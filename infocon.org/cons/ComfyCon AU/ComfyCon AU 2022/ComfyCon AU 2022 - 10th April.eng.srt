00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,880
it is literally set to zero percent

96
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,800

97
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,560

100
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,199
yesterday that includes no sales talks

101
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,000
um so no this is what was shown to

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,160
people when they submitted their talks

103
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,400
um and there are two lines there talks

104
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,840
will not include vendor related pitches

105
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
or products or pr marketing campaigns

106
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,520
and the employer logo can only appear on

107
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,680
two slides introduction biography

108
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,280
um we take it really seriously that

109
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,800
we're trying to provide a safe space for

110
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,479
cyber security professionals to come to

111
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,759
where they don't feel like they're being

112
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,919
sold things um i know it's really

113
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,880
annoying when you go to other

114
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,560
conferences which i will not name names

115
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,639
that have sponsors or they are sales

116
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,240
talks

117
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,759
um we want to make sure that this is a

118
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,840
safe space and doesn't have those things

119
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,320
so um just a reminder for those speakers

120
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,840
and for everyone that is part of our

121
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,520
ethos

122
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,440
how do you interact um if you're

123
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,800
watching the youtube stream right now

124
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,160
then you're watching the youtube stream

125
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,199
so i don't need to tell you where that

126
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,240
is uh but um if you want to join in the

127
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,560
conversation you'll notice that the

128
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,800
uh youtube chat and youtube comments are

129
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,560
turned off this is so that we get

130
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,080
everyone coming into discord and

131
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,479
engaging through that um

132
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,000
we want to make sure that we have

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,520
everyone in the same conversation and

134
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
also it makes it way easier for us to

135
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,160
moderate as well

136
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,520
code of conduct uh don't be a dick um

137
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,120
the people who decide what being a dick

138
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,199
is is us we are benevolent dictators for

139
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,360
life as is um

140
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,759
the gentleman from python um

141
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,680
any bad behavior that is seen please

142
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,440
report it to the soft cushions and they

143
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,000
will make a judgment call on that

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,080
so um again it's really keen to make it

145
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,280
a safe space for everyone

146
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,440
and i said yesterday the for the first

147
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,800

148
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,440

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,720
from the last ones and i'm not gonna

171
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,840
talk about that but anyway

172
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,280
i could probably do it i just don't have

173
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
you know my video making skills i'm

174
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,080
testing them today uh using video editor

175
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,840
in microsoft and it's pretty

176
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,479
basic

177
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,880
yeah i am not a good video editor i

178
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
couldn't do it so um

179
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,120
we'll we'll find a way to do it but

180
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,360
without further ado we will get started

181
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,280
and i will bring

182
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,880
jess on who

183
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,800
i have to say only

184
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,560
volunteered to do this a week ago and

185
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,919
one of the conditions was she could use

186
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,160
as much profanity as she wanted

187
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,560
um we we were happy to oblige in that

188
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,919
respect i think the term is voluntold

189
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,400
voluntous yeah

190
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,160
yeah i was voluntold i had a couple of

191
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,240
people go you should do this and i went

192
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
sorry what and they went yeah you should

193
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,479
do this i'm like okay

194
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,800
so it sounds like so so noting the fact

195
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,160
that they'd given talks before i think

196
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,680
they should do them again but sarah and

197
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,720
bronwyn it sounds like they're

198
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
volunteering to give a talk again in the

199
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,759
future 100 i get both sarah and bronwyn

200
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,680
they have to give a talk for comfy con

201
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,960
now okay pay it forward pay it forward i

202
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,000
love it

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,080
um jess uh tennes versus nuggies

204
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,879
um i i am the parent of a four-year-old

205
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,400
gremlin so it's whichever is in the

206
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,039
freezer and is quick to cook and

207
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,520
available to stop her you know turning

208
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,160
into a hideous tantrum beast in about 20

209
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,599
minutes so

210
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,479
i i don't care as long as it's available

211
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,880
within about 20 minutes that is entirely

212
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,479
fair i can completely go with that

213
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,000
although a recommendation from nathan

214
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,919
yesterday is that there are

215
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,919
dinosaur-shaped nuggies which if you're

216
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,279
a small gremlin i think that they

217
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,039
appreciate that i know i'm going to have

218
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,760
to get a bag now so i have two bags of

219
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,560
them in my freezer

220
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,640
because she's because her and i both

221
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,560
love a good espresso martini

222
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,160
yeah

223
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
and i would have one with me but i had

224
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,519
my espresso this morning and it's a

225
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,360
little bit too early for me yeah maybe

226
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,440
when my small one goes down for a nap i

227
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,040
still have my wine

228
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,320
we'll have an afternoon

229
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,839
maybe i can do another video making one

230
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,959
of them

231
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,279
that would be good actually

232
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,880
that would be good i'm so just

233
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,800
introducing yes if you don't know her

234
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,040
already jess is based in brisbane so

235
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,480
close to 20 years which doesn't seem

236
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,240
right knowing she's 21 years of

237
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,360
experience in the management and

238
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,800
architecture of identity and security

239
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,480
system platforms

240
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,320
jess wears the title of secops which

241
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,839
proudly and if you've run into girl

242
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,680
germs online you've probably spoken to

243
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,399
jess so um jess is going to be talking

244
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,839
this is the talk she's given before but

245
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,680
because we've said that she could uh use

246
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,000
profanity again it should be interesting

247
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,600
so um the floor is all yours jess

248
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,640
thank you very very much so yes um

249
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,600
i am jess uh girl germs pretty much

250
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,680
anywhere online so you will have bumped

251
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,480
into me likely at some point um

252
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,959
i am an ex sysadmin so i do come from

253
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,959
operations so i have a lot of that

254
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,959
background which is kind of nice but now

255
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,200
i am a security customer engineer um

256
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,440
focusing on both security and identity

257
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
so i've got a lot of

258
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,519
love for the identity space i promise i

259
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,160
won't use the term zero trust um now

260
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,959
this talk is the back to basics so this

261
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:15,760
is

262
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,839
uh why can't we get this right i

263
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,480
think shana has renamed it to why we

264
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,160
can't get this right which

265
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,640
is about accurate that is

266
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
what i tend to be saying quite a lot

267
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,440
when i am seeing a lot of these things

268
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,000
when i am out in the field and i am

269
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,240
pretty cranky if you couldn't tell by

270
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,680
the beautiful slide that you are seeing

271
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,519
in front of you with my cranky face that

272
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,000
i keep seeing these things when i am out

273
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
in the field um

274
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,160
i know for a lot of you i'm going to be

275
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,399
teaching you to suck eggs and i i hate

276
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,720
doing that but at the same time if

277
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,959
if we all knew how to do these if we all

278
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,880
knew that these needed to be done we

279
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
would be seeing them done a lot more and

280
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,000
i wouldn't be head desking and swearing

281
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,399
profusely um every time i have to go and

282
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,399
see a customer i am not going to use the

283
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,480
phrase common sense because i saw

284
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,320
laura's talk yesterday and i don't want

285
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,760
to piss her off

286
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,920
so i won't use the phrase common sense

287
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,920
um but i do think a lot of this is

288
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,360
relatively basic low

289
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,760
security level stuff that we should be

290
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,560
doing it's boring it is batshit boring

291
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,399
like there is nothing more monotonous

292
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,399
than most of this stuff which is why i

293
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,560
give this talk but in a more humorous

294
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,360
way so if you see dodgy practices in

295
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,440
this talk that you are guilty of do not

296
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,240
worry you are definitely not alone and

297
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,160
to be honest

298
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,839
you don't know what you don't know so

299
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,040
there is a good chance that you might

300
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,320
see something in here that you're like

301
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,560
oh i'm not doing that

302
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,720
if you're not doing it that's not a bad

303
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,079
thing it just means it's something you

304
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,440
have to improve upon and that's fine so

305
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,200
the way this talk is done is i've broken

306
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,440
it down via the mist framework now if

307
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,959
you're not aware of what that framework

308
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,480
is this is a really good educational

309
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,880
exercise go and take a look so the

310
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,800
easiest way that i've done it was to do

311
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,120
it this way mainly because it gives some

312
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
really nice chunks that i can then work

313
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,320
to so

314
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,040
most of my focus as a blue teamer which

315
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,560
i guess i am because i spend most of my

316
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,519
time protecting stuff is on the identify

317
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,360
and protect phases within the nist

318
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,279
framework a little bit of love for

319
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,120
detect and then a couple of tidbits for

320
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,440
respond and recover now don't stress

321
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,120
about writing any of this down taking

322
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
screenshots any of that there is a

323
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,800
lovely link at the end which includes a

324
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
checklist that you can then use and tick

325
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,440
most of this already off so

326
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,920
onwards

327
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,200
i identify that we are really at

328
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,160
identifying stuff

329
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,279
okay number one do you know what you

330
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,240
have

331
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,639
so is your asset system up to date does

332
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,040
it contain all of the information in

333
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
regards to the systems you have the

334
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,440
operating systems you're using the patch

335
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,279
levels those operating systems are at

336
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,360
what appliances what applications you

337
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,920
have installed i guarantee you that if

338
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,240
you do have some form of asset system

339
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,920
cmdb etc that it is not up to date so

340
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,720
you need to audit and you need to check

341
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,279
for those things and get them updated

342
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,079
without that it makes life so much

343
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,360
harder when you are trying to a secure

344
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,200
things because you can't secure it if

345
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
you don't know about it how do you

346
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,800
protect something if you don't know that

347
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,920
it exists

348
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,760
and b if you're trying to recover how do

349
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,839
you recover it when you don't know what

350
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,200
state it was at to begin with

351
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,279
single points of failure are bad and in

352
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,880
tech we all know that they are

353
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,760
incredibly bad um but it is way worse

354
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
when it comes to people and i guarantee

355
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,920
you we have all worked somewhere where

356
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,800
we

357
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,959
know someone or we may have even been

358
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,440
that someone where

359
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,760
you know or they are the person who

360
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,800
knows

361
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,639
everything like they have all of that

362
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,959
organizational knowledge in their head

363
00:13:58,959 --> 00:13:59,760
and it's

364
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,120
 awful because you have to go and

365
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,880
talk to them

366
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,839
to get that information now that's not

367
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,839
to say that they are bad people it's

368
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,839
just that there is they've probably been

369
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,079
there for a long period of time they

370
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,399
know the organization really well they

371
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,560
don't just know the what but they know

372
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,959
the how and the why which is really

373
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,720
really important so you need to make

374
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,839
sure you are giving those people time to

375
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,920
put that stuff down so in my last

376
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,560
workplace um prior to my current role uh

377
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,320
his name was ken and if he's watching i

378
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,680
can um he knows and still does know

379
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,880
pretty much everything about that

380
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,040
organization and he has never given time

381
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,600
to get that out onto paper so that

382
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
he can hand off that stuff to other

383
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,360
people which makes it really really hard

384
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,519
for people to be able to go on holiday

385
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,959
or get sick or or leave the organization

386
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,959
there is that feeling that they are tied

387
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,880
to that organization so

388
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,639
we need to make sure that we are sharing

389
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,000
knowledge that we are sharing that

390
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,720
information you do not need toward it as

391
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,680
laura said yesterday the aim of our job

392
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,480
really should be to automate ourselves

393
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,440
out of our current roles

394
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,160
now the flip side

395
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,120
is

396
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,240
if no one is responsible for stuff and

397
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,160
no one knows everything no one knows

398
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,360
anything then everyone is assumed to

399
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,320
know it

400
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,000
and when goes bad it means that

401
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,399
everyone's in the firing line so

402
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,079
we need our business owners and our

403
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,120
system owners to own their risk and to

404
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,639
understand

405
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,000
that risk i think that's probably the

406
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
biggest point if they don't understand

407
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,279
what that risk is if they're just going

408
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,480
yeah sure i accept that 100 what'll end

409
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,800
up happening is when goes bad and

410
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,480
it will go bad at some point they will

411
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,160
come to you and go no no i didn't agree

412
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,560
to that i didn't understand why i just

413
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,759
said yes

414
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,360
you don't want it to get to that point

415
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,320
you want to make sure that they

416
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,399
understand what they are saying yes to

417
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,839
and that they understand the risks

418
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,759
associated with the systems um that they

419
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,560
are the owners for because they need to

420
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,758
be owned by someone

421
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,199
um this is probably one of my biggest

422
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,959
bug bears uh

423
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,839
just because it was right doesn't mean

424
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,920
it still is

425
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,759
right um

426
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,279
the if it's not broken mentality um

427
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,360
needs to change so just because

428
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,240
something isn't broken doesn't mean

429
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,040
it can't be fixed or improved or

430
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,240
enhanced in some way so an example one

431
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,920
close to my own heart windows server

432
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,040
2003 great for its time not great now

433
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,639
like if you're still running that there

434
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,160
are problems um so it needs to be fixed

435
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,000
so you need to make sure that you are

436
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,240
looking for efficiencies ways to

437
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,880
innovate i know it's a crappy buzzword

438
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,759
but

439
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,240
you need to find ways to improve what

440
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,839
you currently have improve your

441
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,720
processes improve your systems um

442
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,399
big thing that i found with this is to

443
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,440
listen to new stuff so if you have new

444
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,519
people who are coming into your org you

445
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,480
have new folks who are um

446
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,720
bringing in their new insight and way of

447
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,640
seeing things listen to them when they

448
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,919
say that there are things that can be

449
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,079
improved don't just dismiss it because

450
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,480
they're new

451
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,880
um

452
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,359
please just write the thing down for the

453
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,760
love of god um i know it's

454
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,319
tedious i know it's boring i know it's

455
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,039
time consuming but documentation is so

456
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,760
important because if it is in your head

457
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,039
no one else can read it so

458
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,840
document absolutely everything if you've

459
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,000
had to do something document if you've

460
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,320
had to change something document if you

461
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,200
have to write code document it in a way

462
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,679
that someone else can read it and no

463
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,760
i don't know how this works isn't a

464
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,120
valid comment

465
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,760
um in security breaches particularly at

466
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,000
like 3 a.m in the morning this kind of

467
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,760
documentation is really vital because we

468
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,840
need to understand what the system

469
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,720
current state is and documentation plays

470
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,000
a part in that

471
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,400
if hits the fan you're going to

472
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,840
need that documentation on hand

473
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,280
and this is probably something that i

474
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,480
think we're

475
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,520
really bad at doing um

476
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,080
we don't educate our users well enough

477
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,320
we tend to judge them quite harshly and

478
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,760
they are still

479
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,600
our weakest link most the time when we

480
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,480
are looking at breaches um that are

481
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
occurring these days we're seeing things

482
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,720
like ransomware attacks or insider

483
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,400
threat it's coming from within the

484
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,200
building um so we need to make sure that

485
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,160
we are

486
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,799
educating our users in a more meaningful

487
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,919
way we're making them understand

488
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:44,960
why

489
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,120
cyber security and information security

490
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,960
is so important but we need to do it in

491
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,799
a way that doesn't patronize them and i

492
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,360
think that's the key

493
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,000
we complain quite a lot about our end

494
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
users but we wouldn't have as much to

495
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,559
complain about if we actually educated

496
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,120
our users and educated them well

497
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,840
so from my perspective there is no such

498
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,160
thing as a stupid question

499
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,039
so let them ask those questions without

500
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,000
the fear of being mocked or denigrated

501
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,520
or patronized um spend time with them to

502
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,280
understand what it is that they are

503
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,120
doing within the organization within

504
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,000
your business so that you can understand

505
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,480
where security applies in what they're

506
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,160
doing

507
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,480
we're not expected to be experts in what

508
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,520
they do

509
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,600
so why should we expect them to be

510
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,679
experts in what we do

511
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,200
we need to make sure that what we are

512
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,440
doing from a security perspective

513
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,200
is

514
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,919
tailored to the users that we have is

515
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,080
tailored to the business that we're

516
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,799
involved in and is done in such a way

517
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,000
that it's not creating more overhead for

518
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,600
those users remember at the end of the

519
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,160
day most of the time tech is a cost

520
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,039
center we're not making money we cost

521
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,520
them money the people our users our

522
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,280
customers they are the ones that are

523
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,200
making the money for this business they

524
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,720
are important and need to be

525
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,280
there a lot of the time we're seen as

526
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,720
somewhat superfluous which is not

527
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
fantastic so we need to make sure that

528
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,280
what we are doing isn't impacting them

529
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,880
in a way that's going to make people

530
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,400
turn on us

531
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,039
so getting your users to understand the

532
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,320
why

533
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,960
um just as much as the how so it's great

534
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,559
to be able to turn around and say you

535
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,320
need to be doing this

536
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,840
why what is it that we are trying to do

537
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,080
with that particular piece of security

538
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,320
um probably the big example that i have

539
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,520
that i have used in many cases is users

540
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,120
who give out their username and password

541
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,559
now for us there's a

542
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,080
multitude of reasons why we don't want

543
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
users to be doing that but the one that

544
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,159
seems to get most of the users kind of

545
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,159
perking theirs up and going oh

546
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,159
maybe i shouldn't be doing that if you

547
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,760
give your username and password within

548
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,880
an organization to somebody else someone

549
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,960
else then has the ability to go in and

550
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,840
modify where your pay is going they can

551
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,159
change your bank details so your pay is

552
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,679
no longer going to your bank but to

553
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,919
their bank so that tends to get people

554
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,200
to be sort of sitting up and paying

555
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,799
attention so it's little things like

556
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,280
that making it be more about the user

557
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,640
how we are doing it to protect them

558
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
which leads quite nicely into protecting

559
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,039
so now that we've identified stuff we

560
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,240
have to go off and protect it

561
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
please don't focus on shiny things shiny

562
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,600
is lovely shiny is nice i personally

563
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,240
love the shiny and it's great but when

564
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,000
it comes to protecting our our

565
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
infrastructure our systems our business

566
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,559
um there is no point in doing it if we

567
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,240
are not protecting everything so you

568
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
need to make sure that you are even

569
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,520
protecting

570
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
the old and busted which has probably

571
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,880
been around for 10 15 20 years

572
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,240
and make sure that we are looking after

573
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,000
it now as an example for me um in my

574
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,840
organization everyone wants to look at

575
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,760
protecting their identity systems up in

576
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,159
the cloud wherever it may be but none of

577
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,320
them look at their on-prem identity

578
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,080
systems and look at protecting that even

579
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,840
though in most cases the two are

580
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,919
synchronized so you're grabbing users

581
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,280
from whatever you're using on-prem and

582
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,600
synchronizing them up into the cloud if

583
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,919
you're not protecting what is on-prem

584
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,919
even though it's 15-20 years old old

585
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,039
busted has been sort of ad hoc grown

586
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,919
over the last god knows how many years

587
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,840
if you don't protect that all you are

588
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,440
doing is creating more weakness because

589
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,799
all of that is being synchronized up

590
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,799
into the cloud so making sure that you

591
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,159
are protecting those systems that are

592
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,080
critical and pivotal so looking at those

593
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,159
ones that are on prem because they are

594
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,520
the ones that are going to become your

595
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,679
weakest link um

596
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,520
you've got to protect

597
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,840
everything that is in relation to your

598
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,120
identities at the moment because

599
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,000
identities are where most of our attacks

600
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,559
are coming from

601
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,480
now i know i'm going to get a little bit

602
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,919
of pushback from this one and i

603
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,240
apologize to those who are like no no no

604
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,520
we shouldn't have to do that one but

605
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,480
please

606
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,280
love god eat your own dog food

607
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,840
if you are asking your users to do it

608
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,799
you have to be doing it we cannot tell

609
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,720
our users to do something and then we go

610
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,799
and do something else it is hypocritical

611
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,840
it's awful so an example of this if you

612
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,559
are

613
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,240
expecting your users to have their

614
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,840
administrative privileges removed from

615
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,400
their local workstations you cannot be a

616
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,240
local administrator using your standard

617
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,559
account either you cannot do that it's

618
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,640
not fair on your users and to be

619
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,760
perfectly honest it's not fair on your

620
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,159
security scope either you need to ensure

621
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,240
that whatever your users are doing you

622
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,559
are doing and to be perfectly honest you

623
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,159
should be the guinea pigs

624
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,000
the best way that i've seen most

625
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,559
security policies be put in place is if

626
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,640
the techs be it the security team the it

627
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,760
operations team service desk etc if they

628
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,400
are the ones that are being the pilot

629
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,840
group for a lot of the new security

630
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,520
policies that are being put in place

631
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,600
because if we can operate with this

632
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,000
security in place our end users surely

633
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,720
should be able to

634
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,480
probably the other one that i think this

635
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,240
applies to as well is any of our

636
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,000
management particularly upper management

637
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,200
i'm thinking like c-level directors etc

638
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,000
um

639
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,559
please don't put policies in place that

640
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,880
restrict

641
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,720
i wouldn't say restrict that change the

642
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
way that they operate to be different or

643
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,240
vip towards other users um

644
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,960
the worst that i've seen is um

645
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,760
a

646
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,880
a c level i would say who had um

647
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,200
password never expires set and it had

648
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,279
been that way for four different people

649
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,760
who had been a job no one had ever asked

650
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,200
them if that's what they wanted it was

651
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,880
just assumed

652
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,200
please don't do that it

653
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,600
just makes everyone's life harder

654
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,360
um and tied to that your passwords so i

655
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
see it all the time passwords

656
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,600
really crappy passwords passwords

657
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,520
that are the same pretty much everywhere

658
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,960
and i don't understand why it's still

659
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,400
happening like this is

660
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,679
pretty basic um i felt like it shouldn't

661
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,480
have

662
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,159
needed to be said

663
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,039
uh but we still see it

664
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,960
today in threats that are out there i

665
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,480
think there was one just recently where

666
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,520
there was

667
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,080
an excel spreadsheet that contained all

668
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,039
of the domain admin password like just

669
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,880
 no

670
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,120
um

671
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,520
this comes down to making sure that when

672
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,960
you are looking at your passwords that

673
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,320
you are setting them correctly i mean

674
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,080
most of us should know that we have the

675
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,039
ability to use password managers etc we

676
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,360
can generate passwords which is where we

677
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,279
go into this sharing is not always

678
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,480
caring

679
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,240
when we are talking about our passwords

680
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,520
making sure that you are putting them

681
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,039
somewhere that other people can access

682
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,720
when you are creating passwords that

683
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,480
they're not being stored in an excel

684
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,000
spreadsheet that they're not being

685
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,480
written on post-it notes um and i see

686
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,039
that far more frequently than i should

687
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,000
where

688
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,640
post-it notes are used as a password

689
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,080
manager and

690
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,960
it's

691
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,039
so frequent out in the world i don't

692
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,720
understand how

693
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,559
organizations are still running in this

694
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,799
way um particularly in customer-facing

695
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,159
roles where customers are going into

696
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,480
organizations and seeing these post-it

697
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,000
notes on monitors like

698
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,440
for sake just

699
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
put it in a password like there's free

700
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,320
ones there's cloud ones there's

701
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,559
um ones that can synchronize there's

702
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,320
ones you can have on your like just do

703
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,000
something just not an excel spreadsheet

704
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,559
love of god

705
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,679
tie to this as well um shared

706
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,200
credentials so things like um generic

707
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,080
accounts that are in high level admin

708
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,640
groups and things like that please just

709
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,440
stop doing it

710
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
especially

711
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,000
service accounts now i'm going to try

712
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,320
really hard not to say a lot of really

713
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,480
bad words here but

714
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,400
get these out of any of your highly

715
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,120
privileged accounts they do not need

716
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,760
enterprise admin global admin root

717
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,679
whatever it is get them the out of

718
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,279
those accounts they don't need those

719
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,279
level of permissions they don't need

720
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,640
root do not pass go do not collect 200

721
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,000
we need to make sure that our service

722
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,440
accounts are given the permissions that

723
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,520
they need to be able to do the role that

724
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,600
they are assigned to do

725
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,720
the other big thing when it comes to

726
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,240
service accounts when did you last

727
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,520
change the password on the service

728
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,440
accounts that exist in your environment

729
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
i guarantee you it was a really long

730
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,480
time ago and there have been people that

731
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,799
have left your organization during that

732
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,640
time and there's probably a good chance

733
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,080
that if you're not using complex

734
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,840
passwords they will remember what those

735
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,240
service account passwords are so please

736
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,480
look at rotating your service account

737
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,640
passwords either making them hideously

738
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,279
complexly long and disgusting so no one

739
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,480
is going to have a chance to remember

740
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,720
them or if you're making them short make

741
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,159
sure that you are rotating them when

742
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,000
people are leaving your organization

743
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,600
because they will remember them

744
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,080
yeah

745
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,520
and when we're talking about making sure

746
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,360
that you're giving the right rights use

747
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,200
role-based access control like it's not

748
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,880
hard um

749
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,120
don't just go for that top level it's

750
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,559
easiest i know that if i give admin

751
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,919
rights over everything it's going to be

752
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,320
fine i can't be bothered looking for it

753
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,960
no your entire msp doesn't need full

754
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,640
admin rights over your cloud environment

755
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,440
that's just not the way it works so work

756
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,240
out what rights are actually needed fine

757
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,360
tune based on what's required hopefully

758
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,279
everyone here or at least those who are

759
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,679
in australia know what the asd

760
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,000
essentially is and understand that least

761
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,919
privilege is a part of that and

762
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,200
particularly when we're starting to talk

763
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,919
about zero trust yes i know buzzword um

764
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,520
but when we're looking at zero trust

765
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,240
least privilege is really important so

766
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
when it comes to looking at what rights

767
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,320
you are assigning you need to be looking

768
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,919
at role-based access control you need to

769
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,840
be looking at where that highest point

770
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,159
is what rights do they need make sure

771
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,760
you are giving them no more no less um

772
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,320
an example for me when i'm coming in to

773
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,559
look at systems in my current role

774
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,200
i just ask for read nothing else i don't

775
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,600
need anything else i don't want anything

776
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,120
else just need read

777
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,360
and when we're talking about limiting

778
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,760
privileges um and this one hits a little

779
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,440
close to home for me

780
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,600
rank doesn't equal access so just

781
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,000
because you are the manager of a group

782
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,760
of people who are

783
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,080
identity administrators or who are

784
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,720
server administrators doesn't mean you

785
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,000
necessarily need to have those rights um

786
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,080
it's not because i don't trust those

787
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,520
managers but it's because in a lot of

788
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,840
cases management who are in those roles

789
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
they are not deeply technical a lot of

790
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,679
managers are

791
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,200
managers that's what they're there to do

792
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,360
they are there to manage people not

793
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,399
infrastructure

794
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,000
um and it's because i know that

795
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,240
accidents happen if you are given

796
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,399
too much rights if you are given

797
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,240
role-based access control that gives you

798
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,720
too many permissions and you don't know

799
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,080
what you are doing

800
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,600
it is more likely that something is

801
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,360
going to go wrong so the way that i

802
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,799
really like to explain this particularly

803
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,480
to managers who are like no no i need

804
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,559
that level of access unless you are the

805
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,559
person who is being woken up at two

806
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,559
o'clock in the morning to fix that

807
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,039
system you do not need that access okay

808
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,279
um the flip side to this as well

809
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,600
managers need to trust their staff

810
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,279
if you don't trust your staff why did

811
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,480
you hire them in the first place

812
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,720
mfa please you need to

813
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,600
have mfa turned on for everything now

814
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,840
this one i think should be a no-brainer

815
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,600
it's out there it's been out there for a

816
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,919
long time mfa should be on

817
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,360
everyone it should be on all of your

818
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,960
users and if it's not on all of your

819
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,200
users that's okay we'll get there but at

820
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,159
least have it on all of your

821
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,919
administrative accounts now the other

822
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,760
thing that i talk about when it comes to

823
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,919
mfa for us particularly as security and

824
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,840
i.t professionals is it shouldn't just

825
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,840
be on our work accounts so we need to

826
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,919
have mfa turned on on everything because

827
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,880
your identity is really important your

828
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,360
identity could be used to compromise

829
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,360
your organization so any of your

830
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,640
personal accounts any of your email your

831
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,039
banking any of your social media if you

832
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,440
can put mfa on it put mfa on it for the

833
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,399
love of god um looking at things like

834
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,039
risk-based access control as well so for

835
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,880
example if you're coming in from

836
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,279
internally you're coming in from a known

837
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,640
ip address

838
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,399
that's inside an organization you might

839
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,240
say sure you may not need that level of

840
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,720
mfa you're coming from

841
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,080
say i don't know latvr at two o'clock in

842
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
the morning trying to log in with

843
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,840
administrative rights maybe you want

844
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,639
some mfa on that

845
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,240
um

846
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
account segregation still isn't being

847
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,200
done

848
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,600
and if you are an administrator of any

849
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,480
system

850
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,440
you need

851
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,919
more than one admin account now i don't

852
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,200
know why i'm still talking about this

853
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,440
because i remember giving this talk back

854
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,000
in like i think it was 2014 or 2015 and

855
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,840
i'm still not seeing it

856
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,679
you cannot have admin rights on your

857
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,600
standard user account you have to have a

858
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
separate admin account for that and to

859
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,679
be perfectly honest depending on the way

860
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,120
that your tiering is done within your

861
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,799
environment should probably have like

862
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,480
two or three accounts if you've got

863
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,440
cloud it should be separate your cloud

864
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,960
administrative account should not be the

865
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,279
same as your on-prem administrative help

866
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,720
never the twain shall meet they should

867
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,799
be completely separate

868
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,760
um

869
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,120
i want to make sure that people

870
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,399
understand that this is not just to

871
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,960
protect your organization but it is to

872
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,679
protect yourself we are humans we are

873
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,799
fallible we can do stupid stuff so

874
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,399
making sure that your standard user

875
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,000
account that has access to your email

876
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,840
and access to the internet and opens

877
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,080
documents doesn't have an administrative

878
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,159
rights protects you

879
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,880
just as much as it does the organization

880
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,840
on top of that using something like pam

881
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,440
um so that you're you're looking after

882
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,799
your privileged access management so

883
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,559
that you've got the ability to elevate

884
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,799
to rights um get the rights that you

885
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,240
need there's a number of products out

886
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,679
there that can do this

887
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,080
and then remove that level of rights so

888
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,840
you don't have it permanently even

889
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,120
better

890
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,799
if there's approval processes in there

891
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,840
it makes it even better

892
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,760
this goes out to all the network admins

893
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,200
server admins and particularly

894
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,000
developers when is firewall no longer a

895
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,080
firewall when you ask me to put

896
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,480
any any rules in place now a lot of the

897
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,600
time i know that they are for testing uh

898
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,360
and that's fine i don't mind testing

899
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,880
things to work out whether it is the

900
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,399
firewall that's causing the problem but

901
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,840
at the same time once we've tested and

902
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
we've worked out that yes the firewall

903
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,519
was the cause we don't just leave the

904
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,440
any any rule in place we try and find

905
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,279
out the ports that we need and we put

906
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,279
them in and then we get rid of the ndne

907
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,200
rule there is no point in having a

908
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,880
client-side firewall when you have an

909
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,399
eddie any rule it's just making it

910
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,360
completely redundant um and having that

911
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,279
client-side firewall is still really

912
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,960
important so

913
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,440
don't use put in proper rules that's all

914
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,840
we need to do

915
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,159
um

916
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,360
edr and av uh it's not nice for our

917
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,919
machines to catch things um for any of

918
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,840
our systems to catch things so any of

919
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,159
our endpoints so i'm talking like our

920
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,480
workstations servers mobile devices um

921
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,320
you don't want to make

922
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
your infrastructure sick i mean it looks

923
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,000
really sad

924
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,560
um i don't want my systems to be sad and

925
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,079
i am still really surprised by the

926
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,440
number of administrators that have no

927
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,960
edr on

928
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,199
their either workstations or their

929
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,599
personal machines or devices because

930
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,520
they'd never install anything bad or

931
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,639
click on anything um

932
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,079
you need to make sure that you have got

933
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,480
edr on pretty much everything uh if you

934
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,839
have particularly if you have admin

935
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,159
rights on it like guarantee you most of

936
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,760
you have administrative rights on your

937
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,560
local home machine um you want to make

938
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,760
sure that you have something in there

939
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,839
that's going to pop up and go hey are

940
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,320
you really sure about that word file

941
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,918
that looks like an executable do you

942
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,399
really want to be running that um so

943
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,640
this kind of comes back to that dog food

944
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,560
um if we're expecting users to do it

945
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,839
then we should be doing it as well

946
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,599
encryption um this one's pretty basic

947
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,119
although i have to say i'm laughing a

948
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,960
little bit about this recently i

949
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,480
connected my home machine into my work

950
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,599
to be able to do it because i've got

951
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,040
three monitors and it's grunty and it

952
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,480
makes life easier and they went you need

953
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,720
to bitlocker that and i went okay

954
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,839
including my 10 my 10 terabyte spinner

955
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:24,800
which

956
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,200
was not fantastic it took a really long

957
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,160
time so yes turn it on if you can turn

958
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,400
encryption on please turn it on um for a

959
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,920
lot of systems it's now a checkbox

960
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,280
particularly when you are creating this

961
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,760
system to begin with just turn it on for

962
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,040
the love of god just turn it on

963
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,359
do you know what applications your users

964
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,160
are using um make sure you know what

965
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,359
your users are using because if you

966
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,440
don't know what your users are using um

967
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,119
how are you going to be able to keep

968
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,839
them updated and keep them maintained um

969
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,640
so making sure you understand what

970
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,480
applications are using look at white

971
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,400
listing it's frustrating it's time

972
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,760
consuming but

973
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,119
it's something that we really do need to

974
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,680
look at again the asd essential 8 we

975
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,440
need to be doing this across all of our

976
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,240
systems

977
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,560
asd essential eight patching

978
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,320
please be patching your systems we have

979
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,040
seen so many zero days come out recently

980
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,680
um and we've seen a lot of

981
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,920
updates come out for critical security

982
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
vulnerabilities in a lot of our systems

983
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,839
making sure we are keeping our systems

984
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,160
as up-to-date as possible particularly

985
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,480
any of our crown jewels so that way we

986
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,160
can make sure that they are as protected

987
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,240
as we can possibly make them as soon as

988
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,839
some of those critical security patches

989
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,920
come out we should be applying them as

990
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,280
soon as feasibly possible

991
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,200
and then probably the big one that i

992
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,240
don't hear a lot of the time is

993
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,640
physical security um not everyone is in

994
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,040
the cloud i know most organizations that

995
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,200
i deal with are still hybrid so there's

996
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,520
still some on-prem systems and not all

997
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,520
of those are in data centers some of

998
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,960
them are

999
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,359
computers underneath someone's desk

1000
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,839
making sure that you are looking after

1001
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,920
all of your systems because particularly

1002
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,119
those servers that are running

1003
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,640
underneath someone's it's very easy for

1004
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,280
them to just walk out the door if a bad

1005
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,440
guy has unrestricted physical access to

1006
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,359
your computer it's not your computer

1007
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,200
anymore so you need to make sure that

1008
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,280
you are physically securing all of your

1009
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,839
systems

1010
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,200
detection really quick

1011
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,160
um

1012
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,680
logs

1013
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,040
if no one looks at the logs did it

1014
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,240
really happen

1015
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,359
um

1016
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,320
you need to make sure that you are

1017
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,440
logging things in as security

1018
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,200
professionals i think we should all be

1019
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,720
well aware of that the big thing for me

1020
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,839
though is we need to make sure that we

1021
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,200
are picking and choosing the logs that

1022
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,800
we want an example that i have had

1023
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,200
recently someone turned on file auditing

1024
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,520
at the very root level of their domain

1025
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,760
and it was file auditing everything they

1026
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,839
were collecting somewhere between two

1027
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,040
and four terabytes of data

1028
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,680
every single day and of that most of it

1029
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,480
was an object was accessed

1030
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,079
great

1031
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,320
that's not really useful so

1032
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,760
making sure that you are picking and

1033
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,839
choosing the logs that you are

1034
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,200
grabbing hold of that they are

1035
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,040
meaningful that they are actionable that

1036
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,680
they are giving you information that you

1037
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,440
will need should something happen

1038
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,480
the other one that i see quite a lot who

1039
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,520
is watching your watches so your theme

1040
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,560
systems

1041
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,359
siam whatever sam i don't care how you

1042
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,520
pronounce it whatever you are

1043
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,119
using to be able to look after all of

1044
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,720
your logs you need to make sure that it

1045
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,160
is being monitored in a way that can't

1046
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,320
be tampered with because

1047
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,920
security

1048
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,320
operations we are not immune to insider

1049
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,720
threats and we have seen that

1050
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,560
quite a bit where it is security

1051
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,480
operations with their open slather

1052
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,400
access to a lot of things that have been

1053
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,720
the cause of some breaches recently so

1054
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
making sure that we are monitoring our

1055
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,960
security systems seeing if logs are

1056
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,040
being tampered with seeing if security

1057
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,800
systems are being accessed outside of

1058
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,800
ours

1059
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,359
tuning your systems as well um

1060
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,720
it's great if you've got a lot of

1061
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,560
security systems it's great if you've

1062
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,040
got a lot of security appliances um and

1063
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,880
you're collecting a lot of data and

1064
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,240
aggregating that somewhere but if you

1065
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,680
are not actually

1066
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,599
tuning those systems

1067
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,880
you're not going to be getting valuable

1068
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,640
information out of them they are not

1069
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,560
just set and forget you do need to pay

1070
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,079
attention to them despite what any

1071
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,400
vendor will ever tell you

1072
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,920
there is no such thing as a set and

1073
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,760
forget security system you will still

1074
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,680
need to go in you will still need to

1075
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,040
look at it you will still need to make

1076
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,320
sure that the information that it is

1077
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,480
giving you is valuable and tuning it so

1078
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,560
that it is looking after your

1079
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,079
organization your business your

1080
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,680
environment

1081
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,440
we also need to be paying attention to

1082
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,800
what alerts we're getting we need to

1083
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,560
make sure that we are getting the right

1084
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,680
amount of signal rather than noise um so

1085
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,119
making sure that our correlation is

1086
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,640
being done properly and that we are

1087
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,760
actually getting signal rather than a

1088
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,440
bunch of white noise that no one's ever

1089
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,560
going to see and it's going to be boy

1090
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,279
who cried wolf

1091
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,040
respond and recover

1092
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,599
back up all your

1093
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,920
um we should be backing up everything

1094
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,920
and the big one and i know everyone's

1095
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,079
probably heard it uh if we're backing

1096
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,920
things up we can restore it right how

1097
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,760
many how many of you are testing backups

1098
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
or have um a team that is testing

1099
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,160
backups in your organization so

1100
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,680
making sure that if you are backing

1101
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,960
things up that you are testing the

1102
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,880
restore because if it was never restored

1103
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,160
and you can't restore it it was never

1104
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,240
backed up in the first place so testing

1105
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,520
your backups is vital um

1106
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,200
crypto is still out there we are still

1107
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,880
seeing a lot of ransomware attacks we

1108
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,960
are still seeing it far more frequently

1109
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
than i would have thought people should

1110
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,040
know not to click on stuff but it's

1111
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,480
still happening so making sure that we

1112
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,240
are backing up our important systems and

1113
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,079
backing up our important data so that

1114
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,119
way we can actually get it back

1115
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,560
disaster recovery

1116
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,240
um

1117
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,680
you need to have an incident response

1118
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,160
plan like any kind of plan is better

1119
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,560
than no plan um and making sure we're

1120
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,960
testing the plan uh running around like

1121
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,160
our pants are on fire is just not gonna

1122
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,839
cut it so you need to make sure that

1123
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,920
when something happens you know what to

1124
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,000
do you know who to contact and the other

1125
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,599
thing as well make sure that we are

1126
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,480
actually updating that plan it's no use

1127
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,240
having a plan an incident response plan

1128
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,680
that has contact numbers from people who

1129
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,240
left the organization five years ago

1130
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,760
i know because i've received an sms in

1131
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
regards to that previously

1132
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,839
kind of pointless so making sure that if

1133
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,520
you do have an incident response plan it

1134
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,200
is tested regularly it is updated

1135
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,400
regularly particularly with staff

1136
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,880
changes um and the other thing is if

1137
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,240
i've got any managers who are watching

1138
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,480
this uh when an incident occurs managers

1139
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,880
back the off okay

1140
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,520
your staff know what they need to do and

1141
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,560
having

1142
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,040
seven people standing around them

1143
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,800
asking what's going on if they're trying

1144
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,160
to answer your questions they're not

1145
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,599
focused on fixing the problem so we have

1146
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,640
itil for a reason as much as

1147
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,280
 sister tears um we have it for a

1148
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,440
reason have an incident manager and

1149
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,040
everything gets fed through them they

1150
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,319
look after it all and that way your

1151
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,560
techs can actually do their bloody jobs

1152
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,400
um

1153
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,640
i don't think we talk about this one

1154
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,720
enough it is okay

1155
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,480
to screw up

1156
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,040
um everyone screws up it is inevitable

1157
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,280
we will all stuff up at some point so my

1158
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,640
biggest piece of advice in regards to

1159
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,880
this is to own your own mistakes

1160
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,359
do not try and hide them do not try and

1161
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,119
cover them up or minimize them you will

1162
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,680
just make things worse so owning up when

1163
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,240
you make a mistake um

1164
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,880
can actually help you in the long run um

1165
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,319
but i think the big one here is making

1166
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,440
sure that management doesn't play a

1167
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,520
blame game you cannot

1168
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,200
blame people

1169
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,920
for things that go wrong um and then get

1170
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,280
pissed off when people aren't opening up

1171
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,200
to their mistakes so no one is going to

1172
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,040
want to admit when they screw up if that

1173
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,640
is the case so making sure that there is

1174
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,040
no blame game that there is um

1175
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,200
honesty and openness when it comes to

1176
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,720
people making mistakes and that it is

1177
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,240
just focused on

1178
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,480
fixing things rather than pointing

1179
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,880
fingers

1180
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,359
and tied to that

1181
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,800
it is okay to ask for help

1182
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,359
you cannot know everything it is

1183
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,280
impossible to fit all knowledge in your

1184
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,400
head so please ask for help if you need

1185
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,880
it you are part of this community um

1186
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,839
you've you're in this discord right now

1187
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,680
um you've got other communities you're

1188
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,960
on twitter you're on reddit ask for help

1189
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,880
you cannot do it all by yourself

1190
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,800
as mentioned this is the url to go and

1191
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,440
grab this list of stuff so you can

1192
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,280
actually tick things off and go oh look

1193
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,359
i'm doing all of this which is awesome

1194
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,400
um

1195
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,599
if there's stuff that you think needs to

1196
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,520
be added let me know i'm more than happy

1197
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,760
i'm i'm open to constructive criticism

1198
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,599
again i can't know everything so if you

1199
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,119
think i've missed something or stuff

1200
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,760
something up let me know

1201
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,480
so

1202
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,640
hopefully now we have secured all of the

1203
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,800
things and you can go off and secure

1204
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,960
your environments a little bit better um

1205
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,359
and look at putting some of those basics

1206
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,040
in place

1207
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,760
um so now you can see look i'm all happy

1208
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,280
now i'm chill i'm happy and content um

1209
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,800
hopefully you're already doing a lot of

1210
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,960
the things that i mentioned in this talk

1211
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,280
fingers crossed um but if you're not

1212
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,440
that's okay that's why i give this talk

1213
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,880
so that you know

1214
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,400
what you have to do in order to just

1215
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,079
sort of elevate your security posture a

1216
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,920
little bit more now as i said if you

1217
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,599
think i missed something and i'm sure i

1218
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,160
have um or if you want to talk to me or

1219
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,760
debate me on any of these points at all

1220
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,440
you can have a chat to me in discord or

1221
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,839
rant at me on twitter um but otherwise i

1222
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,839
just want to say a big thank you to

1223

there's two quotes i want to pull out

1230
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,079
the first one is safe for work the

1231
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,880
second one is not for work um there we

1232
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,319
go i can hear again

1233
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,119
uh

1234
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,520
where my heads have gone to sleep

1235
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,760
i love how blunt jess is we need people

1236
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,839
more people like this so that was one

1237
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,280
quote from someone

1238
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,400
and the second one

1239
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,960
which i will keep scrolling up for

1240
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,160
was

1241
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,240
i think my new kink is being told off by

1242
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,560
jess

1243
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,040
oh so you're telling me i should be

1244
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,280
charging for this apparently

1245
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,960
yes apparently you should be charging

1246
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,160
money for this

1247
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,839
um

1248
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,599
because there was a lot of a lot of

1249
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,920
likes to that comment um and there are

1250
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,000
some questions as well unfortunately we

1251
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,520
don't have time to go to the questions

1252
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,359
but um i'll go in i'll jump in discord

1253
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,440
and i'll answer them myself no worries

1254
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,040
but that was a fantastic talk and a lot

1255
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,280
of people were agreeing and also

1256
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,040
it was quite refreshing i think to have

1257
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,400
someone like oh

1258
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,920

1262
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,359
one day i think it's the same thing just

1263
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,800
said yesterday we need to make ourselves

1264
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,280
redundant but until we get to that point

1265
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,040
we got a lot of work to do

1266
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,640
that's the one

1267
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,800
i'm keen on being redundant come on

1268

bring it on more comfy cons i'd like to

1269
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,880
be redundant and retire yeah that's it

1270

because i work in federal government but

1288

1290

1307
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,000
presenting in conficon this year so i

1308
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,200
would like to share with you um about uh

1309
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,559
starting off with um your if you're

1310
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,240
starting off with your iso certification

1311
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,559
journey or if you're new to iso so i'll

1312
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,559
just share with you a few tips

1313
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,520
uh since i started with the journey so

1314
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,680
we all know how the certification

1315
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,119
process um can be tedious can be nerve

1316
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,760
wracking can be stretching for security

1317
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,880
people and at the same time how much

1318
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,680
it's important for organizations to get

1319
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,440
this right because it's part of their

1320
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,440
strategic plan so since it involves um

1321
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,640
heavy investments and resources in terms

1322
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,920
of time people and money it's really

1323
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,839
very important to get the things right

1324
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,760
and i've climbed this mountain before in

1325
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,319
the near past and successfully

1326
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,200
implemented iso 27001 in the company i

1327
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,440
work for and as well as helping other

1328
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,160
companies um uh actually in singapore

1329
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,079
being certified so i'll share with you

1330
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,359
today about my journey from fear

1331
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,240
resilience to success uh what i've

1332
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,040
learned from the implementation phase

1333
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,240
till the audi phase some of the pitfalls

1334
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,480
and how to navigate through them

1335
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,839
irrespective of wherever you are within

1336
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,800
your certification journey but before we

1337
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,319
deep dive into that topic actually i

1338
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,920
wanted to share a little bit about my

1339
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,280
story which started nearly two decades

1340
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,240
ago in in banking and finance which as

1341
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,359
we all know is a very

1342
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:16,640
a highly regulated environment heavy

1343
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,359
process oriented environment and i moved

1344
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,839
from that type of an organization to a

1345
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,319
million dollar funded startup

1346
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:25,200
and

1347
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,000
i've always been a follower to all the

1348
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,640
process and procedures myself and

1349
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,119
suddenly i found myself on the other

1350
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,640
side now where instead of me working

1351
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,760
through um abiding to the

1352
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,400
process procedures and controls i had to

1353
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,640
literally do research build them from

1354
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,760
scratch

1355
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,640
implement them at the same time train

1356
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,520
people and show compliance and

1357
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,119
continuous monitoring at the same time

1358
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,640
doing all of that

1359
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,839
the real challenge for me was also

1360
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,040
despite being new in isil i had to lead

1361
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,119
through the control implementation the

1362
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,680
assessment the evaluation the the audit

1363
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,599
process which finally led the

1364
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,559
organization to be um to be iso

1365
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,680
certified so there are so many um there

1366
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,160
are so many uh standards and and

1367
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,720
frameworks out there and iso

1368
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,119
27001 happens to be one of them so it is

1369
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,280
basically an international standard

1370
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,000
comprising of 14 domains and 114

1371
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,559
controls to be implemented through an

1372
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,920
organization's isms which is abbreviated

1373
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,880
as information security management

1374
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,079
system across the organization to ensure

1375
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,760
both basically three key things and we

1376
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,240
all know that in cyber which is the cia

1377
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,680
triad confidentiality integrity and

1378
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,880
availability by protecting all the

1379
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,200
critical information assets from any

1380
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,640
malicious attacker so iso

1381
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,319
27001

1382
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,880
is basically a globally acceptable

1383
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,240
standard

1384
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,880
enabling organization so far to navigate

1385
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,960
through their isms by using a

1386
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,480
combination

1387
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,079
of policies uh process procedures to

1388
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,480
altogether mitigate the information

1389
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,440
security risks even with the new changes

1390
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,720
that are coming within iso 27001

1391
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,880
during the year 2022

1392
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,280
if we look at it we see that the bulk of

1393
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,680
the standard still remains the same the

1394
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,520
closest 4 to 10

1395
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,160
no changes at all the only things that

1396
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,880
we can see have changed significantly

1397
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,920
changed is actually the annex a controls

1398
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,079
which have been reduced from 114 to 93

1399
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,680
and now they are kind of grouped into

1400
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,000
themes as part of the continuous

1401
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,040
improvement

1402
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,319
and my experience with

1403
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,319
iso is that

1404
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,359
it is

1405
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,160
basically a framework that can adapt to

1406
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,880
your organization based on a

1407
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,599
documentation that we call the statement

1408
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,119
of applicability abbreviated as so uh

1409
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,800
unlike a framework like pci dss that

1410
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,559
some of you may be familiar with which

1411
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,839
is either you are compliant or not

1412
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:20,960
compliant and with iso it's more about

1413
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,839
documenting the reasons for your choices

1414
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,640
about specific control application to

1415
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,960
your company so iso itself iso 27001

1416
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,480
itself is a very

1417
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,280
very broad topic but i'll focus on just

1418
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,960
a few key areas which are about uh the

1419
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,839
closes uh and the controls uh when it

1420
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,559
comes to iso 27001

1421
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,720
or the audit process as you navigate

1422
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,680
through it from the start till the end

1423
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,839
and uh some of the change management

1424
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,200
process that is involved and

1425
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,280
incorporated within your iso

1426
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,359
implementation and some of the key

1427
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,160
skills that might be necessary as you

1428
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,359
move on with the implementation phase so

1429
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,280
some of the benefits of iso before we

1430
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,599
deep dive into that so the

1431
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,920
core topic uh we want to understand the

1432
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,079
importance of iso and

1433
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,720
what it means to be iso certified so the

1434
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,839
whole iso 27001

1435
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,319
uh implementation certification can be

1436
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:22,319
expensive so

1437
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,400
very important to do things the right

1438
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,280
way and all organizations which are iso

1439
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,800
certified um iso 27001 certified with

1440
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,720
the benefits that i've kind of

1441
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,800
segregated into two categories here so

1442
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,160
the first one is risk uh mitigation

1443
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,359
and overall uh organizational benefits

1444
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,720
so

1445
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,760
businesses reap the benefits of minimize

1446
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,319
i.t risks minimize damages and

1447
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,680
consequences uh to their business reduce

1448
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,240
chances of security breaches within

1449
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,119
their environment and at the same time

1450
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,200
improve the vulnerability detection

1451
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,280
mechanisms to timely detect any

1452
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,680
vulnerability within their system and

1453
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,240
take some corrective actions accordingly

1454
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,000
and at the end of the day this all

1455
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,880
everything funnels down to ensuring

1456
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,280
confidentiality of information

1457
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,160
and

1458
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,960
from an organization perspective if we

1459
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,760
look at it it just goes about building

1460
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,359
the trust for the

1461
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:22,880
for the partners

1462
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,800
for the customers for the public and uh

1463
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,920
it really provides a very structured and

1464
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,599
methodical way

1465
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,599
to address all those compliance

1466
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,960
requirements and provides the company

1467
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,799
once you're certified provides the

1468
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,440
company with uh a competitive edge due

1469
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,599
to the recognized uh

1470
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,000
requirement and and the standard and at

1471
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
the end of the day of course helps to

1472
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,839
help slower costs because we all know

1473
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,720
what it costs an organization

1474
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,920
in the event of a of a data breach so

1475
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,559
every organization have their own

1476
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,960
reasons to adopt uh

1477
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,160
iso 27001 framework or any other

1478
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,280
framework

1479
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,160
but the essence of it is to actually

1480
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,880
build resilience ensure business

1481
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,480
continuity minimize any operational

1482
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,040
business or cyber risk and as a company

1483
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,720
we embarked to achieve iso certification

1484
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,799
because we wanted to work with big

1485
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,920
corporations and improve our maturity uh

1486
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,839
the maturity actually of our governance

1487
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:31,760
and um our information uh security

1488
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,160
so uh before we deep dive into that um i

1489
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,640
really wanted to when i began actually

1490
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,119
my iso journey

1491
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,160
i was so overwhelmed with a bulk of

1492
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,079
annex a controls

1493
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,799
and it literally took my whole attention

1494
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,799
because if we look at it holistically

1495
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,400
the number of annex control and the

1496
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,960
number of closes the number of controls

1497
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,040
actually far outweighs the number of

1498
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,119
controls that we have and during the

1499
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,640
hustle and of the implementation phase

1500
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,799
i had a quick look at the closes and

1501
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,960
realized that i actually

1502
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,119
might have started with the wrong item i

1503
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,760
should have done the closes first before

1504
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,079
moving on to the controls and this

1505
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,000
triggered my interest for you know to

1506
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,200
dig into this this matter further

1507
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,920
and uh i ended up doing a lead auditor

1508
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,960
course which actually where i learned

1509
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,400
that it is actually the best way the the

1510
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,119
proper way to do the closes first and

1511
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,160
then move on to the to the annex control

1512
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,960
my reasoning behind though was that

1513
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,839
if you are working onto a framework and

1514
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:43,280
you will be audited at the end uh um at

1515
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,599
some point in time

1516
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,480
the auditors would be checking for

1517
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,640
literally the implic applications of the

1518
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,760
annex control so my why reasoning behind

1519
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,839
is if this is what the auditors would be

1520
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:57,680
checking i should focus my time and

1521
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,520
energy into doing that

1522
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,480
and um the irony in the whole story is

1523
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,240
that after i successfully implemented

1524
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,680
iso went through the certification

1525
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,520
process and all of that

1526
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,640
i started to share some of the uh

1527
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,400
some of my learnings and some of the

1528
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,839
things that i really messed up with some

1529
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:15,680
of the security people

1530
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,799
and

1531
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,960
a lot of them actually confessed to me

1532
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,760
that the very first time

1533
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,040
that they

1534
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,119
were working with isil

1535
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,280
they were inclined into doing the exact

1536
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,359
same thing that is working on the annex

1537
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,640
a controls first and then realizing that

1538
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,119
the closers are more um

1539
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,319
important i realized that okay uh rest

1540
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,079
assured that i've not the only one who

1541
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,520
messed up at the the first time uh

1542
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,079
with setting the right priorities uh at

1543
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,200
the beginning

1544
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,960
and it was also a kind of eye opening at

1545
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,119
the same time in the sense how we

1546
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,520
gravitate towards achieving you know the

1547
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,000
complex things the big stuff while

1548
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,839
starting with the basics and the

1549
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,599
foundational

1550
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,119
stuff literally

1551
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,119
makes

1552
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,599
way more way more sense

1553
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,040
so i've been talking a lot about uh

1554
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,839
about closers and and controls so if you

1555
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:16,480
if you don't know them so what are they

1556
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,359
um

1557
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,920
so both of them actually different quite

1558
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,839
distinct

1559
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,599
characteristics a close is a descriptive

1560
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:24,799
paragraph

1561
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:27,440
but there would be input interpretations

1562
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,880
when applied to any organization

1563
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,760
and in security if we talk about

1564
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,280
controls

1565
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,799
most of the time

1566
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,040
we understand what they are security

1567
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,040
people do understand controls we know

1568
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,839
what they are and to me they are more

1569
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,720
like

1570
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,160
you do this

1571
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,119
while a close is more like a state of

1572
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,680
being like a living thing for example

1573
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,240
the culture within an organization the

1574
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,400
support system that is used within the

1575
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,319
organization the support mechanism that

1576
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,799
functions within the organization which

1577
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:04,559
all together drive and promote success

1578
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,520
and the reason why these two are

1579
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,680
actually there is because

1580
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,799
you could predominantly implement

1581
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,440
all the annex a controls

1582
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,240
but

1583
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,839
if you do not have a solid culture

1584
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:23,280
to ensure continuity it just goes to

1585
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,599
question everything that you've worked

1586
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,720
on everything that uh you've implemented

1587
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,559
so far and

1588
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:33,680
on the flip side of it if organizations

1589
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,400
if we look at organizations who are not

1590
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,760
iso certified but with a good

1591
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,319
cyber security culture without even

1592
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:45,200
realizing it they they do meet the

1593
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,400
requirements uh for the closes which are

1594
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,200
basics for getting security right within

1595
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,640
any any type of business

1596
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,680
so

1597
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,000
my experience

1598
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,760
with

1599
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,319
with audit

1600
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:06,079
in the banking sector as an odt i was

1601
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,960
exposed to various types of audits

1602
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,559
internal audits

1603
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,720
external audits regulatory audits and

1604
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,000
all these various types of audits

1605
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,599
can be daunting

1606
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:23,200
can even sound scary which makes the the

1607
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,079
audit phobia a real thing i wonder how

1608
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,079
many of you would be able to relate to

1609
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:29,599
this but

1610
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:33,040
audits have always been very scary to me

1611
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,680
the the reason is the feeling of being

1612
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,119
assessed

1613
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,640
uh to prove to an outside source has

1614
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,480
always made me nervous

1615
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,440
and from my experience the first audit

1616
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,119
is always the hardest

1617
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,319
and i had the apprehension that uh the

1618
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:52,000
audiophobia

1619
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,480
will go away with time after going

1620
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,400
through multiple audits

1621
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,400
but it simply doesn't

1622
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,160
it's something that you just have to

1623
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,319
work through and then cope with it and

1624
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,000
then deal with it

1625
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,640
as and when you're emotionally ready

1626
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,839
so

1627
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,720
iso owed it actually happens in in two

1628
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,319
stages

1629
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,400
the stage one audit

1630
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,960
which is more like an interview

1631
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,160
like a rapid fire round uh going on

1632
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,839
about the organization what it has in

1633
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:26,880
place while a stage to audit is more

1634
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,200
about providing the evidences to show

1635
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,079
compliance to the to the standard so the

1636
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:35,200
strategy that i used in the first place

1637
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,680
when i was preparing for the audit

1638
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,240
instead of stage one

1639
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,480
i was getting ready straight away for

1640
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,920
stage two

1641
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,559
so building on all my evidences not

1642
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,960
losing any time building on all my

1643
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,599
evidences building a repository and then

1644
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,200
classifying them making sure that

1645
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,920
everything that i need is very much well

1646
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,480
documented and it literally gave me a

1647
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,559
lot of confidence in terms of responding

1648
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:03,119
to the iso auditor's questions showing

1649
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,720
them the evidences things that we've

1650
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,640
already put in place

1651
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,440
and

1652
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,200
auditors at the end of the day at the

1653
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,680
end of stage one they give you time to

1654
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,920
work on your major minor

1655
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,680
non-conformities

1656
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,319
but the degree of my readiness with no

1657
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,799
major and minor non-conformities

1658
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:22,079
i was

1659
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,160
ready for stage two

1660
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,880
the very next day of the stage one audit

1661
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,599
so

1662
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,280
this thing really happens if it happened

1663
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,680
to you very lucky and it just goes to

1664
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,440
show how much hard work that you put in

1665
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,400
behind

1666
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,400
but the thing is

1667
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,880
the idea here is to really

1668
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,520
have all the documentation ready the

1669
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,400
evidences ready and be emotionally

1670
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,799
prepared

1671
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,760
to navigate through your uh audit

1672
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,960
process

1673
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:51,920
and

1674
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,559
at the same time if you do it so like

1675
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,960
this you also give a little bit more

1676
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,960
assurance to the auditors when they're

1677
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,119
auditing the organization

1678
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,920
and having gone through the lead audit

1679
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,720
training myself i found that there are

1680
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,200
two key things that

1681
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,400
auditors like as they audit a firm

1682
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,280
the first thing is that clients

1683
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,520
the clients in the organization they're

1684
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,359
auditing the clients know exactly

1685
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:22,480
what

1686
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,200
and why they're doing whatever they're

1687
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,480
putting in place

1688
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,720
and the second category of client is

1689
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,640
that that a client has no idea

1690
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,319
what they are doing and why they are

1691
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,760
doing so and so so both these situations

1692
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,640
make the life of an auditor relatively

1693
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,640
easy because you're compliant compliant

1694
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,799
compliant non-compliant not

1695
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:46,720
non-compliant so makes the report

1696
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,119
reporting really easy the messy part for

1697
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,520
them comes when the client partially

1698
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,559
knows about and understand about iso and

1699
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,160
this is what makes reporting a little

1700
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,319
bit bulkier so you want to be of course

1701
01:03:58,319 --> 01:03:59,920
on the other side where you make the

1702
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,240
auditor's life easy you make your life

1703
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,720
easy which means easier for you and your

1704
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,720
organization to be certified at the end

1705
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,559
of the day

1706
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,880
at the same time one key thing when

1707
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,920
dealing with iso audit is that as much

1708
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,119
as an organization wants to be certified

1709
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,760
the auditors want the organization to be

1710
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,200
the audit to be certified as well it's

1711
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,160
not

1712
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,200
a typical carrot and stick approach

1713
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,319
therefore auditors do accept

1714
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,240
you know documentations that

1715
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,720
commensurate with the organization and

1716
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,799
those documentation

1717
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,799
on do need not be

1718
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:40,400
fully automated

1719
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,280
uh super sleek because they do accept

1720
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,400
auditors do accept manual reports uh and

1721
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,640
items and the only thing at the end of

1722
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,640
the day that they check for

1723
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,240
is compliance

1724
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,520
so a successful iso audit is all about

1725
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,760
being emotionally ready in the first

1726
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,079
place because if you mess this part up

1727
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:01,680
the whole process is going to be messed

1728
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,400
up

1729
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,440
be emotionally ready making sure that

1730
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,880
all the concerned employees involved

1731
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,799
within the audit process

1732
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:13,440
know and understand what is their

1733
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,520
security responsibilities as per the

1734
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,839
other requirements and also that of

1735
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:21,039
their respective department or portfolio

1736
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,839
they are they are looking at so to me

1737
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:26,720
the iso uh journey

1738
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,440
is a journey of resilience throughout

1739
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,000
where you prioritize the control

1740
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,599
implementation

1741
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:35,839
where i had to get organized for the

1742
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:37,440
documentation

1743
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,079
and evidence at the same time

1744
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:44,640
for the for the audit so auditing is not

1745
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,119
an endeavor that should be rushed

1746
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:49,839
but the more prepared you are the more

1747
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:53,200
confident and emotionally emotionally

1748
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,559
ready you are

1749
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,559
the better you'll be able to navigate

1750
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,720
through this um through this tedious

1751
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,799
process

1752
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:03,119
well um

1753
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,799
i've been struggling with iso 27001 it

1754
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:09,039
was really stretching for me

1755
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:11,200
and what i did is at the end of it i did

1756
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,880
a linkedin poll to to understand uh what

1757
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,760
was the experience like for other

1758
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,880
security

1759
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,119
senior security professionals out there

1760
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,200
and i wanted to explore basically based

1761
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,240
on three

1762
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,160
main categories

1763
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,960
which is uh skill pros

1764
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,599
cyber tools and certification and

1765
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,520
compliance all together and here we go

1766
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,559
the results i got a few respondents and

1767
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:37,680
um

1768
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,559
we

1769
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:41,520
so if we talk about cyber uh skill

1770
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,280
shortages we we all know uh

1771
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,240
the skill shortage in cyber in finding

1772
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,880
the right people to implement evaluate

1773
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,880
and improve the information security

1774
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,640
within an organization

1775
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,119
and to me i i used to be in a highly

1776
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:59,280
regulated environment where i'm more to

1777
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,280
being audited so

1778
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,280
where i had to comply with things and

1779
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,760
people who come from um

1780
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,160
from from a very technical background

1781
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,960
may find it a little bit harder but with

1782
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,480
time i think this is also going to

1783
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,480
change because with the divers that

1784
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,839
skill sets that is coming to the

1785
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,559
industry and people transitioning from

1786
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,319
various other industries into cyber

1787
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:22,880
security so we can say that yeah this is

1788
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:23,680
going to

1789
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,640
uh

1790
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,680
change

1791
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,599
after some time

1792
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,720
in terms of cyber security tools or even

1793
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,359
grc tools or risk governance governance

1794
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,760
risk and compliance tools

1795
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,880
so getting the the right tools training

1796
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,559
the employees on how to use them on how

1797
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:46,319
to optimize them on how to leverage them

1798
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:47,520
can

1799
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,240
can require some time and and then some

1800
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,520
investment as well so tools

1801
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,240
are mostly things that security people

1802
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,280
are particularly confident about and

1803
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,119
because most of us tend to be quite

1804
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,039
technical in cyber security so not a

1805
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:04,240
major

1806
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,000
a major big deal

1807
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,839
but when it comes to compliance and

1808
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:11,200
certification well which is the integral

1809
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,720
part of iso

1810
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,559
it's no surprise at all that it's the

1811
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,880
bulkiest part and many many security

1812
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,600
professionals find it um struggling as

1813
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,359
well so certification and compliance is

1814
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:26,158
not a security thing altogether which

1815
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:27,759
makes it more complex

1816
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,799
it's more of a cultural change a

1817
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,839
behavioral change an organizational

1818
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:37,439
change where you go about talking to

1819
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,719
people across the organization

1820
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:44,158
and make them comply and do things

1821
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:46,479
differently to support any of your

1822
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,319
security initiatives that you have in

1823
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,520
place so this has been my experience as

1824
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,719
well and

1825
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:55,198
there is no best fit approach because

1826
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:58,640
each and every organization um

1827
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,560
is is different

1828
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,920
so change management um well one of the

1829
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,520
most

1830
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,238
high level things in iso

1831
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:10,880
is navigating through change change

1832
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,600
management when i was working on change

1833
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,560
management multiple times i came across

1834
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,520
processes that needed to be improved so

1835
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,279
if you're a bigger organization using uh

1836
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,520
legacy systems and applications and all

1837
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,759
of that and heavy process driven and

1838
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:30,158
oriented so it's even a bigger challenge

1839
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:31,920
to drive and instill continuous

1840
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,279
improvement and change management so in

1841
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,399
in various uh businesses

1842
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:39,359
people

1843
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:42,640
tend to see change as difficult nobody

1844
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:43,920
likes change

1845
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,719
so as a security person

1846
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,759
what we must do is build a business case

1847
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:53,120
get management buying and then roll it

1848
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,000
out

1849
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,880
and all the communications

1850
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,239
that happen

1851
01:09:58,239 --> 01:09:59,600
should come

1852
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,840
literally from the management and not

1853
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,600
from the security team

1854
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,840
and this is when you actually get to

1855
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,800
understand the need basis the need for

1856
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,280
for iso 27001 is because some

1857
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,640
organizations are stuck

1858
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,560
between the need to have iso 27001 and

1859
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,840
the good to have iso 27001

1860
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,480
and change management in the whole story

1861
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,880
makes a huge difference when you're

1862
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,560
coping with change actually so to really

1863
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,960
uh to really think about uh just to

1864
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,640
really think about that objectively and

1865
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:41,040
if we holistically uh look at iso

1866
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,360
it is all about business change

1867
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,199
and framing

1868
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:48,159
reframing and organizational culture

1869
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,640
a change in governance changing approach

1870
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,120
to information security whereby you

1871
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,440
improve your cyber security posture so

1872
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,360
taking people on a security journey

1873
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,719
where they can make themselves their

1874
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:00,960
family their data their community at the

1875
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,560
end of the day their organization will

1876
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,719
cyber safe by using

1877
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,080
specific

1878
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,840
cyber security you know good cyber

1879
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,320
security hygiene

1880
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,360
in place

1881
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,400
i've put in their um intangibles so

1882
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:18,320
intangibles do matter a lot in change

1883
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,199
management but what they are well um to

1884
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,600
share a little bit about my story when i

1885
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,840
was working uh we were trying to scale

1886
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,320
up the company at some point in time and

1887
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,120
this was when uh kovid hit and it

1888
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,600
literally hindered our whole

1889
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,239
growth strategies that we had in place

1890
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:40,000
and i was working on iso some of the iso

1891
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,840
controls which is third-party risk

1892
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,000
management vendor assessments at that

1893
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,360
point in time

1894
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,640
and we took that opportunity actually

1895
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,840
to manage at the same time build and

1896
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,640
strengthen some of the relationships and

1897
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,480
partnership that we had

1898
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,960
across few different countries africa

1899
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,360
india taiwan and vietnam so far

1900
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,480
and

1901
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,280
we have been able to build some

1902
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,679
strengthen those relationship agreed on

1903
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,000
to partnering on some of some various

1904
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,760
international projects

1905
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,159
so the idea here is

1906
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:16,760
not to make iso

1907
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,920
27001 a transactional thing

1908
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,040
if you do it in a transactional way you

1909
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,159
will simply end up being certified

1910
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:28,480
but rather when you are implementing

1911
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,480
your change working through your control

1912
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,000
and your closes

1913
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,719
try and explore partnership

1914
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:37,520
collaborative initiatives as well which

1915
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,239
can be beneficial to your organization

1916
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:42,960
going forward

1917
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,360
in terms of when i was working on iso

1918
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,800
again i came across people who knew iso

1919
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,679
theoretically but somewhat struggled

1920
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,840
with the implementation

1921
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,440
the each organization is different

1922
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:01,199
and it is important to understand in

1923
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:04,320
this case the organizational context so

1924
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,600
many organizations do not need someone

1925
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,920
to be working full-time in information

1926
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,159
security unless you are a complex

1927
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,719
organization your organization requires

1928
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:17,440
it for example a bank so

1929
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,000
to implement iso you can also use

1930
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,080
consultants who can unders who

1931
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,440
understand uh the organization and when

1932
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,000
you actually um and these consultants

1933
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,080
what they're gonna do they're gonna uh

1934
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,600
go for your whatever you have within the

1935
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,840
organization build a security strategy

1936
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,360
and a roadmap

1937
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,159
after um uh working with your security

1938
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:40,880
team so looking out for consultants

1939
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,120
that have done that and done it multiple

1940
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,440
times makes way more sense at the same

1941
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,800
time

1942
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,400
if you're planning on going and using

1943
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,719
consultants it is a good

1944
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,719
at they are quite good actually

1945
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:55,840
preparing your internal stakeholders for

1946
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,520
example your it team your hr team your

1947
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,040
marketing team if they're within your

1948
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:04,640
scope so preparing those people to for

1949
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,360
the iso for the iso audit

1950
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,920
and at the same time the more people

1951
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,000
within the organization that involved in

1952
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,520
the audit just gives more assurance to

1953
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,760
uh to the to the auditors that many

1954
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,600
people within the organization actually

1955
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,360
know what they are doing they know their

1956
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,280
their their contribution to your uh

1957
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,000
information security and and all that so

1958
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,080
uh consultants usually what they tend to

1959
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,199
have is

1960
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,239
they tend to have quite good

1961
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,800
relationships with auditors and they

1962
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,199
might have you know work together

1963
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,120
maybe multiple times they understand

1964
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,880
each other they know what the

1965
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,159
documentation are like and at the same

1966
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:43,679
time

1967
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,679
it could be potentially cost effective

1968
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,679
as well for an organization to be using

1969
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,440
consultants depending of course on your

1970
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,480
business

1971
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,560
requirements

1972
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,560
and you can gather consultants at

1973
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,640
different stages whether it's auditing

1974
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,120
recertification implementation

1975
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,520
but one very important key thing

1976
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,719
to to really remember here is that if

1977
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:09,520
you hire a consultant make sure that the

1978
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,600
knowledge at the end of the day doesn't

1979
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,360
leave the business

1980
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,080
it's very important and again there is

1981
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,960
no perfect solution to what works best

1982
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,480
for your business

1983
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,280
but

1984
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,600
um

1985
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,440
do do things that are what works best

1986
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,280
for your environment what works best for

1987
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,080
your business

1988
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,000
so to

1989
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
sum it up

1990
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,159
if you're new to iso

1991
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:38,719
start with the closes and then move on

1992
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,800
to the annex controls

1993
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,480
do not let the audiophobia get to you

1994
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,159
and be ready

1995
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:49,440
prepared to smash your iso certification

1996
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,800
service or recertification audit

1997
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,719
last but not least

1998
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:56,480
as you work through your control

1999
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:59,040
implementation do not take change to be

2000
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,600
disruptive to your business functions

2001
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,600
but rather take them as an opportunity

2002
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,159
to build and strengthen

2003
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:09,280
b2b

2004
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,719
relationships

2005
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:13,360
relationships with vendors suppliers

2006
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,640
partners as well as your internal

2007
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,560
stakeholders

2008
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:19,280
so

2009
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,199
thank you so much for your attention and

2010
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:24,639
thank you so much for having me

2011
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,799
oh i'm gonna meet again um

2012
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,080
to see what you were going to say and

2013
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,920
there's a couple of questions but i'll

2014
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,400
just talk about if that's okay um i've

2015
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,440
spent some months progressing in iso

2016
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:59,520
27001 implementation as nzs 2015 version

2017
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,679
and just recently found out the annex a

2018
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:03,040
controls are changing which you

2019
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,440
mentioned can we still certify against

2020
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,440
the older version or should we bite the

2021
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,600
bullet and rework

2022
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,080
oh that's an interesting one but i'm

2023
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,159
sure it depends on where you are at with

2024
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:16,719
your within your certification journey

2025
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:19,840
but if you are if you already are a

2026
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,440
company which is iso 27 000 and 135 then

2027
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,880
definitely there would be some time that

2028
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,560
would be allocated to you unfortunately

2029
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,320
it hasn't been communicated yet that

2030
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,199
part

2031
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,040
but there would be some time allocated

2032
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,480
to you for you to transition to the

2033
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,640
newer version of it but if you've

2034
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,159
already been an iso 27001 company which

2035
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,239
is certified it doesn't mean like it's

2036
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:41,840
some of the major changes that are

2037
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,280
happening it's just some of the annex a

2038
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,520
controls that have newly controls that

2039
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,600
have been incorporated and some of them

2040
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,760
which have been grouped into themes so

2041
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,920
to really check you know where your

2042
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,000
organization sit what are the controls

2043
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,159
that you already have and what are the

2044
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,080
ones that need to be implemented for you

2045
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,000
to um

2046
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,800
for you to be more compliant with the um

2047
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,560
with the newer version of iso 27001

2048

01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,080
are testing so um

2073
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,679
i think we're gonna have to put out you

2074
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,440
know remember how i wrote that blog post

2075
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,600
about the very first comfy con i was

2076
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,199
thinking about that last night we're

2077
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:10,719
gonna have to put out an updated one

2078
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,239
which also includes some of the tech

2079
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,640
because i think we've refined it

2080
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:15,840
a lot

2081
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,560
and refines the process a lot yeah and

2082
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,159
there's probably forms and templates we

2083
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:22,320
can give out so

2084
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,400
i know

2085
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,480
there's a reason why

2086
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,679
the webpage is au.comfycon dot rocks and

2087
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:31,840
that was because i was always like could

2088
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,840
we have comfy cons elsewhere in the

2089
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,800
world

2090
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,880

zinger phillips

2123
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,239
zinger phillips that's right do you want

2124
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:43,520
to tell you a story of what happened

2125
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,840
last night oh i'm so mad it was actually

2126
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,280
me and um so me and my wife went to kfc

2127
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,440
get myself one of those naked zinger

2128
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,040
boxes it's just a bunch of zinger

2129
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,000
fillets

2130
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,679
and uh they gave us a bunch of original

2131
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,880
recipe and some popcorn chicken

2132
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,040
and it was a very depressing night we

2133
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,080
just didn't know we were very

2134
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,480
disappointed as well we we really liked

2135
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,480
the zinger villas

2136
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,080
oh yeah and

2137
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,400
the worst part is that one of my other

2138
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,360
friends locally also went to kfc and

2139
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,280
also had to go and return his order

2140
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,880
because they made the same mistake at a

2141
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,520
different kfc so

2142
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,120
apparently no one knows what naked

2143
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,440
singers are so well it's literally just

2144
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,760
include a burger without the burger

2145
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,840
yeah yeah yeah love it though it's very

2146
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,840
tasty yeah oh

2147
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,440
yeah i mean i've still got some leftover

2148
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,880
kfc and we're going to have some later

2149
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,639
as well so um

2150
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,880
that should be awesome so cole is the

2151
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,560
director for gala cyber who's a

2152
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,480
consultancy in apsec continuing the

2153
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,760
theme that this is actually an abstract

2154
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,280
conference not actually a normal cyber

2155
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,679
conference as people keep reminding me i

2156
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:48,400
love them too i've had someone suggest

2157
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,280
to me that i create the company magpie

2158
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,480
cyber

2159
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,040
it will be competitors

2160
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,440
my market so exactly so there's a

2161
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,199
there's actually it's a funny story i've

2162
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,199
been talking to a company recently who

2163
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,600
um i won't give the name but their name

2164
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,639
is magpie in a different language and it

2165
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:08,320
was literally so that they would come in

2166
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,880
and sweep other people's lunches so you

2167
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,560
know there is actually

2168
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,960
companies out there who are very similar

2169
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,679
but um cole has

2170
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,480
very interested in work supporting um

2171
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,360
owasp and a few other areas but um today

2172
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,480
he's going to be talking to you about

2173
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,639
writing which i'm really happy about

2174
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:29,600
because

2175
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,120
one of the things that i keep talking to

2176
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,040
people about in interviews is like how

2177
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,120
do you communicate and how do you write

2178
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:38,800
so um very happy to have cole on the

2179
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,000
stage today and i will hand over to him

2180
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,080

to be here at comfy con

2182
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:47,120
writing

2183
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,520
is hard so i'm hoping that i can make it

2184
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,120
a bit easier for everybody here

2185
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,199
afterwards all right

2186
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:54,639
so i'm cole they've already done this

2187
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:56,560
spiel let's move on

2188
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,840
what i love

2189
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,920
i love my dog rocco so when you guys

2190
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,840
mentioned that there was a dog in the

2191
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,920
background i was actually looking at

2192
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,760
my feet to just make sure that it wasn't

2193
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,760
rocco eating my chair but he's a cute

2194
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,280
little frenchie he was playing with

2195
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,679
other frenchies today so

2196
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:13,440

2197
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,600
it's uh it's just great loved it since

2198
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:19,120
high school and ocarina of time so yeah

2199
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,280
go nintendo that's your vendor product

2200
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,679
pitch for today things i don't love

2201
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,560
seagulls true story i had a burrito

2202
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,400
stolen from me when i was kayaking in

2203
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,800
croatia by a seagull picked the entire

2204
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,080
thing up and flew off into the distance

2205
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,920
so i hate them to this day

2206
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,840
i don't like bad code that's why i work

2207
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,600
in apsec so i can just tell people hey

2208
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,920
guys just just fix this please

2209
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,760
and i especially don't like poor writing

2210
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:44,800
which is

2211
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,400
endemic

2212
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,440
in computer security

2213
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,360
i'm going to promise you that at the end

2214
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,080
of my talk you will understand why

2215
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,520
writing is important

2216
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,840
you will be able to structure write and

2217
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,040
edit good content and using your writing

2218
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,100
achieve better security outcomes

2219
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:04,800
[Music]

2220
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:05,760
so

2221
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,840
why is writing important

2222
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,239
in security

2223
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:12,639
people just just do hacking

2224
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,719
yeah

2225
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,480
you write every day

2226
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,480
every single day we work in an

2227
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,239
asynchronous world

2228
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:23,199
you'll be writing whether it's in slack

2229
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:26,400
online little blog articles

2230
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,400
you can write the ism

2231
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,520
not a big fan emails

2232
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:32,960
sales pictures

2233
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,560
reports

2234
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,400
in conclusion we found some areas where

2235
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,400
the security policies working well but

2236
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,760
other areas where it isn't being

2237
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,120
followed at all

2238
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,560
this leads to some risk but not a

2239
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,320
critical amount of risk we recommend

2240
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,840
implementing the recommendations in the

2241
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,960
recommendation section

2242
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,080
you need people to listen to you and

2243
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,760
they will not listen to that they won't

2244
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,360
even read it

2245
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,960
difficult writing will not be read at

2246
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,480
all

2247
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,920
we've got two literary masterpieces here

2248
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,760
the very hungry caterpillar and the

2249
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,840
tales of don quixote

2250
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,000
and i can guarantee that far more people

2251
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,440
in this audience have read the very

2252
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,360
hungry caterpillar than they have of don

2253
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,639
quixote

2254
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,000
and if you've read don quixote please

2255
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,760
give me an app it's a great book just

2256
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,440
difficult

2257
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,199
poor writing also makes people feel

2258
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:22,000
stupid and no one likes feeling stupid

2259
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,159
so you need to make it simple for people

2260
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:26,320
to understand

2261
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,679
as soon as you can do that you can

2262
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:29,679
establish credibility

2263
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:31,600
credible writing helps you make an

2264
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,000
impact

2265
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,040
time rolls ever forward without a pause

2266
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,800
the seasons cycle through spring and

2267
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,120
autumn as i watch the green fade all

2268
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,600
around me i fear the sun setting on my

2269
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,639
youth

2270
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:48,239
it's a quote from chew you in

2271
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:50,400
give a man a fire and he's gone for a

2272
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,159
day but set fire to him and he's warm

2273
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:54,000
for the rest of his life that's in terry

2274
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,480
pratchett and look your risk assessments

2275
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,080
and your reports are not likely to

2276
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,800
become literary masterpieces like laura

2277
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,400
said yesterday we kind of hide in the

2278
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,360
shadows we're not producing novels

2279
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,520
but i hope that the end of this talk

2280
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,679
that instead of writing things like this

2281
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,679
i want you to be able to write it like

2282
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:13,520
this

2283
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,679
so let's go for how you do that

2284
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:17,440
structure

2285
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,159
who are your readers

2286
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:23,280
are they executives

2287
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,520
children

2288
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,520
academics and scientists

2289
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:31,360
uh students or javascript developers

2290
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,400
so

2291
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,159
the main thing is in cyber security

2292
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:35,760
you're probably going to be speaking to

2293
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,199
these free groups it's going to be

2294
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:38,639
executives it's going to be software

2295
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:40,480
engineers general infrastructure

2296
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,000
engineers so

2297
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,159
other people in cyber

2298
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:47,199
and how you structure your content

2299
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:48,719
matt is going to be different for each

2300
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:51,600
of these audiences

2301
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,840
then that leads to what are you trying

2302
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,040
to do which is your narrative

2303
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:00,400
why are you writing what is your purpose

2304
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,120
if it's to inform you want to be very

2305
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,199
explicit short

2306
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:07,520
and so people could just read it quickly

2307
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,800
so finding one sql injection

2308
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,880
are you trying to teach people

2309
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,159
if you're trying to teach people

2310
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,239
narratives and stories of things that

2311
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:19,280
people listen to and care about deeply

2312
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,280
sql injection has been a recurring

2313
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:24,719
source of breaches for decades

2314
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:27,840
people listen to stories

2315
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,639
are you trying to convince people

2316
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:32,000
we need our engineers to use

2317
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,400
parameterized queries to stop customer

2318
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,239
data being stolen

2319
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,159
put some authority into it

2320
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:39,360
main thing is

2321
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,040
all three of these are related to sql

2322
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,800
injection but they're all written for

2323
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,320
different contexts and different

2324
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,560
audiences

2325
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,719
now you've got to structure your writing

2326
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:50,880
which means scaffolding

2327
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,960
love scaffolding it's the the first

2328
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,400
thing you should be doing really once

2329
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,830
you've established your audience

2330
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:57,280
[Music]

2331
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,520
if you're doing info informing directors

2332
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,480
you'll say i did x i found y means that

2333
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,440
straight to the point that's all i need

2334
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,000
if you're trying to get your peers to

2335
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,440
you know believe you and think that

2336
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,800
you're credible you want to say

2337
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,760
something like i did this and then i did

2338
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,880
this i encountered a waff but i overcame

2339
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,520
the laugh and ultimately achieved

2340
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,040
perfection

2341
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,840
i don't know everyone loves stories

2342
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,000
and grammar just as happy that you're in

2343
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
security so you don't need to do all

2344
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,800
that much for her

2345
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,920
let's talk about content

2346
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:35,840
everyone when they write

2347
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,679
goes from their brain

2348
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:40,480
onto paper or in our most of our

2349
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,120
situations to keyboard

2350
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,199
and it's a colorful

2351
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:47,360
beautiful mess of all sorts of just

2352
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,400
descriptive languages and crazy words we

2353
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,320
have no real

2354
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,199
like

2355
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:56,719
like float it makes any sense a bit of a

2356
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:58,080
scribble

2357
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,000
and it's terribly confusing for both

2358
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,679
yourself when you read it a few days

2359
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:05,520
later and your audience as well right

2360
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,920
nobody does it well but you have to

2361
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,360
start somewhere

2362
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,520
and it's a lot easier to do it with

2363
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,679
structure so you can get your little

2364
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,440
colorful descriptions into a bunch of

2365
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,239
different sections than it is to try to

2366
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:20,639
get an enormous novel

2367
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:24,400
and try to edit that

2368
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,920
i like to think of it as logs

2369
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,080
and not the type of security logs like

2370
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,880
li actual logs and you can do a lot with

2371
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,360
logs you can you can build log cabins

2372
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,800
like pretty well

2373
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,400
but you need to do a lot of work to make

2374
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,320
them quite usable if you're trying to do

2375
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,480
anything complicated you need to turn it

2376
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,440
into lumber

2377
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,600
[Music]

2378
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,760
so you've got to strip the log

2379
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,679
and you need to be absolutely ruthless

2380
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:53,600
i didn't have time to write a short

2381
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:54,880
letter

2382
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:58,320
so i wrote a long one instead

2383
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,360
short messages are superior to long ones

2384
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,400
go through your written prose your brain

2385
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,480
to keyboard and look at anything where

2386
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:11,360
you've tried to use a complicated word

2387
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,440
and make it a simple one so turn

2388
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,400
numerous into many implementing to do

2389
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,239
and any phrases that are

2390
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:20,080
a long-winded way of trying to do

2391
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,040
something

2392
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,040
simplify and shorten it

2393
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,840
at this point in time is now

2394
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,870
in our professional opinions we think

2395
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:30,400
[Music]

2396
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,639
abc was engaged to perform a white

2397
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:33,760
book's

2398
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,520
assessment encompassing the cloud

01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,080
infrastructure and web presence of xyz

2400

company

2401
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,560
ass long-winded

2402
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,960
what i prefer

2403
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:47,760
xyz asked abc to look for security bugs

2404
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,560
in their website

2405
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,800
simple is better than complex as well

2406
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,239
are you going to talk to people about

2407
01:30:58,239 --> 01:31:00,560
your homogenous server fleet

2408
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,719
or are you going to say we use linux

2409
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:04,719
everywhere

2410
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:07,520
and minimal is better than cluttered

2411
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,199
you get your content that you've written

2412
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:10,960
brand of paper

2413
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,719
delete half

2414
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:14,840
and then another half

2415
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,760
so this is from the original xss

2416
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,000
prevention cheat sheet

2417
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,920
html entity encoding is okay for

2418
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:23,360
untrusted data that you put in the body

2419
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,280
to html document such as inside of div

2420
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,120
tag it even sort of works for untrusted

2421
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,480
data that goes into attributes

2422
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,840
particularly if you're religious about

2423
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,280
using quotes around your attributes but

2424
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,280
html entity encoding doesn't work if

2425
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,600
you're putting it inside a script

2426
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,320
yeah let's just get rid of half of that

2427
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,159
especially like the uh stuff that's not

2428
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:41,920
really related to entity encoding it's

2429
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,000
talking about attribute encoding so just

2430
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,320
delete that and we're left with html

2431
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,760
entity encoding is for data that you put

2432
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,679
in the body of html document such as

2433
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:51,360
inside a div tag

2434
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,280
html entity encoding won't work when

2435
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,280
placing data inside a script

2436
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,960
now it still isn't good it's way too

2437
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,560
wordy

2438
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,719
you can simplify fo

2439
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:03,040
use html entity encoding when placing

2440
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:07,679
data between html tags like here

2441
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:11,199
delete a lot of your content

2442
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:13,040
i know it hurts to kill your babies but

2443
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,440
sometimes you've got to do it

2444
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,120
but so where are you going to make cuts

2445
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,280
these are the places i look for the most

2446
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,199
it's adjectives because any colorful

2447
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:22,719
language is just you

2448
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:24,159
in your head thinking oh yeah it sounds

2449
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:25,040
really good

2450
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,840
adverbs conjunctions and lots are

2451
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,280
necessary words like we mentioned

2452
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,679
earlier

2453
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,800
part three is personalization

2454
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,560
so you've now got the literary

2455
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,960
equivalent to c spot run

2456
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:46,800
very simple but no one wants to read

2457
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,040
where spot run if you're an adult

2458
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,679
you got a skeleton

2459
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,760
you could now have an opportunity though

2460
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:56,159
to show personality because you stripped

2461
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:59,040
everything down to the bare necessities

2462
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,639
you got your lumbar

2463
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,880
and you want people to read your content

2464
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,159
so you can style it how you want now

2465
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:08,239
if you want to have mahogany stairs you

2466
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:10,159
can say that they're brown and they've

2467
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:12,080
got iron railings

2468
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,159
or you can say you're going for a

2469
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:16,960
hamptons look with the whites

2470
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,480
or you're a bit of a weirdo and like

2471
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,080
this kind of spirally thing that you

2472
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:22,800
want just i i don't get it but

2473
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,400
main thing is that every word that you

2474
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,560
add in there now is intentional and

2475
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,360
every single word has purpose

2476
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,840
so it's your content not your brain to

2477
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,920
paper

2478
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:36,320
so let's go down to why are developers

2479
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,719
still introducing xss when you have so

2480
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:40,800
much great content teaching them how to

2481
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,400
prevent it which is something that keeps

2482
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,920
coming up in

2483
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,239
our conversations all the time

2484
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:48,159
and what i said is all right let's have

2485
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:49,840
a look at where all the developers go

2486
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,920
and start with rewriting it which is the

2487
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,040
prevention cheat sheet

2488
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,760
this was written 10 years back and it

2489
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,360
was written by code reviewers by pen

2490
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,840
testers and web security engineers and

2491
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:07,040
it is fantastic technical advice

2492
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,280
and their intended audience are software

2493
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:12,080
engineers junior security professionals

2494
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,880
and other security peeps

2495
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,480
the actual audience are code reviewers

2496
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,239
pen testers and web security engineers

2497
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:19,760
because no one actually understands what

2498
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,199
it's what's going on there and there's

2499
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:22,800
no structure

2500
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,880
so we're going to go about applying

2501
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:28,320
those rules to fixing this content

2502
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:31,280
so this is the existing structure

2503
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,560
every heading is basically

2504
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,120
unintelligible never insert untrusted

2505
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,600
data except in the loud locations

2506
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:38,800
um

2507
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,960
why can't i just html entity and code

2508
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,199
it's just so much content it's

2509
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:44,880
it's just like someone's got it into

2510
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,159
their head and just done the brain to

2511
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:48,000
paper thing right

2512
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,400
there are 14 rules it's just too many

2513
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,719
for people to crop it's overwhelming

2514
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:53,600
and

2515
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,600
like that sounds really difficult like

2516
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,000
what what is untrusted data what are

2517
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,719
allowed locations i don't know

2518
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:02,800
and rule zero

2519
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,320
i guess it's a programming joke but

2520
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:05,280
still

2521
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,040
it's too difficult

2522
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,199
but when i've gone into it i said we

2523
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:11,760
need to make it simple

2524
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,159
exercise prevention philosophy talk

2525
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:16,639
about frameworks talk about output

2526
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:18,000
encoding

2527
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,600
and make sure that we talk about each

2528
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,560
specific type of it

2529
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,480
we've gone and made it current so

2530
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,320
developers immediately have front loaded

2531
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,840
with the information they care about

2532
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,639
which is how does react fix my problems

2533
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:32,239
how does

2534
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:33,760
output encoding

2535
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,239
matter in a url context

2536
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:37,920
all of the sections are independent of

2537
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:40,239
one another nowadays as well so you

2538
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:42,239
don't have to go to section zero to find

2539
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:44,400
content for section four and it's

2540
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,639
searchable it's a lot easier to search

2541
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:50,560
html or css than it is to search for

2542
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,440
um

2543
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,440
untrusted data in the loud locations

2544
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,719
what what what are allowed locations

2545
01:35:56,719 --> 01:35:58,110
next is the content

[Music]

2547
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,760
first rule is to deny all don't put

2548
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,760
untrusted data into your html document

2549
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,280
unless it is within one of the slots to

2550
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,040
find in rule one through five the reason

2551
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,480
for suspended

2552
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,600
too much

2553
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,760
it's long it's complex and cluttered we

2554
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,000
want to do the opposite short simple

2555
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,840
minimal delete half delete another half

2556
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,760
so we go from this

2557
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,520
where it filled my entire screen and

2558
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,360
still doesn't have it all

2559
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,360
down to this output encoding is not

2560
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,320
perfect it will not prevent xss always

2561
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,400
there are dangerous contexts here are

2562
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,480
the dangerous contexts

2563
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,239
simple

2564
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:35,840
style

2565
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,920
it's reference material i don't want

2566
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:40,639
embellishment c spot run is exactly what

2567
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:43,679
i'm looking for so i've gone through

2568
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:47,480
updated the cheat sheet to get rid of

2569
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:50,010
572 lines of content

2570

[Music]

2571
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,199
there's more page hits now developers

2572
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:54,960
are pinging me for advice and i hope

2573
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:57,520
there's less exercise in the future

2574
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,679
so back to my promise

2575
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:01,360
hopefully at this point you understand

2576
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,280
why writing's important

2577
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,520
you can now structure write and edit

2578
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:06,880
your pros

2579
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,040
and using that you can get better

2580
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:11,199
security outcomes

2581
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:14,799
thanks copycon have fun

2582
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,040
and what was amazing about all that is

2583
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,800
you had 20 minutes to talk and you took

2584
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,199
less than 20. yeah so you were nice and

2585
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:22,880
simple concise

2586
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,639
etc

2587
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:26,239
thank you i was i was expecting to take

2588
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:28,880
40 for some reason no no no no i think

2589
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:31,199
it was a really good talk and i think

2590
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:32,400
because i know that you were a bit

2591
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:33,760
worried that it was very similar to

2592
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,000
nana's but i think it's what i said

2593
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,679
earlier was it's coming at it from

2594
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:39,600
different contexts right so

2595
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,679
the technical versus the slightly less

2596
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:43,440
technical i don't like using those terms

2597
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,040
but there's not a better term right now

2598
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,960
and it's just emphasizing that thing

2599
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,320
which is like making sure you're

2600
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,639
addressing to the audience making sure

2601
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:52,080
you keep it simple and making it

2602
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,679
actionable in some way

2603
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:55,920
um because you're right i was reading

2604
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,639
those i'm going i i have a vague

2605
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:00,159
understanding of javascript i won't

2606
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:01,600
pretend i know

2607
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,080
anything about javascript other than i

2608
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,639
used to fiddle with d3 and be really bad

2609
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:08,000
at it but

2610
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,679
having those new simpler versions make

2611
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:12,159
it a lot easier to use so and i have

2612
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:14,080
heard from reasonably good sources who

2613
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,239
are sitting next to me on the couch that

2614
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:19,119
um the new versions of those um cheat

2615
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:20,719
sheets are a lot better than they used

2616
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:21,679
to be and have been getting a lot of

2617
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:24,000
good praise as well so

2618
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,400
um but it is it is a time sync because

2619
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,719
doing good writing takes a lot of time

2620
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:31,040
so just remember that you need to budget

2621
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,960
to do that

2622
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,560
so do you so i guess that leads to an

2623
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,159
interesting question is that something

2624
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:38,880
we should be teaching more people

2625
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,480
do you think that's a cultural problem i

2626
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,719
know that so let me phrase this so i

2627
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:44,639
know that there used to be this history

2628
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:47,600
where people would say i am technical i

2629
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:50,080
don't write and it was like you know the

2630
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,760
people who assist admins or computer

2631
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,440
admins would be like i don't do

2632
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,280
documentation because documentation is

2633
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:56,960
not technical

2634
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,199
is that different now do we have to

2635
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:01,040
start teaching writing

2636
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,280
um you know writing courses as part of

2637
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,800
career development what do you think of

2638
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,159
some of the things we would have to do

2639
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:08,639
to sort of improve that moving forward

2640
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:11,199
i think far earlier i actually had some

2641
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:13,360
slides i cut from the presentation which

2642
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:16,000
we're talking about for beginning

2643
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,480
how at school we're actually talking

2644
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:21,520
about writing practices so and some

2645
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,920
examples of this is that you have word

2646
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,239
limits for assignments or page limits

2647
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:29,199
and the whole idea behind them initially

2648
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:31,600
was to make people get write lots and

2649
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,080
lots of content and then to cut it down

2650
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:35,840
so that they can have a ver like talk

2651
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,760
about more things but what you end up

2652
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:40,719
having is people writing to the limit as

2653
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:42,639
little as they possibly can

2654
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:45,040
and using lots of conjunction words

2655
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,119
because we're all lazy so it's all right

2656
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:49,360
like that's that's what you do so i

2657
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,760
think um and i guess other stuff is

2658
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:53,679
you're praised by your peers at high

2659
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:55,520
school and primary school for using

2660
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,800
complex sentences and you know like

2661
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,800
see spot run is people laugh at that

2662
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,639
when you could be talking about like

2663
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:05,280
crazy words i don't know like saccharine

2664
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,840
and or like catechismic and when you

2665
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,000
could say bad so

2666
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,639
i i feel that our education system

2667
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,719
before we even get to becoming

2668
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:18,960
professionals sets us up badly so and

2669
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,719
unless you have an active interest in

2670
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:22,960
writing it's going to be hard for you to

2671
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,239
change 13 years of education

2672
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:27,840
i remember when i was at dst and we did

2673
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,360
a scientific writing course the one

2674
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:30,159
thing

2675
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:31,040
well there was a couple of different

2676
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:32,880
things but it was like never use the

2677
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,280
word utilize because wherever you can

2678
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,199
use the word utilize use there's a much

2679
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:39,040
better way of putting it like things

2680
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,480
like that we put words into sound

2681
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,400
smarter or because we just want to fill

2682
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,159
a page up with long words and it's like

2683
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:45,199
well you're just making it more

2684
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:47,119
complicated than it needs to be

2685
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:49,520
yeah and i guess it's also like

2686
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,760
you want clients to accept that you

2687
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,679
they've paid for a good service and one

2688
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:55,520
way to kind of indicate that is the

2689
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,440
length of your report it's like words

2690
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,920
pen test reports 50 pages long so

2691
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,920
clearly i got my values worth of like a

2692
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,560
two-week assessment but i think i think

2693
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,320
that clients will get more value from

2694
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,480
like a short report that's explicit

2695
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,400
about exactly what they need to do even

2696
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,719
if it's only four pages long so that's

2697
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:13,440
me

2698
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:14,960
i think there was a comment in the chat

2699
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,239
or there was a comment in the chat

2700
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:17,920
saying worst advice ever charged by the

2701
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:19,440
word two thousand five hundred page

2702
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:22,080
reports channel you're in a big four

2703
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:25,600
which i don't wanna say is is real but

2704
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,600
i mean

2705
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,440
i've read enough of those instead i

2706
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,839
think

2707
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,880
it's not easy to teach like change that

2708
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:39,199
behavior so and

2709
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:41,040
also a lot of these places write

2710
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,040
findings and pre-generated reports

2711
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,840
anyway so it's

2712
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:48,159
not i think the thing that's changing

2713
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:50,560
with communications and writing as well

2714
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,080
is

2715
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,520
not just

2716
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:55,600
you know learning at school it's the way

2717
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,080
we communicate so people

2718
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,480
are talking a lot different they're

2719
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:02,080
writing a lot different they're writing

2720
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,239
a lot more phonetically which can you

2721
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:06,320
know kind of piss people off but we're

2722
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,960
also using shorter shorter means of

2723
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:11,199
communication so text messages

2724
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:13,040
slack um

2725
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:15,440
so it's changing the way that

2726
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,520
people communicate and the way that we

2727
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,600
communicate in reports and and what we

2728
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,280
present back is going to have to change

2729
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:24,159
as well as the generations go on but for

2730
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:26,239
now when we have the

2731
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:28,880
you know generation above us in power so

2732
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,440
to speak um the way that they need

2733
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:34,000
communication is a little bit different

2734
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:34,960
from the way that the younger

2735
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,639
generations communicate these days and i

2736
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:38,800
think knowing that knowing your audience

2737
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,480
you know you put in your slides you'll

2738
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,560
have different different audiences and

2739
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,320
different people that you're pitching to

2740
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:45,600
and we've heard that a few times over

2741
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,480
the last days is just understanding

2742
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:50,400
who your audience are and how you need

2743
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,920
to communicate to them is super

2744
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,360
important don't just expect that

2745
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,119
everybody is going to accept the same

2746
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:56,719
kind of report in the same kind of

2747
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:58,000
language

2748
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,639
one thing i try to teach my juniors um

2749
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:03,520
is that impersonal does not mean

2750
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,679
professional so you don't need to go

2751
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:08,159
through and say a report was

2752
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:10,159
assessed at the beginning of this thing

2753
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:11,760
between this period of time when you

2754
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,840
could say something like i did hacking

2755
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:14,639
here

2756
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:17,600
um again it depends on your audience but

2757
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:20,560
i think having colloquialisms and it's

2758
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,719
as long as you go through and strip your

2759
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:24,400
logs to lumber first and then you can

2760
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,239
add your colloquialisms in afterwards

2761
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:27,920
it's all right so

2762
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,360
yeah but it's

2763
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:30,960
i'm interested to see how the world

2764
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:33,199
changes i hope more people write like me

2765
01:43:33,199 --> 01:43:35,119
eventually

2766
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:37,360
well the the thing is um being a

2767
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:39,040
consultant forever and what i've always

2768
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:40,800
talked to my team about is that you

2769
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,000
could be the best consultant you can do

2770
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,320
the best job in the world unless your

2771
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:47,119
report reflects that then nobody cares

2772
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:48,800
and unfortunately

2773
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,639
the person you give that report to may

2774
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:52,080
not be the last person who sees that

2775
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,000
report so it is what is

2776
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,920
going to be the lasting impression on

2777
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:56,880
you and

2778
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,800
and on your organization when you're

2779
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,800
reporting it is really important to get

2780
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:05,159
it right and to make an impact

2781
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:08,000
there are some questions but we'll have

2782
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,520
to move on to the next one i was gonna

2783
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,440
i'm gonna quickly post a link that i

2784
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,920
think is related though um in the chat

2785
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:15,360
which is also you were talking about

2786
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,360
different ways of communication people

2787
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,960
who say hello

2788
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,280
in i am or slack and things

2789
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:23,520
and then wait for a response rather than

2790
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,360
asking their question when they say

2791
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:26,639
hello

2792
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:28,080
it's like a complete change from the

2793
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,840
previous settings where you say hello

2794
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,679
and then it's how are you it's not that

2795
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:33,520
any like we don't want that anymore it's

2796
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,199
hello can you answer this question for

2797
01:44:35,199 --> 01:44:36,639
me and then somebody will get back and

2798
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:38,800
answer to you at some point yeah i've

2799
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,960
had people say to me i i was like all

2800
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,560
right what do you want like oh i was

2801
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:43,600
waiting for you to be back at your

2802
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,520
machine like three days later so and

2803
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:46,800
it's just like

2804
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,560
we are not living in a synchronous world

2805
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,480
anymore you know i can give me a phone

2806
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,480
call if you need direct communication

2807
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,639
but if that's not going to work send me

2808
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:56,719
a slack message saying hello please

2809
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:58,639
review this report by the state or

2810
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:00,719
whatever and it's not about being it's

2811
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:03,760
not about being uh you know

2812
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:06,159
unfair or not nice it's literally just

2813
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:08,159
say what you want and get it done with

2814
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:09,280
and then we'll deal with it when it

2815
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:11,119
comes up

2816
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:13,360
i guess like the niceties like that you

2817
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:14,960
used to have with email

2818
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,480
or whatever just

2819
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,080
don't translate particularly well to

2820
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,400
instant messaging all that well so

2821
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:21,760
yeah

2822
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,040
awesome look we could talk about this

2823
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:24,639
subject forever cole there are a couple

2824
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:26,239
of questions in the chat that i'm sure

2825
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:27,360
people would really love to get your

2826
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,199
opinion on um but thank you very much

2827
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:30,239

2831
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,840

2844
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:01,760
tired but we are we're getting there um

2845

oh it's nice and short uh sebastian is a

2848
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:10,159
security professional who loves all

2849
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:12,400
things related cloud and email security

2850
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,080
during business as i'm often working on

2851
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:16,320
defensive tools after hours is a

2852
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,080
different story and i've got a sneaking

2853
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,119
suspicion this is where your

2854
01:46:19,119 --> 01:46:20,800
presentation comes in

2855
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,040
so i will add that

2856
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,480
to the stream

2857
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:27,520
and um you're ready to go

2858
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,920
cool cool well uh yeah look first off

2859
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,840
thanks uh everyone for for coming to the

2860
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,360
talk and i hope you'll be able to take

2861
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:34,800
something away from it

2862
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,719
now yeah as you can see from the title

2863
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:38,719
here today i'm going to be talking about

2864
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:40,880
email security and more specifically

2865
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,400
i'll be talking about some security

2866
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:45,040
research i did a few months ago

2867
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,360
which resulted in me compromising the

2868
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:49,920
email supply chain of about 260

2869
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:51,920
australian organizations and i'll

2870
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:54,159
elaborate a bit more on what it means to

2871
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:57,199
compromise an email supply chain shortly

2872
01:46:57,199 --> 01:46:59,600
but i think it'll be best off if i start

2873
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,360
off with a bit of an agenda

2874
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,280
so look yep right at the beginning i'll

2875
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,600
introduce myself and who i am

2876
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,520
we'll then get into a technical overview

2877
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:09,600
of everything email authentication

2878
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,920
related and supply chain related we'll

2879
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:13,920
talk about how email supply chains have

2880
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:16,320
become more complex with the adoption of

2881
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,719
cloud infrastructure and how threat and

2882
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:21,119
how threat actors can abuse this cloud

2883
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:23,760
infrastructure with malicious intent

2884
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,040
um we'll then talk about some of the

2885
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,960
security research i did and i'll flesh

2886
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:28,800
out some of the technical challenges

2887
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,119
involved in doing this research and what

2888
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:33,760
the ultimate outcome of it was and

2889
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,040
finally we'll wrap up with some

2890
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,360
concluding thoughts

2891
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,119
um so yeah getting into the who am i i'm

2892
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:41,600
sebastian sala and i currently work at

2893
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,360
palo alto networks as a cloud security

2894
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:46,000
architect in my spare time i work on a

2895
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,159
fishing simulation platform called can i

2896
01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:50,480
fish and a lot of the security research

2897
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:51,440
i did

2898
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:54,639
was enabled by the toolings i created on

2899
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:56,320
behalf of can i fish

2900
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,320
um aside from that i've been in infosec

2901
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,639
it for about nine years where i focus

2902
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:02,480
pretty heavily on cloud and email

2903
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:06,000
security but that's enough about me

2904
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,600
so let's get straight into the the

2905
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,840
technical overview and as mentioned

2906
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,679
earlier we'll talk about everything

2907
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:13,840
email authentication and supply chain

2908
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,840
related and how we can perform attacks

2909
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:19,520
against email supply chains

2910
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,199
so starting off

2911
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:23,440
you know when you receive an email and

2912
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,360
you see that it purports to come from

2913
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:27,920
somebody such as your employer a friend

2914
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,760
a colleague or a service provider that

2915
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,440
you use

2916
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,199
have you ever wondered what's going on

2917
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:35,520
behind the scenes so that when you see

2918
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:36,960
that that email says that it's coming

2919
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:39,119
from someone you actually have assurance

2920
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,520
that it did in fact come from them

2921
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,920
and what i'm talking about here is this

2922
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,840
little from address at the top of the

2923
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,239
email right you know whenever we receive

2924
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:50,480
an email in this example purporting to

2925
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:52,400
come from github.com

2926
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:55,119
um i instinctively begin to trust some

2927
01:48:55,119 --> 01:48:57,440
of the content right i don't fully trust

2928
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:59,280
it and no one ever should

2929
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:00,880
but you know when i see that it's come

2930
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,760
from a sender that i know and trust you

2931
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:04,560
know

2932
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:08,159
a trust relationship starts to form

2933
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:09,920
now behind the scenes whenever you

2934
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:11,920
receive an email your your email gateway

2935
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:14,480
provider whether it's microsoft google

2936
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:16,880
yahoo or whoever it is they're doing a

2937
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,560
bunch of checks behind the scenes to try

2938
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:20,320
and determine if the sender is who they

2939
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:23,440
say they are and these checks typically

2940
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:25,440
are aligned against three email

2941
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:27,360
authentication protocols

2942
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,199
the first and most commonly adopted is

2943
01:49:29,199 --> 01:49:32,159
the sender's policy framework or spf

2944
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:33,840
um then we have two other email

2945
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,080
authentication protocols now i won't go

2946
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:38,159
into the nitty gritty of what dkim or

2947
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:40,320
dmarc are because that'll take five or

2948
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,880
ten minutes on its own but i will deep

2949
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,119
dive into spf

2950
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:47,679
and essentially what spf is is it's

2951
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:50,000
essentially a public record that each

2952
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
organization maintains

2953
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,719
in its dns zone file and it tells email

2954
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:57,280
receivers that if they receive an email

2955
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,199
purporting to come from someone at this

2956
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:00,400
organization

2957
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,880
only trust it if the email is received

2958
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:05,280
from one of the ip addresses that you

2959
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,159
tell them to trust so that way if they

2960
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:10,560
receive an email appearing to come from

2961
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:12,560
you know your organization but it's from

2962
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:15,679
an unknown ip address that gives them a

2963
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:18,239
mechanism to say hey wait a second you

2964
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:19,920
aren't who you say you are right you're

2965
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:21,920
trying to spoof this sender and then

2966
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:24,320
they will base off of the sp the spf

2967
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:27,040
configuration put that email into a spam

2968
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:30,000
or uh completely block it right

2969
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,800
um now what we see here on screen is an

2970
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:36,159
extract of the github spf record and

2971
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:37,920
what we can see here is that it's made

2972
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:40,320
up of two different types of addresses

2973
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:43,440
uh first we have just stock standard ip

2974
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,080
addresses and this is sort of

2975
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:46,639
self-explanatory

2976
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,960
um but then we also have domains with an

2977
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,520
spf record and this is essentially them

2978
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,760
saying hey you know first of all take a

2979
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:55,199
look at the ip addresses that i'm

2980
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:58,000
directly listing but then also do a

2981
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,800
lookup of the spf record for the domain

2982
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:02,719
that i'm listing within my own spf

2983
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:04,639
record right so this is where we start

2984
01:51:04,639 --> 01:51:06,960
to get the idea of downstream domain

2985
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:09,440
lookups and these are commonly used when

2986
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:10,960
we're using third-party mail

2987
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:13,840
infrastructure right so if if we want

2988
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,400
office 365 to be able to send emails on

2989
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,960
our behalf or servicenow or salesforce

2990
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,639
or zendesk or one of thousands of

2991
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:22,800
different apps we're typically going to

2992
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:25,040
do it through these downstream domain

2993
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:26,960
lookups because what ends up happening

2994
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:27,760
is

2995
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:29,679
those downstream suppliers end up

2996
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:31,440
managing the mail infrastructure for us

2997
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,040
we don't have to do it because they're

2998
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:35,199
managing it

2999
01:51:35,199 --> 01:51:37,040
and this is really where we start to get

3000
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:39,440
into the idea of email supply chains

3001
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,760
right here we can see we have two very

3002
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:44,159
different organizations with two very

3003
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:46,400
different email supply chains

3004
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:48,960
on the left we've got cyber update you

3005
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:52,000
and on the right we've got github.com

3006
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,159
now for cyberdog update you um you know

3007
01:51:54,159 --> 01:51:56,400
when we look at their spf records they

3008
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:59,440
list a single mail server within it

3009
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:00,960
that can deliver emails on behalf of

3010
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:02,480
them now this is pretty tightly

3011
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:04,320
controlled and it's a pretty extreme

3012
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:05,360
example

3013
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:07,040
but when we look at the github record on

3014
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:08,960
the right you can see that they've got a

3015
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:10,960
very different email supply chain and

3016
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,960
when we delve into the spf record you

3017
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,400
can see that they've got some mail

3018
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:16,880
servers that are you know directly

3019
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:19,840
listed within the github.com spf record

3020
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,679
but then they do have those downstream

3021
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:23,599
lookups right they've got salesforce

3022
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:27,040
zendesk mailchimp and so on so forth and

3023
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:29,040
they're essentially trusting all these

3024
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:30,880
different providers to be doing the

3025
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:33,440
right thing

3026
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:34,560
um

3027
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,880
yeah there we go a couple animations uh

3028
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:38,560
now this is where you know things start

3029
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:40,400
to become even more interesting right

3030
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,400
because we're in the middle of this

3031
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,080
massive migration that a lot of

3032
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:46,080
government as well as publicly traded

3033
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,159
companies are starting to go through

3034
01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:50,000
where they're shifting their workloads

3035
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,239
from private data centers into public

3036
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:54,560
lab providers such as aws

3037
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,159
and gcp

3038
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:58,320
and there this also includes mail

3039
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,639
servers right so previously what was

3040
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:02,880
hosted and strictly controlled is now a

3041
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:05,280
bit more dynamic in the cloud we have

3042
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,920
this idea of elasticity where you can

3043
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,159
dynamically add or remove workloads when

3044
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:12,239
necessary so you may spin up one

3045
01:53:12,239 --> 01:53:14,080
workload which is being used as a mail

3046
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:16,480
server and then a month later you tear

3047
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:18,000
it back down and then another month

3048
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,520
later you know you're like you know what

3049
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:20,800
i want to spin it up but this time i

3050
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,880
want to spin up two and the reason

3051
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:25,520
you're able to do this is because aws

3052
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,920
azure gcp and you know however many

3053
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:29,840
other sort of hyperscaler public cloud

3054
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,920
providers are out there they're allowing

3055
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:34,639
you to pull from a pooled uh a pooled

3056
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:36,800
resource pool right so

3057
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:39,040
essentially you're pulling from this

3058
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:40,639
and you're also doing this not only for

3059
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:42,880
the compute memory and hard drive space

3060
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,639
but you're also doing this for the ip

3061
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:46,239
addresses that those workloads are

3062
01:53:46,239 --> 01:53:48,320
leveraging

3063
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,080
and this is where you know

3064
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:52,239
there's only a limited number

3065
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:55,040
of ipv4 addresses that are in existence

3066
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:57,760
so if we spin up a workload that ip

3067
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:58,880
address

3068
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:02,000
um will come from a shared ip pool and

3069
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,840
if we spin our workload back down then

3070
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:05,679
boom it will go back into that pool and

3071
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:07,760
other customers can pull from it

3072
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:10,080
now you're probably beginning to see

3073
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,840
where this may become an issue right

3074
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,760
what if at one point

3075
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:16,239
you were using a particular ip address

3076
01:54:16,239 --> 01:54:17,679
and you configured it within your dns

3077
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:19,840
records but then at some point later

3078
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:21,760
down the line you released that ip but

3079
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:23,840
you forget to remove it from your dns

3080
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:24,800
records

3081
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,159
well now you're in a pretty tricky

3082
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:28,639
situation because another customer can

3083
01:54:28,639 --> 01:54:31,679
come in and take that ip address

3084
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:33,760
and because you've forgotten to update

3085
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:36,400
your dns records from everyone else's

3086
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:39,040
perspective it looks like you're still

3087
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:41,920
actually using that ip and this exact

3088
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:44,719
scenario is how i p

3089
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:47,679
takeover attacks occur

3090
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:50,000
now ip takeover attacks aren't anything

3091
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,719
new you know relating just to aws there

3092
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:54,960
are dozens of blogs already written on

3093
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:57,040
this and in fact many bug bounty hunters

3094
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,480
have built their entire profession

3095
01:54:58,480 --> 01:54:59,360
around

3096
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:01,599
finding these vulnerabilities

3097
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:03,280
um but you know if we take a look at it

3098
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:05,199
from another perspective when we're

3099
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:07,760
looking at dns records there are a

3100
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,760
variety of different types that that are

3101
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:11,920
within a dns zone file right we've got

3102
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:15,280
cname records we've got a records nf ns

3103
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:17,440
mx and we've also got text records which

3104
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:20,239
is where spf entries are located

3105
01:55:20,239 --> 01:55:22,239
now at a certain point while reading

3106
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:24,000
through some of the various bug bounty

3107
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,639
reports i began to realize right

3108
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:29,040
everyone spends all their time looking

3109
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:31,679
at the top four dns record types

3110
01:55:31,679 --> 01:55:35,119
no one has really properly looked at spf

3111
01:55:35,119 --> 01:55:36,560
and you know there are a variety of

3112
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,239
reasons why this may be the case but i

3113
01:55:38,239 --> 01:55:40,000
like to think it's just because spf

3114
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,800
isn't as sexy as taking something like a

3115
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:45,199
web server ip

3116
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:47,360
so anyway i suspected that no one had

3117
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:49,840
given spf supply chain or ip takeover

3118
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:52,080
attacks a proper look at and i wanted to

3119
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,920
test out my theory

3120
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:56,400
and the first step of testing that

3121
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:59,440
theory out is collecting some targets to

3122
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:02,080
test it out on right so i wanted a

3123
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:04,000
sample list of a few hundred australian

3124
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
domains and the easiest way to get that

3125
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,960
list was to use a tool called sublisto

3126
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:12,480
now what sublisto does is it uses open

3127
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:14,320
source intelligence to scan things like

3128
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:17,360
certificate registrations google search

3129
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:20,400
bing yahoo and so on to find sub domains

3130
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:23,119
for a given domain name

3131
01:56:23,119 --> 01:56:25,920
now in this case i simply used

3132
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:28,800
a u and dot com.u as the domain name and

3133
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,800
accordingly sublister would present

3134
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,480
information back to me on what sub

3135
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:34,000
domains you can find

3136
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,320
now if i let this run to completion i'd

3137
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,320
probably get a couple million domains

3138
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:40,480
back so i only let it run for a few

3139
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,639
seconds and then i stopped the search

3140
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:44,480
and after that i ran a simple script to

3141
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:46,960
check if the domains uh found actually

3142
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,960
had a dns record associated to them and

3143
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:51,040
then i filtered out those that didn't

3144
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,520
and finally i then just sort of selected

3145
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:56,080
the first 300 domains i came across and

3146
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:58,080
checked everything else else out just

3147
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:00,159
simply just to get a few hundred domains

3148
01:57:00,159 --> 01:57:02,960
to to do this test against

3149
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:05,360
now once i had that list the the second

3150
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:08,239
step was to do that deep dive scan and

3151
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:10,159
you know we have to remember that spf

3152
01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:12,239
records are in a pretty bespoke format

3153
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:14,639
and it isn't simply a case of just

3154
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:16,719
querying an spf record and being

3155
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:19,199
presented back with all the ip addresses

3156
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:21,599
that are authorized to deliver emails on

3157
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:23,040
behalf of them

3158
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,400
and that's because there are downstream

3159
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:26,400
domain lookups so we need to go ahead

3160
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,159
and query those downstream lookups

3161
01:57:28,159 --> 01:57:29,920
extract all the authorized mail centers

3162
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:32,159
and if we want this exhaustive search to

3163
01:57:32,159 --> 01:57:33,440
actually work

3164
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:34,400
that's what we're going to have to do

3165
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:35,599
we're going to have to go down to the

3166
01:57:35,599 --> 01:57:37,599
nth level of degree run recursive

3167
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:40,000
searches and query as many mail senders

3168
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,440
as we can find

3169
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:43,440
now fortunately for me i was pretty

3170
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:46,000
uniquely positioned to run this game

3171
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,679
i've already built a tool that can do

3172
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:48,960
exactly this

3173
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:51,199
and normally the tool will output the

3174
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:53,520
the full spf supply chain in a human

3175
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:56,000
readable gui format but i also created

3176
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,639
an api which outputs it in a json format

3177
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:00,719
so all i did was put together a quick

3178
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:03,199
little script queried my own api and

3179
01:58:03,199 --> 01:58:05,679
extracted the the full spf supply chain

3180
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:07,360
for for each of these 300 target

3181
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,760
organizations

3182
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:12,239
now once i had that full spf supply

3183
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:14,400
chain for those 300 orgs it was simply a

3184
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,639
case of doing a cross-reference right

3185
01:58:16,639 --> 01:58:19,280
aws and azure list their pooled ip

3186
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:21,119
addresses publicly right anyone can go

3187
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:23,199
and download them they're listed on the

3188
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:25,679
aws and azure websites so i went ahead

3189
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:27,440
and downloaded each list and again

3190
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:28,880
scripted together a short little

3191
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:30,800
function that would do a cross reference

3192
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:32,880
right where i would

3193
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:34,639
essentially match you know the domain

3194
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:37,599
spf ips against the aws and the zero

3195
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:39,760
pooled ips check to see where there was

3196
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:41,679
a match or if subnets were within one

3197
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:44,560
another and then i combined both data

3198
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:46,960
sets together so that way i could run

3199
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:48,639
you know just searches to see you know

3200
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:50,960
what region was an ip address in

3201
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:53,199
uh what aws service or service was it

3202
01:58:53,199 --> 01:58:57,040
associated to and so on so forth

3203
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:59,840
so anyway um you know the data that i

3204
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:02,719
got i output it into a nice neat little

3205
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,800
csv file for me to review

3206
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:06,960
and i began looking at that csv file

3207
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:08,400
running filters on it to see if i could

3208
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:11,119
eyeball any low-hanging fruits so the

3209
01:59:11,119 --> 01:59:14,159
first filter i ran was to look at spf

3210
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:18,719
ips that were associated with aws's ec2

3211
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:20,560
ip address pool used for virtual

3212
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:21,599
machines

3213
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:23,840
i then began running filters against ip

3214
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:27,040
subnets and my first subnet search was

3215
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:29,199
to check for the presence of a subnet

3216
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:31,440
starting with a slash one

3217
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:34,080
and to my surprise i was immediately

3218
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:35,679
smacked in the face with a couple of

3219
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:38,639
organizations that had or authorized

3220
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:41,520
entire slash 16 subnets to send emails

3221
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:43,040
on their behalf

3222
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:45,599
now just sort of recapping a bit um when

3223
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:47,760
we're dealing with spf records you can

3224
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:49,760
list ip addresses that are authorized to

3225
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:52,639
send emails but you can also list entire

3226
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:55,199
ip subnets right now typically you

3227
01:59:55,199 --> 01:59:57,280
should avoid doing this because you know

3228
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:59,040
you want to be certain that you actually

3229
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:01,280
own all the ip addresses that you're

3230
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:03,760
authorizing or you're at least trusting

3231
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:05,520
a third party provider who owns all

3232
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:06,880
those ips

3233
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:08,639
but in this particular case with this

3234
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:11,119
particular queensland city council

3235
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:15,199
had authorized 16 separate 16 subnets

3236
02:00:15,199 --> 02:00:19,280
all located on aws's ec2 ip address pool

3237
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:22,239
now that's over a million ips and it's

3238
02:00:22,239 --> 02:00:25,840
also every single ip that aws reserve

3239
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:29,040
four ec2 instances in its ap southeast 2

3240
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,360
region in sydney australia so

3241
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:33,679
effectively anyone who

3242
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:37,360
um who spun up an ec2 instance in aws's

3243
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:40,239
sydney data centers could send spf

3244
02:00:40,239 --> 02:00:42,239
authenticated emails as though they were

3245
02:00:42,239 --> 02:00:44,080
the city council

3246
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:45,920
so naturally i decided to go and test

3247
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:48,560
this out so i went and spun up an ec2

3248
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:50,719
instance got a random ip and sent an

3249
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:51,760
email

3250
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:53,599
from it posing as this queensland city

3251
02:00:53,599 --> 02:00:54,480
council

3252
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:57,360
to a gmail account that i controlled and

3253
02:00:57,360 --> 02:01:00,320
as suspected the email passed all spf

3254
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:02,000
authentication checks with the email

3255
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,440
going directly to my inbox

3256
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:07,760
now this didn't really sit right with me

3257
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:09,760
you know i mean what city council needs

3258
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:11,599
over a million ip addresses to send

3259
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:14,159
emails um so i sat there for a good

3260
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:15,840
minute or two trying to

3261
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,239
think of a reason why and really there

3262
02:01:18,239 --> 02:01:20,800
isn't any reason right so i instead

3263
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:23,440
shifted a gear and decided to do some

3264
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:26,080
root cause analysis

3265
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:29,119
now remember that that spf records can

3266
02:01:29,119 --> 02:01:32,000
contain lookups to other spf records so

3267
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,159
when analyzing the spf record for this

3268
02:01:34,159 --> 02:01:36,320
city council i found a look up to

3269
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:38,239
another spf record

3270
02:01:38,239 --> 02:01:41,360
for pre dot net dot eu and it was this

3271
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:43,199
domain that was actually introducing all

3272
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:45,040
those aws ips

3273
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:47,280
now again i sat there for a few seconds

3274
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:48,960
and it struck me as a bit odd having

3275
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:51,440
this sub lookup within the spf record i

3276
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:54,159
mean it obviously isn't from a major it

3277
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:56,400
vendor or software as a service provider

3278
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:58,080
or else i probably would have recognized

3279
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:00,000
it but on the surface you know it's

3280
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
seemingly owned by another australian

3281
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,320
organization which might be a smaller

3282
02:02:04,320 --> 02:02:06,480
i.t service provider right

3283
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:08,159
anyway i figured i needed to to dig a

3284
02:02:08,159 --> 02:02:10,080
bit deeper

3285
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:11,760
so naturally the next step was to try

3286
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:15,360
and figure out who owned predomnet.u

3287
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:17,679
so i went and ran the domain through a

3288
02:02:17,679 --> 02:02:19,280
quick who is search

3289
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:21,040
and i was pretty stoked to realize that

3290
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:23,119
the actual owner of the domain wasn't

3291
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:25,520
hidden behind some privacy service so i

3292
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:29,280
got the contact info back and pre.net.u

3293
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:31,440
is owned by an organization called

3294
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:33,920
precedence group so naturally the next

3295
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:35,520
step is to run a good old-fashioned

3296
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:37,040
google search

3297
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:40,000
um and the first results back was the

3298
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,080
precedence group website and at this

3299
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:43,840
point i'm thinking awesome right let's

3300
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:46,400
see how much further we can take this so

3301
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,840
i load up the website and i'm

3302
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:49,920
immediately greeted with the portfolio

3303
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:52,800
page which contained pages and pages of

3304
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,199
customer info i'm talking a ridiculous

3305
02:02:55,199 --> 02:02:58,080
amount of information just on this page

3306
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:01,119
alone there were 225 customer domain

3307
02:03:01,119 --> 02:03:03,920
names just on that page right so i go

3308
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:05,840
ahead i scrape all the customer data out

3309
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:08,080
of that portfolio page i then also

3310
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:09,760
decide to browse around the website and

3311
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:11,360
i notice that precedence group

3312
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:13,599
predominantly do web dev right so i

3313
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:15,040
browse to a couple of their customer

3314
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:17,280
websites and i notice at the bottom of

3315
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:18,880
each page there's a little snippet

3316
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:21,679
saying web design by precedence so i

3317
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:24,080
again go to google run an exact map

3318
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:26,800
search for that particular keyword and

3319
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:29,599
boom i find another 27 customers

3320
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:31,920
and then i found another 77 customers

3321
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:33,760
just through various other searching

3322
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:36,000
techniques so i ultimately landed on a

3323
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,719
list of 329

3324
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:40,560
customer domains that that precedence

3325
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:44,080
group provided it services towards

3326
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:45,760
so naturally i've got a new list of

3327
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:48,000
domains to go and analyze so i go ahead

3328
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,440
and essentially re-perform the same

3329
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,840
steps i did before i re-extract the full

3330
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:53,920
spf supply chain for each domain i check

3331
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:55,760
to see what ips overlap with the

3332
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:58,400
eyepiece provided by aws and azure and

3333
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:00,800
then i get my result

3334
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,800
and i found that precedence group had

3335
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:05,920
injected that same overly permissive spf

3336
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:09,119
lookup into 190 of its customers and i

3337
02:04:09,119 --> 02:04:11,440
was pretty blown away right i mean i i

3338
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:12,639
really couldn't believe it right

3339
02:04:12,639 --> 02:04:14,560
precedence group had customers in just

3340
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:16,480
about every industry that there was

3341
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:18,800
right law firms financial service

3342
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:20,719
providers city councils tourism

3343
02:04:20,719 --> 02:04:22,800
providers construction companies freight

3344
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:25,840
services and and so on right and anyone

3345
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:27,679
with an ec2 instance or a virtual

3346
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:30,880
machine in aws's ap southeast 2 region

3347
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:32,960
could send authenticated emails as

3348
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:34,000
though they were any of these

3349
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,360
organizations

3350
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:37,119
so my next thought was how long has this

3351
02:04:37,119 --> 02:04:39,040
been going on

3352
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:40,880
so i booted up a neat cloud service

3353
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,880
called security trails and i ran a

3354
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:45,360
historical dns lookup and found the the

3355
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:47,920
vulnerable spf record had existed for

3356
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:50,239
just shy of three years

3357
02:04:50,239 --> 02:04:53,280
so pretty long time

3358
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:54,880
now when i began this research i

3359
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:57,119
honestly didn't think i would find many

3360
02:04:57,119 --> 02:04:59,040
organizations where i'd actually be able

3361
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:01,360
to to do an ip takeover attack for their

3362
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:03,520
their spf supply chain it's a bit of a

3363
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:05,280
shot in the dark to to see what came

3364
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:08,159
back so my you know my immediate

3365
02:05:08,159 --> 02:05:10,079
thinking was all right i've just managed

3366
02:05:10,079 --> 02:05:11,760
to find this by scanning a few hundred

3367
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:14,159
domains what if i were to scan every

3368
02:05:14,159 --> 02:05:16,880
domain in australia all right so that's

3369
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:18,560
exactly what i went and did

3370
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:21,280
now scaling from hundreds to millions of

3371
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:24,400
domains is a significantly harder task i

3372
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:26,400
knew i'd have to re-architect the entire

3373
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:28,560
way i'm doing things but i ultimately

3374
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:30,960
decided to tackle each problem one at a

3375
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:33,119
time so so let's go through them

3376
02:05:33,119 --> 02:05:34,800
all right so the first problem how do

3377
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:37,040
you even get a list of all australian

3378
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:39,360
domains to begin with right it sounds

3379
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:41,119
simple but it actually takes a bit of

3380
02:05:41,119 --> 02:05:43,360
research so i ultimately ended up

3381
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:45,199
aggregating the data from about three

3382
02:05:45,199 --> 02:05:46,880
different data sources

3383
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:49,360
first off with github i found this

3384
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:52,320
really handy project called domains

3385
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:54,400
that's maintained by a ukrainian

3386
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:56,159
security researcher

3387
02:05:56,159 --> 02:05:57,360
and this is where i actually got about

3388
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:59,679
95 of the domains i ended up scanning

3389
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:01,679
right i don't know how they collated the

3390
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:02,880
list but

3391
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:05,040
it was pretty comprehensive

3392
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:07,360
next i scoured the asx 200 and grabbed

3393
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,520
all the domain names associated to asx

3394
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:12,719
200 organizations and finally i used

3395
02:06:12,719 --> 02:06:17,520
sublister and i ran a search against dot

3396
02:06:18,599 --> 02:06:20,320
com.u.org.au.net.ou.edu.edu and dot gov

3397
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:22,400
dot eu domains to see what could be

3398
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:24,159
found just through open source

3399
02:06:24,159 --> 02:06:26,239
intelligence i collated all these

3400
02:06:26,239 --> 02:06:28,400
together de-duped them and ultimately

3401
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:31,119
landed on the list of just shy of 2

3402
02:06:31,119 --> 02:06:33,840
million domains

3403
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:36,079
now i had my domain listing

3404
02:06:36,079 --> 02:06:37,760
but i had another issue to get past

3405
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:40,480
right i have to query the dns records of

3406
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:42,400
1.8 million domains

3407
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:45,199
and better yet because i have to query

3408
02:06:45,199 --> 02:06:48,000
um domains or downstream lookups within

3409
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,239
spf records it actually turns out i have

3410
02:06:50,239 --> 02:06:53,840
to do about 10.8 million dns requests

3411
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:56,400
now using my current approach um it

3412
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,719
would take you know about 10 seconds to

3413
02:06:58,719 --> 02:07:01,440
scan a single domain so if we multiply

3414
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:04,400
that by 1.8 million domains that's 18

3415
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,320
million seconds

3416
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:09,360
or 208 days so my current approach to

3417
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:13,839
scanning just isn't going to work right

3418
02:07:14,079 --> 02:07:15,840
um so essentially i put together my

3419
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:17,440
options and i essentially landed on

3420
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:19,360
these three right i could reduce the

3421
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:21,199
amount of time it takes to scan a single

3422
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:23,520
domain i could increase the number of

3423
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:26,320
parallel threads on my workloads or i

3424
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:28,000
could increase the number of workloads

3425
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,800
during the scan right so i took a look

3426
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:32,480
at reducing the amount of time it takes

3427
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:34,639
to perform the scan

3428
02:07:34,639 --> 02:07:36,400
and i realized it's just not technically

3429
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:38,800
feasible right the problem here isn't

3430
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:40,960
necessarily me it's the domain name

3431
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:42,639
servers or the dns servers that i'm

3432
02:07:42,639 --> 02:07:44,639
querying you know they just they take

3433
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:47,119
time to respond back so i just i can't

3434
02:07:47,119 --> 02:07:49,280
really reduce that right

3435
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:51,440
um so secondly you know increasing the

3436
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:53,679
number of parallel threads it would help

3437
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:55,679
a bit but it's not going to make a

3438
02:07:55,679 --> 02:07:57,599
material difference because there's a

3439
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:00,320
hard limit on the number of parallel

3440
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:02,079
processes that there can be it's

3441
02:08:02,079 --> 02:08:04,000
essentially attached to the number of

3442
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
cores within your cpu

3443
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,239
so while it would help it wouldn't help

3444
02:08:08,239 --> 02:08:09,599
by enough

3445
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:11,360
now finally i could increase the number

3446
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:13,840
of workloads and really this is the only

3447
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:15,040
approach that's going to help me

3448
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:16,960
drastically reduce the amount of time to

3449
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:19,599
do a scan across so many domains and i

3450
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:21,599
mean really the only limiting factor

3451
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:24,159
here is how much i'm willing to spend

3452
02:08:24,159 --> 02:08:26,239
so essentially i decided i needed to

3453
02:08:26,239 --> 02:08:28,480
re-architect a solution that would use

3454
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:30,800
more workloads to do the scan and really

3455
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:32,800
the solution would need to meet four

3456
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:35,199
four key criteria um first of all i'd

3457
02:08:35,199 --> 02:08:37,040
need to be able to programmatically

3458
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:38,880
provide an input which includes a list

3459
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:40,480
of domains to scan

3460
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,400
secondly the the workloads would need to

3461
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:44,960
be able to flexibly scale up and down

3462
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:46,639
and that's mainly because you know my

3463
02:08:46,639 --> 02:08:48,480
scan might only take a short amount of

3464
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:49,920
time i don't want to be stuck paying

3465
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:52,159
these workloads for the next year or two

3466
02:08:52,159 --> 02:08:53,520
right

3467
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:55,760
and thirdly um i'd need to be able to

3468
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:58,000
rotate ip addresses to avoid dns

3469
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,920
sinkholing because i'm sending millions

3470
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:02,159
of dns requests

3471
02:09:02,159 --> 02:09:03,840
and finally i'd need to be able to save

3472
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:05,360
these results

3473
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:07,119
to a database that can support high

3474
02:09:07,119 --> 02:09:08,880
input output operations to make sure i

3475
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:11,280
don't run into concurrency issues

3476
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:13,040
so i had a bit of a think about it and i

3477
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:15,119
ultimately decided the best option was

3478
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:18,000
to use lambda functions with a dynamodb

3479
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,239
database to capture the results and the

3480
02:09:20,239 --> 02:09:23,199
best thing by default is that aws lets

3481
02:09:23,199 --> 02:09:24,880
you run up to a thousand lander

3482
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:27,199
functions concurrently so using this

3483
02:09:27,199 --> 02:09:29,040
approach i should be able to

3484
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:33,280
exponentially speed things up

3485
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:34,880
now to prevent me from hitting any rate

3486
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:37,040
limits i decided that the best approach

3487
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:39,679
would be to run 400 concurrent lambda

3488
02:09:39,679 --> 02:09:42,320
functions in five minute intervals uh

3489
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:44,639
with each lambda function scanning 15

3490
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:47,119
domains right so using a bit of a bit of

3491
02:09:47,119 --> 02:09:48,880
mathematics i realized you know i'd be

3492
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:51,119
able to scan about 72 000 domains an

3493
02:09:51,119 --> 02:09:53,920
hour so scanning 1.8 million domains

3494
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:56,000
would take about 25 hours

3495
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,840
now that's a pretty significant drop

3496
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:00,480
from what was 208 days so i was pretty

3497
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:01,760
happy with this

3498
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:03,840
so i put together a script that would

3499
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:05,280
orchestrate the execution of these

3500
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:07,760
lambda functions provided um you know

3501
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:09,599
essentially told the the the script to

3502
02:10:09,599 --> 02:10:11,440
provide each function with 15 domains to

3503
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:12,800
scan

3504
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:14,320
and then within the lambda functions

3505
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:16,000
themselves you know they'd parse the

3506
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,520
input they'd scan each domain

3507
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:19,360
sequentially and then they'd extract the

3508
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:21,360
full spf supply chain and save the

3509
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,840
results to a dynamodb database

3510
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:25,360
so i essentially just let that script

3511
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:27,840
run for the next 25 hours and waited for

3512
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:29,840
the results

3513
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:32,560
now when the scan finished i decided i

3514
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:34,880
needed to filter out some of the noise

3515
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:37,520
so i decided to only look at spf records

3516
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:41,440
where an aws ip existed and i found

3517
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:43,599
about three percent of all domains in

3518
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:46,719
australia had an aws ip address listed

3519
02:10:46,719 --> 02:10:49,679
in their spf record so that's about 67

3520
02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:51,040
000 domains

3521
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:53,199
and each domain on average had about

3522
02:10:53,199 --> 02:10:55,840
five or six aws ips and the majority

3523
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:57,760
were spread across about five aws

3524
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:58,960
regions

3525
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:01,599
now i really wanted to identify as many

3526
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:03,840
low hanging fruit as possible so before

3527
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:06,239
i even tried to eyeball the raw data i

3528
02:11:06,239 --> 02:11:08,320
figured i could troll through some aws

3529
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:11,280
ips to see which ips i could take over

3530
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:13,520
that someone had listed in their spf

3531
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:15,280
record

3532
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:16,880
so i put together a little script that

3533
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:20,000
would cycle through aws ec2 instances

3534
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,520
turning them on and off again every

3535
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:23,520
minute and with each restart i would get

3536
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:27,119
a new aws ip and to do this i spun up 50

3537
02:11:27,119 --> 02:11:30,000
ec2 instances spread across five aws

3538
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,320
regions so about 10 per region and i

3539
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:34,480
figured if i'd let this run for you know

3540
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:36,480
about 20 hours i'd be able to cycle

3541
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:40,400
through 60 000 aws ips which would be a

3542
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:42,320
good enough sample set essentially it's

3543
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:46,079
one in a thousand so 0.1 of

3544
02:11:46,079 --> 02:11:48,960
ip addresses that aws reserve for ec2

3545
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:51,040
instances across the globe

3546
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:53,760
so anyway i let the script run and

3547
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:55,920
whenever an ip address i trolled through

3548
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:57,840
matched an ip address found in someone's

3549
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:01,040
spf record i saved that ip to a csv file

3550
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:04,000
i left the workload running and after 20

3551
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:07,840
hours i had my my low hanging fruits

3552
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:10,159
and i found that through this method i

3553
02:12:10,159 --> 02:12:12,480
had compromised the email supply chain

3554
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:14,800
of an additional 74 australian

3555
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:18,239
organizations including two asx 200

3556
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:20,320
orgs a major state government

3557
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:22,560
corporation university of sydney and

3558
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:25,280
also the australian parliament house

3559
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:26,800
i was a bit surprised in both a good and

3560
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:29,119
a bad way with these results um first of

3561
02:12:29,119 --> 02:12:31,119
all i was surprised i didn't actually

3562
02:12:31,119 --> 02:12:33,679
compromise more organizations

3563
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:35,520
so overall that's a good thing because

3564
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:37,199
it shows that most people are doing the

3565
02:12:37,199 --> 02:12:39,040
right thing they're managing their email

3566
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:41,360
and dns infrastructure quite well but on

3567
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:43,599
the flip side i was also surprised by

3568
02:12:43,599 --> 02:12:44,960
some of the organizations that were

3569
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:47,040
compromised right like some of these

3570
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:49,040
organizations that they're pretty big

3571
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:50,960
they've got dedicated security teams and

3572
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:52,480
i suppose this just sort of slipped

3573
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:54,880
through the cracks

3574
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:56,960
so naturally my next step was figuring

3575
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:58,639
out how to notify the affected

3576
02:12:58,639 --> 02:13:01,119
organizations and think thankfully we've

3577
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:03,679
got the australian cyber security center

3578
02:13:03,679 --> 02:13:05,520
i reached out to them within about an

3579
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:07,119
hour i got a confirmation back that they

3580
02:13:07,119 --> 02:13:08,960
were looking into it and within a few

3581
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:10,960
days i saw organizations have begun

3582
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:12,400
applying the fix

3583
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:14,320
now this is where acsc is pretty handy

3584
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:16,639
right because me as a loan security

3585
02:13:16,639 --> 02:13:18,560
researcher i don't really have much sway

3586
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:21,119
with these organizations they may ignore

3587
02:13:21,119 --> 02:13:23,599
me they may threaten legal action or

3588
02:13:23,599 --> 02:13:25,119
whatever it be right but getting a

3589
02:13:25,119 --> 02:13:27,520
notification from acsc a lot of orgs

3590
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:30,800
begin to take it pretty seriously

3591
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:33,360
now look a lot of you are probably uh

3592
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:35,119
wondering right how can you perce how

3593
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:36,639
can you protect yourself against these

3594
02:13:36,639 --> 02:13:38,800
types of attacks and the short and

3595
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:41,199
simple answer to that is to simply

3596
02:13:41,199 --> 02:13:43,679
review your spf record and understand

3597
02:13:43,679 --> 02:13:45,760
your spf supply chain

3598
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:47,920
look at any downstream lookups embedded

3599
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:50,079
within your spf understand who owns

3600
02:13:50,079 --> 02:13:52,079
those ips and whether they're part of a

3601
02:13:52,079 --> 02:13:54,400
shared ip pool that another customer may

3602
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:56,159
have access to

3603
02:13:56,159 --> 02:13:58,480
now to assist with that i have created a

3604
02:13:58,480 --> 02:14:00,719
free tool it's accessible at the link on

3605
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:02,880
screen and what that tool will do is

3606
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:04,960
essentially it will query recursively

3607
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:07,679
query spf records downstream lookups it

3608
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:10,000
will present you with your full spf

3609
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
supply chain tell you where those ips

3610
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,520
are located who owns them and what

3611
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:16,480
they're associated to

3612
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:18,639
look aside from that

3613
02:14:18,639 --> 02:14:20,480
doing this security research was a

3614
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:22,159
pretty fun exercise

3615
02:14:22,159 --> 02:14:24,840
i scoped things purely to australian

3616
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:27,440
domains now i'm almost certain on a

3617
02:14:27,440 --> 02:14:30,000
global scale there's likely

3618
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,679
thousands or even tens of thousands of

3619
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:33,199
domains which are still vulnerable to

3620
02:14:33,199 --> 02:14:35,760
this type of spf supply chain attack but

3621
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:37,679
from a research standpoint i've done

3622
02:14:37,679 --> 02:14:39,679
what i wanted to do so i'll leave it in

3623
02:14:39,679 --> 02:14:41,280
the hands of other researchers if they

3624
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:44,320
want to pick up where i left off

3625
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:45,840
otherwise that's all

3626
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:48,159
thanks everyone

3627
02:14:48,159 --> 02:14:50,320
i think the scary thing about that is

3628
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:51,440
the fact that

3629
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:52,960
sorry ignored zero in the background the

3630
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:54,719
very thing is that it was obviously in

3631
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:57,199
the news recently that acsc had

3632
02:14:57,199 --> 02:14:59,760
implemented sorry aph had implemented

3633
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:01,760
dmarc you know it's a great thing to say

3634
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:03,280
you've implemented it have you actually

3635
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:05,280
implemented it properly

3636
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:08,159
uh it's probably a difficult issue yeah

3637
02:15:08,159 --> 02:15:08,960
yeah

3638
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:10,239
definitely definitely i thought it was

3639
02:15:10,239 --> 02:15:11,679
pretty funny as well because it was it

3640
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:13,520
was about two weeks after my blog post

3641
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:15,440
came out that uh

3642
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:17,440
um that other

3643
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:19,760
news article came up on it news

3644
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:22,760
coincidence

3645
02:15:24,079 --> 02:15:26,400
so i guess um

3646
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:29,440
having the acsc there is a buffer to the

3647
02:15:29,440 --> 02:15:30,560
because i know that there's a lot of

3648
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:32,480
people who come back with you know

3649
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:34,560
threatening security researchers if they

3650
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:36,639
say certain things the example in the

3651
02:15:36,639 --> 02:15:39,360
u.s of and we all know this is bs right

3652
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:40,960
but the person who

3653
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:43,920
read the source code of a html page and

3654
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:46,320
got all of the details for a bunch of

3655
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:47,360
teachers

3656
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:49,280
and then got threatened with legal

3657
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:50,480
action

3658
02:15:50,480 --> 02:15:51,920
um i guess it's a good thing in that

3659
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:54,239
case that things like the acsc or cert

3660
02:15:54,239 --> 02:15:56,400
and those groups exist for people to be

3661
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:58,639
able to submit these issues too

3662
02:15:58,639 --> 02:16:01,760
even uh you know groups like dare i say

3663
02:16:01,760 --> 02:16:02,480
it

3664
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:04,639
hacker one and um

3665
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:07,199
a bug crowd to be able to submit these

3666
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:09,040
bugs to and be able to get someone to

3667
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:11,760
sit as a buffer between you

3668
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:13,760
yeah yeah definitely i mean it was

3669
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:16,239
something i i heavily considered myself

3670
02:16:16,239 --> 02:16:18,480
i was a bit worried but i

3671
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:21,119
i realized if i included acsc into the

3672
02:16:21,119 --> 02:16:23,040
process and sort of let them lead the

3673
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:25,840
notification process it adds like a

3674
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:28,320
a layer of professionalism that you can

3675
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:30,320
sort of hide behind as a security

3676
02:16:30,320 --> 02:16:32,638
researcher so sure they can probably

3677
02:16:32,638 --> 02:16:34,799
still pursue you but

3678
02:16:34,799 --> 02:16:36,718
you know the news is already out there

3679
02:16:36,718 --> 02:16:39,599
the gain for legally pursuing you as a

3680
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:41,920
security researcher isn't really there

3681
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:43,599
because typically they would want to

3682
02:16:43,599 --> 02:16:45,599
threaten you before the blog came out

3683
02:16:45,599 --> 02:16:47,599
not after

3684
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:50,080
so yeah yeah and a shout out to everyone

3685
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:51,519
and i know there's a few people from the

3686
02:16:51,519 --> 02:16:54,478
acsc and asd who are on here um we won't

3687
02:16:54,478 --> 02:16:56,558
make jokes about red spice although he

3688
02:16:56,558 --> 02:16:58,160
who controls the splice controls the

3689
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:01,040
universe um but uh

3690
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:02,638
they do a good job and i've worked with

3691
02:17:02,638 --> 02:17:04,959
them before so i know they get a lot of

3692
02:17:04,959 --> 02:17:06,638
um they get a lot of useful stuff they

3693
02:17:06,638 --> 02:17:08,318
also get a lot of garbage as well so

3694
02:17:08,318 --> 02:17:09,359
it's good that they're still doing

3695
02:17:09,359 --> 02:17:12,398
something with the good stuff as well

3696
02:17:12,398 --> 02:17:13,599
definitely

3697
02:17:13,599 --> 02:17:15,679
um so thank you very much seb that was

3698
02:17:15,679 --> 02:17:17,920
an amazing talk and i'm slightly scared

3699
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:19,599
by the fact that people

3700
02:17:19,599 --> 02:17:21,359
uh are now probably going to go and

3701
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:23,200
check all their dns records i know i'm

3702
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:24,478
probably going to go check some of my

3703
02:17:24,478 --> 02:17:27,120
dns records as i said yesterday comfycon

3704
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:28,558
doesn't have spf

3705
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:31,040
dkim or d mark for comfy con um you're

3706
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:32,240
still not getting any money and if

3707
02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:33,679
somebody pretends to be comfy con it

3708
02:17:33,679 --> 02:17:35,359
won't work anyway because

3709
02:17:35,359 --> 02:17:37,519
people just come talk to me anyway

3710
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:38,718
so um

3711
02:17:38,718 --> 02:17:40,080
yeah no thanks very much for the talk

3712
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:42,160
said that was absolutely fantastic

3713
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:43,840
perfect thank you thank you for having

3714
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:45,599
me

3715
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:46,799
no worries

3716
02:17:46,799 --> 02:17:48,398
so i think we have to waste three

3717
02:17:48,398 --> 02:17:50,240
minutes before alan starts speaking

3718
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:51,679
because i know there's a lot of people

3719
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:54,160
who are joining just to see alan speak

3720
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:56,959
as he is such an international star um i

3721
02:17:56,959 --> 02:17:59,200
have been seeing a lot of years

3722
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:00,799
i have been seeing a lot of posts from

3723
02:18:00,799 --> 02:18:03,359
some very significant people um talking

3724
02:18:03,359 --> 02:18:05,280
about alan so i'm very happy to

3725
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:07,439
obviously have him alan is someone who

3726
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:09,760
we've had three times now and despite

3727
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:11,760
the fact that we severely disagree in a

3728
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:13,439
lot of things we still keep inviting him

3729
02:18:13,439 --> 02:18:14,478
back

3730
02:18:14,478 --> 02:18:15,760
but um

3731
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:17,920
he still hasn't made keynote though he

3732
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:20,240
still hasn't made kino but nor has um

3733
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:22,718
lewis either so um

3734
02:18:22,718 --> 02:18:24,879
neither of them have made keynote uh

3735
02:18:24,879 --> 02:18:26,718
they cannot

3736
02:18:26,718 --> 02:18:29,519
yeah i think the key knot is probably a

3737
02:18:29,519 --> 02:18:31,359
good spot and

3738
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:33,359
you know maybe is where he'll stay

3739
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:35,359
no no we love our time

3740
02:18:35,359 --> 02:18:38,080
we'll see how he stands with chicken and

3741
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:39,760
nuggies and tendees

3742
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:41,040
so just a reminder for everyone we're

3743
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:42,398
gonna have an afternoon tea break after

3744
02:18:42,398 --> 02:18:44,240
this but this afternoon we've got ben

3745

02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,679
talks um

3750
02:18:55,679 --> 02:18:57,760
i think the phrase used earlier was may

3751
02:18:57,760 --> 02:19:00,080
contain some cyber content because at

3752
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:02,160
the moment we seem to be focusing less

3753
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:03,920
on cyber and more and other things which

3754
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:06,240
you know personally i have no issue with

3755
02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:08,478
um

3756
02:19:08,478 --> 02:19:10,959

3764
02:19:26,558 --> 02:19:29,040
alan into the chat so he can get set up

3765
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:32,800

first comfy con gave a presentation

3777
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:58,000
using excel and i think we believe him

3778
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,840
to do the same thing this time

3779
02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:05,040

3817
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:24,399
so all right let's let's jump into it so

3818
02:21:24,399 --> 02:21:25,840
um

3819
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:28,000
this talk is basically about processes

3820
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,120
and and

3821
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:30,800
we've had a lot of talks over the last

3822
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:33,120
couple of days about them and usually i

3823
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:36,240
go to conferences um and i'm kind of

3824
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:37,520
talking

3825
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:39,439
about stuff that you know everyone else

3826
02:21:39,439 --> 02:21:40,640
at the conference is talking about

3827
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:42,319
different controls and and what's

3828
02:21:42,319 --> 02:21:43,600
happening

3829
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:45,600
these days and i'm talking about the

3830
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:47,760
future and it's quite

3831
02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:48,960
um

3832
02:21:48,960 --> 02:21:50,319
it's quite a pleasant surprise to

3833
02:21:50,319 --> 02:21:52,240
actually be part of a conference where

3834
02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:54,319
um i'm kind of talking about the same

3835
02:21:54,319 --> 02:21:55,760
stuff that the other

3836
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:57,359
uh the other participants are talking

3837
02:21:57,359 --> 02:21:59,120
about so i just wanted to start with

3838
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:00,800
this quote i'm not going to tell you who

3839
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:03,280
says it because i'm sure someone in the

3840
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:05,040
chat will be able to work it out if not

3841
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:07,600
everyone in the chat uh so things happen

3842
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:09,439
and anything that happens happens

3843
02:22:09,439 --> 02:22:11,040
anything that in happening causes

3844
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:12,399
something else to happen causes

3845
02:22:12,399 --> 02:22:14,640
something else to happen anything that

3846
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:17,120
in happening causes itself to happen

3847
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:18,399
happens again

3848
02:22:18,399 --> 02:22:20,479
and it doesn't necessarily do it in

3849
02:22:20,479 --> 02:22:23,600
chronological order though

3850
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:25,439
so we'll see if someone picks that up

3851
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:26,800
and

3852
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:30,080
and gets that so yeah as discussed um a

3853
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:32,640
couple of years back at the first comfy

3854
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:35,120
con i decided to do a talk

3855
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:38,240
about how used spreadsheets to to solve

3856
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:40,479
issues

3857
02:22:40,479 --> 02:22:44,080
and it was quite popular and as ian said

3858
02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:46,000
i was bullied into

3859
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,399
doing this talk again

3860
02:22:48,399 --> 02:22:50,560
in a in excel hopefully a little bit

3861
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:53,439
different so here we go uh deep dive

3862
02:22:53,439 --> 02:22:55,520
into winning infosec using stickiness

3863
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:57,280
and oiliness

3864
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:01,120
it's the comfy con au 2022

3865
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:04,120
keynote

3866
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:08,399
okay so i've already had a bit of a

3867
02:23:08,399 --> 02:23:11,200
introduction which is good enough um

3868
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:14,720
i am a manager level consultant in the

3869
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:17,120
grc practice at cyber cx and that's the

3870
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:18,880
only time i will mention my company's

3871
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:20,640
name

3872
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:22,880
if you are trustworthy trusting you can

3873
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:26,399
scan this and it won't take you to

3874
02:23:26,399 --> 02:23:28,240
anything to

3875
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:30,080
do with any music videos or anything

3876
02:23:30,080 --> 02:23:32,479
that's my my linkedin address it took me

3877
02:23:32,479 --> 02:23:34,080
quite a bit of time to get this right

3878
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:36,960
and it actually works i tested it

3879
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:38,800
um but i'll show it a bit later let's

3880
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:41,120
jump into the thing so one of the things

3881
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:43,920
that um

3882
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:47,680
that i wanted to talk about um is

3883
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:49,760
coming from the 40 000 foot view the

3884
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:51,280
kind of like let's look at the entire

3885
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:52,560
planet view

3886
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:54,720
um this is a term that i've that i've

3887
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:58,479
kind of coined bizsec um and yeah as per

3888
02:23:58,479 --> 02:24:01,040
mean girls i'm trying to make it happen

3889
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:02,720
uh because in

3890
02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:04,399
information security we don't really

3891
02:24:04,399 --> 02:24:06,080
seem to have a term that is more broad

3892
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:07,439
than grc

3893
02:24:07,439 --> 02:24:09,840
uh or devsecops or resilience they're

3894
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:12,319
all terms that i've come across of how

3895
02:24:12,319 --> 02:24:14,960
people are trying to get business

3896
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:17,760
thinking to uh to basically bring

3897
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:20,800
security into the business and make it

3898
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:23,200
um an essential part of the business so

3899
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:25,200
this is my term feel free to use it to

3900
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:27,280
use it whatever if you want to attribute

3901
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:30,560
it you can if you don't don't worry

3902
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:32,880
so that's the sex so part of what uh

3903
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:34,160
what i was

3904
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:36,399
came up with uh for a previous talk that

3905
02:24:36,399 --> 02:24:37,439
i did

3906
02:24:37,439 --> 02:24:39,439
um which i actually

3907
02:24:39,439 --> 02:24:42,479
created for comfy con 21 which never

3908
02:24:42,479 --> 02:24:45,520
quite happened um and then just uh

3909
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:47,280
presented it at

3910
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:49,840
the acer conference is i came up with

3911
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:52,319
what i call the more essential essential

3912
02:24:52,319 --> 02:24:54,319
eight so the essential atar are good

3913
02:24:54,319 --> 02:24:56,479
controls got no problem with them but

3914
02:24:56,479 --> 02:24:58,240
they're very technical and yeah there

3915
02:24:58,240 --> 02:25:00,640
are controls

3916
02:25:00,640 --> 02:25:02,960
um this is more this is this is business

3917
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:06,160
um so what i came up with with these

3918
02:25:06,160 --> 02:25:07,840
different things that i expect that

3919
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:09,840
organizations should do

3920
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:12,080
number one do everything risk is not

3921
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:13,760
your friend that's the one that ian

3922
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:15,600
would probably have a big problem with

3923
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:17,520
uh blink and lights plan your dive dive

3924
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:18,880
your plan people are people use the

3925
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:20,399
walkie-talkie to look good and

3926
02:25:20,399 --> 02:25:22,240
stickiness and oiliness and then grow up

3927
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:24,160
and don't grab number seven stickiness

3928
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:25,680
and oiliness is the one that i want to

3929
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:27,920
concentrate in this talk

3930
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:29,439
because the original talk i just went

3931
02:25:29,439 --> 02:25:31,760
through all of them at a very high level

3932
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:34,479
and was always aiming to put together

3933
02:25:34,479 --> 02:25:36,560
more content about each one

3934
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:39,359
and today is that and i think stickiness

3935
02:25:39,359 --> 02:25:42,000
and oiliness is is the one that i felt

3936
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,080
most excited about so

3937
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:46,080
um that's the one that i wanted to cover

3938
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:47,520
today so that a little bit of

3939
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:49,040
introduction as to where we're coming

3940
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:49,920
from

3941
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:52,560
so why is thickness high oiliness so the

3942
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:54,560
idea is and this comes from a t-shirt

3943
02:25:54,560 --> 02:25:57,040
it's a kind of joke that says basically

3944
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:59,200
the whole point of of like a bindings is

3945
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:00,720
is a bit of a waste of time you need

3946
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:03,040
only two things inner bunnings uh

3947
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:04,399
essentially oil

3948
02:26:04,399 --> 02:26:07,120
and duct tape and you can basically fix

3949
02:26:07,120 --> 02:26:09,920
anything if you have oils and duct tape

3950
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:12,000
so the idea being and i'll show you this

3951
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:12,880
little

3952
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:14,160
um

3953
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:17,120
way of working things out

3954
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:20,080
um so the question uh that you might

3955
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:21,680
have is

3956
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:24,160
uh is something supposed to be moving so

3957
02:26:24,160 --> 02:26:25,840
anything at your house is it supposed to

3958
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:27,840
be moving and

3959
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:29,439
if the answer is yes and the question

3960
02:26:29,439 --> 02:26:31,439
then is is it moving and if the quest if

3961
02:26:31,439 --> 02:26:32,880
the answer is yes then you have no

3962
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:35,120
problems so that's basically anything at

3963
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:36,160
your house

3964
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:39,600
now if you have uh the opposite so you

3965
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:41,439
have

3966
02:26:41,439 --> 02:26:43,359
uh something supposed to be moving and

3967
02:26:43,359 --> 02:26:45,200
it's no and it's not moving well then

3968
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:46,960
you still have no problem it's fixed and

3969
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:49,280
it's supposed to be where it is

3970
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:50,960
where you have issues is when they don't

3971
02:26:50,960 --> 02:26:52,560
line up and if something is supposed to

3972
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:54,080
be moving it's not moving you need to

3973
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:56,240
put some oil and if something is

3974
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:57,840
supposed to be

3975
02:26:57,840 --> 02:27:00,160
not moving and it is moving

3976
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:01,920
then you hold it in place with duct tape

3977
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:04,399
and that's pretty much how you can solve

3978
02:27:04,399 --> 02:27:07,040
anything that you need to

3979
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:09,120
um just out of interest the font that

3980
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:12,000
i'm using for this slide is called uh

3981
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,800
comic serif and i used it just because

3982
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:16,720
it exists and i love that idea that

3983
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:19,920
there is a comic serif

3984
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:23,280
okay so what you might be wondering okay

3985
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:25,760
well that's all kind and well but um

3986
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:26,960
basically

3987
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:28,000
what

3988
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
does that mean like how do we apply that

3989
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:31,840
in information security so i'll go back

3990
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:33,680
to slide number five and you'll have a

3991
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:35,600
look at the t-shirt now says i can fix

3992
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:37,200
anything with standards

3993
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:40,160
and processes

3994
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:43,359
and

3995
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:46,240
the thing is that that standards are

3996
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:48,720
usually very easy to

3997
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:51,840
uh to get right um we've basically built

3998
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:54,240
an entire industry all around it

3999
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:58,319
um and it's if you look at kind of any

4000
02:27:58,319 --> 02:28:00,080
organization that's out there they're

4001
02:28:00,080 --> 02:28:02,319
selling you a standard or a control or

4002
02:28:02,319 --> 02:28:04,080
something that will stop things from

4003
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:05,280
happening

4004
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:08,560
um you know firewalls antivirus even

4005
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:12,479
stuff like allow listing etc etc etc

4006
02:28:12,479 --> 02:28:13,840
um

4007
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:16,720
and uh the problem that i find and i

4008
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:18,880
think a lot of what the other talks have

4009
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:21,040
been around which is why i was very

4010
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:23,280
excited to to listen to them and see

4011
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:26,960
them um is that processes are where

4012
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:29,600
things get a little bit more difficult

4013
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:32,479
things are just not done very well

4014
02:28:32,479 --> 02:28:35,120
and where i apply this is kind of in the

4015
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:38,479
same sort of concept here where uh you

4016
02:28:38,479 --> 02:28:40,560
have is something supposed to be moving

4017
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:43,040
is there a process is it happening good

4018
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:44,960
if it's happening it's it's fine that's

4019
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:46,399
okay it's working

4020
02:28:46,399 --> 02:28:47,280
um

4021
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:48,160
if

4022
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:50,880
it's not working or if there's a cause

4023
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:54,000
that that may cause it to stop working

4024
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:55,760
and ransomware is a very good example of

4025
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:57,840
this you know ransomware comes in it

4026
02:28:57,840 --> 02:29:00,000
stops processes from happening how do we

4027
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,359
sort that out

4028
02:29:01,359 --> 02:29:03,280
um that's where all of a sudden we need

4029
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:05,439
to to get involved and to make sure that

4030
02:29:05,439 --> 02:29:07,520
the processes are happening what we

4031
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:09,120
shouldn't be doing is putting in more

4032
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:10,880
controls because that's not working

4033
02:29:10,880 --> 02:29:12,240
that's like putting duct tape on

4034
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:13,840
something

4035
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:15,760
that should be moving

4036
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:17,520
we need to work with with specific

4037
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:20,080
controls

4038
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:23,840
so

4039
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:26,000
uh

4040
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:29,040
let's start at the very beginning um

4041
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:32,080
so i i like to learn uh from my other

4042
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:34,800
industries ours is a very young industry

4043
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:38,080
um i'm i'm older than our industry in

4044
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:39,680
fact i've been kind of working in our

4045
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:41,840
industry from for you know since before

4046
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:44,319
it was even defined as an industry

4047
02:29:44,319 --> 02:29:47,040
um and there are some very old ones like

4048
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:49,120
uh accounting has been around for for

4049
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:50,640
many many years

4050
02:29:50,640 --> 02:29:51,920
um

4051
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:54,000
manufacturing has been around for for

4052
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,240
for many kind of thousands of years and

4053
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:57,600
stuff and we can learn from these

4054
02:29:57,600 --> 02:30:00,800
different industries um but because we

4055
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:03,040
kind of align ourselves with it and i t

4056
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:05,840
people seem to you know just know

4057
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:07,359
that they're the best and and don't

4058
02:30:07,359 --> 02:30:10,319
really look elsewhere um it's taken

4059
02:30:10,319 --> 02:30:12,720
quite a while for for for even just it

4060
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:14,640
to actually adopt all the learnings that

4061
02:30:14,640 --> 02:30:16,560
there can be the design learnings and

4062
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:17,359
the

4063
02:30:17,359 --> 02:30:20,319
process learnings and

4064
02:30:20,319 --> 02:30:23,200
stuff like lean agile devops these were

4065
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:25,200
all concepts that

4066
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:27,280
the manufacturing

4067
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:31,000
organizations came up with in the 19

4068
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:34,800
1950s and 1960s already um it's it's

4069
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:37,120
stuff that that's been around for for

4070
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:38,720
pretty much forever

4071
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:39,600
um

4072
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:41,200
and

4073
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:43,439
it's it's ways that we can we can learn

4074
02:30:43,439 --> 02:30:45,760
and and ways that we can

4075
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:48,160
use to to define what kind of processes

4076
02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:50,720
we we should uh we should be using

4077
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:52,800
so let's start with um basically this

4078
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:54,960
this picture here which is a picture of

4079
02:30:54,960 --> 02:30:56,080
um

4080
02:30:56,080 --> 02:30:58,319
something called a desire path so desire

4081
02:30:58,319 --> 02:31:02,479
path is where you have for example grass

4082
02:31:02,479 --> 02:31:04,160
and people have just walked along the

4083
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:05,680
grass and eventually the grass stops

4084
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:07,120
growing there and you can actually see a

4085
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:09,760
path that's that's kind of come along

4086
02:31:09,760 --> 02:31:12,479
it's not designed it wasn't supposed to

4087
02:31:12,479 --> 02:31:13,680
be like that and if you have a look at

4088
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:15,520
this there is a design the design is

4089
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:16,880
that you should stick to the path and

4090
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:18,880
you should go around the corner

4091
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:20,800
um but obviously nobody does that

4092
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:22,479
because you can cut a little bit of time

4093
02:31:22,479 --> 02:31:26,000
off of your day just by walking through

4094
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,160
through the park so i guess the question

4095
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:29,680
i mean some people might look at this

4096
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:31,200
and say that's terrible you're killing

4097
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:32,640
the grass

4098
02:31:32,640 --> 02:31:34,160
others might say okay well then why

4099
02:31:34,160 --> 02:31:35,760
didn't they just put the path there in

4100
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:37,439
the first place um

4101
02:31:37,439 --> 02:31:39,439
so there's different ways that you could

4102
02:31:39,439 --> 02:31:43,200
approach this but the idea being is that

4103
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:45,280
um people are going to do whatever it

4104
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:47,280
takes to get whatever they need to do

4105
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:49,200
done um and that's especially true in

4106
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:51,359
business and that is something that

4107
02:31:51,359 --> 02:31:53,040
information security

4108
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:56,640
keeps bumping up against because

4109
02:31:56,640 --> 02:31:59,040
you are always going to have controls in

4110
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:00,640
place and you are always going to need

4111
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:02,880
people to respect them but at the same

4112
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:05,280
time people need to be able to do their

4113
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:06,240
work

4114
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:08,240
and by putting

4115
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:10,560
by putting designs in people may or may

4116
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:12,960
not accept them and if they don't

4117
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:17,600
um accept them then basically um

4118
02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:20,960
you you you gonna be um

4119
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:23,280
ignored totally this is this is a slide

4120
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:25,439
that that basically every

4121
02:32:25,439 --> 02:32:27,920
um information security

4122
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:30,000
organization used to have i've seen it

4123
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,840
so many times it's almost become like a

4124
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:32,880
cliche

4125
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:35,439
the the irony is that in most cases the

4126
02:32:35,439 --> 02:32:37,120
organizations that were showing this

4127
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:39,280
we're like hey this control is so very

4128
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:42,000
stupid um people go straight around it

4129
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:43,359
um if you can't really see what's going

4130
02:32:43,359 --> 02:32:44,560
on there there's like a little pole in

4131
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:47,439
the middle which is uh to stop you from

4132
02:32:47,439 --> 02:32:49,120
driving down that road but people just

4133
02:32:49,120 --> 02:32:50,640
drive around it

4134
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:51,680
and

4135
02:32:51,680 --> 02:32:53,760
the

4136
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:57,280
irony behind it all is that the

4137
02:32:57,280 --> 02:32:58,880
usually the people that were showing the

4138
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:01,680
the slides uh to me were were coming up

4139
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:03,840
with us with a separate control and the

4140
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,840
whole idea being that like in five years

4141
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:07,840
time someone is going to bring up this

4142
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:09,520
exact same slide with the previous

4143
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:11,359
person's control and say hey everyone's

4144
02:33:11,359 --> 02:33:13,280
going around this control

4145
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:15,760
people will go around it if you don't

4146
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:17,520
let them know exactly why they're doing

4147
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:18,720
something

4148
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:20,800
and make it easy for them to build that

4149
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:22,479
into their day-to-day

4150
02:33:22,479 --> 02:33:23,680
um

4151
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:27,680
it will just it'll just be ignored

4152
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:29,200
um

4153
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:31,200
the other thing to look at is is

4154
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:33,680
something called a norman door

4155
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:36,240
so a norman door is basically defined as

4156
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:37,120
a door

4157
02:33:37,120 --> 02:33:39,600
that is just not logical to to open

4158
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:41,439
which is quite crazy if you think about

4159
02:33:41,439 --> 02:33:43,439
it because the door literally serves one

4160
02:33:43,439 --> 02:33:46,720
specific purpose and that is to

4161
02:33:46,720 --> 02:33:48,720
block off rooms and you can get from one

4162
02:33:48,720 --> 02:33:51,040
room to the other um and if you have to

4163
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:52,720
read something to be able to work out

4164
02:33:52,720 --> 02:33:55,520
how a door works um it's not your

4165
02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:58,640
problem it's the door's problem

4166
02:33:58,640 --> 02:34:01,200
um and i'm referring to doors that have

4167
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:03,680
like the word push written on them why

4168
02:34:03,680 --> 02:34:05,680
would you even need to tell someone to

4169
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:08,160
push a door just have a handle that

4170
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:09,920
basically tells someone

4171
02:34:09,920 --> 02:34:12,479
you know this is how you work this door

4172
02:34:12,479 --> 02:34:14,319
uh if you have a door that's supposed to

4173
02:34:14,319 --> 02:34:16,560
be pushed have a flat panel on it where

4174
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:18,240
people can push

4175
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:20,640
don't have a handle that looks like you

4176
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:22,640
should be pulling the door because it's

4177
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:25,040
giving the person the wrong idea um the

4178
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:26,880
reason why i bring this up is is a lot

4179
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:27,600
of

4180
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:30,720
information security we rely on

4181
02:34:30,720 --> 02:34:33,280
um we are allowing awareness and we rely

4182
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:35,920
on training uh to to be able to to tell

4183
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:36,800
people

4184
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:39,040
what they should and shouldn't be doing

4185
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:40,080
and

4186
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:42,240
it's it's

4187
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:44,720
in most cases a bad

4188
02:34:44,720 --> 02:34:46,399
waste of their time

4189
02:34:46,399 --> 02:34:47,760
if you want them to make a strong

4190
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:50,080
password put controls in place that will

4191
02:34:50,080 --> 02:34:52,399
guide them towards having a strong

4192
02:34:52,399 --> 02:34:54,240
password if you don't want them to write

4193
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:56,399
down stuff tell them why they shouldn't

4194
02:34:56,399 --> 02:34:58,000
be writing down their passwords give

4195
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:59,920
them a password manager make their life

4196
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:02,080
easier um

4197
02:35:02,080 --> 02:35:03,600
and yeah

4198
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:05,840
make sure that they don't export stuff

4199
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:08,160
out of the password manager because that

4200
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:10,640
that itself is is a failure in the

4201
02:35:10,640 --> 02:35:12,399
process

4202
02:35:12,399 --> 02:35:14,640
um

4203
02:35:14,720 --> 02:35:16,640
another thing i've got a quote here from

4204
02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:18,960
from larry wall uh easy things should be

4205
02:35:18,960 --> 02:35:20,800
easy and hard things should be possible

4206
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:23,600
so larry wall is is the creator of pearl

4207
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:26,560
um and

4208
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:28,720
whatever your thoughts on pill it it

4209
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:30,640
really did change the world

4210
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:32,160
um and

4211
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:34,000
what i what i like about this is he's

4212
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,680
kind of thinking how people actually

4213
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:36,479
work

4214
02:35:36,479 --> 02:35:39,680
um now i was i was talking to um

4215
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:42,399
to a guy called wolf gurler who's also

4216
02:35:42,399 --> 02:35:44,560
looking at this kind of stuff looking at

4217
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:47,920
how pro um how design influences things

4218
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:49,200
and how we can bring that into

4219
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:51,200
information security and one of the

4220
02:35:51,200 --> 02:35:52,640
things that that we were kind of

4221
02:35:52,640 --> 02:35:54,960
thinking about is the idea of having

4222
02:35:54,960 --> 02:35:57,359
processes good processes and bad

4223
02:35:57,359 --> 02:35:59,920
processes like a good process is is

4224
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:01,680
someone does a piece of work and that

4225
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:03,359
brings value to the business a bad

4226
02:36:03,359 --> 02:36:05,439
process is someone breaks into the

4227
02:36:05,439 --> 02:36:08,240
business and hijacks that process to to

4228
02:36:08,240 --> 02:36:11,200
do something bad with um and if you can

4229
02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:13,280
work out what those different things

4230
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:16,640
look like and they're not the same

4231
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:18,319
and then work out how do you make the

4232
02:36:18,319 --> 02:36:20,479
good process work better and the bad

4233
02:36:20,479 --> 02:36:23,120
process work um

4234
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:25,120
more difficult uh be more difficult to

4235
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:27,680
actually achieve

4236
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:30,800
um so yeah some ideas here that if you

4237
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:32,640
if you're busy working with programmers

4238
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:34,000
uh telling them

4239
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:35,760
that that's there their

4240
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:37,120
issue that there's issues with their

4241
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:39,040
codes as they're writing it

4242
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:40,800
uh kind of like a spell check is a good

4243
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:42,640
way for doing things but blocking them

4244
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:43,439
while

4245
02:36:43,439 --> 02:36:45,359
you know after they've done coding

4246
02:36:45,359 --> 02:36:48,640
um and are like 12 like at the 11th hour

4247
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:50,800
just trying to get their code in that's

4248
02:36:50,800 --> 02:36:52,800
not a very good time to be telling to

4249
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:54,399
someone hang on a sec you've got some

4250
02:36:54,399 --> 02:36:56,160
issues

4251
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:57,840
telling people not to click on links in

4252
02:36:57,840 --> 02:37:00,000
email because like literally half of

4253
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:03,120
what email is is to send links to people

4254
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:04,800
so that they can click on it and carry

4255
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:06,319
on with their job

4256
02:37:06,319 --> 02:37:08,319
how do we get around that there are ways

4257
02:37:08,319 --> 02:37:09,439
um

4258
02:37:09,439 --> 02:37:12,000
but uh you've got to make it difficult

4259
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,240
for attackers to use fishing uh make

4260
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:16,399
sure that that if someone is successful

4261
02:37:16,399 --> 02:37:18,160
with a phishing attack it doesn't lead

4262
02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:20,240
to too much so mfa could help you out

4263
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:22,000
with that

4264
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,800
make make it easy for people to report

4265
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:27,200
into you when when they have been caught

4266
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:30,319
by a phishing email

4267
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:34,960
so yeah um

4268
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:41,040
that process leads to bad design um

4269
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:43,280
so from all of these kind of things if

4270
02:37:43,280 --> 02:37:45,840
you have bad design have bad processes

4271
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:47,040
in place

4272
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:49,200
you will end up with with some security

4273
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:50,640
failures

4274
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:53,040
and yes most of it is humans being

4275
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:56,800
humans uh so we had um some talks

4276
02:37:56,800 --> 02:37:59,520
already that discussed this even um and

4277
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:01,280
the one that i was impressed with was

4278
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:03,439
was the one discussing how the internal

4279
02:38:03,439 --> 02:38:07,040
threat of of uh you know humans

4280
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:08,800
uh like good people doing the wrong

4281
02:38:08,800 --> 02:38:10,800
thing just because of who they are and

4282
02:38:10,800 --> 02:38:12,399
and how they work

4283
02:38:12,399 --> 02:38:15,040
um and people being nervous that their

4284
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:16,960
work won't be available at the time when

4285
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:18,720
they need to send it through it's a real

4286
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:20,399
human uh fear

4287
02:38:20,399 --> 02:38:24,160
um and it needs to be addressed um

4288
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:25,680
uh some other things for example

4289
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:27,600
whack-a-mole so basically information

4290
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:29,120
security getting involved in all the

4291
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:30,720
little bits and pieces don't do that

4292
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:31,439
just

4293
02:38:31,439 --> 02:38:33,920
automate it you know get find some way

4294
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:35,280
to get rid of

4295
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:36,720
the idea that you're part of the

4296
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:38,640
patching process every single month you

4297
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:40,560
don't need to be all you need to know is

4298
02:38:40,560 --> 02:38:41,920
that it's happening just trust the

4299
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:44,960
people and and get the results from that

4300
02:38:44,960 --> 02:38:47,439
um obviously shadow i.t so shadow i.t

4301
02:38:47,439 --> 02:38:50,080
where people need to do stuff need to to

4302
02:38:50,080 --> 02:38:52,240
get stuff done um

4303
02:38:52,240 --> 02:38:54,960
and just can't because it's moving too

4304
02:38:54,960 --> 02:38:58,080
slowly or won't allow stuff

4305
02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:00,240
but is not in line with with what the

4306
02:39:00,240 --> 02:39:03,680
business is actually needing to do

4307
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:04,479
um

4308
02:39:04,479 --> 02:39:06,960
yeah manual reviews and approvals i i

4309
02:39:06,960 --> 02:39:08,960
when i was a security person i was

4310
02:39:08,960 --> 02:39:11,040
involved in approving every single time

4311
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:13,840
a patch needed to be done why i'm happy

4312
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:15,760
that you're patching your stuff rather

4313
02:39:15,760 --> 02:39:17,439
bring me in when you don't want to patch

4314
02:39:17,439 --> 02:39:19,760
something um then then i will work with

4315
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:22,160
you and work out what we can do but if

4316
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:24,000
you're doing the good things do it and

4317
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,160
tell me that you've done it uh password

4318
02:39:26,160 --> 02:39:28,160
rotation is one that like we never quite

4319
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:29,840
worked out while we were doing it we

4320
02:39:29,840 --> 02:39:31,920
just knew that we had to do it

4321
02:39:31,920 --> 02:39:34,160
and we did it um which leads to people

4322
02:39:34,160 --> 02:39:35,680
having weaker passwords because they

4323
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:37,200
have to keep changing their passwords

4324
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:39,439
all the time

4325
02:39:39,439 --> 02:39:41,280
the other thing that i was three i was

4326
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:43,280
reading an article this past week um and

4327
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:45,439
i said that stress is basic when people

4328
02:39:45,439 --> 02:39:48,160
get stressed their information security

4329
02:39:48,160 --> 02:39:49,359
um

4330
02:39:49,359 --> 02:39:52,319
kind of cleanliness or ability to carry

4331
02:39:52,319 --> 02:39:54,160
out the different processes actually

4332
02:39:54,160 --> 02:39:55,200
drops

4333
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:56,240
um

4334
02:39:56,240 --> 02:39:58,720
and obviously we can't

4335
02:39:58,720 --> 02:40:00,479
stop people from being stressed there's

4336
02:40:00,479 --> 02:40:02,720
a lot of things happening these days

4337
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:05,359
these unprecedented days that are that

4338
02:40:05,359 --> 02:40:07,680
is causing people to be stressed

4339
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:08,560
um

4340
02:40:08,560 --> 02:40:09,760
but

4341
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:12,080
we can definitely not make it more

4342
02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:15,200
stressful um like we we can work in and

4343
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:17,120
like if we asking people to do really

4344
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:19,359
stressful things to get stuff done

4345
02:40:19,359 --> 02:40:21,920
um that actually might lead them to to

4346
02:40:21,920 --> 02:40:24,080
to break all the different rules and and

4347
02:40:24,080 --> 02:40:25,760
just say to hell with it let's let's

4348
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:28,240
just get this done

4349
02:40:28,240 --> 02:40:31,920
um and yeah this is this is a quote um

4350
02:40:31,920 --> 02:40:34,479
i think from one of the

4351
02:40:34,479 --> 02:40:37,120
um it was debbie's talk uh that said

4352
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:39,120
like a rock will swim around you um and

4353
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:41,120
that's all to do with process if you if

4354
02:40:41,120 --> 02:40:42,800
people need to get their job done and

4355
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:44,319
you're standing in the way they will

4356
02:40:44,319 --> 02:40:47,600
definitely just do it around you

4357
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:49,840
okay

4358
02:40:50,720 --> 02:40:52,560
so

4359
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:55,439
talking about maturity um i love the

4360
02:40:55,439 --> 02:40:57,920
idea of maturity models

4361
02:40:57,920 --> 02:40:59,279
um i

4362
02:40:59,279 --> 02:41:02,160
have an issue with some maturity models

4363
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:05,279
like the essential 8 maturity model and

4364
02:41:05,279 --> 02:41:08,560
i'm not picking on that one specifically

4365
02:41:08,560 --> 02:41:09,439
but

4366
02:41:09,439 --> 02:41:11,200
the reason why i don't really like most

4367
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:12,880
maturity models is that they look at the

4368
02:41:12,880 --> 02:41:15,840
maturity of the controls the maturity of

4369
02:41:15,840 --> 02:41:17,920
your duct tape and they don't look at

4370
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:22,000
the maturity of the processes

4371
02:41:22,479 --> 02:41:24,560
there are some that do both

4372
02:41:24,560 --> 02:41:26,240
and they are rare and they're also my

4373
02:41:26,240 --> 02:41:27,760
favorite

4374
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:30,399
so pci

4375
02:41:30,399 --> 02:41:33,680
uh pci was was thought of being a really

4376
02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:34,800
kind of

4377
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:36,560
point in time assessment and they said

4378
02:41:36,560 --> 02:41:38,240
well let's look at processes and now

4379
02:41:38,240 --> 02:41:40,479
it's it's it's quite an amazing eye

4380
02:41:40,479 --> 02:41:42,080
standard to work with

4381
02:41:42,080 --> 02:41:45,200
isaka has the cmmi um electrical

4382
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:47,520
industry has the c2m2 in the us and the

4383
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:50,399
aescsf

4384
02:41:50,399 --> 02:41:53,439
in australia and those are amazing um

4385
02:41:53,439 --> 02:41:57,040
unfortunately the cmmc that's this uh

4386
02:41:57,040 --> 02:41:58,880
well it's basically something that you

4387
02:41:58,880 --> 02:42:01,520
need to do if you're going to be doing

4388
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:03,760
a business with government in the us um

4389
02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:05,279
they've actually taken out the part of

4390
02:42:05,279 --> 02:42:07,680
the standard that addresses um processes

4391
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:10,800
which i was very very disappointed about

4392
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:12,399
so i'm proposing

4393
02:42:12,399 --> 02:42:14,000
my own

4394
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:15,439
maturity model

4395
02:42:15,439 --> 02:42:18,479
um i call it the microsoft office suite

4396
02:42:18,479 --> 02:42:20,800
process maturity standard i might have

4397
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:22,640
to take the microsoft out because i'm

4398
02:42:22,640 --> 02:42:25,439
not affiliated with them at all so we'll

4399
02:42:25,439 --> 02:42:27,120
call it the office suites process

4400
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:30,319
maturity standard so maturity one

4401
02:42:30,319 --> 02:42:33,680
maturity level one is notepad

4402
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:35,840
basically what happens is someone new to

4403
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:38,240
the organization uh you go to the

4404
02:42:38,240 --> 02:42:41,279
sysadmins computer open up notepad and

4405
02:42:41,279 --> 02:42:43,200
say hey dude reminder that the new chat

4406
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:44,640
starts today make sure he gets computer

4407
02:42:44,640 --> 02:42:46,640
with some access check out what sally

4408
02:42:46,640 --> 02:42:49,200
has and give them about the same

4409
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:51,920
that's your maturity level one

4410
02:42:51,920 --> 02:42:54,640
um obviously not great so what happens

4411
02:42:54,640 --> 02:42:57,600
is you move to maturity level two um i

4412
02:42:57,600 --> 02:42:59,520
haven't used a microsoft product yet but

4413
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:01,359
i used netscape because netscape is

4414
02:43:01,359 --> 02:43:03,760
great um

4415
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:07,200
and this is where you get jira um

4416
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:08,560
or something similar

4417
02:43:08,560 --> 02:43:10,880
where all of a sudden you log a ticket

4418
02:43:10,880 --> 02:43:13,200
now there's no standardized way of doing

4419
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:15,120
anything but at least you can track it a

4420
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:17,920
little bit which is slightly better

4421
02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:21,279
um again this all this information lies

4422
02:43:21,279 --> 02:43:23,600
in some guy's head

4423
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:24,800
um

4424
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:26,479
or some person's head

4425
02:43:26,479 --> 02:43:28,960
of how to to go about doing this and

4426
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:30,640
that's not great if they ever leave the

4427
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:33,040
organization you'll have no idea why

4428
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:35,439
anyone got the access that they needed

4429
02:43:35,439 --> 02:43:39,279
why they even got any access at all um

4430
02:43:39,279 --> 02:43:40,640
there will be a ticket that says you

4431
02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:42,399
know please give joe some access but

4432
02:43:42,399 --> 02:43:44,080
like basically you have no idea what

4433
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:46,479
access it is or why

4434
02:43:46,479 --> 02:43:48,240
stepping up from that you have maturity

4435
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:50,399
three

4436
02:43:50,399 --> 02:43:52,960
which is the repeatable or proactive way

4437
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:56,160
what i call the microsoft word uh level

4438
02:43:56,160 --> 02:43:59,040
of maturity where you have standards you

4439
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:00,240
have

4440
02:44:00,240 --> 02:44:03,040
processes you have policies

4441
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:05,040
all of these good things so at least you

4442
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:07,040
can work out what things are supposed to

4443
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:08,399
look like

4444
02:44:08,399 --> 02:44:12,640
what your password should be etc

4445
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:16,319
maturity level four the ultimate level

4446
02:44:16,319 --> 02:44:18,560
of maturity excel of course because

4447
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:20,160
excel is the best

4448
02:44:20,160 --> 02:44:21,439
as we all know

4449
02:44:21,439 --> 02:44:23,279
um and

4450
02:44:23,279 --> 02:44:24,640
this is where you can actually track

4451
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:27,040
your users so stuff gets done and you

4452
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:28,880
can pull out reports and you can say oh

4453
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:30,720
hang on a sec all these users this guy

4454
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:31,920
shouldn't have he's no longer with the

4455
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:33,600
organization and you can remove his

4456
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:36,000
access um if someone wants to come into

4457
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:37,600
your organization and says hey can you

4458
02:44:37,600 --> 02:44:39,120
give me a list of all the people that

4459
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:41,279
can do x bomb yeah here it is we've got

4460
02:44:41,279 --> 02:44:44,560
it we've been tracking it um and

4461
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:46,720
we we know exactly who they are why they

4462
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:49,520
are and and per the standards we know

4463
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:52,160
what sort of access they should have

4464
02:44:52,160 --> 02:44:54,960
and we've given them that

4465
02:44:54,960 --> 02:44:57,040
uh i guess at this point if you have a

4466
02:44:57,040 --> 02:44:58,240
look at the pull-down you'll see that

4467
02:44:58,240 --> 02:45:00,000
there's also maturity level five and six

4468
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:01,680
in the question that i'm sure yen is

4469
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:04,160
busy thinking at the moment what

4470
02:45:04,160 --> 02:45:06,000
ever could be better than excel because

4471
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:07,600
excel is brilliant

4472
02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:10,399
and the answer is

4473
02:45:10,399 --> 02:45:13,120
the zero so this is where you take all

4474
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:15,120
the stuff that you've learned previously

4475
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:16,880
build it into actual

4476
02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:19,600
processes that you can monitor and see

4477
02:45:19,600 --> 02:45:20,479
what's

4478
02:45:20,479 --> 02:45:22,960
happening you can tie this in with all

4479
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:24,399
the reports that you're getting you can

4480
02:45:24,399 --> 02:45:26,160
tie this in with all the standards that

4481
02:45:26,160 --> 02:45:27,359
you've got

4482
02:45:27,359 --> 02:45:28,880
you can tie this in with all the calls

4483
02:45:28,880 --> 02:45:30,720
that you've got logged in if you put all

4484
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:32,240
of those together

4485
02:45:32,240 --> 02:45:34,080
you can see where your organization is

4486
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:35,760
going right and you can see most

4487
02:45:35,760 --> 02:45:37,760
importantly where your organization is

4488
02:45:37,760 --> 02:45:39,760
going wrong

4489
02:45:39,760 --> 02:45:42,399
and this is basically the optimized or

4490
02:45:42,399 --> 02:45:45,279
efficiency part of of what you should be

4491
02:45:45,279 --> 02:45:46,479
doing here

4492
02:45:46,479 --> 02:45:47,600
and the next question you should be

4493
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:49,359
asking okay well then what is maturity

4494
02:45:49,359 --> 02:45:51,279
level six so if you have maturity level

4495
02:45:51,279 --> 02:45:52,880
five and that's vizio and vizio is

4496
02:45:52,880 --> 02:45:55,040
better than excel and excel's the best

4497
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:56,800
what is maturity level six and the

4498
02:45:56,800 --> 02:46:00,399
answer to that is quite simple

4499
02:46:00,800 --> 02:46:03,920
and laura covered this um in in her talk

4500
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:06,880
uh the first day as well and the answer

4501
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:08,840
is

4502
02:46:08,840 --> 02:46:11,760
nothing could anything be better

4503
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:14,960
absolutely so the idea here is to remove

4504
02:46:14,960 --> 02:46:17,760
the process entirely if a process is

4505
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:20,000
simple enough changing and not changing

4506
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:21,680
do you need to be part of it no not

4507
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:24,080
really automate it is it adding value

4508
02:46:24,080 --> 02:46:25,520
can we get rid of it can we get rid of

4509
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:28,080
the original process uh can we get rid

4510
02:46:28,080 --> 02:46:30,160
of the broken computers that that you're

4511
02:46:30,160 --> 02:46:32,240
patching every time all of these sort of

4512
02:46:32,240 --> 02:46:34,240
things how can we just remove all of the

4513
02:46:34,240 --> 02:46:36,160
stuff as well as

4514
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:38,319
for example can we get the business to

4515
02:46:38,319 --> 02:46:39,920
take on some of the work can they do

4516
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:42,640
some of the work themselves um business

4517
02:46:42,640 --> 02:46:45,120
do hr stuff they do financial work they

4518
02:46:45,120 --> 02:46:46,960
do a bit of it work

4519
02:46:46,960 --> 02:46:48,720
um maybe they can even do some of the

4520
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:50,800
security stuff themselves if we make it

4521
02:46:50,800 --> 02:46:52,880
easy for them to understand and part of

4522
02:46:52,880 --> 02:46:56,000
their role um we can actually do it but

4523
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,880
we also from security points of view

4524
02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:01,359
um need to

4525
02:47:01,359 --> 02:47:03,120
um be comfortable with with people

4526
02:47:03,120 --> 02:47:05,680
taking over from what we do

4527
02:47:05,680 --> 02:47:08,479
all right and for cyber mum

4528
02:47:08,479 --> 02:47:10,479
hello um

4529
02:47:10,479 --> 02:47:12,960
always a call to action and list of next

4530
02:47:12,960 --> 02:47:15,359
steps

4531
02:47:15,359 --> 02:47:18,240
and here we go um no i don't really have

4532
02:47:18,240 --> 02:47:20,000
perfect solutions i've given you the

4533
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:21,200
idea that you need to look at your

4534
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:23,520
processes how we do that we're still

4535
02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:25,040
learning

4536
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:26,240
if you look at the other talks that

4537
02:47:26,240 --> 02:47:27,359
we've had

4538
02:47:27,359 --> 02:47:29,200
they've got very much more detail they

4539
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:31,359
have more time and more detail in in how

4540
02:47:31,359 --> 02:47:32,880
you can look at each of these different

4541
02:47:32,880 --> 02:47:35,279
things i think from my point of view uh

4542
02:47:35,279 --> 02:47:36,800
the only thing i just really wanted you

4543
02:47:36,800 --> 02:47:39,439
to look at is whether um

4544
02:47:39,439 --> 02:47:41,040
whether you're taking processes

4545
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:42,560
seriously or not

4546
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:45,520
um and just to to remind yourself that

4547
02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:48,319
that you must it's not the fun part of

4548
02:47:48,319 --> 02:47:49,920
it it's not the blinking lights and

4549
02:47:49,920 --> 02:47:52,960
stuff that um or the shiny things

4550
02:47:52,960 --> 02:47:54,640
but it is definitely what's going to

4551
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:58,000
move the needle for you

4552
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,399
and finally um things that i want to add

4553
02:48:00,399 --> 02:48:02,640
into to to my talk and make a little bit

4554
02:48:02,640 --> 02:48:04,880
longer stuff that i found inspirational

4555
02:48:04,880 --> 02:48:06,399
over the last couple of days laura's

4556
02:48:06,399 --> 02:48:08,880
talk do scary things in a secure way

4557
02:48:08,880 --> 02:48:09,840
um

4558
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:12,720
and yeah make yourself redundant uh

4559
02:48:12,720 --> 02:48:13,920
debbie stuff

4560
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:16,080
compliance adherence and concordance

4561
02:48:16,080 --> 02:48:18,160
moving your way through all of that that

4562
02:48:18,160 --> 02:48:20,000
sounds very exciting sounds like it'll

4563
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,160
work with with what what i'm talking

4564
02:48:22,160 --> 02:48:24,880
about um the idea of hugging smacking

4565
02:48:24,880 --> 02:48:26,560
shoving and nudging people to do the

4566
02:48:26,560 --> 02:48:29,040
right thing um absolutely

4567
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:30,479
and that would just be part of of

4568
02:48:30,479 --> 02:48:32,240
looking at your processes and working

4569
02:48:32,240 --> 02:48:33,279
out where

4570
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:34,080
um

4571
02:48:34,080 --> 02:48:35,359
where you should

4572
02:48:35,359 --> 02:48:37,520
uh make things better

4573
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:39,920
um other people that i found interesting

4574
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:42,840
kelly shortridge writes a lot about this

4575
02:48:42,840 --> 02:48:44,960
uh wolfgang

4576
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:48,080
writes a lot about this nicole dr nicole

4577
02:48:48,080 --> 02:48:50,640
forsgren writes a lot about this she was

4578
02:48:50,640 --> 02:48:52,240
very involved in

4579
02:48:52,240 --> 02:48:54,080
setting up and creating the whole idea

4580
02:48:54,080 --> 02:48:55,359
of devops

4581
02:48:55,359 --> 02:48:57,920
and we definitely can learn a lot from

4582
02:48:57,920 --> 02:49:01,200
from how it has adopted devops

4583
02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:03,359
and lean and agile and use it in

4584
02:49:03,359 --> 02:49:05,520
information security not only for

4585
02:49:05,520 --> 02:49:08,080
application security uh but for our own

4586
02:49:08,080 --> 02:49:09,760
stuff and also for supporting the

4587
02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:11,520
business

4588
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:13,680
and that is pretty much that i'll take

4589
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:16,000
you back to my personal detail slide so

4590
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,160
that you can scan the qr code if you

4591
02:49:18,160 --> 02:49:19,840
want to

4592
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:22,319
and thank you very much

4593
02:49:22,319 --> 02:49:24,399
that was a fantastic talk allen as

4594
02:49:24,399 --> 02:49:26,800
always um able to impress us with your

4595
02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:28,479
excel skills

4596
02:49:28,479 --> 02:49:29,439
um

4597
02:49:29,439 --> 02:49:31,040
and as normal

4598
02:49:31,040 --> 02:49:33,520
i think we agree on the same things but

4599
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:35,279
we just disagree on some of it but

4600
02:49:35,279 --> 02:49:37,120
that's useful

4601
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:39,359
it makes for it makes for a good life

4602
02:49:39,359 --> 02:49:41,200
yeah this is why we when we catch up

4603
02:49:41,200 --> 02:49:42,960
it's always interesting

4604
02:49:42,960 --> 02:49:44,640
it always says yeah we have two

4605
02:49:44,640 --> 02:49:46,319
questions one slightly not serious

4606
02:49:46,319 --> 02:49:48,720
someone serious um so on the oil versus

4607
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:50,800
duct tape question my kitchen is on fire

4608
02:49:50,800 --> 02:49:52,800
because i'm cooking chicken do i use oil

4609
02:49:52,800 --> 02:49:54,800
or duct tape

4610
02:49:54,800 --> 02:49:56,240
i would probably at that point just

4611
02:49:56,240 --> 02:49:59,840
throw everything at the problem

4612
02:49:59,840 --> 02:50:01,760
right um

4613
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:04,080
yeah that's a good question actually

4614
02:50:04,080 --> 02:50:06,000
um so i guess you got to break it down

4615
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:07,200
to

4616
02:50:07,200 --> 02:50:08,960
do do you actually need controls or do

4617
02:50:08,960 --> 02:50:11,120
you need process i think at that point

4618
02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:13,120
you need process and the process is to

4619
02:50:13,120 --> 02:50:14,960
leave the house

4620
02:50:14,960 --> 02:50:17,760
that's a fair point that is the point

4621
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:19,840
um and a question from what are your

4622
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:22,000
fans um alan your presentation is full

4623
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,240
of advice about a variety of things what

4624
02:50:24,240 --> 02:50:25,760
advice do you wish someone had told you

4625
02:50:25,760 --> 02:50:28,960
when you were just starting out

4626
02:50:30,160 --> 02:50:32,479
um

4627
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,720
yeah probably a lot about this um that

4628
02:50:36,720 --> 02:50:38,640
that uh

4629
02:50:38,640 --> 02:50:39,600
i

4630
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:43,279
i think one of the main things is is um

4631
02:50:43,279 --> 02:50:46,399
as as as we've gone through is try and

4632
02:50:46,399 --> 02:50:48,880
take yourself out of the process um if

4633
02:50:48,880 --> 02:50:50,720
you're in the process you don't scale

4634
02:50:50,720 --> 02:50:53,520
very well um you should try and kind of

4635
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:55,200
work out how you can take yourself out

4636
02:50:55,200 --> 02:50:57,520
of the process so automation is a nice

4637
02:50:57,520 --> 02:50:59,680
way to do that i'm getting people to

4638
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:02,720
help use um so your i.t guys to to do

4639
02:51:02,720 --> 02:51:05,200
the patching um and you monitor it and

4640
02:51:05,200 --> 02:51:07,300
work with them to see what the um

4641
02:51:07,300 --> 02:51:08,640
[Music]

4642
02:51:08,640 --> 02:51:11,439
where things are going wrong um

4643
02:51:11,439 --> 02:51:12,240
and

4644
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:14,319
yeah just basically

4645
02:51:14,319 --> 02:51:15,439
do i

4646
02:51:15,439 --> 02:51:17,600
could get all that done i think the

4647
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:20,560
other thing is also um if i have to give

4648
02:51:20,560 --> 02:51:22,960
advice to people that that are just

4649
02:51:22,960 --> 02:51:24,640
starting off

4650
02:51:24,640 --> 02:51:26,880
um not everyone knows everything and

4651
02:51:26,880 --> 02:51:28,640
people come across as being very smart

4652
02:51:28,640 --> 02:51:30,080
and knowledgeable and stuff we're all

4653
02:51:30,080 --> 02:51:33,920
making it up as we go along um so

4654
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:36,880
if you have good ideas probably your

4655
02:51:36,880 --> 02:51:39,120
your manager all the people around you

4656
02:51:39,120 --> 02:51:42,240
um or people at conferences will you

4657
02:51:42,240 --> 02:51:43,040

be very keen to to hear how it is that

4659
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:47,840
that that um

4660
02:51:47,840 --> 02:51:50,560
you your solution might solve things um

4661
02:51:50,560 --> 02:51:52,720
speak up um don't be scared to to do

4662
02:51:52,720 --> 02:51:54,960

the big chicken

4737
03:06:02,319 --> 03:06:03,279
um

4738
03:06:03,279 --> 03:06:05,840
even though people think we do uh ben um

4739
03:06:05,840 --> 03:06:07,600
10 news versus nuggies do you have an

4740
03:06:07,600 --> 03:06:09,760
opinion on this matter

4741
03:06:09,760 --> 03:06:10,800
uh

4742
03:06:10,800 --> 03:06:12,880
look if it were me i would i would be on

4743
03:06:12,880 --> 03:06:15,279
the attendees side but my children would

4744
03:06:15,279 --> 03:06:17,120
would definitely go the nuggies so i

4745
03:06:17,120 --> 03:06:18,960
think i would have to get both

4746
03:06:18,960 --> 03:06:21,040
our tandy's just an adult version of

4747
03:06:21,040 --> 03:06:22,319
nuggies

4748
03:06:22,319 --> 03:06:23,760
i think that's what we're finding out

4749
03:06:23,760 --> 03:06:26,479
now yeah um oh hello rose

4750
03:06:26,479 --> 03:06:29,359

of organizations in the defence sector

4761
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:53,040
he worked at high events and he has a

4762
03:06:53,040 --> 03:06:54,960
bachelor of business from rmit

4763
03:06:54,960 --> 03:06:59,040
university so ben is going to be

4764
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:01,279
talking to us about

4765
03:07:01,279 --> 03:07:03,120
politics in fighting but hopefully not

4766
03:07:03,120 --> 03:07:04,880
the kind of politics which by the way if

4767
03:07:04,880 --> 03:07:06,960
you haven't seen the news if you're not

4768
03:07:06,960 --> 03:07:08,080
watching

4769
03:07:08,080 --> 03:07:09,600
everyone's got to enroll to vote because

4770
03:07:09,600 --> 03:07:12,000
we have to vote in a month unfortunately

4771
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:13,680
sausage day is happening democracy

4772
03:07:13,680 --> 03:07:16,479
sausage day has been announced so

4773
03:07:16,479 --> 03:07:18,080
ben we will leave you alone to talk

4774
03:07:18,080 --> 03:07:20,160
about your awesome topic

4775
03:07:20,160 --> 03:07:21,359
cool thank you

4776
03:07:21,359 --> 03:07:22,399
uh

4777
03:07:22,399 --> 03:07:24,160
yes no we're not talking about um

4778
03:07:24,160 --> 03:07:25,760
politics politics we're talking about

4779
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:29,920
organizational uh politics um

4780
03:07:29,920 --> 03:07:31,600
uh yeah i've been introduced that's fine

4781
03:07:31,600 --> 03:07:32,960
just i've been

4782
03:07:32,960 --> 03:07:35,840
in security long enough to have um

4783
03:07:35,840 --> 03:07:37,600
gray hair but not long enough to have

4784
03:07:37,600 --> 03:07:39,359
wrinkles yet

4785
03:07:39,359 --> 03:07:41,120
so here we go

4786
03:07:41,120 --> 03:07:43,439
um i we are hiring thank you for

4787
03:07:43,439 --> 03:07:44,880
mentioning that um we're looking for a

4788
03:07:44,880 --> 03:07:46,800
site reliability engineer

4789
03:07:46,800 --> 03:07:48,080
tam

4790
03:07:48,080 --> 03:07:50,000
et cetera et cetera if you know anyone

4791
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,880
please let us know we'll be really keen

4792
03:07:52,880 --> 03:07:54,960
to get to know them

4793
03:07:54,960 --> 03:07:56,000
okay

4794
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:57,840
so why am i talking about this

4795
03:07:57,840 --> 03:07:58,720
um

4796
03:07:58,720 --> 03:08:00,880
a lot of security work is actually

4797
03:08:00,880 --> 03:08:02,800
selling uh believe it or not so i've

4798
03:08:02,800 --> 03:08:04,960
done consulting sales before

4799
03:08:04,960 --> 03:08:07,359
and that's typically not that bad you'd

4800
03:08:07,359 --> 03:08:10,560
have one stakeholder to sell to

4801
03:08:10,560 --> 03:08:13,760
but since being uh at sidearm you're

4802
03:08:13,760 --> 03:08:15,279
actually dealing with product sales and

4803
03:08:15,279 --> 03:08:16,720
you actually have to involve a lot of

4804
03:08:16,720 --> 03:08:18,960
people across the organization so from

4805
03:08:18,960 --> 03:08:21,920
it folks to procurement folks there'd be

4806
03:08:21,920 --> 03:08:24,479
security assurance or grc people getting

4807
03:08:24,479 --> 03:08:25,520
involved

4808
03:08:25,520 --> 03:08:27,840
and then you actually might have

4809
03:08:27,840 --> 03:08:29,680
the buyers of the technology being

4810
03:08:29,680 --> 03:08:31,040
different people from the users of the

4811
03:08:31,040 --> 03:08:33,040
technology so i just went through one of

4812
03:08:33,040 --> 03:08:34,880
the more bruising sales cycles i've ever

4813
03:08:34,880 --> 03:08:36,640
had with a prospective customer and i

4814
03:08:36,640 --> 03:08:39,439
don't have an outcome after a year

4815
03:08:39,439 --> 03:08:41,120
and i came to the conclusion that some

4816
03:08:41,120 --> 03:08:43,040
of this is actually very similar to what

4817
03:08:43,040 --> 03:08:44,399
we do in

4818
03:08:44,399 --> 03:08:46,720
um security so in most cases you don't

4819
03:08:46,720 --> 03:08:48,960
own the outcome there might be you know

4820
03:08:48,960 --> 03:08:51,040
i.t folks over there who need to uplift

4821
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:53,279
ad there might be hr folks who need to

4822
03:08:53,279 --> 03:08:55,680
change a process and so on so a lot of

4823
03:08:55,680 --> 03:08:57,359
cyber security is actually selling or

4824
03:08:57,359 --> 03:08:58,960
convincing these people

4825
03:08:58,960 --> 03:09:02,000
to do the right thing

4826
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:03,600
and the reason it's so hard and

4827
03:09:03,600 --> 03:09:05,680
problematic is because of this um

4828
03:09:05,680 --> 03:09:08,319
principal agent problem on the screen so

4829
03:09:08,319 --> 03:09:09,840
uh you know the principal might be over

4830
03:09:09,840 --> 03:09:11,920
here and they might own a process or an

4831
03:09:11,920 --> 03:09:13,040
asset or resource and have

4832
03:09:13,040 --> 03:09:14,640
responsibility for it

4833
03:09:14,640 --> 03:09:16,720
they may or may not be uh knowledgeable

4834
03:09:16,720 --> 03:09:19,200
about you know something or security or

4835
03:09:19,200 --> 03:09:20,720
i.t or whatever and they might delegate

4836
03:09:20,720 --> 03:09:22,160
an activity to an agent who works on

4837
03:09:22,160 --> 03:09:24,560
their behalf now the agent should make

4838
03:09:24,560 --> 03:09:26,479
decisions in the best interests of the

4839
03:09:26,479 --> 03:09:28,399
principle but there's always a degree of

4840
03:09:28,399 --> 03:09:29,920
self-interest there which is why you

4841
03:09:29,920 --> 03:09:31,760
have the potential for conflict of

4842
03:09:31,760 --> 03:09:33,439
interest

4843
03:09:33,439 --> 03:09:35,120
and the the elements of the diagram

4844
03:09:35,120 --> 03:09:36,960
might be familiar like you see this in

4845
03:09:36,960 --> 03:09:39,439
other areas such as law or financial

4846
03:09:39,439 --> 03:09:40,960
services where there's a high chance of

4847
03:09:40,960 --> 03:09:42,640
conflict of interest so

4848
03:09:42,640 --> 03:09:45,279
financial services is a great example

4849
03:09:45,279 --> 03:09:47,520
uh you know you in australia you had the

4850
03:09:47,520 --> 03:09:49,279
banks by a bunch of wealth management

4851
03:09:49,279 --> 03:09:51,439
firms who provide financial advice and

4852
03:09:51,439 --> 03:09:53,520
funnily enough they recommended products

4853
03:09:53,520 --> 03:09:54,800
that the banks

4854
03:09:54,800 --> 03:09:57,680
who owned them uh you know took lots of

4855
03:09:57,680 --> 03:09:59,040
fees for

4856
03:09:59,040 --> 03:10:00,880
or if you go back a ways

4857
03:10:00,880 --> 03:10:03,200
uh you know you get enron uh you know

4858
03:10:03,200 --> 03:10:04,880
the enron board of directors selling off

4859
03:10:04,880 --> 03:10:07,200
shares before the market knew about uh

4860
03:10:07,200 --> 03:10:08,479
you know the freudian accounting

4861
03:10:08,479 --> 03:10:10,319
information that that really

4862
03:10:10,319 --> 03:10:12,479
made the company go under and this is

4863
03:10:12,479 --> 03:10:14,239
why the financial services industry is

4864
03:10:14,239 --> 03:10:17,200
so highly regulated but

4865
03:10:17,200 --> 03:10:19,200
the principal agent problem really also

4866
03:10:19,200 --> 03:10:21,279
exists within an organization as well

4867
03:10:21,279 --> 03:10:22,640
you just don't really see it because

4868
03:10:22,640 --> 03:10:24,880
it's a less formal

4869
03:10:24,880 --> 03:10:27,200
structure so the more formal ones being

4870
03:10:27,200 --> 03:10:28,960
say a shareholder

4871
03:10:28,960 --> 03:10:31,040
uh installing a board to look after

4872
03:10:31,040 --> 03:10:34,000
their interests who then manages the ceo

4873
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:36,560
but you might also see a leadership team

4874
03:10:36,560 --> 03:10:38,720
uh delegating stuff to security who they

4875
03:10:38,720 --> 03:10:41,680
might delegate stuff to it or hr to it

4876
03:10:41,680 --> 03:10:43,120
or legal to it

4877
03:10:43,120 --> 03:10:44,960
so the challenge is

4878
03:10:44,960 --> 03:10:47,040
how do you make it so that where a

4879
03:10:47,040 --> 03:10:49,279
person has self-interest but they still

4880
03:10:49,279 --> 03:10:51,200
act in the best interests of whomever

4881
03:10:51,200 --> 03:10:55,399
they're acting on behalf of

4882
03:10:58,160 --> 03:10:59,920
this matters because

4883
03:10:59,920 --> 03:11:01,200
when you have the principal agent

4884
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:02,880
problem you get what's called moral

4885
03:11:02,880 --> 03:11:04,880
hazard

4886
03:11:04,880 --> 03:11:06,399
and the usual outcome of this is where

4887
03:11:06,399 --> 03:11:08,479
one of the actors the agent

4888
03:11:08,479 --> 03:11:10,000
takes on risk because they don't have to

4889
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:11,840
bear the consequences or the full costs

4890
03:11:11,840 --> 03:11:15,520
of that risk does that sound familiar

4891
03:11:15,520 --> 03:11:17,200
but that can only really occur when

4892
03:11:17,200 --> 03:11:19,040
there's an information asymmetry between

4893
03:11:19,040 --> 03:11:21,040
the principal and the agent

4894
03:11:21,040 --> 03:11:22,319
so if the principal the owners of the

4895
03:11:22,319 --> 03:11:23,520
risk don't know what risks they're

4896
03:11:23,520 --> 03:11:24,960
taking on they can't make appropriate

4897
03:11:24,960 --> 03:11:27,040
decisions and that the agents might be

4898
03:11:27,040 --> 03:11:29,840
taking on their behalf

4899
03:11:30,160 --> 03:11:31,920
in addition if you think about any kind

4900
03:11:31,920 --> 03:11:33,279
of

4901
03:11:33,279 --> 03:11:36,080
you know macroeconomic system or model

4902
03:11:36,080 --> 03:11:38,560
you have externalities and externalities

4903
03:11:38,560 --> 03:11:40,239
are those things that are not measured

4904
03:11:40,239 --> 03:11:42,160
or accounted for in that economic system

4905
03:11:42,160 --> 03:11:44,160
so when you look at for example the

4906
03:11:44,160 --> 03:11:46,239
mining or energy industry

4907
03:11:46,239 --> 03:11:47,680
you know carbon is released into the

4908
03:11:47,680 --> 03:11:49,600
atmosphere and it's not accounted for

4909
03:11:49,600 --> 03:11:51,600
unless you have a price of carbon to

4910
03:11:51,600 --> 03:11:53,680
bring it back into that economic model

4911
03:11:53,680 --> 03:11:56,000
the organization pushes that cost of

4912
03:11:56,000 --> 03:11:58,160
that carbon onto society

4913
03:11:58,160 --> 03:11:59,600
and the problem in cyber security is

4914
03:11:59,600 --> 03:12:00,960
that we're not very good at measuring

4915
03:12:00,960 --> 03:12:02,640
the costs of risk so it's very hard to

4916
03:12:02,640 --> 03:12:04,880
communicate risk and bridge that

4917
03:12:04,880 --> 03:12:06,560
information asymmetry so it's very hard

4918
03:12:06,560 --> 03:12:08,000
to say

4919
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:09,680
build that cost into organizational

4920
03:12:09,680 --> 03:12:11,359
budgets as well

4921
03:12:11,359 --> 03:12:12,239
so

4922
03:12:12,239 --> 03:12:13,840
our first job

4923
03:12:13,840 --> 03:12:16,080
as a security professional is really to

4924
03:12:16,080 --> 03:12:18,080
understand and communicate these risks

4925
03:12:18,080 --> 03:12:19,359
and externalities to all the

4926
03:12:19,359 --> 03:12:21,439
stakeholders in the organization and our

4927
03:12:21,439 --> 03:12:23,439
second job is to make sure that none of

4928
03:12:23,439 --> 03:12:25,600
these costs or externalities are dumped

4929
03:12:25,600 --> 03:12:29,680
on the security team insofar as possible

4930
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:33,120
another outcome of the principal agent

4931
03:12:33,120 --> 03:12:35,520
problem is agency costs so

4932
03:12:35,520 --> 03:12:38,000
whenever you have agency occurring there

4933
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:39,760
will always be costs associated with

4934
03:12:39,760 --> 03:12:41,279
that there might be

4935
03:12:41,279 --> 03:12:43,279
say money or time or the quality of the

4936
03:12:43,279 --> 03:12:44,880
outcomes

4937
03:12:44,880 --> 03:12:46,880
again talking about um a board of

4938
03:12:46,880 --> 03:12:48,160
directors working on behalf of

4939
03:12:48,160 --> 03:12:50,160
shareholders they're getting paid fees

4940
03:12:50,160 --> 03:12:51,840
to make sure that the cio does the the

4941
03:12:51,840 --> 03:12:53,920
right thing and that's a cost for the

4942
03:12:53,920 --> 03:12:55,680
the shareholders to bear

4943
03:12:55,680 --> 03:12:56,800
it's really just a cost to doing

4944
03:12:56,800 --> 03:12:57,920
business

4945
03:12:57,920 --> 03:12:59,200
um

4946
03:12:59,200 --> 03:13:01,520
but within an organization those costs

4947
03:13:01,520 --> 03:13:03,760
still apply so you might have

4948
03:13:03,760 --> 03:13:05,120
uh you know

4949
03:13:05,120 --> 03:13:06,720
paying for security folks to make sure

4950
03:13:06,720 --> 03:13:09,040
that shareholder threats are safe you

4951
03:13:09,040 --> 03:13:11,680
might have projects and project teams

4952
03:13:11,680 --> 03:13:14,239
uh you know making sure that it projects

4953
03:13:14,239 --> 03:13:16,080
are delivered to business requirements

4954
03:13:16,080 --> 03:13:17,840
you might have say procurement teams

4955
03:13:17,840 --> 03:13:19,600
making sure that there's no corruption

4956
03:13:19,600 --> 03:13:21,760
in procurement processes there's always

4957
03:13:21,760 --> 03:13:24,800
always some sort of agency cost uh to to

4958
03:13:24,800 --> 03:13:28,438
organizational processes

4959
03:13:29,200 --> 03:13:31,279
um so projects are probably the most

4960
03:13:31,279 --> 03:13:33,200
common way that

4961
03:13:33,200 --> 03:13:35,520
security controls slip or you get

4962
03:13:35,520 --> 03:13:37,040
changes in your organization's control

4963
03:13:37,040 --> 03:13:38,640
baseline

4964
03:13:38,640 --> 03:13:40,239
so you might have a project manager

4965
03:13:40,239 --> 03:13:42,399
working on behalf of the it organization

4966
03:13:42,399 --> 03:13:45,120
to deliver some service or system

4967
03:13:45,120 --> 03:13:47,279
and it's in the interest of the project

4968
03:13:47,279 --> 03:13:49,439
manager to get the project done on time

4969
03:13:49,439 --> 03:13:51,040
and on budget but not necessarily to

4970
03:13:51,040 --> 03:13:52,720
deliver security

4971
03:13:52,720 --> 03:13:54,560
um these are some examples by the way

4972
03:13:54,560 --> 03:13:56,160
i'm going through so the the security

4973
03:13:56,160 --> 03:13:58,399
organization needs to make sure that the

4974
03:13:58,399 --> 03:14:01,120
risks and costs are well understood

4975
03:14:01,120 --> 03:14:02,800
across the organization so making sure

4976
03:14:02,800 --> 03:14:04,640
that the owner is defined

4977
03:14:04,640 --> 03:14:06,080
they understand that they own the risk

4978
03:14:06,080 --> 03:14:07,279
and they have to contribute to the

4979
03:14:07,279 --> 03:14:08,880
budget to remediate any controlled

4980
03:14:08,880 --> 03:14:11,359
efficiencies

4981
03:14:11,359 --> 03:14:12,960
i've seen quite a few cases where the

4982
03:14:12,960 --> 03:14:14,800
ownership of controls just slips

4983
03:14:14,800 --> 03:14:16,399
magically into the lap of the security

4984
03:14:16,399 --> 03:14:17,840
team

4985
03:14:17,840 --> 03:14:19,600
in one particular case i've seen the

4986
03:14:19,600 --> 03:14:22,239
project manager was delivering

4987
03:14:22,239 --> 03:14:24,160
sort of an outsourced itune network

4988
03:14:24,160 --> 03:14:26,479
monitoring platform via a third-party

4989
03:14:26,479 --> 03:14:27,600
service

4990
03:14:27,600 --> 03:14:28,720
and

4991
03:14:28,720 --> 03:14:30,160
uh you know it was all hooked up to the

4992
03:14:30,160 --> 03:14:32,239
vendors network and shipping a lot of

4993
03:14:32,239 --> 03:14:33,920
telemetry to a network overseas and

4994
03:14:33,920 --> 03:14:35,920
giving a render the vendor remote access

4995
03:14:35,920 --> 03:14:37,279
to the tooling in the organization's

4996
03:14:37,279 --> 03:14:38,479
network

4997
03:14:38,479 --> 03:14:39,920
um but

4998
03:14:39,920 --> 03:14:41,439
they engaged with the cyber security

4999
03:14:41,439 --> 03:14:43,200
team right at the project project close

5000
03:14:43,200 --> 03:14:44,560
out so there was no opportunity to

5001
03:14:44,560 --> 03:14:46,479
review it you know kind of drop down and

5002
03:14:46,479 --> 03:14:47,920
walk away kind of thing

5003
03:14:47,920 --> 03:14:49,600
so there had to be a lot of post project

5004
03:14:49,600 --> 03:14:50,880
work to evaluate the risk the

5005
03:14:50,880 --> 03:14:54,080
organization is taking on

5006
03:14:54,560 --> 03:14:57,680
another failure mode

5007
03:14:58,080 --> 03:14:59,439
that exists and this one's a bit more

5008
03:14:59,439 --> 03:15:01,040
personal to me

5009
03:15:01,040 --> 03:15:02,239
so i've been again going through

5010
03:15:02,239 --> 03:15:03,760
procurement

5011
03:15:03,760 --> 03:15:05,600
for sidearm at a particular organization

5012
03:15:05,600 --> 03:15:06,399
and most

5013
03:15:06,399 --> 03:15:08,319
projects have some sort of feature bake

5014
03:15:08,319 --> 03:15:10,080
off between you know best of breed

5015
03:15:10,080 --> 03:15:12,399
product versus versus an everything

5016
03:15:12,399 --> 03:15:14,160
burger

5017
03:15:14,160 --> 03:15:16,239
and uh you know the agency effects are

5018
03:15:16,239 --> 03:15:18,080
there so the security team wants this

5019
03:15:18,080 --> 03:15:20,560
like solution that they uh you know

5020
03:15:20,560 --> 03:15:22,000
solves their problems there might be a

5021
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:23,200
project team

5022
03:15:23,200 --> 03:15:24,880
uh that looked for a solution to solve

5023
03:15:24,880 --> 03:15:26,479
multiple use cases

5024
03:15:26,479 --> 03:15:28,800
i was an enterprise architect that would

5025
03:15:28,800 --> 03:15:30,399
that was looking to find solutions that

5026
03:15:30,399 --> 03:15:32,399
fit their design patterns and then

5027
03:15:32,399 --> 03:15:34,239
management of course was involved for

5028
03:15:34,239 --> 03:15:35,040
you know

5029
03:15:35,040 --> 03:15:37,040
financial reasons basically looking at

5030
03:15:37,040 --> 03:15:38,880
vendor consolidation

5031
03:15:38,880 --> 03:15:40,880
um

5032
03:15:40,880 --> 03:15:41,600
so

5033
03:15:41,600 --> 03:15:43,760
the end result of this process was that

5034
03:15:43,760 --> 03:15:45,600
you you're looking at a four or five

5035
03:15:45,600 --> 03:15:47,200
month delay on this project getting

5036
03:15:47,200 --> 03:15:49,120
delivered you know there are multiple

5037
03:15:49,120 --> 03:15:50,720
committees involved with all the time

5038
03:15:50,720 --> 03:15:52,880
they took out months of writing business

5039
03:15:52,880 --> 03:15:55,359
cases and other supporting material

5040
03:15:55,359 --> 03:15:56,960
and hundreds of person hours with no

5041
03:15:56,960 --> 03:15:57,920
outcome

5042
03:15:57,920 --> 03:15:59,040
so

5043
03:15:59,040 --> 03:16:01,200
you have to be careful when you're doing

5044
03:16:01,200 --> 03:16:02,960
project work that you don't

5045
03:16:02,960 --> 03:16:04,880
really chew up too much of your

5046
03:16:04,880 --> 03:16:06,800
create too many agency costs when you're

5047
03:16:06,800 --> 03:16:09,840
trying to achieve something

5048
03:16:10,319 --> 03:16:12,399
this one was pretty brutal too this is

5049
03:16:12,399 --> 03:16:14,479
one example where there was insider

5050
03:16:14,479 --> 03:16:17,760
threat from inside the security team so

5051
03:16:17,760 --> 03:16:19,359
this one with in this case there was a

5052
03:16:19,359 --> 03:16:21,040
program to uplift security across the

5053
03:16:21,040 --> 03:16:22,560
organization

5054
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:25,279
and they pulled staff in from

5055
03:16:25,279 --> 03:16:26,880
other areas of the organization to help

5056
03:16:26,880 --> 03:16:28,479
with security uplift so some team

5057
03:16:28,479 --> 03:16:30,000
members didn't have a security

5058
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:32,239
background or experience in security

5059
03:16:32,239 --> 03:16:34,479
which is fine we spent time coaching

5060
03:16:34,479 --> 03:16:36,399
them and providing advice sort of like a

5061
03:16:36,399 --> 03:16:38,640
train the trainer gig

5062
03:16:38,640 --> 03:16:40,560
but there was one particular person who

5063
03:16:40,560 --> 03:16:42,160
just seemed to actively undermine

5064
03:16:42,160 --> 03:16:44,640
efforts of the security team it did feel

5065
03:16:44,640 --> 03:16:46,560
like stockholm syndrome they came from

5066
03:16:46,560 --> 03:16:48,239
the i.t organization and would let the

5067
03:16:48,239 --> 03:16:51,520
it teams really do what they wanted

5068
03:16:51,520 --> 03:16:53,520
and the organization had

5069
03:16:53,520 --> 03:16:56,960
most of the network using an soe

5070
03:16:56,960 --> 03:16:58,960
for all their systems which while it

5071
03:16:58,960 --> 03:17:00,960
needed some work was relatively secure

5072
03:17:00,960 --> 03:17:03,120
but there was a segregated enclave in

5073
03:17:03,120 --> 03:17:04,720
the network to house all the legally

5074
03:17:04,720 --> 03:17:06,640
legacy systems that didn't conform to

5075
03:17:06,640 --> 03:17:07,680
the soe

5076
03:17:07,680 --> 03:17:09,200
and they had a genuine business reason

5077
03:17:09,200 --> 03:17:10,720
to do this that's fine

5078
03:17:10,720 --> 03:17:12,319
um they were important but not important

5079
03:17:12,319 --> 03:17:14,399
enough to rebuild and this individual

5080
03:17:14,399 --> 03:17:16,239
was providing advice that poked holes in

5081
03:17:16,239 --> 03:17:19,520
that network segregation so

5082
03:17:19,520 --> 03:17:22,319
um when you're talking about agency uh

5083
03:17:22,319 --> 03:17:24,000
you know organizations are not well

5084
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:25,920
equipped to deal with bad faith actors

5085
03:17:25,920 --> 03:17:27,600
in there or at least it takes a lot of

5086
03:17:27,600 --> 03:17:29,920
time to to weed them out

5087
03:17:29,920 --> 03:17:31,760
in this particular case

5088
03:17:31,760 --> 03:17:34,479
um the agency cost was that the rest of

5089
03:17:34,479 --> 03:17:36,000
the security team had to monitor the

5090
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:37,840
advice he was giving and making sure

5091
03:17:37,840 --> 03:17:39,200
that the organization was still doing

5092
03:17:39,200 --> 03:17:41,840
the right thing

5093
03:17:42,239 --> 03:17:44,560
um

5094
03:17:44,560 --> 03:17:47,200
sizo the sizer gig is a tough tough

5095
03:17:47,200 --> 03:17:50,319
tough role so they effectively operate

5096
03:17:50,319 --> 03:17:52,080
oh it's i would argue as the agent of

5097
03:17:52,080 --> 03:17:53,600
the sizo so they're

5098
03:17:53,600 --> 03:17:55,359
you know can be often

5099
03:17:55,359 --> 03:17:57,279
information asymmetry between the pair

5100
03:17:57,279 --> 03:17:58,479
there might be

5101
03:17:58,479 --> 03:18:00,239
um so there needs to be a high degree of

5102
03:18:00,239 --> 03:18:01,760
trust and engagement with the executive

5103
03:18:01,760 --> 03:18:02,880
team

5104
03:18:02,880 --> 03:18:04,960
and a lot of the success of the security

5105
03:18:04,960 --> 03:18:07,120
program depends on how well

5106
03:18:07,120 --> 03:18:09,279
the sizer manages upwards and delegates

5107
03:18:09,279 --> 03:18:10,560
downwards

5108
03:18:10,560 --> 03:18:13,040
and the more time that

5109
03:18:13,040 --> 03:18:15,200
a sizer has to spend managing upwards

5110
03:18:15,200 --> 03:18:16,720
the less time they have to set direction

5111
03:18:16,720 --> 03:18:18,399
downwards

5112
03:18:18,399 --> 03:18:20,479
the best i've seen

5113
03:18:20,479 --> 03:18:22,399
is where the saizo enjoyed the trust and

5114
03:18:22,399 --> 03:18:24,640
support of the executive team and the

5115
03:18:24,640 --> 03:18:26,880
security team below the sizer functioned

5116
03:18:26,880 --> 03:18:28,560
extremely effectively

5117
03:18:28,560 --> 03:18:32,399
um because they they uh would had

5118
03:18:32,399 --> 03:18:34,399
worked delegated to them appropriately

5119
03:18:34,399 --> 03:18:36,479
could make decisions etc

5120
03:18:36,479 --> 03:18:38,479
another organization had literally no

5121
03:18:38,479 --> 03:18:40,319
security policy and they couldn't

5122
03:18:40,319 --> 03:18:42,399
publish security policy because

5123
03:18:42,399 --> 03:18:44,640
the organization's constitution required

5124
03:18:44,640 --> 03:18:46,960
board level approval to get it through

5125
03:18:46,960 --> 03:18:48,640
it was literally too hard to get through

5126
03:18:48,640 --> 03:18:51,200
this process so that meant that the

5127
03:18:51,200 --> 03:18:53,200
security team had no authority to

5128
03:18:53,200 --> 03:18:56,319
enforce security in the organization

5129
03:18:56,319 --> 03:18:58,479
the impact of that was that the sizer

5130
03:18:58,479 --> 03:19:00,160
was absent a lot because i had to spend

5131
03:19:00,160 --> 03:19:01,920
time managing upwards and arguing for

5132
03:19:01,920 --> 03:19:04,239
things to affect change and below the

5133
03:19:04,239 --> 03:19:05,680
sizo it was rudderless because they

5134
03:19:05,680 --> 03:19:08,000
didn't have the time to to sort of set

5135
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:10,960
direction below them

5136
03:19:11,600 --> 03:19:12,399
so

5137
03:19:12,399 --> 03:19:14,479
when you're in an organization what

5138
03:19:14,479 --> 03:19:17,200
you're trying to do is achieve alignment

5139
03:19:17,200 --> 03:19:18,960
of interests and it's easier to do if

5140
03:19:18,960 --> 03:19:20,880
you're in a position of authority like

5141
03:19:20,880 --> 03:19:23,439
the sizeo or above but if you can't do

5142
03:19:23,439 --> 03:19:24,960
it you can at least be aware of where

5143
03:19:24,960 --> 03:19:26,399
your interests are not aligned and find

5144
03:19:26,399 --> 03:19:28,399
places to get aligned

5145
03:19:28,399 --> 03:19:30,239
and like alan said

5146
03:19:30,239 --> 03:19:32,880
talking about the desire path

5147
03:19:32,880 --> 03:19:34,160
if you can make it easier to do the

5148
03:19:34,160 --> 03:19:35,520
right thing and add friction when

5149
03:19:35,520 --> 03:19:36,720
they're not doing the right thing it

5150
03:19:36,720 --> 03:19:38,160
makes things a lot easier for you as

5151
03:19:38,160 --> 03:19:40,319
well

5152
03:19:42,080 --> 03:19:44,080
some other tools are

5153
03:19:44,080 --> 03:19:46,479
thinking about you know formalin for

5154
03:19:46,479 --> 03:19:48,000
informal authority between the different

5155
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:50,319
stakeholders and the organizational

5156
03:19:50,319 --> 03:19:51,600
structure will have a lot to do with

5157
03:19:51,600 --> 03:19:54,080
this um and where security is positioned

5158
03:19:54,080 --> 03:19:55,520
with the organization

5159
03:19:55,520 --> 03:19:56,640
but

5160
03:19:56,640 --> 03:19:58,160
formal and informal authority is

5161
03:19:58,160 --> 03:19:59,279
something you need to consider when

5162
03:19:59,279 --> 03:20:00,960
you're managing stakeholder dynamics and

5163
03:20:00,960 --> 03:20:01,840
whether

5164
03:20:01,840 --> 03:20:04,399
um you know whether to which type of

5165
03:20:04,399 --> 03:20:05,680
power to use when you're when you're

5166
03:20:05,680 --> 03:20:08,319
addressing problems in the organization

5167
03:20:08,319 --> 03:20:09,359
so

5168
03:20:09,359 --> 03:20:12,080
um one of the the formal sort of

5169
03:20:12,080 --> 03:20:14,479
authorities is policy and this can be

5170
03:20:14,479 --> 03:20:16,960
super super super boring but it's one of

5171
03:20:16,960 --> 03:20:18,479
the most important pieces of formal

5172
03:20:18,479 --> 03:20:20,000
authority you can have

5173
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:21,840
uh it's really important to have your

5174
03:20:21,840 --> 03:20:24,000
policies documented published where

5175
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:25,840
they're accessible and endorsed by

5176
03:20:25,840 --> 03:20:27,040
someone up

5177
03:20:27,040 --> 03:20:29,920
as far up the organization as you can

5178
03:20:29,920 --> 03:20:31,439
it also needs to be communicated and

5179
03:20:31,439 --> 03:20:33,359
supported by the executive organization

5180
03:20:33,359 --> 03:20:35,760
because the simple fact is it's really

5181
03:20:35,760 --> 03:20:38,560
hard to get stuff done without policy

5182
03:20:38,560 --> 03:20:40,640
and if you don't have policy to affect

5183
03:20:40,640 --> 03:20:44,399
any change you need to rely on culture

5184
03:20:45,040 --> 03:20:46,399
so

5185
03:20:46,399 --> 03:20:48,239
um

5186
03:20:48,239 --> 03:20:49,920
while policy is important like culture

5187
03:20:49,920 --> 03:20:52,319
is probably i would argue more important

5188
03:20:52,319 --> 03:20:54,560
and the way i describe culture is how

5189
03:20:54,560 --> 03:20:56,160
the organization behaves when there are

5190
03:20:56,160 --> 03:20:58,479
no formal structures to guide them

5191
03:20:58,479 --> 03:21:00,080
uh you know where policy is formal

5192
03:21:00,080 --> 03:21:01,200
authority

5193
03:21:01,200 --> 03:21:02,080
um

5194
03:21:02,080 --> 03:21:03,760
having that informal authority and

5195
03:21:03,760 --> 03:21:05,200
building culture will get through any

5196
03:21:05,200 --> 03:21:07,439
policy problems

5197
03:21:07,439 --> 03:21:09,120
the organization

5198
03:21:09,120 --> 03:21:10,960
where the sizer had no security policy

5199
03:21:10,960 --> 03:21:13,120
was basically looking at five to ten

5200
03:21:13,120 --> 03:21:15,520
years of building co building culture to

5201
03:21:15,520 --> 03:21:17,920
overcome the lack of security policy but

5202
03:21:17,920 --> 03:21:18,960
a good

5203
03:21:18,960 --> 03:21:21,600
a good culture will impact you know

5204
03:21:21,600 --> 03:21:23,120
how much influence operations you need

5205
03:21:23,120 --> 03:21:25,279
to do within the company and increase i

5206
03:21:25,279 --> 03:21:26,960
think increase your chances of success

5207
03:21:26,960 --> 03:21:30,080
as a security team

5208
03:21:33,840 --> 03:21:35,359
another thing you should really do if

5209
03:21:35,359 --> 03:21:37,600
you're in the security team is is get to

5210
03:21:37,600 --> 03:21:39,920
know your security your organization's

5211
03:21:39,920 --> 03:21:41,680
procurement processes

5212
03:21:41,680 --> 03:21:42,720
so

5213
03:21:42,720 --> 03:21:44,319
in in some

5214
03:21:44,319 --> 03:21:46,000
organizations there can be quite lacks

5215
03:21:46,000 --> 03:21:48,000
particularly in smaller ones but

5216
03:21:48,000 --> 03:21:49,840
in government or regulated industries it

5217
03:21:49,840 --> 03:21:51,279
can be more challenging because of those

5218
03:21:51,279 --> 03:21:53,760
principal agent problems i mentioned so

5219
03:21:53,760 --> 03:21:55,439
if you want to get stuff done if you

5220
03:21:55,439 --> 03:21:57,680
want to put a new technology in or

5221
03:21:57,680 --> 03:21:58,960
whatever else

5222
03:21:58,960 --> 03:22:00,960
get to know who can approve what what

5223
03:22:00,960 --> 03:22:02,960
their delegations of authority are

5224
03:22:02,960 --> 03:22:05,040
what artifacts or justifications you

5225
03:22:05,040 --> 03:22:07,439
need to get through those approval gates

5226
03:22:07,439 --> 03:22:08,960
and also get your vendor to help you

5227
03:22:08,960 --> 03:22:10,800
through this process so

5228
03:22:10,800 --> 03:22:12,479
i'm not saying that you you need to

5229
03:22:12,479 --> 03:22:14,800
circumvent it but certainly

5230
03:22:14,800 --> 03:22:16,399
it'll maximize your opportunities to

5231
03:22:16,399 --> 03:22:20,278
improve your security posture

5232
03:22:20,560 --> 03:22:21,520
um

5233
03:22:21,520 --> 03:22:24,880
right lastly is just get to know

5234
03:22:24,880 --> 03:22:27,520
everyone in your organization um and the

5235
03:22:27,520 --> 03:22:29,439
team you're working with go have coffee

5236
03:22:29,439 --> 03:22:30,880
with them if you can i know you're all

5237
03:22:30,880 --> 03:22:33,200
probably working remotely now

5238
03:22:33,200 --> 03:22:34,640
make sure you have those water cooler

5239
03:22:34,640 --> 03:22:36,640
conversations not just with security

5240
03:22:36,640 --> 03:22:40,319
team but legal hrit executives

5241
03:22:40,319 --> 03:22:42,000
because when you get to know them you

5242
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:43,359
get the gossip of what's happening

5243
03:22:43,359 --> 03:22:44,640
around the business

5244
03:22:44,640 --> 03:22:46,160
and you won't get blindsided by any

5245
03:22:46,160 --> 03:22:49,600
initiatives that impact security

5246
03:22:49,600 --> 03:22:51,439
it'll also help you understand those

5247
03:22:51,439 --> 03:22:54,000
inter organizational relationships and

5248
03:22:54,000 --> 03:22:56,319
you know who has the principle and agent

5249
03:22:56,319 --> 03:22:58,239
roles in in various

5250
03:22:58,239 --> 03:23:00,560
parts of the organization so once you

5251
03:23:00,560 --> 03:23:02,640
able to understand those interests that

5252
03:23:02,640 --> 03:23:04,399
are going on and who's

5253
03:23:04,399 --> 03:23:07,680
uh you know who's leveraging what to

5254
03:23:07,680 --> 03:23:09,200
achieve their own goals you're probably

5255
03:23:09,200 --> 03:23:10,800
better off

5256
03:23:10,800 --> 03:23:12,160
navigating the different political

5257
03:23:12,160 --> 03:23:13,520
structures and get better security

5258
03:23:13,520 --> 03:23:17,000
outcomes as well

5259
03:23:17,520 --> 03:23:20,160
any questions

5260
03:23:23,040 --> 03:23:24,960
i think that was an awesome talk to

5261
03:23:24,960 --> 03:23:26,720
start talking about some of the

5262
03:23:26,720 --> 03:23:27,920
i think one of the things we always try

5263
03:23:27,920 --> 03:23:29,680
and do in comfycon is to talk about the

5264
03:23:29,680 --> 03:23:31,120
things that are not directly like

5265
03:23:31,120 --> 03:23:32,960
technology related

5266
03:23:32,960 --> 03:23:34,399
and a lot of the things you've talked

5267
03:23:34,399 --> 03:23:36,160
about there are things that i'm sure

5268
03:23:36,160 --> 03:23:38,080
everyone has seen i know the project

5269
03:23:38,080 --> 03:23:39,120
manager

5270
03:23:39,120 --> 03:23:40,479
who

5271
03:23:40,479 --> 03:23:42,239
then does security right at the end and

5272
03:23:42,239 --> 03:23:43,840
say oh surely you should be able to do

5273
03:23:43,840 --> 03:23:45,520
that in 15 minutes and not actually

5274
03:23:45,520 --> 03:23:47,840
involve us and i'm just like i'm sorry

5275
03:23:47,840 --> 03:23:48,880
what

5276
03:23:48,880 --> 03:23:52,080
that's not a thing we can do um

5277
03:23:52,080 --> 03:23:53,520
that is uh

5278
03:23:53,520 --> 03:23:55,279
you would have had to involve us during

5279
03:23:55,279 --> 03:23:56,960
the design time and then it would have

5280
03:23:56,960 --> 03:23:58,640
taken 15 minutes but because you've

5281
03:23:58,640 --> 03:24:00,560
engaged as now it's like

5282
03:24:00,560 --> 03:24:03,200
crap i know of exactly a project that i

5283
03:24:03,200 --> 03:24:04,399
did that and i had to do it over

5284
03:24:04,399 --> 03:24:05,920
christmas and

5285
03:24:05,920 --> 03:24:08,880
develop the sod the sower and all those

5286
03:24:08,880 --> 03:24:11,359
iraq documentation over christmas

5287
03:24:11,359 --> 03:24:13,840
because the capability needed it so

5288
03:24:13,840 --> 03:24:16,720
um i think it's really important

5289
03:24:16,720 --> 03:24:17,920
ignore them

5290
03:24:17,920 --> 03:24:20,399
i think it highlights surprisingly more

5291
03:24:20,399 --> 03:24:21,680
common

5292
03:24:21,680 --> 03:24:23,359
yeah i think it's more common than you

5293
03:24:23,359 --> 03:24:25,760
think um project teams you need the

5294
03:24:25,760 --> 03:24:27,760
probably the uh the dirtiest ones you

5295
03:24:27,760 --> 03:24:29,200
need to keep your eye on them all the

5296
03:24:29,200 --> 03:24:30,720
time

5297
03:24:30,720 --> 03:24:32,479
um and that's why you know talking to

5298
03:24:32,479 --> 03:24:34,239
stakeholders is really important just

5299
03:24:34,239 --> 03:24:36,160
always get to know them get to know

5300
03:24:36,160 --> 03:24:37,600
what's going on figure out where the

5301
03:24:37,600 --> 03:24:39,439
change is coming because that's what

5302
03:24:39,439 --> 03:24:40,640
i'll get you

5303
03:24:40,640 --> 03:24:42,560
security being proactive right going in

5304
03:24:42,560 --> 03:24:44,399
and asking these questions and saying

5305
03:24:44,399 --> 03:24:45,920
look what are you working on how can we

5306
03:24:45,920 --> 03:24:47,200
help you rather than assuming that

5307
03:24:47,200 --> 03:24:48,720
things are going to come to you i mean

5308
03:24:48,720 --> 03:24:50,479
in a perfect world if you have the right

5309
03:24:50,479 --> 03:24:53,200
processes they will but also you can't

5310
03:24:53,200 --> 03:24:54,800
assume that because some people

5311
03:24:54,800 --> 03:24:56,160
no matter where they are they will

5312
03:24:56,160 --> 03:24:57,760
always say security will slow me down

5313
03:24:57,760 --> 03:24:59,040
therefore i'm not going to engage them

5314
03:24:59,040 --> 03:25:02,000
and have a conversation with them

5315
03:25:02,319 --> 03:25:04,479
yeah i think that's a function of their

5316
03:25:04,479 --> 03:25:06,720
um prior experiences so you know if

5317
03:25:06,720 --> 03:25:08,880
they've had experiences where it has

5318
03:25:08,880 --> 03:25:10,720
slowed them down before

5319
03:25:10,720 --> 03:25:12,720
um they're less likely to engage but i

5320
03:25:12,720 --> 03:25:13,439
think

5321
03:25:13,439 --> 03:25:15,520
uh you know again about

5322
03:25:15,520 --> 03:25:16,800
you know

5323
03:25:16,800 --> 03:25:18,800
making your the security processes where

5324
03:25:18,800 --> 03:25:20,399
you know how you engage with the project

5325
03:25:20,399 --> 03:25:22,560
teams as frictionless as possible i

5326
03:25:22,560 --> 03:25:25,200
think is the best way to do it and just

5327
03:25:25,200 --> 03:25:27,439
make make process exceptions hard for

5328
03:25:27,439 --> 03:25:29,200
them so they naturally sort of come to

5329
03:25:29,200 --> 03:25:32,399
you and do the right thing

5330
03:25:32,880 --> 03:25:35,359
absolutely um look thanks very much ben

5331
03:25:35,359 --> 03:25:36,640
it was great to have you and again if

5332
03:25:36,640 --> 03:25:39,760

thanks everyone

5340
03:25:55,520 --> 03:25:56,880
they're barking because the delivery

5341
03:25:56,880 --> 03:25:58,640
just arrived because someone decided

5342
03:25:58,640 --> 03:26:00,160
they wanted food

5343
03:26:00,160 --> 03:26:01,600
so

5344
03:26:01,600 --> 03:26:03,600
that's probably good timing it is good

5345
03:26:03,600 --> 03:26:06,160
timing what what for

5346
03:26:06,160 --> 03:26:07,520
oh for food

5347
03:26:07,520 --> 03:26:10,720
yeah yeah maybe not yeah

5348
03:26:10,720 --> 03:26:13,120
uh someone reminded me in the um oh no

5349
03:26:13,120 --> 03:26:14,880
he's a bit wet um

5350
03:26:14,880 --> 03:26:17,359
why is the bear wet that is not a

5351
03:26:17,359 --> 03:26:20,399
question i want to know the answer to

5352
03:26:20,399 --> 03:26:23,120
this it's very cute listen

5353
03:26:23,120 --> 03:26:24,880
yeah oh okay

5354
03:26:24,880 --> 03:26:27,200
he's been drinking my espresso martini

5355
03:26:27,200 --> 03:26:28,720
with me

5356
03:26:28,720 --> 03:26:30,720
i heard robbie has a and a call for

5357
03:26:30,720 --> 03:26:32,800
papers open at the moment therapy does

5358
03:26:32,800 --> 03:26:34,160
have a call for papers open at the

5359
03:26:34,160 --> 03:26:36,560
moment and dropy will be accepting those

5360
03:26:36,560 --> 03:26:38,880
call for papers in august and the

5361
03:26:38,880 --> 03:26:40,880
conference is in september and it is a

5362
03:26:40,880 --> 03:26:44,239
super fun in-person conference

5363
03:26:44,239 --> 03:26:47,359
conferences with the acronym cc are

5364
03:26:47,359 --> 03:26:48,720
generally

5365
03:26:48,720 --> 03:26:51,040
 awesome i think there's three of

5366
03:26:51,040 --> 03:26:52,800
them i can't remember the third one but

5367
03:26:52,800 --> 03:26:55,279
i vaguely recall there's a third one in

5368
03:26:55,279 --> 03:26:57,520
australia

5369
03:26:57,520 --> 03:26:58,960
it can't be that important than if we

5370
03:26:58,960 --> 03:27:00,319
don't know no

5371
03:27:00,319 --> 03:27:02,080
obviously not the other thing to remind

5372
03:27:02,080 --> 03:27:03,840
people is that besides melbourne have

5373
03:27:03,840 --> 03:27:05,279
also just announced their dates as well

5374
03:27:05,279 --> 03:27:07,359
which just so happened to be the weekend

5375
03:27:07,359 --> 03:27:09,439
after uh

5376
03:27:09,439 --> 03:27:12,160
crikeycon therefore keep an eye out for

5377
03:27:12,160 --> 03:27:14,319
the call for papers and the tickets

5378
03:27:14,319 --> 03:27:16,000
going out for that one that's going to

5379
03:27:16,000 --> 03:27:18,399
be amazing

5380
03:27:18,399 --> 03:27:19,600
i

5381
03:27:19,600 --> 03:27:22,000
may go to both i don't know i think you

5382
03:27:22,000 --> 03:27:24,319
should i think we need to do some kind

5383
03:27:24,319 --> 03:27:25,600
of

5384
03:27:25,600 --> 03:27:27,040
some kind of talk together you're going

5385
03:27:27,040 --> 03:27:29,200
to make me do a talk together yes okay

5386
03:27:29,200 --> 03:27:31,439
yeah i think i think that would be um

5387
03:27:31,439 --> 03:27:32,560
that'll be worthwhile you can bring your

5388
03:27:32,560 --> 03:27:34,000
scooter there's heaps of scooters up in

5389
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:35,279
brisbane though i don't think i'm

5390
03:27:35,279 --> 03:27:36,960
allowed to take the scooter on the plane

5391
03:27:36,960 --> 03:27:38,960
we'll just hire them okay we'll just

5392
03:27:38,960 --> 03:27:42,319
highlight it

5393
03:27:42,319 --> 03:27:44,960
definitely both conferences are going to

5394
03:27:44,960 --> 03:27:45,680
be

5395
03:27:45,680 --> 03:27:48,640

5398
03:27:53,520 --> 03:27:54,800
also awesome as well and they're

5399
03:27:54,800 --> 03:27:57,680
happening soon as well i think

5400
03:27:57,680 --> 03:28:00,560
uh yeah they announced that

5401
03:28:00,560 --> 03:28:02,479

we

5407

present dan hoody is sitting next to me

5409
03:28:17,520 --> 03:28:18,960

yeah i'm gonna

5417
03:28:33,680 --> 03:28:35,840
just because i wanna stress to people

5418
03:28:35,840 --> 03:28:38,560
watching and people who maybe haven't

5419
03:28:38,560 --> 03:28:41,520
put in a paper for comfy con in the past

5420
03:28:41,520 --> 03:28:43,840
and they're a little bit afraid

5421
03:28:43,840 --> 03:28:46,319
if you want to record your talk

5422
03:28:46,319 --> 03:28:49,040
beforehand we're more than happy for you

5423
03:28:49,040 --> 03:28:50,960
to record your talk and get some

5424
03:28:50,960 --> 03:28:53,120
feedback or so you don't need to be

5425
03:28:53,120 --> 03:28:56,239
doing it on the fly that is so cool

5426
03:28:56,239 --> 03:28:58,000
if you don't want to have your video on

5427
03:28:58,000 --> 03:28:59,600
you don't need to have your video on

5428
03:28:59,600 --> 03:29:01,040
like whatever is going to make you

5429
03:29:01,040 --> 03:29:02,880
comfortable to share what you would like

5430
03:29:02,880 --> 03:29:04,880
to share so yeah that was just a little

5431
03:29:04,880 --> 03:29:06,800
bit i wanted to add in

5432
03:29:06,800 --> 03:29:08,319
that is fair and look now that we've

5433
03:29:08,319 --> 03:29:10,160
worked out technology that actually kind

5434
03:29:10,160 --> 03:29:12,239
of works a bit better with videos zoom

5435
03:29:12,239 --> 03:29:14,319
was not working well with videos it was

5436
03:29:14,319 --> 03:29:16,080
not working at all but now we didn't

5437
03:29:16,080 --> 03:29:17,600
have audio streaming

5438
03:29:17,600 --> 03:29:18,840
and not audio

5439
03:29:18,840 --> 03:29:21,520
yeah thank you thank you

5440
03:29:21,520 --> 03:29:23,200
thank you

5441
03:29:23,200 --> 03:29:25,279
so without further ado we will hand over

5442
03:29:25,279 --> 03:29:27,439
to those two

5443
03:29:27,439 --> 03:29:28,720
hi

5444
03:29:28,720 --> 03:29:31,040
i'm katniss melb

5445
03:29:31,040 --> 03:29:33,760
and i'm hoodie pony here to share some

5446
03:29:33,760 --> 03:29:37,200
parables for self-care

5447
03:29:37,600 --> 03:29:39,840
we begin today by acknowledging the

5448
03:29:39,840 --> 03:29:42,479
traditional custodians of unseated land

5449
03:29:42,479 --> 03:29:45,520
upon which we present from today

5450
03:29:45,520 --> 03:29:49,279
and pay our respects to the eldest past

5451
03:29:49,279 --> 03:29:52,239
present and upcoming

5452
03:29:52,239 --> 03:29:54,399
we extend that respect to aboriginal and

5453
03:29:54,399 --> 03:29:57,200
torres strait islanders here today

5454
03:29:57,200 --> 03:29:59,680
from war stories shared with us

5455
03:29:59,680 --> 03:30:00,840
learn from these

5456
03:30:00,840 --> 03:30:03,760
experiences and hopefully you would do

5457
03:30:03,760 --> 03:30:06,479
better than these cautionary tales

5458
03:30:06,479 --> 03:30:09,679
shared here today

5459
03:30:13,680 --> 03:30:15,760
why are we doing this

5460
03:30:15,760 --> 03:30:17,359
as we've been working from offices for

5461
03:30:17,359 --> 03:30:19,600
the past couple of hundreds of years

5462
03:30:19,600 --> 03:30:22,080
there are cultural expectations and

5463
03:30:22,080 --> 03:30:23,760
safety differences

5464
03:30:23,760 --> 03:30:25,600
working from home

5465
03:30:25,600 --> 03:30:28,880
often overlooked

5466
03:30:29,040 --> 03:30:31,279
remote work and working from home is the

5467
03:30:31,279 --> 03:30:33,520
new normal

5468
03:30:33,520 --> 03:30:36,000
as kovit practically ended the physical

5469
03:30:36,000 --> 03:30:38,560
constraints of the traditional 30 mile

5470
03:30:38,560 --> 03:30:39,920
radius

5471
03:30:39,920 --> 03:30:43,239
to the office

5472
03:30:44,080 --> 03:30:46,800
with new opportunities brought by new

5473
03:30:46,800 --> 03:30:47,760
remote

5474
03:30:47,760 --> 03:30:50,080
digital centric environments

5475
03:30:50,080 --> 03:30:54,640
different and new hazards surfaces

5476
03:30:54,640 --> 03:30:56,720
there is a lot of resources out there to

5477
03:30:56,720 --> 03:31:00,239
help organizations survive

5478
03:31:00,399 --> 03:31:01,279
but

5479
03:31:01,279 --> 03:31:02,640
what about us

5480
03:31:02,640 --> 03:31:04,960
the worker

5481
03:31:04,960 --> 03:31:08,160
the changing landscape of work resulting

5482
03:31:08,160 --> 03:31:10,080
in common pitfalls

5483
03:31:10,080 --> 03:31:13,040
with workplace culture mental health and

5484
03:31:13,040 --> 03:31:15,920
cyber security burnout we feel compelled

5485
03:31:15,920 --> 03:31:19,760
to bring this into conversation

5486
03:31:19,760 --> 03:31:21,200
legally the

5487
03:31:21,200 --> 03:31:23,040
the company's obligations are to its

5488
03:31:23,040 --> 03:31:25,279
shareholders so we

5489
03:31:25,279 --> 03:31:28,000
individuals need to make our own efforts

5490
03:31:28,000 --> 03:31:30,560
to keep ourselves safe

5491
03:31:30,560 --> 03:31:31,920
survive

5492
03:31:31,920 --> 03:31:34,319
and thrive

5493
03:31:34,319 --> 03:31:35,279
us

5494
03:31:35,279 --> 03:31:36,960
we are sharing a few parables and

5495
03:31:36,960 --> 03:31:38,560
lessons learned

5496
03:31:38,560 --> 03:31:40,880
to help kick-start this conversation

5497
03:31:40,880 --> 03:31:42,720
with you

5498
03:31:42,720 --> 03:31:47,200
but before that a quick disclaimer

5499
03:31:47,200 --> 03:31:49,200
these stories do not represent any

5500
03:31:49,200 --> 03:31:51,279
specific individuals and any

5501
03:31:51,279 --> 03:31:56,000
similarities may be purely coincidental

5502
03:31:56,000 --> 03:31:57,120
stories

5503
03:31:57,120 --> 03:31:58,960
are sometimes told in the first person

5504
03:31:58,960 --> 03:32:01,200
for narrative purposes

5505
03:32:01,200 --> 03:32:03,359
and do not necessarily represent

5506
03:32:03,359 --> 03:32:05,279
personal experience

5507
03:32:05,279 --> 03:32:08,399
these may also be similar experiences

5508
03:32:08,399 --> 03:32:11,120
which we have heard from others and

5509
03:32:11,120 --> 03:32:14,000
mulligated them into the stories we tell

5510
03:32:14,000 --> 03:32:16,080
today

5511
03:32:16,080 --> 03:32:17,439
well

5512
03:32:17,439 --> 03:32:19,359
i'm a dog so

5513
03:32:19,359 --> 03:32:21,120
yeah

5514
03:32:21,120 --> 03:32:23,200
with that in mind

5515
03:32:23,200 --> 03:32:26,640
let's start with pre-employment

5516
03:32:26,640 --> 03:32:30,160
so for our first case study

5517
03:32:30,160 --> 03:32:32,239
the ease of recruiting online and

5518
03:32:32,239 --> 03:32:34,880
setting up of virtual offices

5519
03:32:34,880 --> 03:32:37,359
makes it difficult to ascertain whether

5520
03:32:37,359 --> 03:32:40,160
a recruiter posting jobs for a new local

5521
03:32:40,160 --> 03:32:43,040
company in an online portal is the real

5522
03:32:43,040 --> 03:32:44,239
deal

5523
03:32:44,239 --> 03:32:47,120
this particular case is about a person

5524
03:32:47,120 --> 03:32:50,000
who was recruited via a local australian

5525
03:32:50,000 --> 03:32:53,200
online job portal and was told that

5526
03:32:53,200 --> 03:32:55,520
they'll be helping set up a new company

5527
03:32:55,520 --> 03:32:56,800
here

5528
03:32:56,800 --> 03:32:59,840
as the first local hire they were hired

5529
03:32:59,840 --> 03:33:03,359
they were expected to work 100 from home

5530
03:33:03,359 --> 03:33:05,840
and was promised the flexibility to help

5531
03:33:05,840 --> 03:33:07,439
grow the company

5532
03:33:07,439 --> 03:33:09,680
part of the growth challenges was the

5533
03:33:09,680 --> 03:33:10,560
need

5534
03:33:10,560 --> 03:33:13,920
to use the new employees personal bank

5535
03:33:13,920 --> 03:33:16,319
account as the receiving account for a

5536
03:33:16,319 --> 03:33:18,640
commission-based transaction and do a

5537
03:33:18,640 --> 03:33:20,319
fund transfer

5538
03:33:20,319 --> 03:33:23,760
it turned out that it was a fake company

5539
03:33:23,760 --> 03:33:25,840
that was recruiting people

5540
03:33:25,840 --> 03:33:29,520
and using them as money mules

5541
03:33:29,840 --> 03:33:32,960
what can we learn from this first

5542
03:33:32,960 --> 03:33:35,359
watch out for job offers that are too

5543
03:33:35,359 --> 03:33:37,520
good to be true

5544
03:33:37,520 --> 03:33:40,399
second do your due diligence

5545
03:33:40,399 --> 03:33:41,200
check

5546
03:33:41,200 --> 03:33:44,560
background and the company we go

5547
03:33:44,560 --> 03:33:47,040
and then when applying for jobs

5548
03:33:47,040 --> 03:33:48,880
not only should you keep track of the

5549
03:33:48,880 --> 03:33:51,520
job description and company details

5550
03:33:51,520 --> 03:33:53,920
keep a record of the job ad

5551
03:33:53,920 --> 03:33:56,399
should things turn out to be dodgy you

5552
03:33:56,399 --> 03:33:59,120
can report the scam job ad and recruiter

5553
03:33:59,120 --> 03:34:02,239
to the local australian job portal

5554
03:34:02,239 --> 03:34:05,040
and lastly report this to the police and

5555
03:34:05,040 --> 03:34:07,760
to the bank

5556
03:34:08,560 --> 03:34:11,680
now for the second case study

5557
03:34:11,680 --> 03:34:14,399
during the interview process a job

5558
03:34:14,399 --> 03:34:16,800
description for the role was only

5559
03:34:16,800 --> 03:34:19,200
provided during the later stages of the

5560
03:34:19,200 --> 03:34:20,800
interview process

5561
03:34:20,800 --> 03:34:22,880
with the applicant shock they were

5562
03:34:22,880 --> 03:34:24,960
expected to perform the equivalent

5563
03:34:24,960 --> 03:34:27,439
workload of several roles

5564
03:34:27,439 --> 03:34:30,239
both on the defensive and offensive

5565
03:34:30,239 --> 03:34:32,960
security sides it was then made clear to

5566
03:34:32,960 --> 03:34:34,960
them that they were to perform

5567
03:34:34,960 --> 03:34:37,439
their defensive security duties during

5568
03:34:37,439 --> 03:34:40,720
business hours and expected to deliver

5569
03:34:40,720 --> 03:34:43,120
additional offensive

5570
03:34:43,120 --> 03:34:45,359
security duties such as pen testing

5571
03:34:45,359 --> 03:34:47,200
after hours

5572
03:34:47,200 --> 03:34:49,279
even if you are working from home

5573
03:34:49,279 --> 03:34:51,439
and you don't need to commute to and

5574
03:34:51,439 --> 03:34:52,880
from the office

5575
03:34:52,880 --> 03:34:56,080
this set of expectations is unfair and

5576
03:34:56,080 --> 03:34:57,840
unreasonable

5577
03:34:57,840 --> 03:35:00,160
what can we learn from this

5578
03:35:00,160 --> 03:35:02,560
first understand what are the typical

5579
03:35:02,560 --> 03:35:05,359
expectations from an employer

5580
03:35:05,359 --> 03:35:07,600
negotiate to have your scope of work to

5581
03:35:07,600 --> 03:35:09,600
be defined properly

5582
03:35:09,600 --> 03:35:12,720
be willing to walk away if the potential

5583
03:35:12,720 --> 03:35:15,760
employer wouldn't budge

5584
03:35:15,760 --> 03:35:16,960
second

5585
03:35:16,960 --> 03:35:20,160
if you still decide to go for a job that

5586
03:35:20,160 --> 03:35:22,640
requires five people to do it

5587
03:35:22,640 --> 03:35:26,560
clarify immediately about the work hours

5588
03:35:26,560 --> 03:35:29,279
we have national employment standards in

5589
03:35:29,279 --> 03:35:33,600
australia that govern our hours of work

5590
03:35:33,600 --> 03:35:35,680
next let's talk about some leading

5591
03:35:35,680 --> 03:35:39,680
indicators you can use pre-employment

5592
03:35:39,680 --> 03:35:40,960
sometime in the past during the

5593
03:35:40,960 --> 03:35:43,040
recruitment process there was an

5594
03:35:43,040 --> 03:35:45,439
internal hr person which

5595
03:35:45,439 --> 03:35:47,040
after locking in

5596
03:35:47,040 --> 03:35:49,200
time for an interview canceled the

5597
03:35:49,200 --> 03:35:52,399
interview asking for a reschedule

5598
03:35:52,399 --> 03:35:54,960
eventually after a few reschedules we

5599
03:35:54,960 --> 03:35:56,880
nailed down a time for an initial

5600
03:35:56,880 --> 03:35:59,439
interview

5601
03:35:59,439 --> 03:36:01,600
after that the conversation progressed

5602
03:36:01,600 --> 03:36:03,600
with the hiring manager

5603
03:36:03,600 --> 03:36:05,760
which mentioned that well i was a good

5604
03:36:05,760 --> 03:36:07,520
candidate a good fit for the

5605
03:36:07,520 --> 03:36:10,800
organization until that hey

5606
03:36:10,800 --> 03:36:13,439
we'll like you to get started hr will be

5607
03:36:13,439 --> 03:36:15,680
in touch shortly

5608
03:36:15,680 --> 03:36:16,720
however

5609
03:36:16,720 --> 03:36:18,880
the hr person felt that they didn't have

5610
03:36:18,880 --> 03:36:20,560
enough information

5611
03:36:20,560 --> 03:36:22,720
and over the next few days gave a few

5612
03:36:22,720 --> 03:36:24,720
unscheduled calls

5613
03:36:24,720 --> 03:36:26,479
about an hour

5614
03:36:26,479 --> 03:36:28,560
long with random

5615
03:36:28,560 --> 03:36:31,040
role adjacent trivia questions

5616
03:36:31,040 --> 03:36:33,680
then after some back and forth went

5617
03:36:33,680 --> 03:36:36,160
silent

5618
03:36:36,399 --> 03:36:39,120
any emails asking for a progress update

5619
03:36:39,120 --> 03:36:41,120
went ignored

5620
03:36:41,120 --> 03:36:44,080
and unanswered over more than a month

5621
03:36:44,080 --> 03:36:47,520
well i guess i got ghosted

5622
03:36:47,520 --> 03:36:49,600
many months later

5623
03:36:49,600 --> 03:36:52,720
at an event i ran into some people that

5624
03:36:52,720 --> 03:36:55,359
worked at that organization

5625
03:36:55,359 --> 03:36:56,640
which shared

5626
03:36:56,640 --> 03:36:58,319
more than a few horror stories about

5627
03:36:58,319 --> 03:37:00,640
toxic work environment there

5628
03:37:00,640 --> 03:37:02,720
and that they were bleeding talent

5629
03:37:02,720 --> 03:37:06,720
without being able to hire anyone

5630
03:37:06,720 --> 03:37:10,160
i guess i dodged that bullet

5631
03:37:12,640 --> 03:37:14,640
what can we learn from this

5632
03:37:14,640 --> 03:37:18,399
an interview is a two-way conversation

5633
03:37:18,399 --> 03:37:20,560
when do you think an organization would

5634
03:37:20,560 --> 03:37:23,840
best treat you

5635
03:37:23,920 --> 03:37:25,439
of course when they're trying to sell

5636
03:37:25,439 --> 03:37:28,399
you on joining them

5637
03:37:28,720 --> 03:37:31,840
use this process

5638
03:37:32,239 --> 03:37:34,720
to understand the organization's culture

5639
03:37:34,720 --> 03:37:37,120
especially if they respect you and your

5640
03:37:37,120 --> 03:37:38,880
time

5641
03:37:38,880 --> 03:37:41,359
find out if the organization is indeed a

5642
03:37:41,359 --> 03:37:44,560
good fit for you

5643
03:37:44,560 --> 03:37:46,479
and for how you want to work and the

5644
03:37:46,479 --> 03:37:50,880
culture that you want to be part of

5645
03:37:51,040 --> 03:37:53,200
especially when remote working

5646
03:37:53,200 --> 03:37:55,040
ask for examples of rituals and

5647
03:37:55,040 --> 03:37:57,279
accommodations have put in place to

5648
03:37:57,279 --> 03:37:59,200
support a healthy and balanced remote

5649
03:37:59,200 --> 03:38:02,000
work environment

5650
03:38:02,479 --> 03:38:04,560
at this stage

5651
03:38:04,560 --> 03:38:07,520
you're not if you're not observing

5652
03:38:07,520 --> 03:38:09,920
and experiencing culture or behavior you

5653
03:38:09,920 --> 03:38:11,840
like from the company

5654
03:38:11,840 --> 03:38:14,239
decide if it's worth

5655
03:38:14,239 --> 03:38:17,119
while proceeding

5656
03:38:17,600 --> 03:38:21,520
press your guide and move on if you can

5657
03:38:21,760 --> 03:38:23,439
this may indeed sound like a very

5658
03:38:23,439 --> 03:38:26,319
privileged thing to say but the demand

5659
03:38:26,319 --> 03:38:28,160
for technology professionals and

5660
03:38:28,160 --> 03:38:30,399
especially cyber security professionals

5661
03:38:30,399 --> 03:38:32,800
afford us this privilege

5662
03:38:32,800 --> 03:38:37,479
and your recruiter knows this

5663
03:38:40,319 --> 03:38:42,560
case study for

5664
03:38:42,560 --> 03:38:45,279
as an adult there are obligations that

5665
03:38:45,279 --> 03:38:47,840
must be met like bills to pay

5666
03:38:47,840 --> 03:38:50,560
in an employment situation the employer

5667
03:38:50,560 --> 03:38:52,880
has obligations to pay

5668
03:38:52,880 --> 03:38:55,120
their employees the correct wages within

5669
03:38:55,120 --> 03:38:56,880
the pay period

5670
03:38:56,880 --> 03:38:58,560
when you are not physically in the

5671
03:38:58,560 --> 03:38:59,600
office

5672
03:38:59,600 --> 03:39:01,600
if they forget that you exceed and

5673
03:39:01,600 --> 03:39:04,000
forget to pay your salary this is a

5674
03:39:04,000 --> 03:39:06,319
violation of national employment

5675
03:39:06,319 --> 03:39:07,840
standards

5676
03:39:07,840 --> 03:39:10,479
if this organization is in the field of

5677
03:39:10,479 --> 03:39:11,680
infosec

5678
03:39:11,680 --> 03:39:13,760
and they neglect to fulfill their

5679
03:39:13,760 --> 03:39:15,120
obligation

5680
03:39:15,120 --> 03:39:17,439
to their employees in terms of paying

5681
03:39:17,439 --> 03:39:19,359
their salary on time

5682
03:39:19,359 --> 03:39:22,560
how can you expect them to fulfill their

5683
03:39:22,560 --> 03:39:25,040
obligations to upholding their end to

5684
03:39:25,040 --> 03:39:28,399
you as a client and protect your secrets

5685
03:39:28,399 --> 03:39:31,680
what can we learn from this case study

5686
03:39:31,680 --> 03:39:34,080
first remember that this kind of

5687
03:39:34,080 --> 03:39:37,199
behavior are red flags always check your

5688
03:39:37,199 --> 03:39:38,880
bank account

5689
03:39:38,880 --> 03:39:41,439
remember to also check your super fund

5690
03:39:41,439 --> 03:39:43,680
and check the ado website for the

5691
03:39:43,680 --> 03:39:45,720
deadlines on when the super

5692
03:39:45,720 --> 03:39:48,399
contributions from your employee

5693
03:39:48,399 --> 03:39:50,399
employer are due

5694
03:39:50,399 --> 03:39:52,160
if you're dealing with an international

5695
03:39:52,160 --> 03:39:54,880
company and they say that international

5696
03:39:54,880 --> 03:39:57,439
money transfers take time to clear

5697
03:39:57,439 --> 03:39:59,199
document this

5698
03:39:59,199 --> 03:40:01,840
having delayed salary issues affect not

5699
03:40:01,840 --> 03:40:04,800
just your financial health but also your

5700
03:40:04,800 --> 03:40:07,599
mental health

5701
03:40:07,760 --> 03:40:09,920
our next case study let's talk about

5702
03:40:09,920 --> 03:40:12,160
avoiding the pitfalls

5703
03:40:12,160 --> 03:40:15,199
of invisible work

5704
03:40:16,080 --> 03:40:17,760
within the last week

5705
03:40:17,760 --> 03:40:20,479
how many times have you done work that

5706
03:40:20,479 --> 03:40:22,960
is not your main responsibility or

5707
03:40:22,960 --> 03:40:25,520
deliverable

5708
03:40:25,520 --> 03:40:26,479
now

5709
03:40:26,479 --> 03:40:27,840
of that

5710
03:40:27,840 --> 03:40:30,080
how much of that work

5711
03:40:30,080 --> 03:40:32,720
done is not counted

5712
03:40:32,720 --> 03:40:34,800
against your performance but have found

5713
03:40:34,800 --> 03:40:36,319
that this

5714
03:40:36,319 --> 03:40:38,319
have impacted the amount of time you

5715
03:40:38,319 --> 03:40:42,160
have to work on your main deliverable

5716
03:40:45,680 --> 03:40:48,160
early in the transition to remote work a

5717
03:40:48,160 --> 03:40:50,399
significant portion of the day was taken

5718
03:40:50,399 --> 03:40:52,640
up by filling up paperwork video

5719
03:40:52,640 --> 03:40:55,279
conferences responding to emails and

5720
03:40:55,279 --> 03:40:57,120
slack messages

5721
03:40:57,120 --> 03:40:58,840
from your manager and

5722
03:40:58,840 --> 03:41:01,760
colleagues then taking time out to jump

5723
03:41:01,760 --> 03:41:03,600
into video conferences

5724
03:41:03,600 --> 03:41:05,680
to help your colleagues with questions

5725
03:41:05,680 --> 03:41:07,600
that they may have that may not be

5726
03:41:07,600 --> 03:41:09,040
directly relevant to your main

5727
03:41:09,040 --> 03:41:10,640
deliverable

5728
03:41:10,640 --> 03:41:14,000
because it's well way easier to spend

5729
03:41:14,000 --> 03:41:15,120
time

5730
03:41:15,120 --> 03:41:17,920
in a short call than writing hundreds of

5731
03:41:17,920 --> 03:41:19,359
emails back and forth to figure out

5732
03:41:19,359 --> 03:41:20,640
what's going on

5733
03:41:20,640 --> 03:41:23,040
or that your colleague saw an opening

5734
03:41:23,040 --> 03:41:24,960
opening in your calendar and showed you

5735
03:41:24,960 --> 03:41:26,319
a meeting because well you were

5736
03:41:26,319 --> 03:41:28,160
available

5737
03:41:28,160 --> 03:41:30,160
next thing you realize most of your day

5738
03:41:30,160 --> 03:41:31,680
is gone

5739
03:41:31,680 --> 03:41:34,239
then a bunch of work but

5740
03:41:34,239 --> 03:41:36,800
none of this

5741
03:41:37,600 --> 03:41:39,840
is project specific to the project or

5742
03:41:39,840 --> 03:41:42,000
task that you were supposed to do or

5743
03:41:42,000 --> 03:41:44,800
have been assigned

5744
03:41:47,600 --> 03:41:50,800
but because all of this work

5745
03:41:50,800 --> 03:41:52,319
isn't tracked

5746
03:41:52,319 --> 03:41:54,720
your manager sees the availability and

5747
03:41:54,720 --> 03:41:56,399
assigns you more

5748
03:41:56,399 --> 03:42:00,560
despite already being overloaded

5749
03:42:00,640 --> 03:42:03,439
sounds familiar

5750
03:42:03,840 --> 03:42:05,920
well you've got a case of invisible or

5751
03:42:05,920 --> 03:42:08,479
hidden work

5752
03:42:09,279 --> 03:42:12,399
all too often despite already overloaded

5753
03:42:12,399 --> 03:42:15,359
more gates pulled on and simply told

5754
03:42:15,359 --> 03:42:17,680
better manage your time because all this

5755
03:42:17,680 --> 03:42:20,640
glue work you've done is simply just not

5756
03:42:20,640 --> 03:42:22,960
visible

5757
03:42:22,960 --> 03:42:24,640
this is especially difficult when you're

5758
03:42:24,640 --> 03:42:27,120
not in the same physical space where all

5759
03:42:27,120 --> 03:42:28,960
this work done can be observed

5760
03:42:28,960 --> 03:42:31,960
serendipitously

5761
03:42:32,319 --> 03:42:34,160
extra and specific effort needs to be

5762
03:42:34,160 --> 03:42:37,040
put into making this work visible or

5763
03:42:37,040 --> 03:42:39,120
it'll be an express route to exhaustion

5764
03:42:39,120 --> 03:42:41,840
and burnout

5765
03:42:42,880 --> 03:42:46,479
what can we do to prevent this

5766
03:42:46,880 --> 03:42:50,479
there is no simple answer unfortunately

5767
03:42:50,479 --> 03:42:53,359
as an employee try to make the work you

5768
03:42:53,359 --> 03:42:57,840
do visible to your manager and team

5769
03:42:59,760 --> 03:43:01,760
work with your colleagues

5770
03:43:01,760 --> 03:43:03,600
to be more overt

5771
03:43:03,600 --> 03:43:05,920
with thanking each other for the help

5772
03:43:05,920 --> 03:43:09,840
and participation in glue work

5773
03:43:10,000 --> 03:43:12,239
any successful effort requires a

5774
03:43:12,239 --> 03:43:13,600
partnership

5775
03:43:13,600 --> 03:43:15,840
with both the employee and the employee

5776
03:43:15,840 --> 03:43:18,399
and management to make accommodations or

5777
03:43:18,399 --> 03:43:21,840
a remote friendly workplace

5778
03:43:21,840 --> 03:43:23,680
partnering with the team management

5779
03:43:23,680 --> 03:43:26,560
needs to put affordances in processes

5780
03:43:26,560 --> 03:43:28,239
and rituals to ensure glue work is

5781
03:43:28,239 --> 03:43:29,680
considered

5782
03:43:29,680 --> 03:43:33,800
valued and appreciated

5783
03:43:34,000 --> 03:43:35,760
if you don't have such processes in

5784
03:43:35,760 --> 03:43:36,880
place

5785
03:43:36,880 --> 03:43:39,920
trust and organizational culture will

5786
03:43:39,920 --> 03:43:41,840
quickly suffer

5787
03:43:41,840 --> 03:43:45,680
thus affecting productivity

5788
03:43:46,720 --> 03:43:48,800
corporate culture and the welfare of

5789
03:43:48,800 --> 03:43:50,160
your employees are crucial to the

5790
03:43:50,160 --> 03:43:52,720
organization's success

5791
03:43:52,720 --> 03:43:54,640
especially in today's environment where

5792
03:43:54,640 --> 03:43:56,800
cybersecurity talent is extremely

5793
03:43:56,800 --> 03:43:58,160
constrained

5794
03:43:58,160 --> 03:44:02,199
and under a lot of stress

5795
03:44:02,239 --> 03:44:04,399
when we were physically in the same

5796
03:44:04,399 --> 03:44:05,279
space

5797
03:44:05,279 --> 03:44:07,359
various non-verbal communications helped

5798
03:44:07,359 --> 03:44:09,279
communicate the business

5799
03:44:09,279 --> 03:44:11,520
was functioning well

5800
03:44:11,520 --> 03:44:12,399
but

5801
03:44:12,399 --> 03:44:14,080
with remote

5802
03:44:14,080 --> 03:44:16,080
it is a fundamentally different

5803
03:44:16,080 --> 03:44:19,439
environment with different challenges

5804
03:44:19,439 --> 03:44:21,920
from a management perspective

5805
03:44:21,920 --> 03:44:23,439
put yourself

5806
03:44:23,439 --> 03:44:25,439
into your employees shoes and your

5807
03:44:25,439 --> 03:44:27,920
team's shoes and ask how are you

5808
03:44:27,920 --> 03:44:31,560
supporting your team

5809
03:44:32,720 --> 03:44:34,800
set the example for respecting work-life

5810
03:44:34,800 --> 03:44:36,960
balance and your team's help some

5811
03:44:36,960 --> 03:44:39,680
reflects are don't go asking questions

5812
03:44:39,680 --> 03:44:42,000
in slack during the weekend and expect

5813
03:44:42,000 --> 03:44:46,160
the team members to respond asap

5814
03:44:46,720 --> 03:44:48,560
don't give your team actions on a friday

5815
03:44:48,560 --> 03:44:49,680
afternoon

5816
03:44:49,680 --> 03:44:51,359
knowingly that it will take more than

5817
03:44:51,359 --> 03:44:53,760
the few hours that is remaining and ask

5818
03:44:53,760 --> 03:44:57,760
for a progress update monday morning

5819
03:44:57,760 --> 03:44:58,880
creates an

5820
03:44:58,880 --> 03:45:00,640
undue pressure

5821
03:45:00,640 --> 03:45:05,519
for that person to work over the weekend

5822
03:45:06,479 --> 03:45:07,680
when virtual

5823
03:45:07,680 --> 03:45:09,840
sometimes over communicating especially

5824
03:45:09,840 --> 03:45:12,160
asynchronous asynchronously is

5825
03:45:12,160 --> 03:45:13,760
advantageous

5826
03:45:13,760 --> 03:45:16,880
especially internally

5827
03:45:16,880 --> 03:45:18,720
this helps ensure that the team has all

5828
03:45:18,720 --> 03:45:20,560
the information they need

5829
03:45:20,560 --> 03:45:23,279
to do what they need to do

5830
03:45:23,279 --> 03:45:24,840
also set reasonable

5831
03:45:24,840 --> 03:45:26,640
expectations asynchronous and

5832
03:45:26,640 --> 03:45:29,040
asynchronous communication response

5833
03:45:29,040 --> 03:45:31,680
times and other cultural expectations

5834
03:45:31,680 --> 03:45:33,040
such as

5835
03:45:33,040 --> 03:45:34,080
well

5836
03:45:34,080 --> 03:45:37,120
scheduling meetings

5837
03:45:37,120 --> 03:45:39,199
lastly provide mental health support

5838
03:45:39,199 --> 03:45:40,880
options

5839
03:45:40,880 --> 03:45:43,840
with guidance that it's okay to not be

5840
03:45:43,840 --> 03:45:45,040
okay

5841
03:45:45,040 --> 03:45:48,640
and follow up this guidance with action

5842
03:45:48,640 --> 03:45:51,359
giving the team adequate rest when they

5843
03:45:51,359 --> 03:45:52,319
need it

5844
03:45:52,319 --> 03:45:54,640
the gitlab all remote

5845
03:45:54,640 --> 03:45:56,800
guide is a good reference for on what to

5846
03:45:56,800 --> 03:45:58,640
do

5847
03:45:58,640 --> 03:46:01,920
helen portability is at an all-time high

5848
03:46:01,920 --> 03:46:04,160
burnout and a toxic world

5849
03:46:04,160 --> 03:46:07,040
based culture is a surefire way to

5850
03:46:07,040 --> 03:46:10,239
encourage your employees to move on

5851
03:46:10,239 --> 03:46:12,479
without people to do their work

5852
03:46:12,479 --> 03:46:14,640
running a business becomes quite a bit

5853
03:46:14,640 --> 03:46:16,640
more challenging

5854
03:46:16,640 --> 03:46:19,359
as job seekers and employees

5855
03:46:19,359 --> 03:46:22,239
we need to take care of ourselves and

5856
03:46:22,239 --> 03:46:24,560
support each other

5857
03:46:24,560 --> 03:46:26,720
first don't be afraid to ask around the

5858
03:46:26,720 --> 03:46:29,840
community and ask community members for

5859
03:46:29,840 --> 03:46:31,760
feedback and advice

5860
03:46:31,760 --> 03:46:34,399
good organizations will have positive

5861
03:46:34,399 --> 03:46:36,080
advocates

5862
03:46:36,080 --> 03:46:38,720
don't be afraid to share what you know

5863
03:46:38,720 --> 03:46:40,800
to grow the community's knowledge of

5864
03:46:40,800 --> 03:46:43,840
what's expected and appropriate

5865
03:46:43,840 --> 03:46:46,720
second information sharing is very

5866
03:46:46,720 --> 03:46:48,239
important

5867
03:46:48,239 --> 03:46:51,199
answer salary surveys fill up company

5868
03:46:51,199 --> 03:46:52,800
reviews

5869
03:46:52,800 --> 03:46:56,080
third clarify and get specifics if the

5870
03:46:56,080 --> 03:46:59,520
job description is too broad or unclear

5871
03:46:59,520 --> 03:47:01,920
as what the day-to-day delivery

5872
03:47:01,920 --> 03:47:05,680
expectations are being responsible for

5873
03:47:05,680 --> 03:47:08,880
multiple jobs is a quick way to accept

5874
03:47:08,880 --> 03:47:11,199
to exhaust yourself

5875
03:47:11,199 --> 03:47:12,160
fourth

5876
03:47:12,160 --> 03:47:14,319
read and understand the contract if

5877
03:47:14,319 --> 03:47:16,399
you're going to work for a company based

5878
03:47:16,399 --> 03:47:18,960
overseas find out if you're going to be

5879
03:47:18,960 --> 03:47:22,319
covered by their loss or our loss

5880
03:47:22,319 --> 03:47:25,920
and lastly consider joining a union

5881
03:47:25,920 --> 03:47:28,239
we are stronger together

5882
03:47:28,239 --> 03:47:30,000
join the collective

5883
03:47:30,000 --> 03:47:32,880
find the right union for yourself

5884
03:47:32,880 --> 03:47:35,359
in the wake of this pandemic when we are

5885
03:47:35,359 --> 03:47:37,279
all feeling exhausted

5886
03:47:37,279 --> 03:47:40,080
may the things we have shared help you

5887
03:47:40,080 --> 03:47:42,720
not just survive but trying

5888
03:47:42,720 --> 03:47:45,760
in order to care for others we truly

5889
03:47:45,760 --> 03:47:47,760
need to make sure that we care for

5890
03:47:47,760 --> 03:47:50,560
ourselves too

5891
03:47:50,560 --> 03:47:52,080
remember this

5892
03:47:52,080 --> 03:47:54,239
if companies fail

5893
03:47:54,239 --> 03:47:56,880
company owners move on

5894
03:47:56,880 --> 03:48:01,279
but we only have one life well

5895
03:48:01,279 --> 03:48:04,080
i'm a cat so i have at least eight more

5896
03:48:04,080 --> 03:48:04,670
lives

5897
03:48:04,670 --> 03:48:08,130
[Laughter]

5898
03:48:08,160 --> 03:48:10,560
thank you

5899
03:48:11,359 --> 03:48:13,600
we'll take any questions

5900
03:48:13,600 --> 03:48:16,160
in the chat

5901
03:48:22,000 --> 03:48:24,720
um so as you can see we have animals

5902
03:48:24,720 --> 03:48:25,610
among us

5903
03:48:25,610 --> 03:48:27,359
[Music]

you're not actually meant to shake

5978
03:50:53,600 --> 03:50:55,520
following i mean that kind of ruins my

5979
03:50:55,520 --> 03:50:59,040
entire view of right oh yeah

5980
03:50:59,040 --> 03:51:02,399
what was the band hey yeah it was yeah

5981
03:51:02,399 --> 03:51:04,560
andre

5982
03:51:04,560 --> 03:51:06,160
oh no

5983
03:51:06,160 --> 03:51:08,960
now i've got that's like an outcast yeah

5984
03:51:08,960 --> 03:51:11,279
it's outcast of the band but now i've

5985
03:51:11,279 --> 03:51:13,120
got for some reason i've got the guy who

5986
03:51:13,120 --> 03:51:15,120
did mambo number five stuck in my head

5987
03:51:15,120 --> 03:51:17,680
as well no i don't know why

5988
03:51:17,680 --> 03:51:20,000
that was like five years beforehand

5989
03:51:20,000 --> 03:51:21,439
please no

5990
03:51:21,439 --> 03:51:22,479
uh

5991
03:51:22,479 --> 03:51:25,840
even my dad has messaged me saying don't

5992
03:51:25,840 --> 03:51:26,800
sing

5993
03:51:26,800 --> 03:51:28,800
like that's how much he does not want me

5994
03:51:28,800 --> 03:51:31,279
to sing right now i'm almost tempted to

5995
03:51:31,279 --> 03:51:34,080
be like the rebellious teenager and just

5996
03:51:34,080 --> 03:51:38,000
sing because my dad has told me not to

5997
03:51:38,000 --> 03:51:40,960
like he should know better by now

5998
03:51:40,960 --> 03:51:43,960
um

5999
03:51:44,560 --> 03:51:46,800
first infosec talk with fursuit head on

6000
03:51:46,800 --> 03:51:49,359
look if somebody wants to send a infosec

6001
03:51:49,359 --> 03:51:51,600
talk for the first suit head-on

6002
03:51:51,600 --> 03:51:53,840
i'm sure we'll allow it

6003
03:51:53,840 --> 03:51:55,199
um

6004
03:51:55,199 --> 03:51:57,359
that'd be pretty good um anyway i think

6005
03:51:57,359 --> 03:51:59,680
we've bs

6006
03:51:59,680 --> 03:52:01,760
um enough

6007
03:52:01,760 --> 03:52:02,960
or

6008
03:52:02,960 --> 03:52:04,880
i don't know have we

6009
03:52:04,880 --> 03:52:08,319
i'm just going with the flow today

6010
03:52:08,960 --> 03:52:10,720
you're a mute

6011
03:52:10,720 --> 03:52:13,199
i don't know what's going on

6012
03:52:13,199 --> 03:52:15,040
i'm just gonna keep going anyway well i

6013
03:52:15,040 --> 03:52:16,479
have a little bit of a crisis that i

6014
03:52:16,479 --> 03:52:17,760
need to deal with i'll be back in a

6015
03:52:17,760 --> 03:52:20,960
minute okay you deal with your crisis um

6016
03:52:20,960 --> 03:52:23,120
i will just keep talking for a bit or i

6017
03:52:23,120 --> 03:52:24,479
will introduce our next speaker but i

6018
03:52:24,479 --> 03:52:25,600
really want you to introduce the next

6019
03:52:25,600 --> 03:52:27,199
speaker so i'll just wait

6020
03:52:27,199 --> 03:52:28,960
um

6021
03:52:28,960 --> 03:52:31,199
because the next speaker unfortunately

6022
03:52:31,199 --> 03:52:33,439
has the privilege unfortunately has to

6023
03:52:33,439 --> 03:52:36,000
work with shanna so um

6024
03:52:36,000 --> 03:52:38,640
yes that's very unfortunate for them um

6025
03:52:38,640 --> 03:52:41,279
again a reminder um for all of our

6026
03:52:41,279 --> 03:52:42,880
speakers if you have questions please

6027
03:52:42,880 --> 03:52:45,279
put them in the q and a

6028
03:52:45,279 --> 03:52:48,720
chat in discord um

6029
03:52:48,720 --> 03:52:51,600
also a reminder that you can buy

6030
03:52:51,600 --> 03:52:55,120
conficon merch which now has a variant

6031
03:52:55,120 --> 03:52:58,000
of the t-shirt which has the big

6032
03:52:58,000 --> 03:53:00,560
farming logo we included earlier because

6033
03:53:00,560 --> 03:53:02,080

6034
03:53:02,080 --> 03:53:05,199
farming and big chicken um

6035
03:53:05,199 --> 03:53:06,640

6036
03:53:06,640 --> 03:53:09,199

6092
03:55:02,560 --> 03:55:03,920
briefly share my learnings and

6093
03:55:03,920 --> 03:55:06,319
observations on how my career today has

6094
03:55:06,319 --> 03:55:07,840
led me to my current role in the cyber

6095
03:55:07,840 --> 03:55:10,319
world uh and how i feel that the skills

6096
03:55:10,319 --> 03:55:11,680
i've developed are relevant and

6097
03:55:11,680 --> 03:55:14,800
desirable in the industry

6098
03:55:14,800 --> 03:55:17,040
so to get things started um we need to

6099
03:55:17,040 --> 03:55:18,800
take a step back in time so i'm going to

6100
03:55:18,800 --> 03:55:21,120
try and briefly summarize my relatively

6101
03:55:21,120 --> 03:55:22,720
short career while at the same time

6102
03:55:22,720 --> 03:55:24,399
pointing out some skills and thoughts or

6103
03:55:24,399 --> 03:55:26,239
themes that in hindsight have shaped me

6104
03:55:26,239 --> 03:55:28,399
as a person and helped lead me to where

6105
03:55:28,399 --> 03:55:30,720
i am today um my job was just coming in

6106
03:55:30,720 --> 03:55:32,080
of course

6107
03:55:32,080 --> 03:55:34,479
um so when i was a kid i wanted to be a

6108
03:55:34,479 --> 03:55:35,680
vet

6109
03:55:35,680 --> 03:55:38,080
um i loved animals and i still do but i

6110
03:55:38,080 --> 03:55:39,840
quickly learned that i do not like blood

6111
03:55:39,840 --> 03:55:42,399
or needles and i'm emotional i couldn't

6112
03:55:42,399 --> 03:55:44,479
bear the thought of the sad and serious

6113
03:55:44,479 --> 03:55:47,040
nature of this job

6114
03:55:47,040 --> 03:55:48,640
so then i went on to wanting to be a

6115
03:55:48,640 --> 03:55:51,040
teacher but as the time grew closer to

6116
03:55:51,040 --> 03:55:53,359
deciding where to do work experience i

6117
03:55:53,359 --> 03:55:55,439
met someone who was in hr

6118
03:55:55,439 --> 03:55:57,040
and she said something along the lines

6119
03:55:57,040 --> 03:55:59,520
of hr is like being a teacher except

6120
03:55:59,520 --> 03:56:01,840
instead of kids it's adults

6121
03:56:01,840 --> 03:56:04,160
hot tip don't google image search on

6122
03:56:04,160 --> 03:56:06,720
your work computer baby adult to try and

6123
03:56:06,720 --> 03:56:08,080
find something funny to add to your

6124
03:56:08,080 --> 03:56:09,840
presentation

6125
03:56:09,840 --> 03:56:11,600
so i went on to do work experience at

6126
03:56:11,600 --> 03:56:13,520
her workplace and then on to uni to

6127
03:56:13,520 --> 03:56:16,800
study hr as part of the business degree

6128
03:56:16,800 --> 03:56:18,880
so generally we're taught to decide

6129
03:56:18,880 --> 03:56:20,640
early on what we want to be when we grow

6130
03:56:20,640 --> 03:56:22,399
up and then stick to this we pick

6131
03:56:22,399 --> 03:56:24,399
subjects at school to help us get into a

6132
03:56:24,399 --> 03:56:26,800
good uni and our chosen degree and then

6133
03:56:26,800 --> 03:56:28,160
we get a job in that field and

6134
03:56:28,160 --> 03:56:31,279
eventually we retire in that role

6135
03:56:31,279 --> 03:56:33,040
we are also taught that hard work pays

6136
03:56:33,040 --> 03:56:35,199
off if you want if you work hard you'll

6137
03:56:35,199 --> 03:56:36,479
get ahead

6138
03:56:36,479 --> 03:56:38,960
but realistically and and generally it's

6139
03:56:38,960 --> 03:56:41,199
not what you know but who you know

6140
03:56:41,199 --> 03:56:43,439
and networking

6141
03:56:43,439 --> 03:56:44,720
all right so now i'm getting towards the

6142
03:56:44,720 --> 03:56:46,399
end of my degree and i'm thinking that i

6143
03:56:46,399 --> 03:56:47,840
might like to get some real work

6144
03:56:47,840 --> 03:56:49,760
experience because the

6145
03:56:49,760 --> 03:56:52,319
jobs that i've had at kfc and bonning's

6146
03:56:52,319 --> 03:56:54,960
so far haven't been real enough

6147
03:56:54,960 --> 03:56:57,920
someone i met at uni networking

6148
03:56:57,920 --> 03:57:00,720
offered me to come and work um sorry

6149
03:57:00,720 --> 03:57:01,920
offered for me to come and help out with

6150
03:57:01,920 --> 03:57:03,600
some filing and archiving at her

6151
03:57:03,600 --> 03:57:04,880
workplace

6152
03:57:04,880 --> 03:57:06,160
this happened to be in the accounts

6153
03:57:06,160 --> 03:57:09,040
department um and i got a pass conceded

6154
03:57:09,040 --> 03:57:10,640
for accounting at uni

6155
03:57:10,640 --> 03:57:12,720
uh and this was nowhere near hr

6156
03:57:12,720 --> 03:57:15,199
so again through networking i met

6157
03:57:15,199 --> 03:57:16,880
someone who introduced me to someone

6158
03:57:16,880 --> 03:57:18,800
else and so on until i ended up in a

6159
03:57:18,800 --> 03:57:21,279
data entry benefits administration role

6160
03:57:21,279 --> 03:57:23,359
which was falling loosely under the hr

6161
03:57:23,359 --> 03:57:24,880
umbrella

6162
03:57:24,880 --> 03:57:26,800
so i've made it right i'm technically in

6163
03:57:26,800 --> 03:57:29,680
hr and now i will be forever

6164
03:57:29,680 --> 03:57:30,960
no

6165
03:57:30,960 --> 03:57:32,560
my journey through the world of hr is

6166
03:57:32,560 --> 03:57:34,160
not what i thought it would be and i was

6167
03:57:34,160 --> 03:57:35,840
hung up on this for a while

6168
03:57:35,840 --> 03:57:37,920
i thought i'd be a generalist hr move

6169
03:57:37,920 --> 03:57:39,359
into a specialist role and then a

6170
03:57:39,359 --> 03:57:41,680
strategic hr business partner

6171
03:57:41,680 --> 03:57:43,279
i ended up doing a lot of things that i

6172
03:57:43,279 --> 03:57:45,199
really disliked and swore i'd never do

6173
03:57:45,199 --> 03:57:46,840
again looking at your

6174
03:57:46,840 --> 03:57:48,960
payroll and wondered why i wasn't doing

6175
03:57:48,960 --> 03:57:50,720
a job that i loved

6176
03:57:50,720 --> 03:57:52,560
of course that's normal and of course

6177
03:57:52,560 --> 03:57:53,840
there were times i loved what i was

6178
03:57:53,840 --> 03:57:55,760
doing but i didn't feel like i had found

6179
03:57:55,760 --> 03:57:56,880
my purpose

6180
03:57:56,880 --> 03:57:58,880
i was a hr officer

6181
03:57:58,880 --> 03:58:00,319
and i've since learnt that the role

6182
03:58:00,319 --> 03:58:02,000
title does not always equal what you

6183
03:58:02,000 --> 03:58:03,520
actually do

6184
03:58:03,520 --> 03:58:05,199
i was leading and supporting various

6185
03:58:05,199 --> 03:58:06,960
projects doing a ton of reporting

6186
03:58:06,960 --> 03:58:09,279
becoming a systems sme training new

6187
03:58:09,279 --> 03:58:11,520
starters optimizing and documenting

6188
03:58:11,520 --> 03:58:13,840
processes and then one day i had what i

6189
03:58:13,840 --> 03:58:16,319
call my epiphany it was actually this

6190
03:58:16,319 --> 03:58:18,080
exact type of work a slightly more

6191
03:58:18,080 --> 03:58:20,319
technical side of things projects and

6192
03:58:20,319 --> 03:58:22,479
process improvement that i loved and it

6193
03:58:22,479 --> 03:58:24,640
was the broad nature of hr and that more

6194
03:58:24,640 --> 03:58:26,479
traditional career path that was holding

6195
03:58:26,479 --> 03:58:28,720
you back

6196
03:58:28,720 --> 03:58:30,560
so i started positioning myself towards

6197
03:58:30,560 --> 03:58:33,520
a hr systems or i.t related career path

6198
03:58:33,520 --> 03:58:35,520
i completed a creating course to give me

6199
03:58:35,520 --> 03:58:36,880
a taster for how things work on the

6200
03:58:36,880 --> 03:58:39,199
other side and i tried to unpack what it

6201
03:58:39,199 --> 03:58:40,960
meant to be interested in technology and

6202
03:58:40,960 --> 03:58:42,800
with technique

6203
03:58:42,800 --> 03:58:44,560
and then finally one day through

6204
03:58:44,560 --> 03:58:46,560
networking again an opportunity

6205
03:58:46,560 --> 03:58:48,319
presented itself and i took the leap

6206
03:58:48,319 --> 03:58:49,840
into my current role

6207
03:58:49,840 --> 03:58:52,560
of engagement manager at chiroflect

6208
03:58:52,560 --> 03:58:53,760
where i've been applying many of the

6209
03:58:53,760 --> 03:58:55,760
skills i've developed in my hr career

6210
03:58:55,760 --> 03:58:57,439
while at the same time developing many

6211
03:58:57,439 --> 03:58:59,439
more new skills in this broad technology

6212
03:58:59,439 --> 03:59:03,199
slash i.t cyber world

6213
03:59:03,920 --> 03:59:05,680
so yeah i've set some context around my

6214
03:59:05,680 --> 03:59:07,760
background and i've started to allude to

6215
03:59:07,760 --> 03:59:10,000
some of the transfer transferable skills

6216
03:59:10,000 --> 03:59:10,960
i have

6217
03:59:10,960 --> 03:59:12,560
but what i want to talk about now is

6218
03:59:12,560 --> 03:59:14,479
some comparisons and connections between

6219
03:59:14,479 --> 03:59:16,399
my previous experience and how it

6220
03:59:16,399 --> 03:59:18,399
relates in the cyber world

6221
03:59:18,399 --> 03:59:20,160
i've taken a lot of inspiration from a

6222
03:59:20,160 --> 03:59:22,640
recent talk that our cto frank delivered

6223
03:59:22,640 --> 03:59:24,160
and i've pulled out

6224
03:59:24,160 --> 03:59:25,920
put out some hr and payroll related

6225
03:59:25,920 --> 03:59:27,920
experiences to help to compare this with

6226
03:59:27,920 --> 03:59:30,080
um so i'll go through some of these now

6227
03:59:30,080 --> 03:59:31,760
uh and i know there's a lot of words on

6228
03:59:31,760 --> 03:59:33,760
the screen um but i'll just try and um

6229
03:59:33,760 --> 03:59:36,800
talk to some of these points

6230
03:59:36,800 --> 03:59:39,040
so not being a nine to five role um i've

6231
03:59:39,040 --> 03:59:40,640
come from a background of dealing with

6232
03:59:40,640 --> 03:59:43,199
payroll deadlines ticket slas

6233
03:59:43,199 --> 03:59:45,520
um sometimes having to work late nights

6234
03:59:45,520 --> 03:59:47,600
starting early and then aligning to

6235
03:59:47,600 --> 03:59:49,920
operational staff ship rosters from a hr

6236
03:59:49,920 --> 03:59:52,880
investigation perspective

6237
03:59:52,880 --> 03:59:54,880
which i'm sure is very relatable for

6238
03:59:54,880 --> 03:59:57,120
some um in the i.t inside the world um

6239
03:59:57,120 --> 03:59:58,560
you might be on shift work yourself

6240
03:59:58,560 --> 04:00:00,640
having to work public holidays weekends

6241
04:00:00,640 --> 04:00:01,760
late nights

6242
04:00:01,760 --> 04:00:03,600
uh and then of course the classic friday

6243
04:00:03,600 --> 04:00:06,960
afternoon incident that comes in

6244
04:00:07,279 --> 04:00:10,399
uh a changing and evolving landscape so

6245
04:00:10,399 --> 04:00:12,800
in a hr and payroll perspective um

6246
04:00:12,800 --> 04:00:14,479
there's obviously lots of legislation

6247
04:00:14,479 --> 04:00:17,279
changes to legislation internal policies

6248
04:00:17,279 --> 04:00:19,199
processes being improved

6249
04:00:19,199 --> 04:00:21,600
and then restructures i can't count how

6250
04:00:21,600 --> 04:00:22,880
many restructures i've been through in

6251
04:00:22,880 --> 04:00:24,560
my time

6252
04:00:24,560 --> 04:00:26,960
similarly in cyber um there will be

6253
04:00:26,960 --> 04:00:28,640
ever-changing tools and techniques and

6254
04:00:28,640 --> 04:00:30,239
threat actor methods

6255
04:00:30,239 --> 04:00:31,760
so having

6256
04:00:31,760 --> 04:00:33,680
a keenness to learn and being flexible

6257
04:00:33,680 --> 04:00:37,199
and open to change is important

6258
04:00:37,199 --> 04:00:40,399
generally first specialist role um so

6259
04:00:40,399 --> 04:00:42,640
i've had a fair amount of different

6260
04:00:42,640 --> 04:00:43,760
roles

6261
04:00:43,760 --> 04:00:45,920
in my experience and gained a broader

6262
04:00:45,920 --> 04:00:47,600
operational and business context through

6263
04:00:47,600 --> 04:00:49,199
this which has helped give me an

6264
04:00:49,199 --> 04:00:51,439
understanding of impacts of decisions

6265
04:00:51,439 --> 04:00:52,720
they're being made

6266
04:00:52,720 --> 04:00:54,319
to employees and other parts of the

6267
04:00:54,319 --> 04:00:55,279
business

6268
04:00:55,279 --> 04:00:57,120
so being able to then bring that voice

6269
04:00:57,120 --> 04:00:59,840
to the table where it might not have

6270
04:00:59,840 --> 04:01:02,319
previously been included

6271
04:01:02,319 --> 04:01:04,800
so similarly um in the cyber space

6272
04:01:04,800 --> 04:01:06,479
needing to know it's more than just how

6273
04:01:06,479 --> 04:01:09,359
to do internet response um maybe needing

6274
04:01:09,359 --> 04:01:10,960
a bit of an understanding of how it

6275
04:01:10,960 --> 04:01:14,560
systems work and other related things

6276
04:01:14,560 --> 04:01:16,800
customer emotions and stakeholder

6277
04:01:16,800 --> 04:01:18,319
management so these two kind of roll in

6278
04:01:18,319 --> 04:01:20,640
together a little bit but

6279
04:01:20,640 --> 04:01:22,479
particularly from a payroll perspective

6280
04:01:22,479 --> 04:01:23,760
um

6281
04:01:23,760 --> 04:01:25,120
dealing with people that are quite

6282
04:01:25,120 --> 04:01:26,960
stressed and upset maybe angry and

6283
04:01:26,960 --> 04:01:29,680
confused um you know if they may not

6284
04:01:29,680 --> 04:01:32,000
have been paid correctly or not paid on

6285
04:01:32,000 --> 04:01:34,479
time um there's a sense of urgency that

6286
04:01:34,479 --> 04:01:36,720
comes with this and people will be

6287
04:01:36,720 --> 04:01:38,239
obviously quite upset if they have bills

6288
04:01:38,239 --> 04:01:39,920
to pay and they don't have money in the

6289
04:01:39,920 --> 04:01:40,880
bank

6290
04:01:40,880 --> 04:01:43,680
um so having empathy and professionalism

6291
04:01:43,680 --> 04:01:45,600
and a genuine care to help people

6292
04:01:45,600 --> 04:01:47,520
through these problems

6293
04:01:47,520 --> 04:01:49,840
similarly for an incident this is

6294
04:01:49,840 --> 04:01:51,600
probably the most stressful time for an

6295
04:01:51,600 --> 04:01:53,520
organization they might be facing lots

6296
04:01:53,520 --> 04:01:55,520
of production they might be unable to

6297
04:01:55,520 --> 04:01:57,359
pay their employer employees and

6298
04:01:57,359 --> 04:01:59,680
suppliers um the reputation is going to

6299
04:01:59,680 --> 04:02:01,760
be on the line in some cases and they

6300
04:02:01,760 --> 04:02:03,359
may have just a general fear of the

6301
04:02:03,359 --> 04:02:05,199
unknown they might not be technical and

6302
04:02:05,199 --> 04:02:08,239
not really know what's going on

6303
04:02:08,239 --> 04:02:09,680
so then rolling that into stakeholder

6304
04:02:09,680 --> 04:02:12,640
management and managing expectations um

6305
04:02:12,640 --> 04:02:14,560
this kind of obviously goes across both

6306
04:02:14,560 --> 04:02:17,120
sides here um we're solving problems

6307
04:02:17,120 --> 04:02:19,520
payroll problem um an incident we're

6308
04:02:19,520 --> 04:02:20,640
probably not going to have all the

6309
04:02:20,640 --> 04:02:23,040
answers up front information may be hard

6310
04:02:23,040 --> 04:02:25,040
to get and it may take time to figure

6311
04:02:25,040 --> 04:02:26,479
things out

6312
04:02:26,479 --> 04:02:28,640
so being aware i guess of your potential

6313
04:02:28,640 --> 04:02:30,880
delay in communications if you're

6314
04:02:30,880 --> 04:02:32,319
sitting there working away on something

6315
04:02:32,319 --> 04:02:34,239
and not getting back to somebody that's

6316
04:02:34,239 --> 04:02:36,160
probably going to feel a lot longer to

6317
04:02:36,160 --> 04:02:38,239
them than it does to us

6318
04:02:38,239 --> 04:02:40,319
um but being upfront and honest with

6319
04:02:40,319 --> 04:02:42,399
people is a good way to go about it they

6320
04:02:42,399 --> 04:02:44,560
may not like what we have to say but at

6321
04:02:44,560 --> 04:02:45,439
least

6322
04:02:45,439 --> 04:02:47,199
we're kind of managing their

6323
04:02:47,199 --> 04:02:49,600
expectations of when um things will be

6324
04:02:49,600 --> 04:02:52,160
done and fed back through to them

6325
04:02:52,160 --> 04:02:54,399
and then finally having a great team and

6326
04:02:54,399 --> 04:02:57,279
a support network around you

6327
04:02:57,279 --> 04:02:58,880
it's fantastic having people that you

6328
04:02:58,880 --> 04:03:00,560
can troubleshoot ideas with share your

6329
04:03:00,560 --> 04:03:02,720
knowledge and learn from

6330
04:03:02,720 --> 04:03:04,319
knowing when to have a laugh and also

6331
04:03:04,319 --> 04:03:05,840
when to knuckle down and get the work

6332
04:03:05,840 --> 04:03:08,080
done

6333
04:03:09,840 --> 04:03:13,199
um so just to wrap up then um i need to

6334
04:03:13,199 --> 04:03:15,040
make one final connection

6335
04:03:15,040 --> 04:03:16,880
so when i was preparing my talk i was

6336
04:03:16,880 --> 04:03:18,800
obviously reflecting on my career path

6337
04:03:18,800 --> 04:03:20,319
and conversations that i've had with

6338
04:03:20,319 --> 04:03:22,399
peers and friends over the years and i

6339
04:03:22,399 --> 04:03:23,600
realized that my so-called

6340
04:03:23,600 --> 04:03:25,520
unconventional career path probably

6341
04:03:25,520 --> 04:03:27,680
isn't really all that unconventional

6342
04:03:27,680 --> 04:03:29,680
uh and it's already been mentioned that

6343
04:03:29,680 --> 04:03:31,600
some other people have shared similar

6344
04:03:31,600 --> 04:03:32,960
experiences

6345
04:03:32,960 --> 04:03:35,120
um but i did a quick google image search

6346
04:03:35,120 --> 04:03:36,960
a safe one to try and find something

6347
04:03:36,960 --> 04:03:38,720
that represented this difference between

6348
04:03:38,720 --> 04:03:40,720
whatever this unconventional career path

6349
04:03:40,720 --> 04:03:42,800
is and the traditional career ladder

6350
04:03:42,800 --> 04:03:44,080
because i knew i had seen something

6351
04:03:44,080 --> 04:03:45,279
before

6352
04:03:45,279 --> 04:03:47,279
so i typed in squiggly career path and

6353
04:03:47,279 --> 04:03:49,120
it very quickly became obvious that i'm

6354
04:03:49,120 --> 04:03:50,319
not the first person to make this

6355
04:03:50,319 --> 04:03:52,640
connection um so i've included a couple

6356
04:03:52,640 --> 04:03:54,239
of links and we don't have time to go

6357
04:03:54,239 --> 04:03:56,160
through the video but um these ladies

6358
04:03:56,160 --> 04:03:58,000
helen tupper and sarah ellis have

6359
04:03:58,000 --> 04:03:59,680
written a book and done a ted talk on

6360
04:03:59,680 --> 04:04:02,560
exactly this the squiggly career

6361
04:04:02,560 --> 04:04:07,840
and that is the end of my talk thank you

6362
04:04:09,439 --> 04:04:12,800
well i know i always talk about biases

6363
04:04:12,800 --> 04:04:15,279
and you know i'm pretty biased back but

6364
04:04:15,279 --> 04:04:19,040
your talk was amazing and

6365
04:04:19,040 --> 04:04:19,840
love

6366
04:04:19,840 --> 04:04:21,520
that you can

6367
04:04:21,520 --> 04:04:23,359
talk about what those crossover skills

6368
04:04:23,359 --> 04:04:24,960
are

6369
04:04:24,960 --> 04:04:27,600
um it's pretty good uh but yes i am also

6370
04:04:27,600 --> 04:04:30,319
very biased because becca's amazing

6371
04:04:30,319 --> 04:04:31,600
um

6372
04:04:31,600 --> 04:04:32,479
and

6373
04:04:32,479 --> 04:04:34,720
was you know just a ray of light coming

6374
04:04:34,720 --> 04:04:36,640
into power flare and organizing things

6375
04:04:36,640 --> 04:04:39,600
which was which is really good so um

6376
04:04:39,600 --> 04:04:40,640
yeah

6377
04:04:40,640 --> 04:04:42,000
ian take over because i'm just gonna be

6378
04:04:42,000 --> 04:04:43,279
like thank you you're just gonna keep

6379
04:04:43,279 --> 04:04:44,800
gushing

6380
04:04:44,800 --> 04:04:46,720
i mean i'm okay with that i mean i'm

6381
04:04:46,720 --> 04:04:48,399
curious when you i can't remember what

6382
04:04:48,399 --> 04:04:49,680
term it was that you searched that you

6383
04:04:49,680 --> 04:04:50,800
shouldn't have searched on the company

6384
04:04:50,800 --> 04:04:52,960
networks what was the response from your

6385
04:04:52,960 --> 04:04:56,080
internal company team

6386
04:04:56,560 --> 04:04:58,720
nothing so far except for beck's asking

6387
04:04:58,720 --> 04:05:01,600
me if i cuz i told her about it um and

6388
04:05:01,600 --> 04:05:03,359
she asked if i was on my work computer

6389
04:05:03,359 --> 04:05:05,120
and i said yes

6390
04:05:05,120 --> 04:05:07,359
oh it'll be fine

6391
04:05:07,359 --> 04:05:09,199
although it does bode well if you know

6392
04:05:09,199 --> 04:05:10,720
they can't even pick that up but anyway

6393
04:05:10,720 --> 04:05:12,479
moving swiftly on um well they're

6394
04:05:12,479 --> 04:05:14,560
probably dead you should it's hilarious

6395
04:05:14,560 --> 04:05:15,920
sometimes i think they'd come up and

6396
04:05:15,920 --> 04:05:16,880
they're like

6397
04:05:16,880 --> 04:05:20,640
dm you on slack were you just doing this

6398
04:05:20,640 --> 04:05:23,920
but at least it was squiggly not furry

6399
04:05:23,920 --> 04:05:24,880
yes

6400
04:05:24,880 --> 04:05:26,000
um there's a lot of people who are

6401
04:05:26,000 --> 04:05:28,160
saying they've also had very you know

6402
04:05:28,160 --> 04:05:30,479
squiggly career paths um someone pointed

6403
04:05:30,479 --> 04:05:32,560
out that in new zealand there's a lot of

6404
04:05:32,560 --> 04:05:35,520
librarians to cyber security which i

6405
04:05:35,520 --> 04:05:37,760
think is an interesting way as well so

6406
04:05:37,760 --> 04:05:39,359
i think the really cool thing about this

6407
04:05:39,359 --> 04:05:41,359
weekend and you're the last of the four

6408
04:05:41,359 --> 04:05:44,160
talks but it's also just

6409
04:05:44,160 --> 04:05:46,160
you can get into cyber from anywhere

6410
04:05:46,160 --> 04:05:47,760
like if you want to get into cyber from

6411
04:05:47,760 --> 04:05:49,760
whatever career it is there's something

6412
04:05:49,760 --> 04:05:51,600
for you to do and there's always a

6413
04:05:51,600 --> 04:05:53,040
pathway there as well so we've had

6414
04:05:53,040 --> 04:05:54,239
people who were

6415
04:05:54,239 --> 04:05:56,399
technical non-technical i hate using

6416
04:05:56,399 --> 04:05:57,600
those words but again i haven't gotten

6417
04:05:57,600 --> 04:05:59,680
anything better at this point in time um

6418
04:05:59,680 --> 04:06:01,760
they've gone from being teachers working

6419
04:06:01,760 --> 04:06:03,040
in banks

6420
04:06:03,040 --> 04:06:06,080
um hr you know every aspect of these

6421
04:06:06,080 --> 04:06:08,479
things and yet they all came into cyber

6422
04:06:08,479 --> 04:06:10,399
security having said that they didn't go

6423
04:06:10,399 --> 04:06:12,160
into the same area of cyber security

6424
04:06:12,160 --> 04:06:13,439
they've all done different things and

6425
04:06:13,439 --> 04:06:14,880
that there's a whole variety of

6426
04:06:14,880 --> 04:06:16,239
different things

6427
04:06:16,239 --> 04:06:17,279
one of my

6428
04:06:17,279 --> 04:06:19,840
favorite slides that i have at work

6429
04:06:19,840 --> 04:06:21,279
is a list of all the different kind of

6430
04:06:21,279 --> 04:06:23,439
careers in cyber trying to explain to

6431
04:06:23,439 --> 04:06:25,199
people that cyber is not just one thing

6432
04:06:25,199 --> 04:06:26,560
it's the it's a whole bunch of different

6433
04:06:26,560 --> 04:06:28,160
things that everyone can get involved in

6434
04:06:28,160 --> 04:06:28,880
so

6435
04:06:28,880 --> 04:06:30,560
you've made your path in it shanna's

6436
04:06:30,560 --> 04:06:32,399
made her path in it everyone's made

6437
04:06:32,399 --> 04:06:33,439
their path in it and they've picked

6438
04:06:33,439 --> 04:06:35,359
something that they really want to do

6439
04:06:35,359 --> 04:06:37,120
yeah we need to think about cyber as an

6440
04:06:37,120 --> 04:06:38,720
industry like you would think about the

6441
04:06:38,720 --> 04:06:41,040
financial industry right like within the

6442
04:06:41,040 --> 04:06:42,960
financial industry you have lawyers

6443
04:06:42,960 --> 04:06:45,120
finance people bankers

6444
04:06:45,120 --> 04:06:47,439
cyber security people project managers

6445
04:06:47,439 --> 04:06:49,199
procurement like

6446
04:06:49,199 --> 04:06:50,880
it's not like

6447
04:06:50,880 --> 04:06:53,760
you know cyber is one narrow field cyber

6448
04:06:53,760 --> 04:06:55,840
is an entire industry in itself and it

6449
04:06:55,840 --> 04:06:58,880
has all of those pieces that go into an

6450
04:06:58,880 --> 04:07:01,120
industry too we need all types of people

6451
04:07:01,120 --> 04:07:02,720
not just the ones that are actually

6452
04:07:02,720 --> 04:07:04,000
doing the

6453
04:07:04,000 --> 04:07:06,000
you know the cyber protection or

6454
04:07:06,000 --> 04:07:07,439
whatever so

6455
04:07:07,439 --> 04:07:08,880
it's um it's good for people to know

6456
04:07:08,880 --> 04:07:11,199
that thank you beck and i know i kind of

6457

put you on the spot to do this talk

6458
04:07:12,640 --> 04:07:14,800
originally um but i think it's really

6459
04:07:14,800 --> 04:07:17,199
important for sharing and people seeing

6460
04:07:17,199 --> 04:07:19,120
those different pathways in so that they

6461
04:07:19,120 --> 04:07:20,479
realize there's a lot of different

6462
04:07:20,479 --> 04:07:21,920
things that you can be doing and how you

6463
04:07:21,920 --> 04:07:23,120
can get here

6464
04:07:23,120 --> 04:07:24,319

know if you've been keeping up with uh

6502
04:08:39,520 --> 04:08:41,439
with uh the conflict on twitter and the

6503
04:08:41,439 --> 04:08:44,239
discord where do you fall on the tendees

6504
04:08:44,239 --> 04:08:46,000
chicken tendees versus chicken nuggets

6505
04:08:46,000 --> 04:08:47,840
debates

6506
04:08:47,840 --> 04:08:50,479
yeah i'm gonna have to go nuggies

6507
04:08:50,479 --> 04:08:53,439
or shanna

6508
04:08:53,439 --> 04:08:55,840
is gonna be sorry already disappoint i

6509
04:08:55,840 --> 04:08:56,560
know

6510
04:08:56,560 --> 04:08:57,840
it's fine

6511
04:08:57,840 --> 04:09:00,159
you know i did find a recipe online on

6512
04:09:00,159 --> 04:09:01,760
making chicken nuggets and they've made

6513
04:09:01,760 --> 04:09:03,359
them with chicken breasts

6514
04:09:03,359 --> 04:09:06,159
so it really is kind of squashing my

6515
04:09:06,159 --> 04:09:08,000
small chicken tendies and not nuggets

6516
04:09:08,000 --> 04:09:10,479
debate when you're entirely

6517
04:09:10,479 --> 04:09:12,840
shaped that oddly shaped candy

6518
04:09:12,840 --> 04:09:15,600
right i always swallow and call it a

6519
04:09:15,600 --> 04:09:16,720
nugget

6520
04:09:16,720 --> 04:09:18,399
how is your life going it's just like

6521
04:09:18,399 --> 04:09:21,680
imploded in front of you hasn't it

6522
04:09:21,680 --> 04:09:24,640
my life is thinking like broken by

6523
04:09:24,640 --> 04:09:27,680
attendees versus nuggies i know i'm my

6524
04:09:27,680 --> 04:09:29,439
life is now defined by attendees first

6525
04:09:29,439 --> 04:09:30,800
nuggets but i'm just going to run with

6526
04:09:30,800 --> 04:09:32,000
the i'm just going to cut small

6527
04:09:32,000 --> 04:09:33,600
attendees and then just call them

6528
04:09:33,600 --> 04:09:36,080
nuggets and you can all win

6529
04:09:36,080 --> 04:09:37,920
sounds perfect

6530
04:09:37,920 --> 04:09:40,880
hello oh yes

6531
04:09:41,040 --> 04:09:43,279

6545
04:10:24,319 --> 04:10:27,920
information security architect

6546
04:10:28,000 --> 04:10:29,040
and like

6547
04:10:29,040 --> 04:10:31,359
vox whenever he thinks something's wrong

6548
04:10:31,359 --> 04:10:33,199
i think i've made a pretty similar joke

6549
04:10:33,199 --> 04:10:34,880
with this one when i was going to the

6550
04:10:34,880 --> 04:10:36,720
office a lot more she was the uh the

6551
04:10:36,720 --> 04:10:38,960
office dogs came along as well so yeah

6552
04:10:38,960 --> 04:10:39,920
yeah

6553
04:10:39,920 --> 04:10:41,600
that's fantastic

6554
04:10:41,600 --> 04:10:44,080
look i your uh your bio is pretty short

6555
04:10:44,080 --> 04:10:46,159
uh ben is the devsecops lead for secure

6556
04:10:46,159 --> 04:10:48,399
stack as well as a security group now am

6557
04:10:48,399 --> 04:10:50,000
i reading the right one

6558
04:10:50,000 --> 04:10:52,720
i am probably

6559
04:10:53,120 --> 04:10:55,279
so that's probably why

6560
04:10:55,279 --> 04:10:57,120
as well as a security

6561
04:10:57,120 --> 04:10:59,120
uh research with a focus on automation

6562
04:10:59,120 --> 04:11:01,199
so i will bring your slides up ben

6563
04:11:01,199 --> 04:11:03,279

to go

6565
04:11:04,800 --> 04:11:07,760
cool uh so today i'm uh talking a bit

6566
04:11:07,760 --> 04:11:09,840
about how we can use open source to

6567
04:11:09,840 --> 04:11:11,120
create really effective security

6568
04:11:11,120 --> 04:11:13,760
workflows uh i will pre-warn it sort of

6569
04:11:13,760 --> 04:11:15,600
started out as a workshop but i it sort

6570
04:11:15,600 --> 04:11:17,120
of changed tact a little bit just

6571
04:11:17,120 --> 04:11:19,040
because uh of some interesting things

6572
04:11:19,040 --> 04:11:20,880
i've identified but um

6573
04:11:20,880 --> 04:11:22,880
i guess we'll we'll kick off from that

6574
04:11:22,880 --> 04:11:25,040
as we said before i'm the dev support

6575
04:11:25,040 --> 04:11:27,199
lead at secure stack um i have a pretty

6576
04:11:27,199 --> 04:11:29,040
mixed background i've

6577
04:11:29,040 --> 04:11:31,199
done a lot of different technical roles

6578
04:11:31,199 --> 04:11:33,279
in sort of different

6579
04:11:33,279 --> 04:11:34,960
parts of

6580
04:11:34,960 --> 04:11:37,120
tech from you know your standard sort of

6581
04:11:37,120 --> 04:11:39,120
sysadmin where i started so like a

6582
04:11:39,120 --> 04:11:41,680
devops sre role

6583
04:11:41,680 --> 04:11:44,319
and now more so security

6584
04:11:44,319 --> 04:11:46,159
along with automation i'm really deeply

6585
04:11:46,159 --> 04:11:47,840
interested in how we can sort of

6586
04:11:47,840 --> 04:11:49,120
intersect software development and

6587
04:11:49,120 --> 04:11:51,439
security not so much from the

6588
04:11:51,439 --> 04:11:54,479
perspective of being a bug bounty hunter

6589
04:11:54,479 --> 04:11:56,319
i'm sorry to disappoint i'm not that

6590
04:11:56,319 --> 04:11:58,560
exciting it's more so about how we can

6591
04:11:58,560 --> 04:12:00,880
prevent the discovery of those bugs et

6592
04:12:00,880 --> 04:12:01,920
cetera etcetera

6593
04:12:01,920 --> 04:12:03,439
and i'm working on a new project that

6594
04:12:03,439 --> 04:12:05,199
i'll be introducing today

6595
04:12:05,199 --> 04:12:06,640
so um

6596
04:12:06,640 --> 04:12:08,319
just to start off uh just a quick

6597
04:12:08,319 --> 04:12:09,920
overview we're gonna chat about today

6598
04:12:09,920 --> 04:12:11,680
just the landscape where we see it a few

6599
04:12:11,680 --> 04:12:13,600
 stats um

6600
04:12:13,600 --> 04:12:15,920
a bit of an idea about what i do and why

6601
04:12:15,920 --> 04:12:17,920
it matters and what we can do to make it

6602
04:12:17,920 --> 04:12:19,600
matter more

6603
04:12:19,600 --> 04:12:21,680
the problems we face and the solution as

6604
04:12:21,680 --> 04:12:24,479
well so um sort of very very

6605
04:12:24,479 --> 04:12:25,600
straightforward

6606
04:12:25,600 --> 04:12:27,760
um but we'll just go with that which is

6607
04:12:27,760 --> 04:12:29,040
you know every security vendor is going

6608
04:12:29,040 --> 04:12:31,920
to hit you with 31.7 percent of cvs or

6609
04:12:31,920 --> 04:12:33,920
above and eight on the cbss

6610
04:12:33,920 --> 04:12:35,120
you know

6611
04:12:35,120 --> 04:12:37,760
they read the cvss reports that's great

6612
04:12:37,760 --> 04:12:39,359
it means effectively nothing what it

6613
04:12:39,359 --> 04:12:41,279
really means is that 68.3 percent of

6614
04:12:41,279 --> 04:12:42,159
vulnerabilities are going to fill you

6615
04:12:42,159 --> 04:12:45,040
scanning with rubbish um so

6616
04:12:45,040 --> 04:12:46,800
that is sort of where

6617
04:12:46,800 --> 04:12:48,800
a lot of devsecops stuff comes in these

6618
04:12:48,800 --> 04:12:50,239
days we're just talking about what we

6619
04:12:50,239 --> 04:12:52,000
can find et cetera et cetera i don't

6620
04:12:52,000 --> 04:12:53,760
really find that a very

6621
04:12:53,760 --> 04:12:56,000
effective approach to it

6622
04:12:56,000 --> 04:12:57,840
but the landscape is there right there's

6623
04:12:57,840 --> 04:12:59,199
there is a lot of vulnerabilities and

6624
04:12:59,199 --> 04:13:00,560
there are a lot of exposures and apps

6625
04:13:00,560 --> 04:13:03,199
you know we know this um and there are a

6626
04:13:03,199 --> 04:13:04,800
lot of vulnerabilities and problems and

6627
04:13:04,800 --> 04:13:07,279
apps once again we know this they aren't

6628
04:13:07,279 --> 04:13:08,640
going to go away until we change how we

6629
04:13:08,640 --> 04:13:10,159
develop software that's just a

6630
04:13:10,159 --> 04:13:13,279
fundamental fact as well um we spent far

6631
04:13:13,279 --> 04:13:14,560
too much time talking about them i've

6632
04:13:14,560 --> 04:13:16,319
already spent a bunch of time just then

6633
04:13:16,319 --> 04:13:17,680
talking about them that we didn't really

6634
04:13:17,680 --> 04:13:19,680
need to go through

6635
04:13:19,680 --> 04:13:21,439
we know that you can prevent these

6636
04:13:21,439 --> 04:13:23,359
things it's sort of common knowledge at

6637
04:13:23,359 --> 04:13:24,479
this point that a lot of these things

6638
04:13:24,479 --> 04:13:25,600
can be stopped if we did the right thing

6639
04:13:25,600 --> 04:13:27,439
at the beginning

6640
04:13:27,439 --> 04:13:29,439
that isn't necessarily easy

6641
04:13:29,439 --> 04:13:31,120
we know that too but

6642
04:13:31,120 --> 04:13:33,600
it can be a lot less difficult than we

6643
04:13:33,600 --> 04:13:35,520
make it these days

6644
04:13:35,520 --> 04:13:37,520
specifically that's where

6645
04:13:37,520 --> 04:13:38,880
devsecops comes in which is that

6646
04:13:38,880 --> 04:13:40,399
prevention does ideally start at

6647
04:13:40,399 --> 04:13:41,600
conception

6648
04:13:41,600 --> 04:13:44,319
but realistically it gets added after uh

6649
04:13:44,319 --> 04:13:46,319
and and there is a better way

6650
04:13:46,319 --> 04:13:48,239
so

6651
04:13:48,239 --> 04:13:50,239
that's where i hit myself up which is

6652
04:13:50,239 --> 04:13:52,000
that before someone else says it

6653
04:13:52,000 --> 04:13:54,640
uh devsecops is a methodology um it's my

6654
04:13:54,640 --> 04:13:56,239
job title i actually don't think it's a

6655
04:13:56,239 --> 04:13:58,479
job title i just got really lucky that

6656
04:13:58,479 --> 04:14:00,720
that became my job title

6657
04:14:00,720 --> 04:14:02,880
it is just a way of doing things as

6658
04:14:02,880 --> 04:14:04,800
opposed to an actual job title and i

6659
04:14:04,800 --> 04:14:06,960
think that matters

6660
04:14:06,960 --> 04:14:09,520
the methodology does have merit uh we do

6661
04:14:09,520 --> 04:14:11,520
get the best of all worlds uh security

6662
04:14:11,520 --> 04:14:13,279
people that understand how other

6663
04:14:13,279 --> 04:14:15,680
business units work um and are embedded

6664
04:14:15,680 --> 04:14:17,279
and sort of surrounded by those business

6665
04:14:17,279 --> 04:14:18,880
units i think that creates the most

6666
04:14:18,880 --> 04:14:20,159
effective return on investment

6667
04:14:20,159 --> 04:14:22,000
specifically in the application security

6668
04:14:22,000 --> 04:14:24,560
and sort of at the coal face of securing

6669
04:14:24,560 --> 04:14:26,080
applications you've built yourself more

6670
04:14:26,080 --> 04:14:27,279
specifically

6671
04:14:27,279 --> 04:14:29,600
um we also get embedded security

6672
04:14:29,600 --> 04:14:31,600
throughout the sdlc and an embedded

6673
04:14:31,600 --> 04:14:33,199
security culture because everyone's

6674
04:14:33,199 --> 04:14:34,319
talking about it and there's sort of

6675
04:14:34,319 --> 04:14:36,720
shared responsibility um

6676
04:14:36,720 --> 04:14:39,120
and yes that comes down to tooling i

6677
04:14:39,120 --> 04:14:40,399
think we do spend a lot of time talking

6678
04:14:40,399 --> 04:14:42,080
about tooling and i will preface there

6679
04:14:42,080 --> 04:14:43,600
is a bit of a tooling talk today in that

6680
04:14:43,600 --> 04:14:46,000
we are going to bring up tools and

6681
04:14:46,000 --> 04:14:48,159
sort of what an ideal tool what i look

6682
04:14:48,159 --> 04:14:50,800
like but i will preface that it is not

6683
04:14:50,800 --> 04:14:52,479
the only thing that matters and i think

6684
04:14:52,479 --> 04:14:54,640
we do spend a lot of time talking about

6685
04:14:54,640 --> 04:14:58,080
it um and i think that in a sense is why

6686
04:14:58,080 --> 04:15:00,239
devops lends itself as both an

6687
04:15:00,239 --> 04:15:02,319
objectively bad end good security

6688
04:15:02,319 --> 04:15:03,279
approach

6689
04:15:03,279 --> 04:15:05,439
in that the techniques that devops

6690
04:15:05,439 --> 04:15:08,159
introduces to jam secops

6691
04:15:08,159 --> 04:15:10,319
is both good and bad and creates a lot

6692
04:15:10,319 --> 04:15:12,960
of good and bad things so

6693
04:15:12,960 --> 04:15:14,880
that's where we come to the idea of why

6694
04:15:14,880 --> 04:15:17,359
you should devsecops

6695
04:15:17,359 --> 04:15:20,560
to sort of reclaim it um i wouldn't sell

6696
04:15:20,560 --> 04:15:21,920
you something without actually selling

6697
04:15:21,920 --> 04:15:23,199
it and giving you an idea of what's good

6698
04:15:23,199 --> 04:15:24,720
about it so

6699
04:15:24,720 --> 04:15:27,520
devsecops delivers a lot of good things

6700
04:15:27,520 --> 04:15:29,199
when implemented correctly you get

6701
04:15:29,199 --> 04:15:30,399
better software quality through

6702
04:15:30,399 --> 04:15:32,640
continuous review from all portions and

6703
04:15:32,640 --> 04:15:34,399
parts of it it's excellent better

6704
04:15:34,399 --> 04:15:36,319
software security obviously that's the

6705
04:15:36,319 --> 04:15:38,479
aim reduce security friction and

6706
04:15:38,479 --> 04:15:41,439
therefore increase security velocity

6707
04:15:41,439 --> 04:15:42,880
so we're seeing a lot more return on

6708
04:15:42,880 --> 04:15:44,479
investment for what you're putting in

6709
04:15:44,479 --> 04:15:46,479
and it happens a lot faster at devops

6710
04:15:46,479 --> 04:15:47,680
velocity

6711
04:15:47,680 --> 04:15:50,399
you get less noise because humans are

6712
04:15:50,399 --> 04:15:52,880
still valued you still get human insight

6713
04:15:52,880 --> 04:15:55,040
but you're kind of involving intelligent

6714
04:15:55,040 --> 04:15:56,319
automations

6715
04:15:56,319 --> 04:15:58,479
um which is is a really powerful way of

6716
04:15:58,479 --> 04:16:00,720
approaching it

6717
04:16:00,720 --> 04:16:03,600
automation goes bur it does a good job

6718
04:16:03,600 --> 04:16:05,040
when it's implemented correctly but we

6719
04:16:05,040 --> 04:16:07,439
can't devalue the human element

6720
04:16:07,439 --> 04:16:08,479
and also

6721
04:16:08,479 --> 04:16:10,239
developers go by and that developers are

6722
04:16:10,239 --> 04:16:12,960
going to do things that developers do

6723
04:16:12,960 --> 04:16:15,600
and we love them for that but they also

6724
04:16:15,600 --> 04:16:17,760
do bad things so we need to learn why

6725
04:16:17,760 --> 04:16:20,000
and how we can change that

6726
04:16:20,000 --> 04:16:22,239
um of course another statistic a hundred

6727
04:16:22,239 --> 04:16:23,439
percent of the time this isn't easy this

6728
04:16:23,439 --> 04:16:25,439
is probably the only only non-bullshit

6729
04:16:25,439 --> 04:16:27,040
statistic i pulled out tonight we know

6730
04:16:27,040 --> 04:16:30,720
that it's hard to secure things

6731
04:16:30,800 --> 04:16:33,120
it's a necessary evil um much like

6732
04:16:33,120 --> 04:16:35,040
security dev cyclops is hard there are

6733
04:16:35,040 --> 04:16:36,319
issues with the right people being in

6734
04:16:36,319 --> 04:16:38,080
the right space we don't always have the

6735
04:16:38,080 --> 04:16:39,279
right staff and people that have the

6736
04:16:39,279 --> 04:16:41,520
right knowledge doing the right things

6737
04:16:41,520 --> 04:16:43,120
automating security is objectively

6738
04:16:43,120 --> 04:16:45,520
difficult and is a bespoke

6739
04:16:45,520 --> 04:16:48,080
situation so we tend to

6740
04:16:48,080 --> 04:16:49,760
have to do things from scratch every

6741
04:16:49,760 --> 04:16:52,000
time i have a set of reusable components

6742
04:16:52,000 --> 04:16:53,760
but they're not always applicable and

6743
04:16:53,760 --> 04:16:55,600
they aren't easily integrated et cetera

6744
04:16:55,600 --> 04:16:57,040
et cetera and although the toolkit

6745
04:16:57,040 --> 04:16:58,720
builds up it requires a lot of

6746
04:16:58,720 --> 04:17:00,960
specialist knowledge over time uh we

6747
04:17:00,960 --> 04:17:02,640
also get a lot of noise too because of

6748
04:17:02,640 --> 04:17:04,399
this siloing we end up having to push

6749
04:17:04,399 --> 04:17:06,080
data around it in weird ways you know

6750
04:17:06,080 --> 04:17:07,359
whether that's a scene or whether we're

6751
04:17:07,359 --> 04:17:08,960
creating tickets it's just it's not

6752
04:17:08,960 --> 04:17:10,880
great and

6753
04:17:10,880 --> 04:17:13,920
i know i'm sort of poking at myself here

6754
04:17:13,920 --> 04:17:15,920
being one that works for vendor but i

6755
04:17:15,920 --> 04:17:18,080
don't like vendors either

6756
04:17:18,080 --> 04:17:19,680
we've got a lot of these tools that are

6757
04:17:19,680 --> 04:17:22,080
being pushed out that are repurposed old

6758
04:17:22,080 --> 04:17:24,960
tools and don't necessarily add value

6759
04:17:24,960 --> 04:17:26,960
and it all becomes a chat about this

6760
04:17:26,960 --> 04:17:29,359
next great tech

6761
04:17:29,359 --> 04:17:32,880
i'm over i am over that um generally and

6762
04:17:32,880 --> 04:17:34,960
i think there needs to be a more open

6763
04:17:34,960 --> 04:17:36,800
approach to that

6764
04:17:36,800 --> 04:17:37,520
so

6765
04:17:37,520 --> 04:17:39,920
the ideal would be an open source

6766
04:17:39,920 --> 04:17:42,239
framework um this framework could be

6767
04:17:42,239 --> 04:17:44,239
made would be largely made up of open

6768
04:17:44,239 --> 04:17:46,000
source tools that provide uh for the

6769
04:17:46,000 --> 04:17:48,640
creation of security workflows um that

6770
04:17:48,640 --> 04:17:49,840
might be

6771
04:17:49,840 --> 04:17:51,680
all sorts of different components that

6772
04:17:51,680 --> 04:17:54,319
reinforce different parts of the sdlc

6773
04:17:54,319 --> 04:17:55,439
there's a list of some of them there

6774
04:17:55,439 --> 04:17:58,399
that's not by any means exhaustive um or

6775
04:17:58,399 --> 04:18:00,399
complete but it's just an idea of the

6776
04:18:00,399 --> 04:18:02,080
kinds of things this is what i would

6777
04:18:02,080 --> 04:18:04,000
expected when i went out there you know

6778
04:18:04,000 --> 04:18:05,600
we would have a modular framework we

6779
04:18:05,600 --> 04:18:07,600
could turn things off and on there might

6780
04:18:07,600 --> 04:18:09,279
be a ui i'm not that fussed about it but

6781
04:18:09,279 --> 04:18:10,800
maybe there's like a yaml file that i

6782
04:18:10,800 --> 04:18:12,880
can configure and say do this with this

6783
04:18:12,880 --> 04:18:14,319
take the output from this blah blah blah

6784
04:18:14,319 --> 04:18:15,920
set a bunch of rules up

6785
04:18:15,920 --> 04:18:18,399
along with reusable components and it

6786
04:18:18,399 --> 04:18:20,399
should have an api

6787
04:18:20,399 --> 04:18:22,000
finally there should be some form of

6788
04:18:22,000 --> 04:18:23,760
integration we should be able to talk

6789
04:18:23,760 --> 04:18:24,560
you know i should be able to create

6790
04:18:24,560 --> 04:18:25,840
tickets enduro should be able to create

6791
04:18:25,840 --> 04:18:27,520
tickets there i should be able to

6792
04:18:27,520 --> 04:18:29,199
open a case whatever i need to do with

6793
04:18:29,199 --> 04:18:30,800
that information

6794
04:18:30,800 --> 04:18:32,800
uh but i realized something

6795
04:18:32,800 --> 04:18:35,600
it doesn't exist there is no framework

6796
04:18:35,600 --> 04:18:38,000
really like this that is truly open that

6797
04:18:38,000 --> 04:18:40,399
is truly accessible universally i know

6798
04:18:40,399 --> 04:18:41,600
there are tools and there are bits and

6799
04:18:41,600 --> 04:18:43,840
bobs and there are different things that

6800
04:18:43,840 --> 04:18:46,000
kind of do this for specific platforms

6801
04:18:46,000 --> 04:18:48,239
but that's not really the answer we need

6802
04:18:48,239 --> 04:18:50,640
something more sort of broad spread and

6803
04:18:50,640 --> 04:18:53,840
capable of you know enrobing things um

6804
04:18:53,840 --> 04:18:56,880
i've seen a lot of uh

6805
04:18:56,880 --> 04:18:58,880
a lot of kubernetes for example centric

6806
04:18:58,880 --> 04:18:59,840
tools which

6807
04:18:59,840 --> 04:19:01,760
it doesn't it's such a small portion of

6808
04:19:01,760 --> 04:19:03,439
what happens on a day-to-day basis that

6809
04:19:03,439 --> 04:19:05,520
it doesn't really help us all

6810
04:19:05,520 --> 04:19:06,800
so

6811
04:19:06,800 --> 04:19:08,720
i really did want to build something for

6812
04:19:08,720 --> 04:19:11,439
this talk um but i realize it's really

6813
04:19:11,439 --> 04:19:12,640
hard

6814
04:19:12,640 --> 04:19:14,720
it's a lot of investment of time and i

6815
04:19:14,720 --> 04:19:16,880
do this a lot in my day-to-day job and i

6816
04:19:16,880 --> 04:19:18,080
have done in my day-to-day job but it

6817
04:19:18,080 --> 04:19:20,319
was bespoke and i paid to do that

6818
04:19:20,319 --> 04:19:22,080
and it really disappointed me that there

6819
04:19:22,080 --> 04:19:24,239
was no ready builds or easily available

6820
04:19:24,239 --> 04:19:25,439
something i could take off the shelf and

6821
04:19:25,439 --> 04:19:28,800
maybe modify a bit without a lot of

6822
04:19:28,800 --> 04:19:31,760
heavy lifting so i i think it's it's

6823
04:19:31,760 --> 04:19:33,199
time to

6824
04:19:33,199 --> 04:19:37,600
change that um this this sort of xkcd uh

6825
04:19:37,600 --> 04:19:39,359
image sort of summed it up a lot for me

6826
04:19:39,359 --> 04:19:41,840
the idea that everyone has this big high

6827
04:19:41,840 --> 04:19:43,279
level dream but the reality is

6828
04:19:43,279 --> 04:19:45,120
completely different and i think that's

6829
04:19:45,120 --> 04:19:46,960
where we sort of change

6830
04:19:46,960 --> 04:19:48,640
so what do we do

6831
04:19:48,640 --> 04:19:50,239
we build it so

6832
04:19:50,239 --> 04:19:52,640
i i just started this new project i call

6833
04:19:52,640 --> 04:19:54,640
it ramparts you know rampart is a

6834
04:19:54,640 --> 04:19:56,640
projective barrier something that wraps

6835
04:19:56,640 --> 04:19:58,159
around something to hold things behind

6836
04:19:58,159 --> 04:19:58,960
it

6837
04:19:58,960 --> 04:19:59,760
um

6838
04:19:59,760 --> 04:20:02,000
the idea is to create an open source uh

6839
04:20:02,000 --> 04:20:03,600
centric vendor neutral framework for a

6840
04:20:03,600 --> 04:20:06,479
devsecops toolchain uh the

6841
04:20:06,479 --> 04:20:08,159
components will be modular they'll be

6842
04:20:08,159 --> 04:20:09,600
integrated into various components of

6843
04:20:09,600 --> 04:20:10,960
the sdlc

6844
04:20:10,960 --> 04:20:12,640
and do

6845
04:20:12,640 --> 04:20:15,120
uh many many different things uh they

6846
04:20:15,120 --> 04:20:17,279
will all be open source at the very

6847
04:20:17,279 --> 04:20:19,120
least they'll be commercially supported

6848
04:20:19,120 --> 04:20:21,120
open source so aim for purely open

6849
04:20:21,120 --> 04:20:23,680
source but primarily that like primarily

6850
04:20:23,680 --> 04:20:25,199
i realize we're going to find ourselves

6851
04:20:25,199 --> 04:20:26,960
using commercially supported open source

6852
04:20:26,960 --> 04:20:29,680
so being mindful of the license

6853
04:20:29,680 --> 04:20:31,920
it also aims to build an integration

6854
04:20:31,920 --> 04:20:33,520
framework around these components such

6855
04:20:33,520 --> 04:20:35,040
that you can feed each other's inputs

6856
04:20:35,040 --> 04:20:36,880
and sort of transform and take output

6857
04:20:36,880 --> 04:20:38,080
from each other

6858
04:20:38,080 --> 04:20:40,319
which allows us to create sort of

6859
04:20:40,319 --> 04:20:43,760
constructive and build on approaches um

6860
04:20:43,760 --> 04:20:45,520
it will also provide collaboration

6861
04:20:45,520 --> 04:20:48,159
integration so things like jira as i

6862
04:20:48,159 --> 04:20:49,840
mentioned before really common place to

6863
04:20:49,840 --> 04:20:51,359
put tickets especially for software

6864
04:20:51,359 --> 04:20:52,640
developers because this is what we're

6865
04:20:52,640 --> 04:20:54,479
trying to pull into the security life

6866
04:20:54,479 --> 04:20:56,880
cycle is software developers

6867
04:20:56,880 --> 04:20:58,319
and we want it to suit

6868
04:20:58,319 --> 04:21:00,080
multiple workloads and design paradigms

6869
04:21:00,080 --> 04:21:01,920
so it shouldn't matter if you're

6870
04:21:01,920 --> 04:21:03,920
building something on a server and it's

6871
04:21:03,920 --> 04:21:05,600
something that you copy there yourself

6872
04:21:05,600 --> 04:21:07,760
versus somebody who has a serverless app

6873
04:21:07,760 --> 04:21:09,840
versus someone that has a docker

6874
04:21:09,840 --> 04:21:12,159
container driven app whatever it doesn't

6875
04:21:12,159 --> 04:21:15,279
really matter that shouldn't be um

6876
04:21:15,279 --> 04:21:16,560
shouldn't affect the availability of

6877
04:21:16,560 --> 04:21:17,920
tooling

6878
04:21:17,920 --> 04:21:19,279
so

6879
04:21:19,279 --> 04:21:20,960
it's early days

6880
04:21:20,960 --> 04:21:22,560
i'm hoping to push an early version of

6881
04:21:22,560 --> 04:21:24,000
the concept with a couple of modules and

6882
04:21:24,000 --> 04:21:25,680
sort of like a a templating and

6883
04:21:25,680 --> 04:21:27,120
configuration system over the next

6884
04:21:27,120 --> 04:21:29,040
couple of months um and i'm sort of

6885
04:21:29,040 --> 04:21:32,800
reaching out to us uh for help to build

6886
04:21:32,800 --> 04:21:35,199
look i i'll aiming i'll be honest this

6887
04:21:35,199 --> 04:21:38,080
is new so it's just started for me um i

6888
04:21:38,080 --> 04:21:39,920
am still architecting what the solution

6889
04:21:39,920 --> 04:21:41,600
might look like as i mentioned i want to

6890
04:21:41,600 --> 04:21:43,600
reuse open source components to build it

6891
04:21:43,600 --> 04:21:46,159
as quickly as possible and sort of

6892
04:21:46,159 --> 04:21:48,479
you know it's a lot of pre-built glue is

6893
04:21:48,479 --> 04:21:50,000
really most of the developing work is

6894
04:21:50,000 --> 04:21:51,040
what we're aiming for plus a

6895
04:21:51,040 --> 04:21:52,720
configuration system

6896
04:21:52,720 --> 04:21:54,399
that may change we may need to fill a

6897
04:21:54,399 --> 04:21:57,199
gap uh there'll be a discord matrix

6898
04:21:57,199 --> 04:21:59,920
slack whatever community i end up doing

6899
04:21:59,920 --> 04:22:02,479
whatever but the real reason for this is

6900
04:22:02,479 --> 04:22:04,720
to say if you want to help i'm looking

6901
04:22:04,720 --> 04:22:08,159
for anyone if you can offer hosting you

6902
04:22:08,159 --> 04:22:11,279
can offer developers devsecops people

6903
04:22:11,279 --> 04:22:13,199
anyone um

6904
04:22:13,199 --> 04:22:15,439
please reach out to me also i really

6905
04:22:15,439 --> 04:22:17,520
like being questioned and if if people

6906
04:22:17,520 --> 04:22:18,720
feel like i'm wrong or they feel like

6907
04:22:18,720 --> 04:22:20,000
there's something that we can contribute

6908
04:22:20,000 --> 04:22:22,239
to instead i'd love that so those are

6909
04:22:22,239 --> 04:22:24,479
some contact details for me there uh i

6910
04:22:24,479 --> 04:22:25,199
will

6911
04:22:25,199 --> 04:22:27,120
work out a way to keep people or anyone

6912
04:22:27,120 --> 04:22:29,279
watching or interested up to date um

6913
04:22:29,279 --> 04:22:31,439
anyways through this but yeah i thought

6914
04:22:31,439 --> 04:22:32,720
i'd just sort of

6915
04:22:32,720 --> 04:22:34,800
have that unfortunately it wasn't the

6916
04:22:34,800 --> 04:22:36,640
talk i wanted because what i wanted

6917
04:22:36,640 --> 04:22:38,000
didn't exist

6918
04:22:38,000 --> 04:22:42,600
and that's it thank you

6919
04:22:46,399 --> 04:22:47,600
well

6920
04:22:47,600 --> 04:22:49,840
it sounds like a really good idea ben um

6921
04:22:49,840 --> 04:22:51,760
so people can get involved by talking to

6922
04:22:51,760 --> 04:22:53,520
you on twitter um you're obviously in

6923
04:22:53,520 --> 04:22:56,000
the comfycom discord as well um

6924
04:22:56,000 --> 04:22:57,600
i think you'll find a lot of people to

6925
04:22:57,600 --> 04:22:59,199
call out your no i'm kidding

6926
04:22:59,199 --> 04:23:02,000
they're just very that's okay

6927
04:23:02,000 --> 04:23:04,000
i think everyone appreciates that right

6928
04:23:04,000 --> 04:23:06,479
the bluntness the the ability to talk

6929
04:23:06,479 --> 04:23:09,199
about things and to um

6930
04:23:09,199 --> 04:23:11,760
to be able to be honest i think

6931
04:23:11,760 --> 04:23:13,279
sorry i'm getting sidetracked now but

6932
04:23:13,279 --> 04:23:14,960
there's difference between being blunt

6933
04:23:14,960 --> 04:23:16,640
and being

6934
04:23:16,640 --> 04:23:17,680
uh

6935
04:23:17,680 --> 04:23:19,199
mean i think

6936
04:23:19,199 --> 04:23:21,199
like laying things out in a very clear

6937
04:23:21,199 --> 04:23:23,920
manner versus like bringing personal

6938
04:23:23,920 --> 04:23:26,479
opinions into it kind of thing

6939
04:23:26,479 --> 04:23:29,040
it's quite interesting that everyone in

6940
04:23:29,040 --> 04:23:31,040
cyber kind of

6941
04:23:31,040 --> 04:23:32,640
conflates the two a little but like if

6942
04:23:32,640 --> 04:23:34,640
you're being clear in expectations then

6943
04:23:34,640 --> 04:23:35,920
you know that's not really being mean

6944
04:23:35,920 --> 04:23:38,159
that's just being clear so um it's good

6945
04:23:38,159 --> 04:23:39,439
to see people actually wanting that as

6946
04:23:39,439 --> 04:23:41,359
well which is really awesome

6947
04:23:41,359 --> 04:23:43,840
yeah i think um i think we miss out a

6948
04:23:43,840 --> 04:23:45,120
lot on

6949
04:23:45,120 --> 04:23:48,399
on questioning um you know in a whole

6950
04:23:48,399 --> 04:23:50,399
in a in a realm that's all about

6951
04:23:50,399 --> 04:23:52,640
questioning the norm we should be really

6952
04:23:52,640 --> 04:23:54,080
happy to be questioned about our own

6953
04:23:54,080 --> 04:23:55,920
norms as well i think in our own

6954
04:23:55,920 --> 04:23:57,120
expectations i think that's really

6955
04:23:57,120 --> 04:23:59,840
valuable so yeah um more than anything

6956
04:23:59,840 --> 04:24:01,840
i'm really happy to have people call me

6957
04:24:01,840 --> 04:24:03,840
out at my um especially with

6958
04:24:03,840 --> 04:24:05,439
this uh because it's something i'm quite

6959
04:24:05,439 --> 04:24:06,880
passionate about so

6960
04:24:06,880 --> 04:24:09,359
it's uh yeah where is great

6961
04:24:09,359 --> 04:24:11,040
that's awesome there is one question in

6962
04:24:11,040 --> 04:24:12,640
the q a but if there are more questions

6963
04:24:12,640 --> 04:24:15,600
please add them um has dagger i don't

6964
04:24:15,600 --> 04:24:17,120
know what the project is has that been

6965
04:24:17,120 --> 04:24:18,960
on your radar it seems to be the talk of

6966
04:24:18,960 --> 04:24:21,920
the town and might suit

6967
04:24:21,920 --> 04:24:23,520
uh i

6968
04:24:23,520 --> 04:24:25,040
i think it came up in sort of my

6969
04:24:25,040 --> 04:24:27,439
research into this and

6970
04:24:27,439 --> 04:24:30,159
i think in some ways dagger could be

6971
04:24:30,159 --> 04:24:31,439
something i think it's something i need

6972
04:24:31,439 --> 04:24:35,439
to spend a bit more time on um but

6973
04:24:35,439 --> 04:24:38,399
what i what i've found is and i don't

6974
04:24:38,399 --> 04:24:40,159
know if this is specific to dagger but

6975
04:24:40,159 --> 04:24:42,159
as i mentioned a lot of them are sort of

6976
04:24:42,159 --> 04:24:44,560
geared around specific approaches to

6977
04:24:44,560 --> 04:24:46,319
architecture and specific

6978
04:24:46,319 --> 04:24:49,199
um ways of doing things like i found

6979
04:24:49,199 --> 04:24:52,880
half a dozen tools that focused on

6980
04:24:52,880 --> 04:24:55,199
providing this to heavily containerized

6981
04:24:55,199 --> 04:24:57,359
workflows which is great but

6982
04:24:57,359 --> 04:24:59,199
honestly don't come across that many

6983
04:24:59,199 --> 04:25:00,960
organizations that are purely running in

6984
04:25:00,960 --> 04:25:03,040
a containerized workflow a lot of the

6985
04:25:03,040 --> 04:25:04,399
time you're coming across people who are

6986
04:25:04,399 --> 04:25:05,600
just running stuff on servers and

6987
04:25:05,600 --> 04:25:06,960
there's nothing wrong with that that

6988
04:25:06,960 --> 04:25:09,359
scales really well and we should be

6989
04:25:09,359 --> 04:25:11,279
sort of democratizing security for

6990
04:25:11,279 --> 04:25:14,880
everyone no matter what um so yeah i

6991
04:25:14,880 --> 04:25:16,319
will take a bit more of a look at dagger

6992
04:25:16,319 --> 04:25:17,359
though thank you

6993
04:25:17,359 --> 04:25:18,399
i think that's a really good term

6994
04:25:18,399 --> 04:25:21,120
actually democratizing or

6995
04:25:21,120 --> 04:25:23,359
equality of cyber like it's been a

6996
04:25:23,359 --> 04:25:24,720
couple of different people have talked

6997
04:25:24,720 --> 04:25:26,560
about like making cyber

6998
04:25:26,560 --> 04:25:28,399
able to be used by different groups like

6999
04:25:28,399 --> 04:25:30,080
small business or normal people or

7000
04:25:30,080 --> 04:25:32,319
whatever it is like it's very difficult

7001
04:25:32,319 --> 04:25:35,279
sometimes to like you get that situation

7002
04:25:35,279 --> 04:25:36,640
where you get 30 million pages of

7003
04:25:36,640 --> 04:25:38,560
documentation and you need

7004
04:25:38,560 --> 04:25:41,199
five azure ec2 hosts plus lambda plus

7005
04:25:41,199 --> 04:25:43,279
this or whatever i've seen so many or or

7006
04:25:43,279 --> 04:25:45,600
you need a the one that i hate right now

7007
04:25:45,600 --> 04:25:49,800
sorry again i'm going to tangent

7008
04:25:55,279 --> 04:25:57,680
is a great example of that how all their

7009
04:25:57,680 --> 04:26:00,080
documentation is geared around

7010
04:26:00,080 --> 04:26:02,399
um kubernetes clusters

7011
04:26:02,399 --> 04:26:04,800
and i'm like i love the idea of runtime

7012
04:26:04,800 --> 04:26:07,760
security i love it but why

7013
04:26:07,760 --> 04:26:11,120
why is it only k8s and like it's

7014
04:26:11,120 --> 04:26:13,359
ah it's such a my new anyways to avoid

7015
04:26:13,359 --> 04:26:15,520
specific specificity but yeah i 100

7016
04:26:15,520 --> 04:26:17,439
agree i think you

7017
04:26:17,439 --> 04:26:20,000
i i i like the word equity and

7018
04:26:20,000 --> 04:26:21,520
democratization those are the two sort

7019
04:26:21,520 --> 04:26:22,640
of terms are used roughly

7020
04:26:22,640 --> 04:26:25,120
interchangeably to say that we should be

7021
04:26:25,120 --> 04:26:27,920
it should be the broad base not really

7022
04:26:27,920 --> 04:26:29,840
specific and what's most profitable that

7023
04:26:29,840 --> 04:26:31,199
i think is the other

7024
04:26:31,199 --> 04:26:33,199
annoying annoyance for me is that it

7025
04:26:33,199 --> 04:26:36,000
shouldn't just be it should be about um

7026
04:26:36,000 --> 04:26:37,840
almost treating it like an immune system

7027
04:26:37,840 --> 04:26:40,720
where uh the the greater that everyone

7028
04:26:40,720 --> 04:26:42,720
is the greater the the constitution of

7029
04:26:42,720 --> 04:26:45,040
greater parts is the goal where

7030
04:26:45,040 --> 04:26:46,479
everyone's more secure therefore

7031
04:26:46,479 --> 04:26:48,319
everyone is more secure

7032
04:26:48,319 --> 04:26:50,720
and most importantly the end user is

7033
04:26:50,720 --> 04:26:52,720
more secure which matters far more than

7034
04:26:52,720 --> 04:26:54,640
just the company so

7035
04:26:54,640 --> 04:26:56,319
yeah always putting the end user first

7036
04:26:56,319 --> 04:26:58,000
that's been a theme through a whole

7037
04:26:58,000 --> 04:27:00,080
bunch of things

7038
04:27:00,080 --> 04:27:01,439
look thanks very much ben and it

7039
04:27:01,439 --> 04:27:02,880
definitely seems like an awesome project

7040
04:27:02,880 --> 04:27:05,040
that we'll be um going along so um if

7041
04:27:05,040 --> 04:27:06,239
anyone wants to get involved please

7042
04:27:06,239 --> 04:27:09,359

because we are again 10 minutes ahead

7048
04:27:17,199 --> 04:27:19,680
we're just gonna have

7049
04:27:19,680 --> 04:27:20,880

04:27:20,880 --> 04:27:22,720
what are we gonna do um we'll have a bit

7051
04:27:22,720 --> 04:27:24,720

please feel free to put all that in the

7059
04:27:40,880 --> 04:27:42,319
chat and we might go through a few of

7060
04:27:42,319 --> 04:27:45,120
them i think for me

7061
04:27:45,120 --> 04:27:47,359
um it's provided a lot of good material

7062
04:27:47,359 --> 04:27:49,520
that i can provide to people who

7063
04:27:49,520 --> 04:27:51,760
are getting into cyber careers

7064
04:27:51,760 --> 04:27:55,279
um they are people who have said they

7065
04:27:55,279 --> 04:27:57,520
can't do cyber or it's it's they don't

7066
04:27:57,520 --> 04:28:00,319
have the experience for cyber um

7067
04:28:00,319 --> 04:28:02,000
those four talks that i've mentioned are

7068
04:28:02,000 --> 04:28:04,080
going to be really awesome um

7069
04:28:04,080 --> 04:28:06,560
the writing and the marketing and the

7070
04:28:06,560 --> 04:28:08,399
communication ones absolutely essential

7071
04:28:08,399 --> 04:28:10,880
i think in today's day and age um the

7072
04:28:10,880 --> 04:28:12,319
fact that we

7073
04:28:12,319 --> 04:28:13,760
uh

7074
04:28:13,760 --> 04:28:16,239
are able to do such great things in

7075
04:28:16,239 --> 04:28:17,520
cyber and now we can be able to

7076
04:28:17,520 --> 04:28:18,960
communicate those things is pretty

7077
04:28:18,960 --> 04:28:20,800
awesome and i think it's becoming more

7078
04:28:20,800 --> 04:28:23,680
important so for me those are the things

7079
04:28:23,680 --> 04:28:26,479
that i'm going to um love providing to

7080
04:28:26,479 --> 04:28:28,159

7081

7085
04:28:36,720 --> 04:28:38,000

7086

7113
04:29:32,960 --> 04:29:34,479

what are you looking forward to left

7117
04:29:42,000 --> 04:29:45,520

7118
04:29:45,520 --> 04:29:47,680
the chats and the talks and everyone

7119
04:29:47,680 --> 04:29:50,960
getting together that's my favorite part

7120

yeah i think that's really good and i

7121
04:29:52,800 --> 04:29:54,479
think the fact that we made this

7122
04:29:54,479 --> 04:29:57,040
community has been really awesome

7123
04:29:57,040 --> 04:29:59,760
in terms of getting people together and

7124
04:29:59,760 --> 04:30:01,439
uh involving them

7125
04:30:01,439 --> 04:30:02,720
um

7126
04:30:02,720 --> 04:30:04,960
what else i think there's been

7127
04:30:04,960 --> 04:30:07,120
someone really enjoyed uh espresso

7128
04:30:07,120 --> 04:30:09,680
martini conference uh oh sorry they

7129
04:30:09,680 --> 04:30:11,199

7130
04:30:11,199 --> 04:30:13,120
rid of it and said conference

7131
04:30:13,120 --> 04:30:14,640

7167
04:31:28,720 --> 04:31:29,760
partner because it's going to have to

7168
04:31:29,760 --> 04:31:32,239
get off the couch and turn the timer off

7169

7174
04:31:43,680 --> 04:31:46,800

04:31:57,199 --> 04:31:59,680
so if anyone's into cocktails definitely

7182
04:31:59,680 --> 04:32:01,760

7183
04:32:01,760 --> 04:32:03,760
like making cocktails we do have a we do

7184

hashtag uh

7186
04:32:07,120 --> 04:32:09,040
i think it's drinks

7187
04:32:09,040 --> 04:32:11,279
drinks alcohol and there's drink stash

7188

hot i don't think we have a drink slash

7189
04:32:12,720 --> 04:32:14,159
cold but

7190
04:32:14,159 --> 04:32:16,000
generally a cold drink is an alcoholic

7191
04:32:16,000 --> 04:32:17,600
drink so

7192
04:32:17,600 --> 04:32:19,840
um tell you what how about i bring in

7193
04:32:19,840 --> 04:32:21,520
our next speaker who is completely not

7194
04:32:21,520 --> 04:32:23,120
ready for this at all but i'm going to

7195
04:32:23,120 --> 04:32:24,720
see if she is ready and can hear me yeah

7196
04:32:24,720 --> 04:32:27,600

cairo what is your favorite cocktail

7200
04:32:36,479 --> 04:32:37,520
oh

7201
04:32:37,520 --> 04:32:39,520
you nearly caught me taking selfies to

7202
04:32:39,520 --> 04:32:41,840
tweet to sales

7203
04:32:41,840 --> 04:32:44,080
comic cons so it's like selfies right

7204
04:32:44,080 --> 04:32:46,159
now that's perfectly fine

7205
04:32:46,159 --> 04:32:50,560
no no no you don't want to see that um

7206
04:32:50,560 --> 04:32:52,479
favorite drink i don't know i kind of

7207
04:32:52,479 --> 04:32:56,239
like anything fruity really um

7208
04:32:56,239 --> 04:32:59,439
and gin is always a good thing so

7209
04:32:59,439 --> 04:33:02,960
gin and mascara so moscato in a soda

7210
04:33:02,960 --> 04:33:05,840
stream and then adding gin

7211
04:33:05,840 --> 04:33:07,039
i forgot

7212
04:33:07,039 --> 04:33:09,438
sodastream moscato and a sodastream to

7213
04:33:09,438 --> 04:33:12,400
give it fizz and then adding gin

7214
04:33:12,400 --> 04:33:14,879
doesn't mascara already have the fizz

7215
04:33:14,879 --> 04:33:16,561
not necessarily you can get sparkling

7216
04:33:16,561 --> 04:33:19,840
moscato though okay all right

7217
04:33:19,840 --> 04:33:23,039
um and where do you stand on the chicken

7218
04:33:23,039 --> 04:33:24,561
sorry the nuggies versus tandy's

7219
04:33:24,561 --> 04:33:26,400
argument all right

7220
04:33:26,400 --> 04:33:27,520
so

7221
04:33:27,520 --> 04:33:28,799
i think

7222
04:33:28,799 --> 04:33:30,799
both are delightful

7223
04:33:30,799 --> 04:33:33,118
um the difference is chicken nuggets are

7224
04:33:33,118 --> 04:33:36,320
a snack and chicken tendies are a meal

7225
04:33:36,320 --> 04:33:38,639
nice perspective that is an interesting

7226
04:33:38,639 --> 04:33:41,278
thing also you're asking a bisexual

7227
04:33:41,278 --> 04:33:43,438
non-monogamous person to choose one

7228
04:33:43,438 --> 04:33:44,958
that's just dumb

7229
04:33:44,958 --> 04:33:46,799
choice is not your thing is it yeah why

7230
04:33:46,799 --> 04:33:50,000
not no i'll i'll have both because they

7231
04:33:50,000 --> 04:33:52,000
add different things to my life that is

7232
04:33:52,000 --> 04:33:54,240
entirely fair and an interesting

7233
04:33:54,240 --> 04:33:56,719
perspective to the debates

7234
04:33:56,719 --> 04:33:58,160
it's very deep actually although i

7235
04:33:58,160 --> 04:33:59,199
shouldn't say that because that's what

7236
04:33:59,199 --> 04:34:01,919
she said that's what um

7237
04:34:01,919 --> 04:34:04,480
is it though

7238
04:34:05,199 --> 04:34:07,520
before we start getting awkward yeah um

7239
04:34:07,520 --> 04:34:09,278
so for those who don't know for those

7240
04:34:09,278 --> 04:34:11,599
who don't know cairo uh cairo is a cyber

7241
04:34:11,599 --> 04:34:13,438
security grc specialist an amateur nida

7242
04:34:13,438 --> 04:34:15,840
who spends a day leading the grc program

7243
04:34:15,840 --> 04:34:18,400
at octopus deploy is it octopus deploy

7244
04:34:18,400 --> 04:34:20,958
shouldn't it be octopi deploy

7245
04:34:20,958 --> 04:34:22,719
like multiple times

7246
04:34:22,719 --> 04:34:25,919
no okay sorry so octopi is not actually

7247
04:34:25,919 --> 04:34:28,958
considered the plural of octopuses is

7248
04:34:28,958 --> 04:34:31,438
actually the the plural these days okay

7249
04:34:31,438 --> 04:34:34,080
i'm getting it it drives me capote

7250
04:34:34,080 --> 04:34:37,840
as an alternative um i tend to take the

7251
04:34:37,840 --> 04:34:40,000
sheep sheep approach and just say one

7252
04:34:40,000 --> 04:34:41,840
octopus to octopus i think it's fine

7253
04:34:41,840 --> 04:34:45,118
yeah fair fare fair i i like octopi but

7254
04:34:45,118 --> 04:34:47,919
yeah octopuses octopodes someone said

7255
04:34:47,919 --> 04:34:49,520

supporting marginalised people and

7259
04:34:54,639 --> 04:34:57,278
stardew valley which i think we used to

7260
04:34:57,278 --> 04:34:58,400
have a channel about but i can't

7261
04:34:58,400 --> 04:35:00,799
remember actually no animal crossing

7262
04:35:00,799 --> 04:35:02,320
there was an animal crossing channel

7263
04:35:02,320 --> 04:35:04,400
that got um sent to the graveyard

7264
04:35:04,400 --> 04:35:05,759
because i saw it and i was like yes

7265
04:35:05,759 --> 04:35:07,680
animal crossing and then i was like oh

7266
04:35:07,680 --> 04:35:09,680
well if lydia if you're watching you now

7267
04:35:09,680 --> 04:35:10,879
have somebody to play animal crossing

7268
04:35:10,879 --> 04:35:13,278
with because uh lydia is still playing

7269
04:35:13,278 --> 04:35:15,520
um but cairo is going to talk to us

7270

user bin pearl

7272
04:35:20,240 --> 04:35:21,759
why learning to knit made me a better

7273
04:35:21,759 --> 04:35:23,199
cyber professional which i'm really

7274
04:35:23,199 --> 04:35:24,799
excited about because i've been seeing

7275
04:35:24,799 --> 04:35:26,879
all of cairo's knitting and going wow i

7276
04:35:26,879 --> 04:35:28,480

7277
04:35:28,480 --> 04:35:31,359
so cairo feel free to take it away

7278
04:35:31,359 --> 04:35:35,438
awesome thank you um so yes as ian said

7279
04:35:35,438 --> 04:35:37,520

7280
04:35:37,520 --> 04:35:40,160
introduced me but i do have my own

7281
04:35:40,160 --> 04:35:41,599
little

7282
04:35:41,599 --> 04:35:44,799
introduction uh so hello i'm cairo as

7283
04:35:44,799 --> 04:35:46,400
mentioned i work in governance risk and

7284
04:35:46,400 --> 04:35:49,039
compliance at octopus deploy

7285
04:35:49,039 --> 04:35:51,278
my career journey is a little bit twisty

7286
04:35:51,278 --> 04:35:54,080
and turny so i actually started off uh

7287
04:35:54,080 --> 04:35:55,680
studying a bachelor of social science

7288
04:35:55,680 --> 04:35:57,919
focusing on politics and international

7289
04:35:57,919 --> 04:36:00,639
relations with the side of history

7290
04:36:00,639 --> 04:36:02,400
while i was studying and then after i

7291
04:36:02,400 --> 04:36:04,561
graduated i worked in hospitality for a

7292
04:36:04,561 --> 04:36:05,919
couple of years

7293
04:36:05,919 --> 04:36:07,919
eventually i got a little bit sick of

7294
04:36:07,919 --> 04:36:09,359
being yelled at and having to work

7295
04:36:09,359 --> 04:36:12,400
weekends so i moved into a tech support

7296
04:36:12,400 --> 04:36:13,599
role

7297
04:36:13,599 --> 04:36:15,359
where i still got yelled at but i didn't

7298
04:36:15,359 --> 04:36:17,599
have to work weekends

7299
04:36:17,599 --> 04:36:19,199
after that

7300
04:36:19,199 --> 04:36:21,438
i didn't really know anything about this

7301
04:36:21,438 --> 04:36:23,520
cyber security thing

7302
04:36:23,520 --> 04:36:25,680
um but i ended up applying for an

7303
04:36:25,680 --> 04:36:27,199
internal role at the organization i

7304
04:36:27,199 --> 04:36:28,958
worked for so that i would no longer get

7305
04:36:28,958 --> 04:36:30,320
yoda

7306
04:36:30,320 --> 04:36:32,400
so working in that entry-level role

7307
04:36:32,400 --> 04:36:34,240
there was definitely a lot less yelling

7308
04:36:34,240 --> 04:36:35,840
but when there was yelling it tended to

7309
04:36:35,840 --> 04:36:37,840
be slightly higher stakes than someone's

7310
04:36:37,840 --> 04:36:39,599
modem not working

7311
04:36:39,599 --> 04:36:42,000
uh from there i moved into consulting

7312
04:36:42,000 --> 04:36:44,080
which was a really great opportunity to

7313
04:36:44,080 --> 04:36:45,759
learn about a lot of different

7314
04:36:45,759 --> 04:36:47,278
organizations and a lot of different

7315
04:36:47,278 --> 04:36:48,639
industries

7316
04:36:48,639 --> 04:36:50,080
and how people were doing things

7317
04:36:50,080 --> 04:36:52,000
differently across those

7318
04:36:52,000 --> 04:36:54,000
from there i ended up working as a cyber

7319
04:36:54,000 --> 04:36:55,599
risk advisor for one of the world's

7320
04:36:55,599 --> 04:36:58,160
largest mining companies yes i did sell

7321
04:36:58,160 --> 04:37:00,561
out but i do live in perth so it's a

7322
04:37:00,561 --> 04:37:03,199
little hard to get away from mining here

7323
04:37:03,199 --> 04:37:04,799
after a couple of years there i moved to

7324
04:37:04,799 --> 04:37:07,118
my current role at octopus deploy as the

7325
04:37:07,118 --> 04:37:09,919
senior grc specialist i spend my days

7326
04:37:09,919 --> 04:37:12,080
doing risk assessments vendor

7327
04:37:12,080 --> 04:37:15,118
assessments working towards iso 27001

7328
04:37:15,118 --> 04:37:17,599
certification and a bit of training and

7329
04:37:17,599 --> 04:37:19,278
awareness stuff

7330
04:37:19,278 --> 04:37:21,359
and a bit of a sales pitch not for the

7331
04:37:21,359 --> 04:37:22,561
product because i don't know enough

7332
04:37:22,561 --> 04:37:25,118
about devops to really do that but for

7333
04:37:25,118 --> 04:37:26,879
my particular team

7334
04:37:26,879 --> 04:37:29,520
we are growing and i am currently hiring

7335
04:37:29,520 --> 04:37:32,799
uh so if you like the sound of iso 27001

7336
04:37:32,799 --> 04:37:34,561
and risk assessments and training and

7337
04:37:34,561 --> 04:37:36,400
awareness uh please reach out to me i'm

7338
04:37:36,400 --> 04:37:38,240
looking to interview us i would love to

7339
04:37:38,240 --> 04:37:39,840
hear from you

7340
04:37:39,840 --> 04:37:42,799
uh so i guess a little bit more relevant

7341
04:37:42,799 --> 04:37:45,599
to this particular talk is my knitting

7342
04:37:45,599 --> 04:37:48,240
journey uh so i wasn't actually someone

7343
04:37:48,240 --> 04:37:50,561
that grew up knitting it's not something

7344
04:37:50,561 --> 04:37:52,320
that you know any of my relatives taught

7345
04:37:52,320 --> 04:37:53,919
me to do as a kid

7346
04:37:53,919 --> 04:37:55,680
it's something i actually learned to do

7347
04:37:55,680 --> 04:37:58,480
last october so about six months ago

7348
04:37:58,480 --> 04:38:01,759
i decided that in 2021 i was going to do

7349
04:38:01,759 --> 04:38:03,199
this weird thing where i would learn to

7350
04:38:03,199 --> 04:38:05,278
do a bunch of different things

7351
04:38:05,278 --> 04:38:07,118
so i did a bunch of different classes i

7352
04:38:07,118 --> 04:38:09,039
learned to make cheese i learned to make

7353
04:38:09,039 --> 04:38:11,919
very bad pottery i did a cooking class

7354
04:38:11,919 --> 04:38:15,039
on using native australian ingredients

7355
04:38:15,039 --> 04:38:16,561
and by the time we got to october i

7356
04:38:16,561 --> 04:38:18,879
signed up for a knitting class

7357
04:38:18,879 --> 04:38:20,719
and i did four of these classes over

7358
04:38:20,719 --> 04:38:22,240
four weeks to cover off a lot of the

7359
04:38:22,240 --> 04:38:23,759
basics

7360
04:38:23,759 --> 04:38:25,199
and then from there i kind of use

7361
04:38:25,199 --> 04:38:27,359
youtube to teach myself the stuff we

7362
04:38:27,359 --> 04:38:29,599
hadn't covered or to remind myself of

7363
04:38:29,599 --> 04:38:30,958
the things we had that i had

7364
04:38:30,958 --> 04:38:33,759
subsequently forgotten

7365
04:38:33,759 --> 04:38:35,278
and in the last six months i've done a

7366
04:38:35,278 --> 04:38:38,000
couple of different projects i knitted a

7367
04:38:38,000 --> 04:38:40,480
scarf in a pattern called mistake rib

7368
04:38:40,480 --> 04:38:42,561
i knitted a baby blanket for a friend of

7369
04:38:42,561 --> 04:38:44,561
mine who actually had a baby just last

7370
04:38:44,561 --> 04:38:45,520
month

7371
04:38:45,520 --> 04:38:46,799
and that's the picture that's on the

7372
04:38:46,799 --> 04:38:48,000
slide there

7373
04:38:48,000 --> 04:38:49,919
i did some cute little christmas

7374
04:38:49,919 --> 04:38:52,000
coasters that had a christmas tree

7375
04:38:52,000 --> 04:38:53,438
pattern on them

7376
04:38:53,438 --> 04:38:56,080
and i'm currently working on a scarf

7377
04:38:56,080 --> 04:38:57,840
made from possum yarn

7378
04:38:57,840 --> 04:38:59,438
which i actually learned after i bought

7379
04:38:59,438 --> 04:39:00,799
the yarn

7380
04:39:00,799 --> 04:39:03,599
that they don't actually just sheer the

7381
04:39:03,599 --> 04:39:06,000
possums it's more of a kills opossums

7382
04:39:06,000 --> 04:39:08,561
take the pelt kind of situation

7383
04:39:08,561 --> 04:39:10,240
uh but it's from new zealand and they're

7384
04:39:10,240 --> 04:39:12,320
a pest and they do it uh within strict

7385
04:39:12,320 --> 04:39:13,919
government regulations to control the

7386
04:39:13,919 --> 04:39:16,561
population so it is ethical still don't

7387
04:39:16,561 --> 04:39:18,840
come for me on that one

7388
04:39:18,840 --> 04:39:20,719
um so you're probably sitting there

7389
04:39:20,719 --> 04:39:23,278
asking yourself well that's all cool but

7390
04:39:23,278 --> 04:39:24,799
why are we talking about knitting this

7391
04:39:24,799 --> 04:39:26,400
is a cyber security conference we should

7392
04:39:26,400 --> 04:39:28,400
be talking about important things like

7393
04:39:28,400 --> 04:39:30,639
chicken nuggets first chicken tendees

7394
04:39:30,639 --> 04:39:32,561
uh and my response to that would be well

7395
04:39:32,561 --> 04:39:34,400
first of all why not knitting i mean

7396
04:39:34,400 --> 04:39:36,000
obviously i quite enjoy it and i like

7397
04:39:36,000 --> 04:39:37,840
talking about it and

7398
04:39:37,840 --> 04:39:39,200
i don't know they put me on the agenda

7399
04:39:39,200 --> 04:39:40,560
so now you have to listen to me talk

7400
04:39:40,560 --> 04:39:41,760
about it

7401
04:39:41,760 --> 04:39:43,440
but outside of that i've actually found

7402
04:39:43,440 --> 04:39:44,638
there's been a lot of good things that

7403
04:39:44,638 --> 04:39:45,920
i've learned from knitting that are

7404
04:39:45,920 --> 04:39:47,360
actually relevant

7405
04:39:47,360 --> 04:39:49,040
to my profession

7406
04:39:49,040 --> 04:39:50,718
so to start with knitting is actually

7407
04:39:50,718 --> 04:39:52,240
quite a technical

7408
04:39:52,240 --> 04:39:55,040
process driven and complex skill there's

7409
04:39:55,040 --> 04:39:57,360
a lot going on about how everything kind

7410
04:39:57,360 --> 04:39:59,680
of fits together to make one knitted

7411
04:39:59,680 --> 04:40:01,040
item and i'm going to walk through some

7412
04:40:01,040 --> 04:40:03,360
of those uh and you can maybe see how

7413
04:40:03,360 --> 04:40:05,200
that might relate to some of the the

7414
04:40:05,200 --> 04:40:07,840
work that we do uh in it whether it's

7415
04:40:07,840 --> 04:40:09,680
coding or working with complex

7416
04:40:09,680 --> 04:40:11,600
interconnected systems

7417
04:40:11,600 --> 04:40:13,920
secondly learning itself is actually a

7418
04:40:13,920 --> 04:40:15,760
skill so i don't think that ever

7419
04:40:15,760 --> 04:40:17,600
learning anything is ever really a waste

7420
04:40:17,600 --> 04:40:19,200
of time

7421
04:40:19,200 --> 04:40:20,638
and finally

7422
04:40:20,638 --> 04:40:23,120
uh i think that

7423
04:40:23,120 --> 04:40:24,878
knitting actually has absolutely nothing

7424
04:40:24,878 --> 04:40:26,638
to do with cyber security and that's a

7425
04:40:26,638 --> 04:40:27,680
good thing

7426
04:40:27,680 --> 04:40:29,280
and i'm going to explain a bit more

7427
04:40:29,280 --> 04:40:31,920
about that point a bit later

7428
04:40:31,920 --> 04:40:33,760
so for status how is knitting actually

7429
04:40:33,760 --> 04:40:36,400
technical just a bunch of yarn right

7430
04:40:36,400 --> 04:40:38,320
well i don't think that's quite accurate

7431
04:40:38,320 --> 04:40:40,560
um so i'm going to assume most of you

7432
04:40:40,560 --> 04:40:42,718
have seen knitted items before and

7433
04:40:42,718 --> 04:40:44,400
you've probably seen there's a wide

7434
04:40:44,400 --> 04:40:47,360
variety of you know patterns and

7435
04:40:47,360 --> 04:40:48,958
everything that you'll see in different

7436
04:40:48,958 --> 04:40:51,680
knitted items what you might not know is

7437
04:40:51,680 --> 04:40:52,798
that

7438
04:40:52,798 --> 04:40:55,200
probably 80 of those patterns are the

7439
04:40:55,200 --> 04:40:58,480
result of just two different stitches

7440
04:40:58,480 --> 04:41:00,638
so the two main stitches that you learn

7441
04:41:00,638 --> 04:41:02,400
when you're learning to knit is a knit

7442
04:41:02,400 --> 04:41:04,798
stitch and a purl stitch

7443
04:41:04,798 --> 04:41:06,160
so for those of you who didn't get the

7444
04:41:06,160 --> 04:41:08,400
pun in my talk title hopefully that's

7445
04:41:08,400 --> 04:41:10,480
just clicked into place

7446
04:41:10,480 --> 04:41:12,718
but a knit stitch uh is basically you

7447
04:41:12,718 --> 04:41:15,440
take uh you've got your loop of yarn you

7448
04:41:15,440 --> 04:41:17,440
take your needle from front to back and

7449
04:41:17,440 --> 04:41:20,240
you bring your uh tail yarn from back to

7450
04:41:20,240 --> 04:41:22,400
front and you loop it around

7451
04:41:22,400 --> 04:41:24,000
and a purl stitch is basically the

7452
04:41:24,000 --> 04:41:25,840
reverse of that so you take your needle

7453
04:41:25,840 --> 04:41:27,600
from back to front and you bring your

7454
04:41:27,600 --> 04:41:29,920
yarn from front to back

7455
04:41:29,920 --> 04:41:32,000
that's basically the the main two things

7456
04:41:32,000 --> 04:41:33,200
you need to learn when you're learning

7457
04:41:33,200 --> 04:41:35,120
to knit and what i find really

7458
04:41:35,120 --> 04:41:37,040
interesting is that you can combine just

7459
04:41:37,040 --> 04:41:38,718
these two stitches

7460
04:41:38,718 --> 04:41:40,480
in a whole bunch of different ways to

7461
04:41:40,480 --> 04:41:42,240
create different patterns and the way

7462
04:41:42,240 --> 04:41:45,360
that works is that each actual stitch is

7463
04:41:45,360 --> 04:41:47,440
dependent on the stitches that come

7464
04:41:47,440 --> 04:41:49,920
before it in a row to create that

7465
04:41:49,920 --> 04:41:53,280
pattern but they also work in columns in

7466
04:41:53,280 --> 04:41:55,680
a vertical way as well so it's how those

7467
04:41:55,680 --> 04:41:57,600
particular stitches are combined

7468
04:41:57,600 --> 04:42:00,560
horizontally and vertically to create

7469
04:42:00,560 --> 04:42:02,878
different patterns and that to me sounds

7470
04:42:02,878 --> 04:42:05,600
a lot like links lists uh it's it seems

7471
04:42:05,600 --> 04:42:07,760
a lot like code and i'm not going to go

7472
04:42:07,760 --> 04:42:09,360
into a huge amount of detail because i

7473
04:42:09,360 --> 04:42:11,120
probably don't know enough about coding

7474
04:42:11,120 --> 04:42:13,760
to really make the metaphor stick

7475
04:42:13,760 --> 04:42:15,040
but i'm going to walk you through a

7476
04:42:15,040 --> 04:42:16,638
couple of different stitch patterns to

7477
04:42:16,638 --> 04:42:19,520
show you what i mean

7478
04:42:19,520 --> 04:42:22,080
so to start with the really basic one

7479
04:42:22,080 --> 04:42:23,520
garter stitch and stocking stitch are

7480
04:42:23,520 --> 04:42:25,920
your two most basic stitch patterns

7481
04:42:25,920 --> 04:42:28,080
so on the right hand side in the light

7482
04:42:28,080 --> 04:42:30,638
blue this is a garter stitch pattern

7483
04:42:30,638 --> 04:42:32,638
and to make a garter stitch you're

7484
04:42:32,638 --> 04:42:34,240
basically just doing

7485
04:42:34,240 --> 04:42:37,360
rows of either knits or purl stitches

7486
04:42:37,360 --> 04:42:39,440
it's all just the same stitch over and

7487
04:42:39,440 --> 04:42:41,440
over and over again and that's how you

7488
04:42:41,440 --> 04:42:44,080
get these little horizontal lines

7489
04:42:44,080 --> 04:42:46,320
uh whereas stocking stitch as you can

7490
04:42:46,320 --> 04:42:48,878
see that's the dark blue on the screen

7491
04:42:48,878 --> 04:42:50,798
it goes in the opposite way so you've

7492
04:42:50,798 --> 04:42:52,878
basically got these vertical lines and

7493
04:42:52,878 --> 04:42:54,878
the way that you create that is by

7494
04:42:54,878 --> 04:42:57,200
alternating rows of knit stitches and

7495
04:42:57,200 --> 04:42:59,840
then purl stitches so just by changing

7496
04:42:59,840 --> 04:43:01,600
that and alternating those two stitch

7497
04:43:01,600 --> 04:43:03,760
types you've basically rotated the

7498
04:43:03,760 --> 04:43:06,000
pattern completely 90 degrees and you're

7499
04:43:06,000 --> 04:43:08,480
going vertical rather than horizontal i

7500
04:43:08,480 --> 04:43:10,240
think that's pretty cool

7501
04:43:10,240 --> 04:43:11,200
um

7502
04:43:11,200 --> 04:43:13,600
and there is basically a ton of

7503
04:43:13,600 --> 04:43:14,958
different stitch patterns there's

7504
04:43:14,958 --> 04:43:17,200
actually a website called stitch a day

7505
04:43:17,200 --> 04:43:19,120
which you can go to which will show you

7506
04:43:19,120 --> 04:43:20,718
a different stitch pattern that you can

7507
04:43:20,718 --> 04:43:21,680
learn

7508
04:43:21,680 --> 04:43:24,320
and there's enough for more than a year

7509
04:43:24,320 --> 04:43:26,240
and these are all just combinations of

7510
04:43:26,240 --> 04:43:28,240
knits and pearls

7511
04:43:28,240 --> 04:43:30,480
in different rows so some of these

7512
04:43:30,480 --> 04:43:33,360
patterns repeat over two rows uh some of

7513
04:43:33,360 --> 04:43:35,680
them repeat over four some of them go to

7514
04:43:35,680 --> 04:43:38,080
six eight or twelve uh it starts getting

7515
04:43:38,080 --> 04:43:41,200
quite complex but here's four or a

7516
04:43:41,200 --> 04:43:42,320
quadrant

7517
04:43:42,320 --> 04:43:44,638
um it's not quite a quadrant but we'll

7518
04:43:44,638 --> 04:43:46,958
lead into it just to show you a bit of

7519
04:43:46,958 --> 04:43:48,798
variety about what you can actually get

7520
04:43:48,798 --> 04:43:50,798
with these two stitch types

7521
04:43:50,798 --> 04:43:53,360
so the first one uh is the the green one

7522
04:43:53,360 --> 04:43:54,958
that is a seed stitch

7523
04:43:54,958 --> 04:43:56,400
uh you can see you've kind of got those

7524
04:43:56,400 --> 04:43:59,040
cute little x's going on

7525
04:43:59,040 --> 04:44:02,000
next to it in the gray is a broken rib

7526
04:44:02,000 --> 04:44:04,400
uh i quite like a broken rib because

7527
04:44:04,400 --> 04:44:06,080
usually you make a rib pattern and

7528
04:44:06,080 --> 04:44:08,320
knitting by doing

7529
04:44:08,320 --> 04:44:10,400
an even number of stitches so multiples

7530
04:44:10,400 --> 04:44:12,080
of two or four

7531
04:44:12,080 --> 04:44:14,080
whereas broken rib you actually do an

7532
04:44:14,080 --> 04:44:16,480
odd number of stitches and everything's

7533
04:44:16,480 --> 04:44:19,040
offset by one what's really smart about

7534
04:44:19,040 --> 04:44:21,760
this is that it actually originated from

7535
04:44:21,760 --> 04:44:24,400
someone making a mistake and casting on

7536
04:44:24,400 --> 04:44:26,480
an odd number of stitches instead of an

7537
04:44:26,480 --> 04:44:28,718
even number of stitches so instead of

7538
04:44:28,718 --> 04:44:30,878
going back and fixing the error they

7539
04:44:30,878 --> 04:44:32,160
rolled with it and they managed to

7540
04:44:32,160 --> 04:44:34,160
create this pattern that still looks a

7541
04:44:34,160 --> 04:44:36,240
lot like a traditional rib but it's all

7542
04:44:36,240 --> 04:44:38,240
offset by one which i think is pretty

7543
04:44:38,240 --> 04:44:39,760
cool it's a bit of a bit of a knitting

7544
04:44:39,760 --> 04:44:41,600
hack

7545
04:44:41,600 --> 04:44:43,520
after that on the bottom row we have a

7546
04:44:43,520 --> 04:44:46,638
basket weave so this is the gray one on

7547
04:44:46,638 --> 04:44:47,760
the bottom

7548
04:44:47,760 --> 04:44:50,560
and this alternates uh little rectangles

7549
04:44:50,560 --> 04:44:52,718
of uh garter stitch and stockinette

7550
04:44:52,718 --> 04:44:55,040
stitch to create that kind of illusion

7551
04:44:55,040 --> 04:44:57,120
of a woven basket

7552
04:44:57,120 --> 04:44:58,958
and then finally on the right hand side

7553
04:44:58,958 --> 04:45:01,600
in the pink we have a diagonal scallop

7554
04:45:01,600 --> 04:45:03,520
so this has these kind of cool little

7555
04:45:03,520 --> 04:45:06,000
loops that go diagonally down the fabric

7556
04:45:06,000 --> 04:45:08,000
and as i said all of these are just

7557
04:45:08,000 --> 04:45:10,240
combinations of those same two

7558
04:45:10,240 --> 04:45:11,920
individual stitches

7559
04:45:11,920 --> 04:45:14,958
repeated over different rows

7560
04:45:14,958 --> 04:45:18,560
and that's kind of awesome and amazing

7561
04:45:18,560 --> 04:45:20,320
but it also means there's a lot to keep

7562
04:45:20,320 --> 04:45:22,958
track of because you have you know

7563
04:45:22,958 --> 04:45:24,798
different rows and you need to be doing

7564
04:45:24,798 --> 04:45:26,798
a particular number of stitches in each

7565
04:45:26,798 --> 04:45:27,760
row

7566
04:45:27,760 --> 04:45:29,520
and if you're anything like me you have

7567
04:45:29,520 --> 04:45:31,600
very bad short-term memory and you will

7568
04:45:31,600 --> 04:45:34,080
immediately forget what you've just done

7569
04:45:34,080 --> 04:45:36,878
like within a millisecond of doing it so

7570
04:45:36,878 --> 04:45:38,480
you have to keep track of what stitch

7571
04:45:38,480 --> 04:45:40,400
you're doing in your row and also

7572
04:45:40,400 --> 04:45:42,560
counting your number of rows so that you

7573
04:45:42,560 --> 04:45:44,798
are you know alternating correctly or

7574
04:45:44,798 --> 04:45:47,120
you're doing you know the third

7575
04:45:47,120 --> 04:45:48,080
uh

7576
04:45:48,080 --> 04:45:49,600
different row in the pattern that you

7577
04:45:49,600 --> 04:45:51,600
need to be doing

7578
04:45:51,600 --> 04:45:53,200
so here i have an example of what

7579
04:45:53,200 --> 04:45:55,600
happens if you get mixed up or you stop

7580
04:45:55,600 --> 04:45:57,680
paying attention uh and you stuff

7581
04:45:57,680 --> 04:45:59,520
something up so this is from the baby

7582
04:45:59,520 --> 04:46:01,920
blanket that i showed you earlier

7583
04:46:01,920 --> 04:46:03,680
and as you can see this is right at the

7584
04:46:03,680 --> 04:46:05,360
beginning when i started uh and right

7585
04:46:05,360 --> 04:46:07,920
down the bottom you can see it switched

7586
04:46:07,920 --> 04:46:10,718
from the kind of the little nubbly uh

7587
04:46:10,718 --> 04:46:12,480
pattern that should be in the nice

7588
04:46:12,480 --> 04:46:15,280
columns to more of a platted pattern

7589
04:46:15,280 --> 04:46:16,160
there

7590
04:46:16,160 --> 04:46:18,638
and what actually happened is that i

7591
04:46:18,638 --> 04:46:21,440
accidentally repeated one of my rows so

7592
04:46:21,440 --> 04:46:23,680
this particular pattern there's two rows

7593
04:46:23,680 --> 04:46:26,320
that i'm repeating over and over again

7594
04:46:26,320 --> 04:46:28,240
i lost track

7595
04:46:28,240 --> 04:46:30,480
wasn't super good at actually reading my

7596
04:46:30,480 --> 04:46:32,638
stitches to tell apart the knits and the

7597
04:46:32,638 --> 04:46:34,798
pearls to work out what row i was

7598
04:46:34,798 --> 04:46:37,040
supposed to be doing and i repeated the

7599
04:46:37,040 --> 04:46:39,040
same row twice instead of switching to

7600
04:46:39,040 --> 04:46:40,400
the other row

7601
04:46:40,400 --> 04:46:42,000
and what that's done is it's actually

7602
04:46:42,000 --> 04:46:44,798
reversed the pattern so those columns

7603
04:46:44,798 --> 04:46:45,920
that you see at the bottom is actually

7604
04:46:45,920 --> 04:46:48,958
what the back of this blanket looks like

7605
04:46:48,958 --> 04:46:50,718
and those look like little nubbly bits

7606
04:46:50,718 --> 04:46:51,840
on the front is what the front is

7607
04:46:51,840 --> 04:46:53,520
supposed to look like

7608
04:46:53,520 --> 04:46:55,920
so by repeating that particular row i've

7609
04:46:55,920 --> 04:46:58,000
switched it and i've started getting

7610
04:46:58,000 --> 04:46:59,840
the nubbly bits on the back and i've

7611
04:46:59,840 --> 04:47:01,760
started getting these particular columns

7612
04:47:01,760 --> 04:47:02,958
on the front

7613
04:47:02,958 --> 04:47:06,000
now there is actually a way to undo this

7614
04:47:06,000 --> 04:47:08,000
it's called unknitting

7615
04:47:08,000 --> 04:47:11,520
or tinking which is knitting backwards

7616
04:47:11,520 --> 04:47:13,040
and what you do is you basically just

7617
04:47:13,040 --> 04:47:15,680
undo each of those stitches

7618
04:47:15,680 --> 04:47:17,440
and you you basically reverse it so that

7619
04:47:17,440 --> 04:47:19,200
you can undo and you can go all the way

7620
04:47:19,200 --> 04:47:21,920
back to where you've made that error

7621
04:47:21,920 --> 04:47:25,040
unknit those stitches redo them and then

7622
04:47:25,040 --> 04:47:26,718
carry on

7623
04:47:26,718 --> 04:47:28,958
now this could be quite time consuming

7624
04:47:28,958 --> 04:47:30,320
particularly if you're like me and

7625
04:47:30,320 --> 04:47:32,798
you're new to it and it takes

7626
04:47:32,798 --> 04:47:35,280
longer than it actually takes to knit

7627
04:47:35,280 --> 04:47:37,120
and also because i was still quite new

7628
04:47:37,120 --> 04:47:38,560
at this point

7629
04:47:38,560 --> 04:47:40,240
it took me a little while to work out

7630
04:47:40,240 --> 04:47:41,920
what i'd actually done wrong so i

7631
04:47:41,920 --> 04:47:43,840
actually knitted a couple of rows before

7632
04:47:43,840 --> 04:47:46,080
i realized that i had stuffed up and

7633
04:47:46,080 --> 04:47:48,240
switched around i was looking at it like

7634
04:47:48,240 --> 04:47:49,600
wait this this isn't what they're

7635
04:47:49,600 --> 04:47:50,638
supposed to look like and then i was

7636
04:47:50,638 --> 04:47:53,200
like i've switched them around

7637
04:47:53,200 --> 04:47:54,958
now i could have unknitted it probably

7638
04:47:54,958 --> 04:47:57,200
would have taken me about three hours to

7639
04:47:57,200 --> 04:47:59,920
unknit just that little section

7640
04:47:59,920 --> 04:48:01,120
um

7641
04:48:01,120 --> 04:48:02,798
at this point i decided that since it

7642
04:48:02,798 --> 04:48:04,560
was quite early in the project i could

7643
04:48:04,560 --> 04:48:06,958
pass that off as a decorative border and

7644
04:48:06,958 --> 04:48:09,360
just move on

7645
04:48:09,360 --> 04:48:11,360
and that's what i ended up doing

7646
04:48:11,360 --> 04:48:12,718
i decided to

7647
04:48:12,718 --> 04:48:14,718
accept the risk that it didn't look

7648
04:48:14,718 --> 04:48:17,360
perfect and just move on with my life

7649
04:48:17,360 --> 04:48:19,600
now just above that section you can also

7650
04:48:19,600 --> 04:48:21,280
see there's a bit of a patch there where

7651
04:48:21,280 --> 04:48:23,040
the little columns have actually become

7652
04:48:23,040 --> 04:48:24,560
uneven

7653
04:48:24,560 --> 04:48:26,320
and the problem that i've had here is as

7654
04:48:26,320 --> 04:48:27,920
i mentioned i have terrible short-term

7655
04:48:27,920 --> 04:48:30,638
memory and i had completely forgotten

7656
04:48:30,638 --> 04:48:32,638
what stitch i had just done

7657
04:48:32,638 --> 04:48:35,360
so instead of doing a knit pearl knit

7658
04:48:35,360 --> 04:48:37,680
pearl knit purl like i was supposed to

7659
04:48:37,680 --> 04:48:39,280
i missed one of the pearls and i did

7660
04:48:39,280 --> 04:48:41,600
three knits in a row

7661
04:48:41,600 --> 04:48:42,958
this is why i've ended up with those

7662
04:48:42,958 --> 04:48:44,638
uneven patches

7663
04:48:44,638 --> 04:48:46,560
and again i could have unknit this to go

7664
04:48:46,560 --> 04:48:48,798
back and fix it up but i didn't realize

7665
04:48:48,798 --> 04:48:51,280
until it was a fair bit later so i just

7666
04:48:51,280 --> 04:48:54,320
figured well it's probably not gonna be

7667
04:48:54,320 --> 04:48:56,480
noticed so we'll just pretend it never

7668
04:48:56,480 --> 04:48:58,480
happened and move on

7669
04:48:58,480 --> 04:49:00,080
uh so this is what you can see happens

7670
04:49:00,080 --> 04:49:02,160
when you're doing a pattern and you get

7671
04:49:02,160 --> 04:49:03,520
mixed up or you're not that great at

7672
04:49:03,520 --> 04:49:04,638
math or you're not that great at

7673
04:49:04,638 --> 04:49:05,840
remembering

7674
04:49:05,840 --> 04:49:08,080
um but this is the the methods that

7675
04:49:08,080 --> 04:49:09,520
you're using to create repeating

7676
04:49:09,520 --> 04:49:10,798
patterns

7677
04:49:10,798 --> 04:49:12,958
you can also knitting actually create

7678
04:49:12,958 --> 04:49:14,958
images uh which is a little bit more

7679
04:49:14,958 --> 04:49:16,080
involved

7680
04:49:16,080 --> 04:49:17,120
uh and i'm going to walk you through

7681
04:49:17,120 --> 04:49:19,200
what that actually looks like so let's

7682
04:49:19,200 --> 04:49:21,360
say you wanted to knit an actual picture

7683
04:49:21,360 --> 04:49:23,440
like this little octopus

7684
04:49:23,440 --> 04:49:25,600
and i will admit i did steal this from

7685
04:49:25,600 --> 04:49:27,360
the internet i haven't actually knitted

7686
04:49:27,360 --> 04:49:30,080
it myself uh i do plan to which is why

7687
04:49:30,080 --> 04:49:32,638
it's in my bookmarks um but because it's

7688
04:49:32,638 --> 04:49:35,120
quite complex i decided to use this as

7689
04:49:35,120 --> 04:49:37,280
the example so let's say you wanted to

7690
04:49:37,280 --> 04:49:39,360
knit this particular square usually you

7691
04:49:39,360 --> 04:49:41,040
would knit a bunch of them and make them

7692
04:49:41,040 --> 04:49:42,878
into a blanket or you can use them as

7693
04:49:42,878 --> 04:49:44,480
washcloths

7694
04:49:44,480 --> 04:49:46,320
you would need a pattern to tell you how

7695
04:49:46,320 --> 04:49:48,718
to do that and it's not just you know

7696
04:49:48,718 --> 04:49:50,320
two or three rows that you need to

7697
04:49:50,320 --> 04:49:52,160
remember and repeat it's actually each

7698
04:49:52,160 --> 04:49:55,520
row is different from the last

7699
04:49:55,520 --> 04:49:57,120
so this is what a knitting pattern when

7700
04:49:57,120 --> 04:49:59,760
it's written out actually looks like

7701
04:49:59,760 --> 04:50:02,560
you can see um it sets out each of your

7702
04:50:02,560 --> 04:50:04,718
stitches where it says k that is a knit

7703
04:50:04,718 --> 04:50:07,280
stitch where it says p that is a purl

7704
04:50:07,280 --> 04:50:08,400
stitch

7705
04:50:08,400 --> 04:50:09,840
and the numbers after each of the

7706
04:50:09,840 --> 04:50:11,920
letters are how many of that particular

7707
04:50:11,920 --> 04:50:13,360
stitch you do

7708
04:50:13,360 --> 04:50:14,080
so

7709
04:50:14,080 --> 04:50:15,600
written out you can see we start with

7710
04:50:15,600 --> 04:50:17,440
rows one to seven are the same and

7711
04:50:17,440 --> 04:50:19,600
that's that little border

7712
04:50:19,600 --> 04:50:21,440
and from there each row tends to be

7713
04:50:21,440 --> 04:50:23,280
different for this particular one a lot

7714
04:50:23,280 --> 04:50:25,440
of the odd numbered rows are exactly the

7715
04:50:25,440 --> 04:50:26,798
same

7716
04:50:26,798 --> 04:50:28,320
and then the even rows will actually

7717
04:50:28,320 --> 04:50:29,600
change and that's how you're getting

7718
04:50:29,600 --> 04:50:32,240
that difference between the stocking at

7719
04:50:32,240 --> 04:50:34,798
stitch that is the background

7720
04:50:34,798 --> 04:50:36,320
and the garter stitch that is the

7721
04:50:36,320 --> 04:50:38,638
octopus itself so putting all of this

7722
04:50:38,638 --> 04:50:40,878
together i tend to chuck these into one

7723
04:50:40,878 --> 04:50:42,878
note and tick off each row as i go

7724
04:50:42,878 --> 04:50:44,840
because otherwise i get very

7725
04:50:44,840 --> 04:50:46,878
confused but this is what you're looking

7726
04:50:46,878 --> 04:50:50,240
at when you look at a knitting pattern

7727
04:50:50,240 --> 04:50:51,600
there is another way that you can

7728
04:50:51,600 --> 04:50:54,000
represent these knitting patterns

7729
04:50:54,000 --> 04:50:56,798
and that is this which is a pattern

7730
04:50:56,798 --> 04:50:58,718
chart

7731
04:50:58,718 --> 04:51:00,718
i really hate these i'll be honest

7732
04:51:00,718 --> 04:51:02,878
because they just don't make sense to me

7733
04:51:02,878 --> 04:51:04,718
but what you might notice is they

7734
04:51:04,718 --> 04:51:06,958
actually look a lot like a punch card

7735
04:51:06,958 --> 04:51:10,240
um and that's not by accident so a lot

7736
04:51:10,240 --> 04:51:12,000
of these kinds of patterns

7737
04:51:12,000 --> 04:51:14,400
are actually used by knitting machines

7738
04:51:14,400 --> 04:51:16,718
to actually knit a pattern and the punch

7739
04:51:16,718 --> 04:51:18,878
card will tell the machine what to knit

7740
04:51:18,878 --> 04:51:21,600
verse what to purl which is pretty cool

7741
04:51:21,600 --> 04:51:22,400
um

7742
04:51:22,400 --> 04:51:24,878
what makes these difficult to read as a

7743
04:51:24,878 --> 04:51:25,920
human

7744
04:51:25,920 --> 04:51:28,878
is that each row the dots actually mean

7745
04:51:28,878 --> 04:51:30,240
something different

7746
04:51:30,240 --> 04:51:31,920
so with this kind of pattern you start

7747
04:51:31,920 --> 04:51:33,600
on the bottom left

7748
04:51:33,600 --> 04:51:35,680
and for the first row and all of the

7749
04:51:35,680 --> 04:51:37,920
subsequent odd numbered rows

7750
04:51:37,920 --> 04:51:40,638
uh the blank squares mean a pearl

7751
04:51:40,638 --> 04:51:42,958
and the dots in the squares mean a knit

7752
04:51:42,958 --> 04:51:45,280
whereas it's actually the inverse for

7753
04:51:45,280 --> 04:51:47,920
the even numbered rows so the dot would

7754
04:51:47,920 --> 04:51:49,760
mean a pearl and the blank space would

7755
04:51:49,760 --> 04:51:52,160
mean a knit so my brain does not like

7756
04:51:52,160 --> 04:51:54,638
that i can't keep track of it um but it

7757
04:51:54,638 --> 04:51:56,400
is definitely used by people and it is

7758
04:51:56,400 --> 04:51:58,958
often used by machines as well

7759
04:51:58,958 --> 04:51:59,840
so

7760
04:51:59,840 --> 04:52:01,200
you can see how there is this

7761
04:52:01,200 --> 04:52:03,840
relationship between a lot of the ways

7762
04:52:03,840 --> 04:52:05,680
that our technology works and is

7763
04:52:05,680 --> 04:52:08,718
connected to each other versus um

7764
04:52:08,718 --> 04:52:10,080
the ways that we're actually reading

7765
04:52:10,080 --> 04:52:11,920
these knitting patterns and i could go

7766
04:52:11,920 --> 04:52:13,760
on a rant about how we tend to

7767
04:52:13,760 --> 04:52:16,000
traditionally uh

7768
04:52:16,000 --> 04:52:18,320
underestimate the technical value of

7769
04:52:18,320 --> 04:52:20,320
traditionally feminine pursuits

7770
04:52:20,320 --> 04:52:21,680
but i'm not going to do that there are

7771
04:52:21,680 --> 04:52:24,000
people much more qualified than me to do

7772
04:52:24,000 --> 04:52:26,000
on that rat but something to maybe keep

7773
04:52:26,000 --> 04:52:27,920
in mind

7774
04:52:27,920 --> 04:52:29,360
so moving on from that i'm going to talk

7775
04:52:29,360 --> 04:52:32,240
about the next point which is you know

7776
04:52:32,240 --> 04:52:33,600
learning is always good you know

7777
04:52:33,600 --> 04:52:36,400
learning new skills is a skill

7778
04:52:36,400 --> 04:52:39,680
in and of itself so learning to knit it

7779
04:52:39,680 --> 04:52:43,200
really gave me this new insight into

7780
04:52:43,200 --> 04:52:45,520
learning a new skill it kind of keeps

7781
04:52:45,520 --> 04:52:48,160
your brain sharp uh and particularly if

7782
04:52:48,160 --> 04:52:50,000
you're anything like me and i hope

7783
04:52:50,000 --> 04:52:52,638
you're not because this is not my best

7784
04:52:52,638 --> 04:52:54,160
characteristic

7785
04:52:54,160 --> 04:52:55,760
but i tend to be one of those people

7786
04:52:55,760 --> 04:52:57,120
that feels like

7787
04:52:57,120 --> 04:52:58,798
if you're good at something it just kind

7788
04:52:58,798 --> 04:53:01,200
of comes naturally and if you don't

7789
04:53:01,200 --> 04:53:02,878
immediately excel

7790
04:53:02,878 --> 04:53:04,718
that means you will never be good at it

7791
04:53:04,718 --> 04:53:06,878
and you should just never do it again

7792
04:53:06,878 --> 04:53:08,480
and then just destroy all evidence that

7793
04:53:08,480 --> 04:53:09,920
you tried

7794
04:53:09,920 --> 04:53:11,520
not the most healthy approach to

7795
04:53:11,520 --> 04:53:13,280
learning particularly when so many of

7796
04:53:13,280 --> 04:53:16,000
the skills that we learn in life are

7797
04:53:16,000 --> 04:53:17,600
things that you actually just need to

7798
04:53:17,600 --> 04:53:19,760
build on and practice and repeat over

7799
04:53:19,760 --> 04:53:21,760
and over until you get the hang of it a

7800
04:53:21,760 --> 04:53:24,240
lot of it is muscle memory or just like

7801
04:53:24,240 --> 04:53:25,520
really getting it into your head that

7802
04:53:25,520 --> 04:53:27,120
that's how things work

7803
04:53:27,120 --> 04:53:29,120
and that's how knitting works you can't

7804
04:53:29,120 --> 04:53:31,200
actually be immediately good at it you

7805
04:53:31,200 --> 04:53:32,878
have to repeat it and build up that

7806
04:53:32,878 --> 04:53:35,680
muscle memory um because like 80 of it

7807
04:53:35,680 --> 04:53:37,760
is muscle memory the other 20 is maths

7808
04:53:37,760 --> 04:53:39,600
and i don't want to do the maths so i

7809
04:53:39,600 --> 04:53:40,878
need to be really good at that muscle

7810
04:53:40,878 --> 04:53:42,080
memory

7811
04:53:42,080 --> 04:53:45,680
so it's really given me this new way to

7812
04:53:45,680 --> 04:53:47,280
keep my brain sharp something to

7813
04:53:47,280 --> 04:53:49,600
practice at to keep me in the habit of

7814
04:53:49,600 --> 04:53:52,877
learning how to learn

7815
04:53:53,760 --> 04:53:56,080
and i'm going to go to my last point and

7816
04:53:56,080 --> 04:53:58,080
for those of you who don't know me i can

7817
04:53:58,080 --> 04:54:00,240
be a little bit opinionated for those of

7818
04:54:00,240 --> 04:54:01,600
you who do know me i'm sure this is

7819
04:54:01,600 --> 04:54:02,638
expected

7820
04:54:02,638 --> 04:54:04,000
uh but i'm gonna get a little bit

7821
04:54:04,000 --> 04:54:06,000
preachy but stay with me i think i have

7822
04:54:06,000 --> 04:54:07,840
a good point

7823
04:54:07,840 --> 04:54:08,878
um

7824
04:54:08,878 --> 04:54:09,600
so

7825
04:54:09,600 --> 04:54:11,280
knitting is good for me as a cyber

7826
04:54:11,280 --> 04:54:13,200
security professional because ultimately

7827
04:54:13,200 --> 04:54:16,160
it has nothing to do with cyber security

7828
04:54:16,160 --> 04:54:17,920
and by that i mean i can get off my

7829
04:54:17,920 --> 04:54:19,360
computer

7830
04:54:19,360 --> 04:54:21,440
i can walk away from a screen and i can

7831
04:54:21,440 --> 04:54:22,718
do something

7832
04:54:22,718 --> 04:54:26,080
that has nothing to do with my computer

7833
04:54:26,080 --> 04:54:27,760
and that's a really good thing in an

7834
04:54:27,760 --> 04:54:30,400
industry which tends to exploit people's

7835
04:54:30,400 --> 04:54:33,040
passion and push people

7836
04:54:33,040 --> 04:54:35,680
to live and breathe what they do for a

7837
04:54:35,680 --> 04:54:38,160
job and i don't like that's not always a

7838
04:54:38,160 --> 04:54:39,680
bad thing i mean obviously all of us are

7839
04:54:39,680 --> 04:54:41,360
here at a cyber security conference on

7840
04:54:41,360 --> 04:54:44,080
the weekend and that's good but if all

7841
04:54:44,080 --> 04:54:45,680
you're ever doing

7842
04:54:45,680 --> 04:54:48,480
is stuff that's related to your job you

7843
04:54:48,480 --> 04:54:50,480
will burn out um

7844
04:54:50,480 --> 04:54:52,400
so you need to have those alternate

7845
04:54:52,400 --> 04:54:54,240
hobbies that take you away from that

7846
04:54:54,240 --> 04:54:55,280
world

7847
04:54:55,280 --> 04:54:57,360
and give you something else to focus on

7848
04:54:57,360 --> 04:54:59,200
because otherwise you're going to burn

7849
04:54:59,200 --> 04:55:00,958
out and that's not great for you

7850
04:55:00,958 --> 04:55:02,718
personally but it's also not great for

7851
04:55:02,718 --> 04:55:05,280
the industry because we end up losing

7852
04:55:05,280 --> 04:55:06,798
really capable people who know what

7853
04:55:06,798 --> 04:55:09,280
they're doing who just can't actually do

7854
04:55:09,280 --> 04:55:10,958
it anymore because they went too hard

7855
04:55:10,958 --> 04:55:13,840
too fast

7856
04:55:14,400 --> 04:55:16,878
and finally my second point is that i

7857
04:55:16,878 --> 04:55:18,240
read something about how knitting is

7858
04:55:18,240 --> 04:55:19,680
actually a really great antidote to

7859
04:55:19,680 --> 04:55:21,760
existential dread

7860
04:55:21,760 --> 04:55:22,958
and i think this is particularly

7861
04:55:22,958 --> 04:55:24,480
relevant for those of us who work in

7862
04:55:24,480 --> 04:55:26,718
cyber security because

7863
04:55:26,718 --> 04:55:28,798
we deal with a lot of that's going

7864
04:55:28,798 --> 04:55:29,920
wrong

7865
04:55:29,920 --> 04:55:32,080
and there's a lot of it you know there

7866
04:55:32,080 --> 04:55:34,240
is always a new vulnerability there is

7867
04:55:34,240 --> 04:55:36,560
always a new you know update to a

7868
04:55:36,560 --> 04:55:38,160
standard there's always a new product

7869
04:55:38,160 --> 04:55:40,560
you need to risk assess there is always

7870
04:55:40,560 --> 04:55:42,480
you know changes to code that need to be

7871
04:55:42,480 --> 04:55:44,638
reviewed there is always stuff that's

7872
04:55:44,638 --> 04:55:46,480
going wrong and if you're anything like

7873
04:55:46,480 --> 04:55:49,200
me you have a huge mountain of work that

7874
04:55:49,200 --> 04:55:51,120
you intend to get through

7875
04:55:51,120 --> 04:55:53,120
but it often feels like stuff is being

7876
04:55:53,120 --> 04:55:54,958
added to that mountain

7877
04:55:54,958 --> 04:55:57,200
faster than you can get through it

7878
04:55:57,200 --> 04:55:59,200
so it can be really easy to fall into

7879
04:55:59,200 --> 04:56:01,520
this hole where you feel like you're

7880
04:56:01,520 --> 04:56:03,280
never actually making a difference it

7881
04:56:03,280 --> 04:56:04,878
gets sicifian

7882
04:56:04,878 --> 04:56:06,000
um

7883
04:56:06,000 --> 04:56:07,920
and i find knitting to be a really great

7884
04:56:07,920 --> 04:56:09,680
antidote to that because it's really

7885
04:56:09,680 --> 04:56:11,760
hard to feel like you're not

7886
04:56:11,760 --> 04:56:13,360
accomplishing something or making a

7887
04:56:13,360 --> 04:56:15,040
difference in the world when you can

7888
04:56:15,040 --> 04:56:17,120
actually hold something tangible

7889
04:56:17,120 --> 04:56:18,718
something physical

7890
04:56:18,718 --> 04:56:21,040
that you made like the picture on this

7891
04:56:21,040 --> 04:56:23,200
slide is a scarf that i knitted it was

7892
04:56:23,200 --> 04:56:25,760
my first big project and i made that

7893
04:56:25,760 --> 04:56:27,840
like it was just a pile of yarn before

7894
04:56:27,840 --> 04:56:29,680
and i took that yarn and i made it into

7895
04:56:29,680 --> 04:56:31,520
something and i gave it to someone as a

7896
04:56:31,520 --> 04:56:32,560
gift

7897
04:56:32,560 --> 04:56:34,240
and that gift will keep them warm in the

7898
04:56:34,240 --> 04:56:36,718
winter and bring them joy and it brings

7899
04:56:36,718 --> 04:56:38,400
me joy so

7900
04:56:38,400 --> 04:56:40,160
it's really hard to kind of feel bad

7901
04:56:40,160 --> 04:56:41,760
about yourself for not accomplishing

7902
04:56:41,760 --> 04:56:43,360
things when you can physically hold

7903
04:56:43,360 --> 04:56:45,360
something in your hands and say i made

7904
04:56:45,360 --> 04:56:46,400
this

7905
04:56:46,400 --> 04:56:48,480
so i would urge everyone out there if

7906
04:56:48,480 --> 04:56:51,200
you don't have a hobby that is tangible

7907
04:56:51,200 --> 04:56:53,280
that is physical i would really

7908
04:56:53,280 --> 04:56:55,520
recommend you go find one

7909
04:56:55,520 --> 04:56:57,040
and it can be anything and you don't

7910
04:56:57,040 --> 04:56:58,638
have to be good at it

7911
04:56:58,638 --> 04:57:00,400
uh but if you have the opportunity you

7912
04:57:00,400 --> 04:57:04,000
know to garden to woodwork to paint to

7913
04:57:04,000 --> 04:57:06,480
bake like do something like that because

7914
04:57:06,480 --> 04:57:08,798
then when you feel like you can't

7915
04:57:08,798 --> 04:57:10,718
actually accomplish anything

7916
04:57:10,718 --> 04:57:12,320
you can just make something and look at

7917
04:57:12,320 --> 04:57:14,560
it and go i made that i made a

7918
04:57:14,560 --> 04:57:16,000
difference in the world

7919
04:57:16,000 --> 04:57:18,480
uh so that's kind of the end of my

7920
04:57:18,480 --> 04:57:21,040
preachy section uh i will thank you all

7921
04:57:21,040 --> 04:57:23,040
for listening to my talk i know it's not

7922
04:57:23,040 --> 04:57:25,840
strictly cyber security related um but i

7923
04:57:25,840 --> 04:57:27,200
really enjoyed the opportunity to kind

7924
04:57:27,200 --> 04:57:28,878
of ramble on about

7925
04:57:28,878 --> 04:57:30,560
what i've learned in knitting over the

7926
04:57:30,560 --> 04:57:32,958
last six months and i hope

7927
04:57:32,958 --> 04:57:34,798
either some of you will reach out to me

7928
04:57:34,798 --> 04:57:36,480
because you're looking for a job or some

7929
04:57:36,480 --> 04:57:37,840
of you will pick up hobbies that you

7930
04:57:37,840 --> 04:57:41,040
didn't before and find some joy in those

7931
04:57:41,040 --> 04:57:45,240
things outside of computer screens

7932
04:57:46,080 --> 04:57:48,400
the preach uh i've been drinking this as

7933
04:57:48,400 --> 04:57:51,920
well recently um i have so many hobbies

7934
04:57:51,920 --> 04:57:53,840
and i think it's what keeps me in cyber

7935
04:57:53,840 --> 04:57:56,400
security to be honest because without it

7936
04:57:56,400 --> 04:57:58,718
i would become a vegetable stuck at my

7937
04:57:58,718 --> 04:58:02,160
desk it's super tasty if you will

7938
04:58:02,160 --> 04:58:04,560
yeah i'd be a comfy couch potato at my

7939
04:58:04,560 --> 04:58:06,718
desk all the time um

7940
04:58:06,718 --> 04:58:09,120
you know even chatting with ian and

7941
04:58:09,120 --> 04:58:11,760
lydia this morning yesterday might have

7942
04:58:11,760 --> 04:58:13,360
been this morning

7943
04:58:13,360 --> 04:58:14,480
about

7944
04:58:14,480 --> 04:58:17,360
um this fact you know the the hyper

7945
04:58:17,360 --> 04:58:18,718
focus and how

7946
04:58:18,718 --> 04:58:21,440
we're all really love getting deep into

7947
04:58:21,440 --> 04:58:23,920
our work and

7948
04:58:23,920 --> 04:58:25,360
if you don't have something to drag you

7949
04:58:25,360 --> 04:58:27,600
out then it can be really debilitating

7950
04:58:27,600 --> 04:58:30,480
to never actually switch off it's it's

7951
04:58:30,480 --> 04:58:32,638
super super hard and i love knitting as

7952
04:58:32,638 --> 04:58:34,638
well i have not knitted in a very long

7953
04:58:34,638 --> 04:58:38,080
time i do have a bag of yarn and and

7954
04:58:38,080 --> 04:58:40,958
like needles um i like to knit it at a

7955
04:58:40,958 --> 04:58:43,200
very young age something my mom taught

7956
04:58:43,200 --> 04:58:44,160
me

7957
04:58:44,160 --> 04:58:45,920
i think it would be good to get back

7958
04:58:45,920 --> 04:58:48,320
into but i just have too many hobbies

7959
04:58:48,320 --> 04:58:50,320
too many hobbies and this is another

7960
04:58:50,320 --> 04:58:51,920
good point of i know people are talking

7961
04:58:51,920 --> 04:58:54,080
about some of their hobbies

7962
04:58:54,080 --> 04:58:55,360
in um

7963
04:58:55,360 --> 04:58:56,958
in the chat does anyone else do any

7964
04:58:56,958 --> 04:58:58,480

7965
04:58:58,480 --> 04:59:01,200
knitting channel actually we should we

7966
04:59:01,200 --> 04:59:02,878

7967
04:59:02,878 --> 04:59:05,520
be like a general crafting channel

7968
04:59:05,520 --> 04:59:07,200

7970
04:59:08,798 --> 04:59:10,400
to create one in hobbies

7971
04:59:10,400 --> 04:59:12,160
straight after this so you guys can go

7972
04:59:12,160 --> 04:59:13,360
in there

7973
04:59:13,360 --> 04:59:16,240
um and it's gonna be inspirational right

7974
04:59:16,240 --> 04:59:18,080
when you see somebody else doing it and

7975
04:59:18,080 --> 04:59:20,400
you're sharing your designs and your

7976
04:59:20,400 --> 04:59:21,680
patterns

7977
04:59:21,680 --> 04:59:24,240
even like coding right like when someone

7978
04:59:24,240 --> 04:59:25,840
shares with me code and you're like wow

7979
04:59:25,840 --> 04:59:27,360
yeah that looks really cool i'll see

7980
04:59:27,360 --> 04:59:28,878
what i can do maybe i can make something

7981
04:59:28,878 --> 04:59:31,440
else as well so definitely it's um

7982
04:59:31,440 --> 04:59:32,958
you know i think

7983
04:59:32,958 --> 04:59:36,000
your talk is more infosec related than

7984
04:59:36,000 --> 04:59:36,798
me

7985
04:59:36,798 --> 04:59:38,240
showing people how to make chicken

7986
04:59:38,240 --> 04:59:40,958
tenders which were awesome by

7987
04:59:40,958 --> 04:59:43,200
the way i just ate some and they were so

7988
04:59:43,200 --> 04:59:44,240
good

7989
04:59:44,240 --> 04:59:45,360
so good

7990
04:59:45,360 --> 04:59:46,878
but my chicken tenders are good for the

7991
04:59:46,878 --> 04:59:47,920
soul

7992
04:59:47,920 --> 04:59:49,200
yeah they're not gonna keep me warm in

7993
04:59:49,200 --> 04:59:50,958
winter though so

7994
04:59:50,958 --> 04:59:52,480
you shaded it

7995
04:59:52,480 --> 04:59:53,840
i mean they couldn't put chili on them

7996
04:59:53,840 --> 04:59:56,480
they'll keep you warm yeah

7997
04:59:56,480 --> 04:59:58,480
i did sriracha

7998
04:59:58,480 --> 05:00:00,320
and like we all everyone's got different

7999
05:00:00,320 --> 05:00:02,080
hobbies i i have to bring it up because

8000
05:00:02,080 --> 05:00:04,240
i bring it up every time beck's digging

8001
05:00:04,240 --> 05:00:07,120
her hole comes up every single time as

8002
05:00:07,120 --> 05:00:09,440
as a as a hobby that she does away from

8003
05:00:09,440 --> 05:00:12,000
the computer picking locks

8004
05:00:12,000 --> 05:00:14,878
um somebody sounds like my whole that's

8005
05:00:14,878 --> 05:00:17,520
what she's quoting she did post pics of

8006
05:00:17,520 --> 05:00:18,798
her whole

8007
05:00:18,798 --> 05:00:20,958
she

8008
05:00:21,200 --> 05:00:23,440
she actually did uh say that you've got

8009
05:00:23,440 --> 05:00:26,080
the quote of the conference when you

8010
05:00:26,080 --> 05:00:28,000
said i love a

8011
05:00:28,000 --> 05:00:30,878
i love a broken rib

8012
05:00:30,878 --> 05:00:32,400
yes apparently that is the quote of the

8013
05:00:32,400 --> 05:00:34,560
conference which i i think is very true

8014
05:00:34,560 --> 05:00:37,440
i picked up on that one as well like

8015
05:00:37,440 --> 05:00:39,040
oh someone has just created the crafting

8016
05:00:39,040 --> 05:00:41,120
channel that hoodie is listening and

8017
05:00:41,120 --> 05:00:42,560
he's just created the crafting channel

8018
05:00:42,560 --> 05:00:44,000
for you so everyone who wants to do

8019
05:00:44,000 --> 05:00:46,320
crafting go into the crafting channel

8020
05:00:46,320 --> 05:00:48,160
and if anyone has any questions for

8021
05:00:48,160 --> 05:00:50,400
cairo i'm sure she is more than happy to

8022
05:00:50,400 --> 05:00:52,560
answer those questions as well and of

8023
05:00:52,560 --> 05:00:54,160
course if you're looking for a job and

8024
05:00:54,160 --> 05:00:56,080
you're is are they remote jobs as well

8025
05:00:56,080 --> 05:00:58,878
cairo are they specifically in perth

8026
05:00:58,878 --> 05:01:01,440
so the job is fully remote all octopus

8027
05:01:01,440 --> 05:01:04,240
roles are fully remote and it's open to

8028
05:01:04,240 --> 05:01:07,440
australia and new zealand um perfect so

8029
05:01:07,440 --> 05:01:09,440
australia is a bit easier time zone wise

8030
05:01:09,440 --> 05:01:11,760
because i am on the west coast um but

8031
05:01:11,760 --> 05:01:13,440
for the right candidate i'm happy for

8032
05:01:13,440 --> 05:01:15,280
new zealand to be in the mix

8033
05:01:15,280 --> 05:01:18,560
so go have a look and go apply and you

8034
05:01:18,560 --> 05:01:20,320
get to work and probably do knitting at

8035
05:01:20,320 --> 05:01:22,000
work i'm sure

8036
05:01:22,000 --> 05:01:24,560
um yeah yeah we can have social

8037
05:01:24,560 --> 05:01:26,400
catch-ups that's fine i actually learned

8038
05:01:26,400 --> 05:01:28,400
to knit on work time

8039
05:01:28,400 --> 05:01:30,958
my boss was flexible enough to allow me

8040
05:01:30,958 --> 05:01:32,958
two hours every friday for four weeks

8041
05:01:32,958 --> 05:01:34,798
away from my computer to learn to knit

8042
05:01:34,798 --> 05:01:35,520
so

8043
05:01:35,520 --> 05:01:36,638
i guess that probably gives you a bit of

8044
05:01:36,638 --> 05:01:39,360
an insight into how flexible we are in

8045
05:01:39,360 --> 05:01:41,600
terms of work-life balance and what you

8046
05:01:41,600 --> 05:01:43,520
want to do so those kinds of things are

8047
05:01:43,520 --> 05:01:46,000
always uh possible yeah it's super

8048
05:01:46,000 --> 05:01:47,040
important

8049
05:01:47,040 --> 05:01:49,120
super important that's great thank you

8050
05:01:49,120 --> 05:01:50,638
very much cairo that was a great talk

8051
05:01:50,638 --> 05:01:52,718
thank you it was very relevant to

8052
05:01:52,718 --> 05:01:54,878
everyone in the cyber community as well

8053
05:01:54,878 --> 05:01:58,520
yeah awesome

8054
05:01:58,560 --> 05:02:00,320
so i think our next speaker is ready to

8055
05:02:00,320 --> 05:02:03,040
go and um then we have a break after

8056
05:02:03,040 --> 05:02:05,040
this but before that i will bring on

8057
05:02:05,040 --> 05:02:06,878
darth

8058
05:02:06,878 --> 05:02:10,000
how are you today darf

8059
05:02:13,040 --> 05:02:14,878
yeah good thanks are you been enjoying

8060
05:02:14,878 --> 05:02:16,638
the conference so far

8061
05:02:16,638 --> 05:02:17,840
yeah i have this actually my first

8062
05:02:17,840 --> 05:02:20,878
coffee con so um

8063
05:02:22,240 --> 05:02:24,718
that's fantastic um i have to ask

8064
05:02:24,718 --> 05:02:25,600
everyone i don't know if you've been

8065
05:02:25,600 --> 05:02:27,040
following the debate but the chicken

8066
05:02:27,040 --> 05:02:28,878
tandies versus the chicken nuggies do

8067
05:02:28,878 --> 05:02:31,600
you have an opinion on that

8068
05:02:31,600 --> 05:02:33,440
so i think the biggest consideration the

8069
05:02:33,440 --> 05:02:34,878
elephant in the room if you like that

8070
05:02:34,878 --> 05:02:37,200
hasn't been brought up yet is quality

8071
05:02:37,200 --> 05:02:39,360
and not all nugs are credited equally

8072
05:02:39,360 --> 05:02:41,680
not all tenderly created equally and the

8073
05:02:41,680 --> 05:02:43,520
best nug in the world is clearly better

8074
05:02:43,520 --> 05:02:46,240
than the worst hendy and vice versa so

8075
05:02:46,240 --> 05:02:48,240
yeah i'm going to agree with this

8076
05:02:48,240 --> 05:02:50,000
i think i think the reason i prefer

8077
05:02:50,000 --> 05:02:52,320
attendees is generally because the

8078
05:02:52,320 --> 05:02:53,840
quality of

8079
05:02:53,840 --> 05:02:56,958
is like actual chicken over

8080
05:02:56,958 --> 05:02:58,638
some of the crappy nuggets that you can

8081
05:02:58,638 --> 05:03:00,718
get that you like i'm not even sure this

8082
05:03:00,718 --> 05:03:03,120
is made of soy product um

8083
05:03:03,120 --> 05:03:04,718
that's a good point that's a good point

8084
05:03:04,718 --> 05:03:08,958
because a good nugget is pretty good

8085
05:03:08,958 --> 05:03:11,760
yeah i like it yep and a bad 10 years

8086
05:03:11,760 --> 05:03:12,718
pretty bad

8087
05:03:12,718 --> 05:03:14,798
yeah yeah yeah yeah true true true that

8088
05:03:14,798 --> 05:03:17,040
is a great way of putting it

8089
05:03:17,040 --> 05:03:18,798
um so darth is based in brisbane

8090
05:03:18,798 --> 05:03:20,480
australia and is the regional f5

8091
05:03:20,480 --> 05:03:22,080
security practice lead where he's

8092
05:03:22,080 --> 05:03:23,520
responsible for the f5 security

8093
05:03:23,520 --> 05:03:25,600
portfolio um he's provided unique

8094
05:03:25,600 --> 05:03:27,280
insights on cyber security compliance

8095
05:03:27,280 --> 05:03:29,520
governance solution architecture a whole

8096
05:03:29,520 --> 05:03:31,520
bunch of different things from customer

8097
05:03:31,520 --> 05:03:33,200
partner security service provider and

8098
05:03:33,200 --> 05:03:34,638
vendor perspectives and holds a

8099
05:03:34,638 --> 05:03:36,798
bachelor's degree in science majoring in

8100
05:03:36,798 --> 05:03:38,560
computer science you've probably seen

8101
05:03:38,560 --> 05:03:39,760
him in a whole bunch of different cyber

8102
05:03:39,760 --> 05:03:41,440
security communities as well i know i've

8103
05:03:41,440 --> 05:03:43,760
seen him in a few different places and

8104
05:03:43,760 --> 05:03:45,280
today

8105
05:03:45,280 --> 05:03:46,718
he's going to be talking about supply

8106
05:03:46,718 --> 05:03:49,040
chain threats in your website so it's

8107
05:03:49,040 --> 05:03:52,000
off feel free to take it away

8108
05:03:52,000 --> 05:03:54,000
thank you so much and thanks so much for

8109
05:03:54,000 --> 05:03:56,480
accepting my con talk uh this is the the

8110
05:03:56,480 --> 05:03:59,360
first time i'll be doing this talk so

8111
05:03:59,360 --> 05:04:01,120
happy to get everyone's feedback and let

8112
05:04:01,120 --> 05:04:03,440
me know what you think um it's a it's an

8113
05:04:03,440 --> 05:04:05,920
emerging area of interest for me

8114
05:04:05,920 --> 05:04:07,760
uh full disclosure though i must say

8115
05:04:07,760 --> 05:04:10,080
that in the making of this contour uh

8116
05:04:10,080 --> 05:04:13,120
not a single nug or tendy was harmed

8117
05:04:13,120 --> 05:04:15,760
uh didn't get an opportunity to enjoy

8118
05:04:15,760 --> 05:04:20,000
any cool snacks a little bit about me

8119
05:04:20,000 --> 05:04:22,240
so i live with three cats they're not

8120
05:04:22,240 --> 05:04:24,080
pictured here unfortunately uh i didn't

8121
05:04:24,080 --> 05:04:26,480
get a chance to take a snap of them uh i

8122
05:04:26,480 --> 05:04:28,320
also live with three dogs and three kids

8123
05:04:28,320 --> 05:04:29,840
so three of everything

8124
05:04:29,840 --> 05:04:31,200
which tend to mean that we're in a

8125
05:04:31,200 --> 05:04:34,160
pretty constant state of madness i enjoy

8126
05:04:34,160 --> 05:04:36,080
playing inline hockey it's a pretty mad

8127
05:04:36,080 --> 05:04:39,040
sport just a level below ice hockey uh

8128
05:04:39,040 --> 05:04:40,560
which i enjoy watching particularly when

8129
05:04:40,560 --> 05:04:42,560
my son is playing so he's that's him

8130
05:04:42,560 --> 05:04:44,638
down in the bottom left there

8131
05:04:44,638 --> 05:04:47,920
and then finally i am pretty confident

8132
05:04:47,920 --> 05:04:49,680
that my cream kelpie is actually a

8133
05:04:49,680 --> 05:04:52,000
kelpie but he may well be a dingo i'm

8134
05:04:52,000 --> 05:04:55,360
not 100 sure uh and he may or may not

8135
05:04:55,360 --> 05:04:57,200
cameo during this talk we'll see how we

8136
05:04:57,200 --> 05:05:00,200
go

8137
05:05:00,320 --> 05:05:02,718
so my talk today summarizes a bunch of

8138
05:05:02,718 --> 05:05:05,280
research and investigations including

8139
05:05:05,280 --> 05:05:07,440
security incident response activities

8140
05:05:07,440 --> 05:05:10,480
from various units inside of f5 as well

8141
05:05:10,480 --> 05:05:12,400
as some external sources that i have

8142
05:05:12,400 --> 05:05:13,840
leveraged

8143
05:05:13,840 --> 05:05:15,680
as i said it's a topic that i find

8144
05:05:15,680 --> 05:05:17,600
interesting

8145
05:05:17,600 --> 05:05:19,760
and it's an area that is increasingly of

8146
05:05:19,760 --> 05:05:22,080
concern as adversaries continue to

8147
05:05:22,080 --> 05:05:24,080
target our ever-expanding attack

8148
05:05:24,080 --> 05:05:25,520
services

8149
05:05:25,520 --> 05:05:27,920
i'm going to quickly go through an

8150
05:05:27,920 --> 05:05:30,560
overview of the problem space

8151
05:05:30,560 --> 05:05:31,520
and

8152
05:05:31,520 --> 05:05:33,840
then i will go through some of the

8153
05:05:33,840 --> 05:05:35,840
techniques that we can potentially use

8154
05:05:35,840 --> 05:05:38,240
to reduce the impact of some of these

8155
05:05:38,240 --> 05:05:41,240
problems

8156
05:05:42,560 --> 05:05:44,080
so today i'm mostly talking about these

8157
05:05:44,080 --> 05:05:46,320
aspects up here uh when we talk about

8158
05:05:46,320 --> 05:05:48,958
mage cart it's not a single uh threat

8159
05:05:48,958 --> 05:05:50,000
group it

8160
05:05:50,000 --> 05:05:51,920
refers to several groups of threat

8161
05:05:51,920 --> 05:05:54,160
actors uh they typically focus on

8162
05:05:54,160 --> 05:05:56,718
e-skimming and form jacking activities

8163
05:05:56,718 --> 05:06:00,240
targeted against the magento cms

8164
05:06:00,240 --> 05:06:02,400
i'll also be talking about

8165
05:06:02,400 --> 05:06:04,480
supply chain in two sort of broad

8166
05:06:04,480 --> 05:06:06,638
categories first party delivered and

8167
05:06:06,638 --> 05:06:08,958
then third party referenced

8168
05:06:08,958 --> 05:06:10,480
i'm not really going to talk about

8169
05:06:10,480 --> 05:06:13,040
crypto jacking i i much prefer to focus

8170
05:06:13,040 --> 05:06:14,638
on things like

8171
05:06:14,638 --> 05:06:17,040
the loss of pii and the loss of credit

8172
05:06:17,040 --> 05:06:18,560
card information and other sensitive

8173
05:06:18,560 --> 05:06:19,520
data

8174
05:06:19,520 --> 05:06:22,080
as opposed to um private

8175
05:06:22,080 --> 05:06:24,400
cyber criminals stealing cpu cycles to

8176
05:06:24,400 --> 05:06:27,360
uh to to mine some coins um it's still a

8177
05:06:27,360 --> 05:06:28,718
problem though and still worth

8178
05:06:28,718 --> 05:06:31,120
acknowledging that it's a problem in

8179
05:06:31,120 --> 05:06:34,480
this attack class space

8180
05:06:34,638 --> 05:06:37,120
so we've seen the impacts of these

8181
05:06:37,120 --> 05:06:38,560
breaches and there's been some pretty

8182
05:06:38,560 --> 05:06:40,160
significant ones

8183
05:06:40,160 --> 05:06:42,480
i'm going to

8184
05:06:42,480 --> 05:06:44,718
pick on british airways a couple of

8185
05:06:44,718 --> 05:06:46,718
times in this talk but they're certainly

8186
05:06:46,718 --> 05:06:48,400
not unique in this space

8187
05:06:48,400 --> 05:06:50,080
the reason i'm going to mention them

8188
05:06:50,080 --> 05:06:52,400
though is because they

8189
05:06:52,400 --> 05:06:54,400
are one of the largest in this space in

8190
05:06:54,400 --> 05:06:56,160
terms of the amount of records that were

8191
05:06:56,160 --> 05:06:57,200
lost so

8192
05:06:57,200 --> 05:07:00,638
they had the pii of almost 430

8193
05:07:00,638 --> 05:07:02,638
000 customers and staff

8194
05:07:02,638 --> 05:07:04,560
was lost in this breach

8195
05:07:04,560 --> 05:07:08,878
and about 244 000 credit cards now those

8196
05:07:08,878 --> 05:07:10,718
credit card details actually included

8197
05:07:10,718 --> 05:07:13,440
the ccvs as well so they were completely

8198
05:07:13,440 --> 05:07:15,440
useful right out the gate

8199
05:07:15,440 --> 05:07:17,680
so it's a significant breach

8200
05:07:17,680 --> 05:07:19,600
risk iq is one of the third parties i

8201
05:07:19,600 --> 05:07:21,120
used in terms of putting this talk

8202
05:07:21,120 --> 05:07:22,798
together um they

8203
05:07:22,798 --> 05:07:24,718
did a good blog post i've linked to it

8204
05:07:24,718 --> 05:07:26,638
at the bottom there it's a good write-up

8205
05:07:26,638 --> 05:07:29,200
of the british airways attack and how

8206
05:07:29,200 --> 05:07:31,320
the attackers got in and what they

8207
05:07:31,320 --> 05:07:32,840
exfiltrated

8208
05:07:32,840 --> 05:07:35,920
um they also noted that at the time they

8209
05:07:35,920 --> 05:07:38,160
were monitoring mage cart activity and

8210
05:07:38,160 --> 05:07:40,958
they had a scanner that was scanning the

8211
05:07:40,958 --> 05:07:43,680
webs for uh mage cart skimmer code

8212
05:07:43,680 --> 05:07:45,840
detections and those detections were

8213
05:07:45,840 --> 05:07:48,080
were going off at least hourly so that

8214
05:07:48,080 --> 05:07:49,920
was how rampant the activity was at the

8215
05:07:49,920 --> 05:07:52,160
time

8216
05:07:53,120 --> 05:07:55,200
and so why these attacks so successful

8217
05:07:55,200 --> 05:07:57,040
well a big part of it is that web apps

8218
05:07:57,040 --> 05:08:00,160
today look nothing like the web apps of

8219
05:08:00,160 --> 05:08:02,798
10 years ago or even 25 years ago um

8220
05:08:02,798 --> 05:08:05,840
they are much more complex than previous

8221
05:08:05,840 --> 05:08:07,680
um as further

8222
05:08:07,680 --> 05:08:09,120
similar to the great quote from the

8223
05:08:09,120 --> 05:08:12,080
spidey movie um you know with with great

8224
05:08:12,080 --> 05:08:14,638
functionality comes great complexity

8225
05:08:14,638 --> 05:08:16,638
so broadly speaking there are two main

8226
05:08:16,638 --> 05:08:18,878
areas to look at we have the first party

8227
05:08:18,878 --> 05:08:20,000
code

8228
05:08:20,000 --> 05:08:22,080
that we actually deliver ourselves and

8229
05:08:22,080 --> 05:08:24,080
then we have third party code that is

8230
05:08:24,080 --> 05:08:26,480
referenced from our main web app

8231
05:08:26,480 --> 05:08:29,200
so with first party delivered code this

8232
05:08:29,200 --> 05:08:30,638
still actually comprises lots of

8233
05:08:30,638 --> 05:08:33,680
third-party uh things in the supply

8234
05:08:33,680 --> 05:08:36,560
chain that can can be abused so

8235
05:08:36,560 --> 05:08:38,160
third-party libraries

8236
05:08:38,160 --> 05:08:39,920
that are then used to make up your web

8237
05:08:39,920 --> 05:08:41,920
app and then those libraries can have

8238
05:08:41,920 --> 05:08:43,920
their own third-party dependencies as

8239
05:08:43,920 --> 05:08:46,080
well so mapping out your own

8240
05:08:46,080 --> 05:08:47,760
dependencies and then the dependencies

8241
05:08:47,760 --> 05:08:49,920
of those dependencies can be

8242
05:08:49,920 --> 05:08:51,600
quite a spider web

8243
05:08:51,600 --> 05:08:53,600
and a challenge to to get your hands

8244
05:08:53,600 --> 05:08:55,520
around

8245
05:08:55,520 --> 05:08:56,718
and then on the other side of it there

8246
05:08:56,718 --> 05:08:57,840
are just certain things that we don't

8247
05:08:57,840 --> 05:08:59,920
want to do in our own web apps ourselves

8248
05:08:59,920 --> 05:09:01,840
that we don't want to build and maintain

8249
05:09:01,840 --> 05:09:03,760
ourselves but we want the functionality

8250
05:09:03,760 --> 05:09:06,400
right so we want it to be then delivered

8251
05:09:06,400 --> 05:09:08,560
from external sources so we have things

8252
05:09:08,560 --> 05:09:11,280
like trackers analytics advertising

8253
05:09:11,280 --> 05:09:13,120
those sorts of things so they're all

8254
05:09:13,120 --> 05:09:15,520
third-party delivered as a function of a

8255
05:09:15,520 --> 05:09:17,760
user interacting with your primary

8256
05:09:17,760 --> 05:09:20,239
website

8257
05:09:20,798 --> 05:09:22,638
so these are just some of the many many

8258
05:09:22,638 --> 05:09:25,280
many many things that are commonly third

8259
05:09:25,280 --> 05:09:27,520
party delivered

8260
05:09:27,520 --> 05:09:29,200
and when i talk later in the how to

8261
05:09:29,200 --> 05:09:31,600
solve some of these problems section

8262
05:09:31,600 --> 05:09:33,200
one of the things to note is that if you

8263
05:09:33,200 --> 05:09:35,360
have good controls in place for the

8264
05:09:35,360 --> 05:09:36,798
first party stuff

8265
05:09:36,798 --> 05:09:38,718
then third party delivered can be a

8266
05:09:38,718 --> 05:09:41,120
juicy softer target for attackers to go

8267
05:09:41,120 --> 05:09:43,200
after

8268
05:09:43,200 --> 05:09:45,520
but attackers do go after first party

8269
05:09:45,520 --> 05:09:47,040
delivered as well

8270
05:09:47,040 --> 05:09:48,718
and they do this in a variety of

8271
05:09:48,718 --> 05:09:51,840
different ways some examples up here so

8272
05:09:51,840 --> 05:09:54,480
for one you know they can go directly at

8273
05:09:54,480 --> 05:09:56,878
your infrastructure they can break into

8274
05:09:56,878 --> 05:09:59,360
your website or the web framework that's

8275
05:09:59,360 --> 05:10:01,280
used to deliver that web app

8276
05:10:01,280 --> 05:10:03,040
and they can go in and directly modify

8277
05:10:03,040 --> 05:10:04,320
the code

8278
05:10:04,320 --> 05:10:06,400
they can use such access and other kinds

8279
05:10:06,400 --> 05:10:08,080
of reconnaissance techniques to

8280
05:10:08,080 --> 05:10:10,400
understand the dependencies and then go

8281
05:10:10,400 --> 05:10:13,440
after the supply chain of libraries

8282
05:10:13,440 --> 05:10:16,480
we see malicious code injected into

8283
05:10:16,480 --> 05:10:19,440
first party scripts by rogue insiders

8284
05:10:19,440 --> 05:10:21,600
and we're seeing that more and more

8285
05:10:21,600 --> 05:10:23,120
examples of this happening across the

8286
05:10:23,120 --> 05:10:25,280
entire cyber security space

8287
05:10:25,280 --> 05:10:26,958
but for these types of attack classes as

8288
05:10:26,958 --> 05:10:30,320
well whereby insiders are being coerced

8289
05:10:30,320 --> 05:10:32,638
typically financially and bribed

8290
05:10:32,638 --> 05:10:34,958
to use their insider access to either

8291
05:10:34,958 --> 05:10:37,360
grant external access or make config

8292
05:10:37,360 --> 05:10:39,840
changes or even

8293
05:10:39,840 --> 05:10:42,480
write or make changes to code that then

8294
05:10:42,480 --> 05:10:44,080
ends up being able to be exploited

8295
05:10:44,080 --> 05:10:46,878
remotely down the track

8296
05:10:46,878 --> 05:10:49,120
we also see examples of attackers buying

8297
05:10:49,120 --> 05:10:51,520
out projects and plugins

8298
05:10:51,520 --> 05:10:54,320
and we also see them if that doesn't

8299
05:10:54,320 --> 05:10:55,200
work

8300
05:10:55,200 --> 05:10:58,000
using social engineering techniques to

8301
05:10:58,000 --> 05:10:59,760
say hey you've got this whole project

8302
05:10:59,760 --> 05:11:01,120
you don't have the time to maintain it

8303
05:11:01,120 --> 05:11:03,280
anymore how about we take it over we'll

8304
05:11:03,280 --> 05:11:04,798
be good guys and we'll maintain it for

8305
05:11:04,798 --> 05:11:06,718
you and then actually just use that as a

8306
05:11:06,718 --> 05:11:08,798
vehicle for deploying uh malicious

8307
05:11:08,798 --> 05:11:11,280
payloads

8308
05:11:11,760 --> 05:11:13,600
more and more recently we are seeing

8309
05:11:13,600 --> 05:11:16,638
politically motivated stuff occurring um

8310
05:11:16,638 --> 05:11:17,840
or maybe it's becoming more to

8311
05:11:17,840 --> 05:11:19,360
prevalence it's probably the better way

8312
05:11:19,360 --> 05:11:21,840
to to say um so there was a really good

8313
05:11:21,840 --> 05:11:22,718
recent

8314
05:11:22,718 --> 05:11:25,520
example with the peace not war npm

8315
05:11:25,520 --> 05:11:27,920
package um that when i was created by

8316
05:11:27,920 --> 05:11:29,920
itself it received very little attention

8317
05:11:29,920 --> 05:11:31,520
very few downloads

8318
05:11:31,520 --> 05:11:33,040
but then it was actually added as a

8319
05:11:33,040 --> 05:11:36,160
dependency to the node ipc package

8320
05:11:36,160 --> 05:11:37,440
and that's actually quite a popular

8321
05:11:37,440 --> 05:11:40,080
package it's a popular um it's

8322
05:11:40,080 --> 05:11:41,840
a dependency to a lot of other popular

8323
05:11:41,840 --> 05:11:43,280
packages as well

8324
05:11:43,280 --> 05:11:46,400
so i've included one here view.js

8325
05:11:46,400 --> 05:11:47,440
and so

8326
05:11:47,440 --> 05:11:49,200
when it got added as a dependency there

8327
05:11:49,200 --> 05:11:51,920
it rapidly increased the distribution of

8328
05:11:51,920 --> 05:11:53,680
that package and it ended up being

8329
05:11:53,680 --> 05:11:56,160
downloaded millions of times a week

8330
05:11:56,160 --> 05:11:57,360
uh patton

8331
05:11:57,360 --> 05:11:58,718
adam talked about it on one of the

8332
05:11:58,718 --> 05:12:00,400
business episodes recently i've got the

8333
05:12:00,400 --> 05:12:02,240
link down the bottom there

8334
05:12:02,240 --> 05:12:03,920
but i thought this quote was was was

8335
05:12:03,920 --> 05:12:05,680
pretty nice from adam um you know the

8336
05:12:05,680 --> 05:12:07,520
fact that your supply chain is now made

8337
05:12:07,520 --> 05:12:10,080
up of 10 000 different nerds any one of

8338
05:12:10,080 --> 05:12:12,878
whom may get a b in their bonnet at any

8339
05:12:12,878 --> 05:12:15,360
time and make all of your infrastructure

8340
05:12:15,360 --> 05:12:17,520
do something different um so that's

8341
05:12:17,520 --> 05:12:20,000
that's quite a scary thought

8342
05:12:20,000 --> 05:12:22,320
but it's uh it is true right so indeed

8343
05:12:22,320 --> 05:12:24,878
who do we trust and do we know who we're

8344
05:12:24,878 --> 05:12:26,080
trusting

8345
05:12:26,080 --> 05:12:29,120
so every time we uh take a single

8346
05:12:29,120 --> 05:12:31,200
third-party library into our environment

8347
05:12:31,200 --> 05:12:33,120
where we actually end up trusting a lot

8348
05:12:33,120 --> 05:12:36,320
of people in the entire supply chain so

8349
05:12:36,320 --> 05:12:38,160
who are the contributors who are doing

8350
05:12:38,160 --> 05:12:40,080
the code commits who are the maintainers

8351
05:12:40,080 --> 05:12:42,718
of these projects are they trustworthy

8352
05:12:42,718 --> 05:12:44,878
and even if they're trustworthy now are

8353
05:12:44,878 --> 05:12:46,560
they trustworthy forever

8354
05:12:46,560 --> 05:12:48,560
and as i said before

8355
05:12:48,560 --> 05:12:50,480
they might the original maintainers

8356
05:12:50,480 --> 05:12:52,480
might not even always be there right it

8357
05:12:52,480 --> 05:12:54,080
might end up being

8358
05:12:54,080 --> 05:12:56,638
different actors in the future

8359
05:12:56,638 --> 05:12:58,080
so using third parties has a ton of

8360
05:12:58,080 --> 05:12:59,120
value right and there's a very good

8361
05:12:59,120 --> 05:13:00,638
reason we do it so that we're not

8362
05:13:00,638 --> 05:13:02,400
reinventing the wheel again and again

8363
05:13:02,400 --> 05:13:05,360
and again um but we then also need to

8364
05:13:05,360 --> 05:13:07,200
ensure that when we are using these

8365
05:13:07,200 --> 05:13:08,798
third-party libraries that we're

8366
05:13:08,798 --> 05:13:11,120
constantly updating our threat models

8367
05:13:11,120 --> 05:13:12,240
based on

8368
05:13:12,240 --> 05:13:14,240
the third parties that are in use what

8369
05:13:14,240 --> 05:13:15,920
are the age of the projects what are the

8370
05:13:15,920 --> 05:13:18,240
current owners are they being maintained

8371
05:13:18,240 --> 05:13:20,320
and that in itself is a non-trivial

8372
05:13:20,320 --> 05:13:23,120
exercise but then you exacerbate it by

8373
05:13:23,120 --> 05:13:25,360
the overwhelming scale of the amount of

8374
05:13:25,360 --> 05:13:26,560
third-party stuff that we've got

8375
05:13:26,560 --> 05:13:28,240
included and then the dependencies and

8376
05:13:28,240 --> 05:13:29,840
dependencies

8377
05:13:29,840 --> 05:13:31,040
and so even if we have a good

8378
05:13:31,040 --> 05:13:32,400
understanding of our own third-party

8379
05:13:32,400 --> 05:13:34,560
dependencies it isn't always possible to

8380
05:13:34,560 --> 05:13:36,840
get that understanding of

8381
05:13:36,840 --> 05:13:39,040
sub-dependencies uh

8382
05:13:39,040 --> 05:13:41,840
or and this is a big one that people

8383
05:13:41,840 --> 05:13:43,120
from my experience anyway tend not to

8384
05:13:43,120 --> 05:13:44,958
think about is what are the dependencies

8385
05:13:44,958 --> 05:13:47,200
of the proprietary components that are

8386
05:13:47,200 --> 05:13:49,040
in our stacks

8387
05:13:49,040 --> 05:13:50,638
and then each one of these represents a

8388
05:13:50,638 --> 05:13:52,400
blind spot to us as defenders

8389
05:13:52,400 --> 05:13:54,400
and also an attack surface to

8390
05:13:54,400 --> 05:13:57,120
adversaries

8391
05:13:57,360 --> 05:14:00,000
i've got a simple example here of a

8392
05:14:00,000 --> 05:14:02,000
simple but effective example of a mage

8393
05:14:02,000 --> 05:14:03,600
car attack

8394
05:14:03,600 --> 05:14:05,360
so this is obfuscated code on the right

8395
05:14:05,360 --> 05:14:07,360
and that was what was actually injected

8396
05:14:07,360 --> 05:14:11,520
into the http supply chain of newegg.com

8397
05:14:11,520 --> 05:14:13,520
we see the actual unobfuscated code down

8398
05:14:13,520 --> 05:14:14,480
the bottom

8399
05:14:14,480 --> 05:14:16,000
and you can see there that the way these

8400
05:14:16,000 --> 05:14:18,798
style of attacks work is that they

8401
05:14:18,798 --> 05:14:20,638
just sit there silently and they they

8402
05:14:20,638 --> 05:14:22,958
take data out as the user's inputting it

8403
05:14:22,958 --> 05:14:25,600
so they are constantly lose looking for

8404
05:14:25,600 --> 05:14:27,680
actual user events like mouse clicks and

8405
05:14:27,680 --> 05:14:30,080
key presses and they hoover up all that

8406
05:14:30,080 --> 05:14:31,760
that sensitive data and just shoot it

8407
05:14:31,760 --> 05:14:34,480
off to a drop zone

8408
05:14:34,480 --> 05:14:37,040
oh sorry one thing to add on that is in

8409
05:14:37,040 --> 05:14:40,000
this particular example they crafted a

8410
05:14:40,000 --> 05:14:42,480
url that looked kind of legit looked

8411
05:14:42,480 --> 05:14:44,320
pretty close to neweggs.com they used

8412
05:14:44,320 --> 05:14:46,000
uxstats.com

8413
05:14:46,000 --> 05:14:47,280
and that domain was covered by a

8414
05:14:47,280 --> 05:14:49,840
perfectly legitimate tls certificate all

8415
05:14:49,840 --> 05:14:50,878
right so

8416
05:14:50,878 --> 05:14:52,080
they're trying to be stealthy what

8417
05:14:52,080 --> 05:14:54,638
they're doing

8418
05:14:54,638 --> 05:14:57,120
uh and so what problems do these classes

8419
05:14:57,120 --> 05:14:58,878
of attack create

8420
05:14:58,878 --> 05:15:01,120
well the first one and this is a massive

8421
05:15:01,120 --> 05:15:03,280
challenge from my point of view is the

8422
05:15:03,280 --> 05:15:04,718
visibility challenge

8423
05:15:04,718 --> 05:15:06,638
so there are lots of tools out there

8424
05:15:06,638 --> 05:15:08,240
that look at lots of various different

8425
05:15:08,240 --> 05:15:10,878
parts of the supply chain and delivery

8426
05:15:10,878 --> 05:15:13,440
of the web app but ultimately it's the

8427
05:15:13,440 --> 05:15:15,680
client side that is the source of truth

8428
05:15:15,680 --> 05:15:17,120
i mean because that's where the

8429
05:15:17,120 --> 05:15:18,480
different components are being pulled

8430
05:15:18,480 --> 05:15:20,480
down to so what actually ends up on that

8431
05:15:20,480 --> 05:15:22,480
endpoint and then how it's executing and

8432
05:15:22,480 --> 05:15:24,080
what other things are on that endpoint

8433
05:15:24,080 --> 05:15:25,840
and interacting with that web app as

8434
05:15:25,840 --> 05:15:27,440
it's executing

8435
05:15:27,440 --> 05:15:29,120
that is the single source of truth and

8436
05:15:29,120 --> 05:15:30,878
that's where we need to have visibility

8437
05:15:30,878 --> 05:15:34,638
and insights and controls

8438
05:15:34,638 --> 05:15:35,840
but these are uncontrolled endpoints

8439
05:15:35,840 --> 05:15:37,360
right these are great on watch they're

8440
05:15:37,360 --> 05:15:39,120
sitting out on the internet it's not

8441
05:15:39,120 --> 05:15:41,760
like they come under our enterprise

8442
05:15:41,760 --> 05:15:43,600
controls and we can't pop an agent down

8443
05:15:43,600 --> 05:15:44,560
on them

8444
05:15:44,560 --> 05:15:46,240
and so if you don't have client-side

8445
05:15:46,240 --> 05:15:48,560
visibility then this makes it harder to

8446
05:15:48,560 --> 05:15:49,600
detect

8447
05:15:49,600 --> 05:15:52,320
and therefore takes longer to respond

8448
05:15:52,320 --> 05:15:54,480
to the incident

8449
05:15:54,480 --> 05:15:56,878
so british airways is again a good

8450
05:15:56,878 --> 05:15:59,440
example of how the impacts of these

8451
05:15:59,440 --> 05:16:02,000
attacks can be huge so in terms of the

8452
05:16:02,000 --> 05:16:04,160
pii that's lost initially of course but

8453
05:16:04,160 --> 05:16:05,920
then there's the the downstream fraud

8454
05:16:05,920 --> 05:16:08,000
activities that occur after breaches

8455
05:16:08,000 --> 05:16:10,160
like these and they can be quite a long

8456
05:16:10,160 --> 05:16:13,120
tail as well of activity

8457
05:16:13,120 --> 05:16:14,798
there are additionally hefty fines that

8458
05:16:14,798 --> 05:16:17,040
come from regulators the british airways

8459
05:16:17,040 --> 05:16:19,760
fine was initially reported at 183

8460
05:16:19,760 --> 05:16:22,718
million euro so quite a sum right

8461
05:16:22,718 --> 05:16:25,040
but i did see later less amplified by

8462
05:16:25,040 --> 05:16:26,320
the press reporting because the number

8463
05:16:26,320 --> 05:16:28,160
was nowhere near as big um that after

8464
05:16:28,160 --> 05:16:30,798
british airways did an appeal that they

8465
05:16:30,798 --> 05:16:33,200
dropped it to 20 million euro so

8466
05:16:33,200 --> 05:16:34,560
significant amount of money for us but

8467
05:16:34,560 --> 05:16:35,920
for british airlines it was probably a

8468
05:16:35,920 --> 05:16:37,920
bit of a slap on the wrist

8469
05:16:37,920 --> 05:16:39,600
people do also talk about reputational

8470
05:16:39,600 --> 05:16:42,480
damage here as well but in my experience

8471
05:16:42,480 --> 05:16:45,120
that tends to be a transient impact at

8472
05:16:45,120 --> 05:16:47,440
worst and more often than not it's it's

8473
05:16:47,440 --> 05:16:49,680
a bit of a nothing burger really i think

8474
05:16:49,680 --> 05:16:51,680
a lot of people are mostly numb to

8475
05:16:51,680 --> 05:16:54,080
breach after breach after breach and

8476
05:16:54,080 --> 05:16:56,718
probably just assume that their pii is

8477
05:16:56,718 --> 05:16:58,400
in the hands of criminals if they have

8478
05:16:58,400 --> 05:17:01,200
any awareness at all

8479
05:17:01,200 --> 05:17:03,440
so finally i just wanted to call out

8480
05:17:03,440 --> 05:17:05,040
that this is now

8481
05:17:05,040 --> 05:17:06,480
appearing higher and higher on

8482
05:17:06,480 --> 05:17:09,120
enterprise lists of priorities uh it's

8483
05:17:09,120 --> 05:17:11,840
on the appsec hype cycle

8484
05:17:11,840 --> 05:17:14,958
it's called out there as a web app

8485
05:17:14,958 --> 05:17:17,200
client-side protection i've also seen it

8486
05:17:17,200 --> 05:17:18,080
called

8487
05:17:18,080 --> 05:17:20,480
client-side web application firewall

8488
05:17:20,480 --> 05:17:22,560
i don't prefer that ladder term i get

8489
05:17:22,560 --> 05:17:24,878
why they use it but i'm not a fan of it

8490
05:17:24,878 --> 05:17:26,320
um so this is saying that we're going to

8491
05:17:26,320 --> 05:17:28,560
see increasing on enterprises priority

8492
05:17:28,560 --> 05:17:30,718
lists as more and more of these types of

8493
05:17:30,718 --> 05:17:33,200
attacks occur and as enterprises realize

8494
05:17:33,200 --> 05:17:35,520
that their attack surface is

8495
05:17:35,520 --> 05:17:37,200
extremely large and largely not being

8496
05:17:37,200 --> 05:17:40,320
looked at appropriately

8497
05:17:40,718 --> 05:17:42,638
so that was a quick overview of what the

8498
05:17:42,638 --> 05:17:45,040
problems are so now i'll go into some

8499
05:17:45,040 --> 05:17:48,000
strategies for reducing the problem

8500
05:17:48,000 --> 05:17:50,000
i originally had solve the problem in

8501
05:17:50,000 --> 05:17:52,160
here and then i changed it to to reduce

8502
05:17:52,160 --> 05:17:53,120
because um

8503
05:17:53,120 --> 05:17:54,400
i don't have any silver bullets i don't

8504
05:17:54,400 --> 05:17:56,400
know of anyone that does um so you know

8505
05:17:56,400 --> 05:17:58,320
i can't handle heart say that the things

8506
05:17:58,320 --> 05:18:00,080
that i'm about to talk about would solve

8507
05:18:00,080 --> 05:18:03,040
this entirely uh but hopefully at least

8508
05:18:03,040 --> 05:18:06,000
implementing some of these controls will

8509
05:18:06,000 --> 05:18:08,080
change the attacker economics such that

8510
05:18:08,080 --> 05:18:09,920
they might be motivated to move on to a

8511
05:18:09,920 --> 05:18:12,798
softer target or you know ideally maybe

8512
05:18:12,798 --> 05:18:14,160
they can rethink their life decisions

8513
05:18:14,160 --> 05:18:15,680
and and do something more productive

8514
05:18:15,680 --> 05:18:17,360
like become a security researcher or

8515
05:18:17,360 --> 05:18:19,840
something like that

8516
05:18:20,400 --> 05:18:21,680
so shields up

8517
05:18:21,680 --> 05:18:23,760
i hope everyone groaned uh just like i

8518
05:18:23,760 --> 05:18:25,440
did when caesar put that announcement

8519
05:18:25,440 --> 05:18:27,200
out the generic the russians are coming

8520
05:18:27,200 --> 05:18:28,798
put your shields up

8521
05:18:28,798 --> 05:18:30,240
because that's how it works right we've

8522
05:18:30,240 --> 05:18:31,520
all got these magical shields that are

8523
05:18:31,520 --> 05:18:32,958
sitting there waiting to protect us at

8524
05:18:32,958 --> 05:18:35,680
any given moment once that threat arises

8525
05:18:35,680 --> 05:18:36,560
you know if

8526
05:18:36,560 --> 05:18:38,000
if that was the case then we'd just have

8527
05:18:38,000 --> 05:18:39,280
the shields up all the time right and we

8528
05:18:39,280 --> 05:18:41,520
would save ourselves a headache

8529
05:18:41,520 --> 05:18:43,440
so

8530
05:18:43,440 --> 05:18:45,600
totally unrealistic unrealistic but um

8531
05:18:45,600 --> 05:18:47,920
at the same time

8532
05:18:47,920 --> 05:18:49,840
i do think there's value in having

8533
05:18:49,840 --> 05:18:51,600
certain controls in place

8534
05:18:51,600 --> 05:18:52,638
so i'm not going to cover some of the

8535
05:18:52,638 --> 05:18:54,480
more developer-centric stuff in terms of

8536
05:18:54,480 --> 05:18:57,360
secure code practices secure code

8537
05:18:57,360 --> 05:18:59,040
your methodologies frameworks those

8538
05:18:59,040 --> 05:19:01,120
sorts of things uh this is more focused

8539
05:19:01,120 --> 05:19:03,680
on security controls that secops can

8540
05:19:03,680 --> 05:19:05,200
bring to bear

8541
05:19:05,200 --> 05:19:07,840
so the first step i

8542
05:19:07,840 --> 05:19:09,840
in my opinion is uh to control the stuff

8543
05:19:09,840 --> 05:19:11,360
that you can control

8544
05:19:11,360 --> 05:19:13,040
so you look at the first party delivered

8545
05:19:13,040 --> 05:19:15,680
code so the code that you

8546
05:19:15,680 --> 05:19:18,080
as an enterprise are writing yourself

8547
05:19:18,080 --> 05:19:19,680
the third party libraries that you're

8548
05:19:19,680 --> 05:19:20,638
putting in

8549
05:19:20,638 --> 05:19:23,200
you can then run static application

8550
05:19:23,200 --> 05:19:25,600
security testing or sas tools across

8551
05:19:25,600 --> 05:19:26,560
this

8552
05:19:26,560 --> 05:19:28,798
do code analysis and look for

8553
05:19:28,798 --> 05:19:30,638
vulnerabilities that can be remediated

8554
05:19:30,638 --> 05:19:32,320
prior to release

8555
05:19:32,320 --> 05:19:34,400
as part of the shift left

8556
05:19:34,400 --> 05:19:35,600
in terms of that spider web of

8557
05:19:35,600 --> 05:19:37,600
dependencies that i mentioned before you

8558
05:19:37,600 --> 05:19:39,440
can also use software composition

8559
05:19:39,440 --> 05:19:43,200
analysis to help map that out find out

8560
05:19:43,200 --> 05:19:45,280
out of date libraries libraries with

8561
05:19:45,280 --> 05:19:46,718
known vulnerabilities and that sort of

8562
05:19:46,718 --> 05:19:48,080
thing and again

8563
05:19:48,080 --> 05:19:50,240
remedy that before you promote the code

8564
05:19:50,240 --> 05:19:52,718
into production

8565
05:19:52,718 --> 05:19:54,080
you also want to make sure that your web

8566
05:19:54,080 --> 05:19:55,440
app and the associated framework

8567
05:19:55,440 --> 05:19:57,360
underneath has protections in place as

8568
05:19:57,360 --> 05:19:58,320
well

8569
05:19:58,320 --> 05:20:00,000
i did see in the chat some shade being

8570
05:20:00,000 --> 05:20:02,240
thrown on dynamic application security

8571
05:20:02,240 --> 05:20:04,798
testing in one of the chats

8572
05:20:04,798 --> 05:20:06,240
and then i get where that comment comes

8573
05:20:06,240 --> 05:20:07,680
from but at the same time i think it

8574
05:20:07,680 --> 05:20:10,000
does have some value as well because no

8575
05:20:10,000 --> 05:20:12,000
matter how far we shift left and indeed

8576
05:20:12,000 --> 05:20:13,760
if we fall off into the ocean uh there's

8577
05:20:13,760 --> 05:20:15,360
still no guarantee that something won't

8578
05:20:15,360 --> 05:20:17,040
end up in prod without any

8579
05:20:17,040 --> 05:20:19,040
vulnerabilities so it's important to

8580
05:20:19,040 --> 05:20:20,798
assess the

8581
05:20:20,798 --> 05:20:22,878
assess the web app as it's actually

8582
05:20:22,878 --> 05:20:25,840
executing in real term real time

8583
05:20:25,840 --> 05:20:27,840
um looking for previously undetected

8584
05:20:27,840 --> 05:20:29,920
vulnerabilities or new vulnerabilities

8585
05:20:29,920 --> 05:20:31,120
as they drop

8586
05:20:31,120 --> 05:20:32,480
uh so this testing will only show the

8587
05:20:32,480 --> 05:20:34,240
vulnerabilities though right so we need

8588
05:20:34,240 --> 05:20:36,480
then a control to actually provide the

8589
05:20:36,480 --> 05:20:39,600
protections uh so you can use dynamic

8590
05:20:39,600 --> 05:20:41,840
applications security testing results

8591
05:20:41,840 --> 05:20:43,440
give it into the developers and get them

8592
05:20:43,440 --> 05:20:45,600
to fix up their code or if you're using

8593
05:20:45,600 --> 05:20:48,480
a modern das tool and using a modern web

8594
05:20:48,480 --> 05:20:50,638
application firewall or waff

8595
05:20:50,638 --> 05:20:52,000
then you can actually get the dash

8596
05:20:52,000 --> 05:20:53,600
results automatically out of that

8597
05:20:53,600 --> 05:20:57,040
scanner uh put it into the waff and use

8598
05:20:57,040 --> 05:20:58,718
that to inform tightening of the wire

8599
05:20:58,718 --> 05:21:01,120
policy to provide those protections

8600
05:21:01,120 --> 05:21:02,558
you can then iterate of course and do

8601
05:21:02,558 --> 05:21:04,160
revalidation scans to make sure that

8602
05:21:04,160 --> 05:21:05,680
you're fixed up on the things that the

8603
05:21:05,680 --> 05:21:08,000
dust has picked up so it's another layer

8604
05:21:08,000 --> 05:21:10,558
of defense

8605
05:21:10,558 --> 05:21:12,320
another thing to focus on specific for

8606
05:21:12,320 --> 05:21:14,160
these classes of attack is of course

8607
05:21:14,160 --> 05:21:15,280
injection

8608
05:21:15,280 --> 05:21:17,040
so if we can prevent injection attacks

8609
05:21:17,040 --> 05:21:18,798
then that is another good thing that we

8610
05:21:18,798 --> 05:21:21,120
should be doing and again this is on

8611
05:21:21,120 --> 05:21:23,200
stuff that we control ourselves we can't

8612
05:21:23,200 --> 05:21:24,878
put a waff in front of the third parties

8613
05:21:24,878 --> 05:21:26,878
that we're referencing right but we can

8614
05:21:26,878 --> 05:21:28,718
do the best we can to

8615
05:21:28,718 --> 05:21:32,160
uh to protect our own resources

8616
05:21:32,160 --> 05:21:34,718
and finally there are other controls

8617
05:21:34,718 --> 05:21:36,320
that we can use in the web apps

8618
05:21:36,320 --> 05:21:38,558
themselves um things like cross-origin

8619
05:21:38,558 --> 05:21:41,360
resource sharing is a another good idea

8620
05:21:41,360 --> 05:21:44,000
or another good control to implement

8621
05:21:44,000 --> 05:21:46,080
so cause allows you to instruct the

8622
05:21:46,080 --> 05:21:48,558
client what which third parties are

8623
05:21:48,558 --> 05:21:51,360
approved so if an attacker actually does

8624
05:21:51,360 --> 05:21:53,600
get in and manage to manipulate your

8625
05:21:53,600 --> 05:21:55,680
code and reference their malicious third

8626
05:21:55,680 --> 05:21:58,000
party if that's not in the cause policy

8627
05:21:58,000 --> 05:22:00,160
then the client will actually ignore it

8628
05:22:00,160 --> 05:22:02,798
so they won't pick up that malicious

8629
05:22:02,798 --> 05:22:04,480
third party and bring down the code so

8630
05:22:04,480 --> 05:22:05,920
it won't be on the end point and so

8631
05:22:05,920 --> 05:22:08,000
therefore the attack will fail

8632
05:22:08,000 --> 05:22:09,280
the problem with that is that you won't

8633
05:22:09,280 --> 05:22:11,520
get a detection that's going on right so

8634
05:22:11,520 --> 05:22:13,600
again this visibility on the endpoint

8635
05:22:13,600 --> 05:22:17,520
piece is somewhat of a challenge

8636
05:22:17,520 --> 05:22:18,958
so you can put all those controls in

8637
05:22:18,958 --> 05:22:20,480
place right and it sounds like that's a

8638
05:22:20,480 --> 05:22:22,638
pretty good step you know um job done

8639
05:22:22,638 --> 05:22:24,718
right but um if we look at these large

8640
05:22:24,718 --> 05:22:26,240
enterprises particularly something like

8641
05:22:26,240 --> 05:22:27,920
a british airways you know they would

8642
05:22:27,920 --> 05:22:29,840
have a lot of these controls in place

8643
05:22:29,840 --> 05:22:31,280
already if not everything that i just

8644
05:22:31,280 --> 05:22:32,798
mentioned there plus a bunch of other

8645
05:22:32,798 --> 05:22:33,920
things

8646
05:22:33,920 --> 05:22:36,320
now we can all argue about the varying

8647
05:22:36,320 --> 05:22:37,840
degrees of quality of deployment and

8648
05:22:37,840 --> 05:22:39,520
operations

8649
05:22:39,520 --> 05:22:41,280
of these types of controls

8650
05:22:41,280 --> 05:22:42,400
and particularly things like web

8651
05:22:42,400 --> 05:22:44,240
application firewall it can be complex

8652
05:22:44,240 --> 05:22:45,040
right

8653
05:22:45,040 --> 05:22:47,360
um but even with all that in place we

8654
05:22:47,360 --> 05:22:49,600
still see these attacks being successful

8655
05:22:49,600 --> 05:22:51,280
and so why is that

8656
05:22:51,280 --> 05:22:53,040
so some additional strategies from my

8657
05:22:53,040 --> 05:22:55,280
point of view i think that we

8658
05:22:55,280 --> 05:22:56,798
client-side is key

8659
05:22:56,798 --> 05:22:58,798
we need to look at what's actually

8660
05:22:58,798 --> 05:23:00,718
happening on that endpoint as i said

8661
05:23:00,718 --> 05:23:02,320
before there's lots of tools that we can

8662
05:23:02,320 --> 05:23:04,798
use to look at the web app as code how

8663
05:23:04,798 --> 05:23:07,520
it's composed uh how it's delivered but

8664
05:23:07,520 --> 05:23:09,120
ultimately the client side is a single

8665
05:23:09,120 --> 05:23:11,040
source of truth as to what is actually

8666
05:23:11,040 --> 05:23:12,878
ending up on that endpoint and what is

8667
05:23:12,878 --> 05:23:14,958
is executing

8668
05:23:14,958 --> 05:23:16,000
so

8669
05:23:16,000 --> 05:23:17,360
these are untrusted and uncontrolled

8670
05:23:17,360 --> 05:23:18,638
right so it's not like we have

8671
05:23:18,638 --> 05:23:20,320
enterprise tooling at our hands that we

8672
05:23:20,320 --> 05:23:22,400
can put on enterprise owned assets but

8673
05:23:22,400 --> 05:23:24,400
we can extend our security controls

8674
05:23:24,400 --> 05:23:26,798
outside of our environments using things

8675
05:23:26,798 --> 05:23:28,878
like a javascript

8676
05:23:28,878 --> 05:23:30,798
and

8677
05:23:30,798 --> 05:23:32,878
sdks for mobile apps right to inject

8678
05:23:32,878 --> 05:23:34,718
your security controls as part of the

8679
05:23:34,718 --> 05:23:37,760
delivery of your app down to that client

8680
05:23:37,760 --> 05:23:40,320
so customers tend to already be doing a

8681
05:23:40,320 --> 05:23:41,520
lot of this sort of stuff particularly

8682
05:23:41,520 --> 05:23:43,200
larger enterprises

8683
05:23:43,200 --> 05:23:45,840
in terms of client-side input validation

8684
05:23:45,840 --> 05:23:47,920
so what i'm suggesting is

8685
05:23:47,920 --> 05:23:49,360
not necessarily something particularly

8686
05:23:49,360 --> 05:23:51,280
new but expand the scope of what you're

8687
05:23:51,280 --> 05:23:53,040
doing with those client-side security

8688
05:23:53,040 --> 05:23:55,200
controls and actually use it to

8689
05:23:55,200 --> 05:23:56,958
understand what's executing on that

8690
05:23:56,958 --> 05:23:58,878
endpoint at least in the context of the

8691
05:23:58,878 --> 05:24:01,280
browser and look back at the website as

8692
05:24:01,280 --> 05:24:03,760
well so you get that externalized view

8693
05:24:03,760 --> 05:24:04,878
of

8694
05:24:04,878 --> 05:24:06,840
of the entire web

8695
05:24:06,840 --> 05:24:08,638
application when you're on the endpoint

8696
05:24:08,638 --> 05:24:10,798
as a security control it's uh

8697
05:24:10,798 --> 05:24:13,120
super essential that you want to ensure

8698
05:24:13,120 --> 05:24:14,558
that you're not showing your hand to the

8699
05:24:14,558 --> 05:24:16,080
adversaries right so you want to hide

8700
05:24:16,080 --> 05:24:17,040
what you're doing you want to be

8701
05:24:17,040 --> 05:24:19,120
obfuscated

8702
05:24:19,120 --> 05:24:21,520
and or ideally encrypted as well so they

8703
05:24:21,520 --> 05:24:23,360
can't see what you're doing they can't

8704
05:24:23,360 --> 05:24:25,120
see the signals that you're looking for

8705
05:24:25,120 --> 05:24:27,120
they can't see what you're collecting

8706
05:24:27,120 --> 05:24:28,080
and see

8707
05:24:28,080 --> 05:24:29,600
you need to ensure that you're keeping

8708
05:24:29,600 --> 05:24:31,600
your signal collection secret and you

8709
05:24:31,600 --> 05:24:33,040
want to make sure that the signals that

8710
05:24:33,040 --> 05:24:34,718
you collecting you're collecting are

8711
05:24:34,718 --> 05:24:35,600
strong

8712
05:24:35,600 --> 05:24:37,760
so in that i mean that they should be

8713
05:24:37,760 --> 05:24:39,120
high fidelity

8714
05:24:39,120 --> 05:24:40,080
um

8715
05:24:40,080 --> 05:24:42,558
should be unknown or at least uh not

8716
05:24:42,558 --> 05:24:46,000
commonly known and difficult to infer

8717
05:24:46,000 --> 05:24:48,000
so once you have this this security

8718
05:24:48,000 --> 05:24:49,360
control operating on the endpoint and

8719
05:24:49,360 --> 05:24:50,718
you've got the signal collection and you

8720
05:24:50,718 --> 05:24:52,240
bring it back to a central location

8721
05:24:52,240 --> 05:24:54,080
hopefully you can do analysis on it

8722
05:24:54,080 --> 05:24:55,680
right and there's a bunch of things you

8723
05:24:55,680 --> 05:24:58,160
can look at to tip off for signs that

8724
05:24:58,160 --> 05:24:59,840
there might be something nefarious going

8725
05:24:59,840 --> 05:25:00,798
on

8726
05:25:00,798 --> 05:25:02,400
i've got some obvious ones up here

8727
05:25:02,400 --> 05:25:04,400
around using things like reputational

8728
05:25:04,400 --> 05:25:06,718
feeds to look for malicious known third

8729
05:25:06,718 --> 05:25:07,680
parties

8730
05:25:07,680 --> 05:25:09,680
uh you can look for new sources that are

8731
05:25:09,680 --> 05:25:11,280
suddenly being referenced

8732
05:25:11,280 --> 05:25:13,520
or changes to existing components and

8733
05:25:13,520 --> 05:25:15,520
then you can use attributes like the the

8734
05:25:15,520 --> 05:25:18,240
length of the age of the domain um that

8735
05:25:18,240 --> 05:25:19,600
is third-party being referenced right

8736
05:25:19,600 --> 05:25:22,000
because that can be as

8737
05:25:22,000 --> 05:25:24,558
a tip-off as well

8738
05:25:24,558 --> 05:25:26,000
uh yeah because with that you know

8739
05:25:26,000 --> 05:25:27,120
attackers will spin up new

8740
05:25:27,120 --> 05:25:28,798
infrastructure to support new campaigns

8741
05:25:28,798 --> 05:25:31,120
or they maybe might even use some reuse

8742
05:25:31,120 --> 05:25:33,200
components from a previous campaign but

8743
05:25:33,200 --> 05:25:34,958
either way it's not going to be a

8744
05:25:34,958 --> 05:25:37,040
website that has been around for 10

8745
05:25:37,040 --> 05:25:39,280
years and has a really solid reputation

8746
05:25:39,280 --> 05:25:41,840
right so you have these cell tail signs

8747
05:25:41,840 --> 05:25:44,878
to figure out that something's not legit

8748
05:25:44,878 --> 05:25:46,480
and then once you have all that analysis

8749
05:25:46,480 --> 05:25:47,760
done and you get a good level of

8750
05:25:47,760 --> 05:25:48,878
confidence that you have something

8751
05:25:48,878 --> 05:25:50,400
malicious that shouldn't be

8752
05:25:50,400 --> 05:25:52,400
executing on that endpoint you need to

8753
05:25:52,400 --> 05:25:54,240
have the ability to dynamically send to

8754
05:25:54,240 --> 05:25:56,080
that client um

8755
05:25:56,080 --> 05:25:57,440
instructions to actually block the

8756
05:25:57,440 --> 05:26:01,040
execution of that malicious component

8757
05:26:01,040 --> 05:26:02,480
so if anyone wants to do some some

8758
05:26:02,480 --> 05:26:04,558
testing with this these are some actual

8759
05:26:04,558 --> 05:26:07,120
malicious third parties

8760
05:26:07,120 --> 05:26:08,958
this code snippet it can be put straight

8761
05:26:08,958 --> 05:26:11,520
into code you can use a proxy to inject

8762
05:26:11,520 --> 05:26:13,440
it or you can if you're just running off

8763
05:26:13,440 --> 05:26:15,040
your laptop you can use

8764
05:26:15,040 --> 05:26:16,558
the experimental feature in chrome for

8765
05:26:16,558 --> 05:26:18,240
local overrides all right so you can

8766
05:26:18,240 --> 05:26:19,680
inject this in

8767
05:26:19,680 --> 05:26:21,600
to your web app dynamically as it's as

8768
05:26:21,600 --> 05:26:22,878
it's loading

8769
05:26:22,878 --> 05:26:24,400
um

8770
05:26:24,400 --> 05:26:26,558
now this will add it as a source right

8771
05:26:26,558 --> 05:26:28,480
so if you've got anything that's looking

8772
05:26:28,480 --> 05:26:30,878
at visibility alerting or any kind of

8773
05:26:30,878 --> 05:26:33,040
mitigation controls it should flag it

8774
05:26:33,040 --> 05:26:34,320
but it's not actually going to invoke

8775
05:26:34,320 --> 05:26:35,840
anything malicious right so it's a

8776
05:26:35,840 --> 05:26:38,638
benign testing tool

8777
05:26:38,638 --> 05:26:40,718
and then this is uh some example

8778
05:26:40,718 --> 05:26:42,320
analysis of one of those malicious third

8779
05:26:42,320 --> 05:26:44,638
parties that i just showed um you can

8780
05:26:44,638 --> 05:26:45,920
see there that the main is relatively

8781
05:26:45,920 --> 05:26:48,000
short-lived it doesn't receive a lot of

8782
05:26:48,000 --> 05:26:50,240
legit traffic it's not generally

8783
05:26:50,240 --> 05:26:53,040
categorized by other vendor engines so

8784
05:26:53,040 --> 05:26:55,200
it's not a website that people are going

8785
05:26:55,200 --> 05:26:57,360
to and that has been classified or

8786
05:26:57,360 --> 05:26:59,120
categorized as a particular type of

8787
05:26:59,120 --> 05:27:01,280
website like sporting or gambling or

8788
05:27:01,280 --> 05:27:03,280
news or whatever right so these are all

8789
05:27:03,280 --> 05:27:05,200
indicators that it's malicious

8790
05:27:05,200 --> 05:27:07,360
and as i said if you can get your risk

8791
05:27:07,360 --> 05:27:09,360
rating to a complete level of confidence

8792
05:27:09,360 --> 05:27:10,638
or a level that you want to have as

8793
05:27:10,638 --> 05:27:12,240
confidence then you can do that

8794
05:27:12,240 --> 05:27:16,160
instruction to take the blocking action

8795
05:27:17,440 --> 05:27:18,878
so that's my talk

8796
05:27:18,878 --> 05:27:21,040
hopefully it provided a useful overview

8797
05:27:21,040 --> 05:27:23,760
of the problems and some strategies to

8798
05:27:23,760 --> 05:27:25,200
hopefully make the attacker's life a bit

8799
05:27:25,200 --> 05:27:27,120
more difficult um couldn't go

8800
05:27:27,120 --> 05:27:29,200
particularly deep in a 20-minute con

8801
05:27:29,200 --> 05:27:31,120
talk because it is quite a broad area

8802
05:27:31,120 --> 05:27:32,240
and there's lots of different components

8803
05:27:32,240 --> 05:27:34,160
to it um so if you want more information

8804
05:27:34,160 --> 05:27:35,520
and you wanna have a chat or whatever

8805
05:27:35,520 --> 05:27:40,480
hit me up on discord or or daf at f5.com

8806
05:27:41,280 --> 05:27:42,638
that was a really good talk for

8807
05:27:42,638 --> 05:27:43,760
providing

8808
05:27:43,760 --> 05:27:46,638
some really easy actionable things to do

8809
05:27:46,638 --> 05:27:48,558
in an organization

8810
05:27:48,558 --> 05:27:50,958
one thing that i'm curious about that's

8811
05:27:50,958 --> 05:27:53,120
slightly becoming

8812
05:27:53,120 --> 05:27:55,680
more relevant or it's um becoming bigger

8813
05:27:55,680 --> 05:27:57,600
these days is the use of a software bill

8814
05:27:57,600 --> 05:28:00,400
of materials um do you have any sort of

8815
05:28:00,400 --> 05:28:02,160
thoughts on how that might help in this

8816
05:28:02,160 --> 05:28:04,400
space as well

8817
05:28:04,400 --> 05:28:06,400
yeah yeah absolutely um one of the

8818
05:28:06,400 --> 05:28:08,320
things that i said that it's difficult

8819
05:28:08,320 --> 05:28:09,040
to

8820
05:28:09,040 --> 05:28:10,400
it's difficult enough to understand your

8821
05:28:10,400 --> 05:28:12,878
own third parties um dependencies and

8822
05:28:12,878 --> 05:28:15,040
then the sub-dependencies of that but

8823
05:28:15,040 --> 05:28:16,320
then when you've got components from

8824
05:28:16,320 --> 05:28:17,920
that different vendors in there that end

8825
05:28:17,920 --> 05:28:19,360
up being essentially a black box and

8826
05:28:19,360 --> 05:28:20,798
you've got no idea what their software

8827
05:28:20,798 --> 05:28:22,958
full of materials is um you don't even

8828
05:28:22,958 --> 05:28:24,400
know where to start right it can be a

8829
05:28:24,400 --> 05:28:26,638
challenge um so yeah i'm actually a big

8830
05:28:26,638 --> 05:28:28,638
advocate for that um i think vendors

8831
05:28:28,638 --> 05:28:30,400
should be

8832
05:28:30,400 --> 05:28:32,000
and there should be an open standard for

8833
05:28:32,000 --> 05:28:36,480
providing a software build materials

8834
05:28:36,480 --> 05:28:38,080
and i think the great example of that

8835
05:28:38,080 --> 05:28:39,440
that's happened recently not necessarily

8836
05:28:39,440 --> 05:28:41,200
in the web app space although you know

8837
05:28:41,200 --> 05:28:42,320
it could have been used in the web app

8838
05:28:42,320 --> 05:28:45,680
space was um log4j and um the spring

8839
05:28:45,680 --> 05:28:48,480
cloud piece um you know look 4j being

8840
05:28:48,480 --> 05:28:51,280
embedded as a jar file five levels deep

8841
05:28:51,280 --> 05:28:53,280
in other jar files and organizations are

8842
05:28:53,280 --> 05:28:54,558
running around going

8843
05:28:54,558 --> 05:28:56,400
uh do we use log4j and the answer is

8844
05:28:56,400 --> 05:28:58,638
probably safe to say yes the question is

8845
05:28:58,638 --> 05:29:01,120
where um because i don't think you're

8846
05:29:01,120 --> 05:29:02,878
nodding furiously shanna i think there's

8847
05:29:02,878 --> 05:29:04,638
been a lot of um

8848
05:29:04,638 --> 05:29:06,480
trying to work out where log4j is and

8849
05:29:06,480 --> 05:29:07,600
that's a problem that's probably not

8850
05:29:07,600 --> 05:29:10,000
going to go away anytime soon either

8851
05:29:10,000 --> 05:29:11,600
yeah and that's and it's one of those

8852
05:29:11,600 --> 05:29:13,200
things that you know some of the advice

8853
05:29:13,200 --> 05:29:14,958
came out that said patch your systems

8854
05:29:14,958 --> 05:29:16,958
it's like that's fantastic

8855
05:29:16,958 --> 05:29:19,200
but we don't even know

8856
05:29:19,200 --> 05:29:21,280
you know what appliances or applications

8857
05:29:21,280 --> 05:29:23,680
it might also be in and then we have to

8858
05:29:23,680 --> 05:29:25,680
wait for vendors to patch their systems

8859
05:29:25,680 --> 05:29:27,360
and things like that but i think that

8860
05:29:27,360 --> 05:29:30,638
did bring up that um the bill of

8861
05:29:30,638 --> 05:29:34,878
software as an idea and that you know

8862
05:29:34,878 --> 05:29:37,600
even if organizations or vendors who are

8863
05:29:37,600 --> 05:29:39,440
producing these applications came out

8864
05:29:39,440 --> 05:29:41,120
and started to do that

8865
05:29:41,120 --> 05:29:42,958
for the good of society would be

8866
05:29:42,958 --> 05:29:44,798
fantastic but i think it's something

8867
05:29:44,798 --> 05:29:46,878
that will come down the line as we see

8868
05:29:46,878 --> 05:29:49,040
more of these supply chain attacks

8869
05:29:49,040 --> 05:29:51,760
um happening you know solar winds

8870
05:29:51,760 --> 05:29:53,760
obviously was a big one that that we saw

8871
05:29:53,760 --> 05:29:56,558
everywhere and they're not going to stop

8872
05:29:56,558 --> 05:29:58,958
so it's i think something that will get

8873
05:29:58,958 --> 05:30:01,040
a little bit more airtime

8874
05:30:01,040 --> 05:30:04,718
going forward but yeah applications and

8875
05:30:04,718 --> 05:30:07,360
application security and

8876
05:30:07,360 --> 05:30:10,080
you know attackers using applications is

8877
05:30:10,080 --> 05:30:12,958
huge it's it's definitely a hole in in a

8878
05:30:12,958 --> 05:30:15,040
lot of security um in a lot of

8879
05:30:15,040 --> 05:30:17,600
organizations for their security attack

8880
05:30:17,600 --> 05:30:19,520
surface for sure

8881
05:30:19,520 --> 05:30:23,120
so yeah thanks for for the talk and some

8882
05:30:23,120 --> 05:30:26,240
actionable um feedback too is is much

8883
05:30:26,240 --> 05:30:27,840
appreciated when we can all learn a

8884
05:30:27,840 --> 05:30:31,600
little bit from our talks so thank you

8885
05:30:31,600 --> 05:30:33,440
not a problem at all um if you don't

8886
05:30:33,440 --> 05:30:35,040
mind i just had one more little thing in

8887
05:30:35,040 --> 05:30:37,280
there so i had a customer conversation

8888
05:30:37,280 --> 05:30:39,200
just recently and we drew up a high

8889
05:30:39,200 --> 05:30:41,040
level uh of their architecture and where

8890
05:30:41,040 --> 05:30:43,360
one of their key applications sat

8891
05:30:43,360 --> 05:30:44,638
and i asked them what controls they had

8892
05:30:44,638 --> 05:30:45,760
in place and all the rest and they had a

8893
05:30:45,760 --> 05:30:47,520
next-gen firewall there but it wasn't

8894
05:30:47,520 --> 05:30:48,958
really doing anything in terms of

8895
05:30:48,958 --> 05:30:50,798
application level inspection and they

8896
05:30:50,798 --> 05:30:53,120
had a way for it wasn't turned on um and

8897
05:30:53,120 --> 05:30:54,638
i said to him okay what's this thing

8898
05:30:54,638 --> 05:30:56,480
listening on um hopefully not 80 but

8899
05:30:56,480 --> 05:30:59,360
definitely 443 right yeah okay all right

8900
05:30:59,360 --> 05:31:01,120
you realize that

8901
05:31:01,120 --> 05:31:02,160
where we've got this drawn in the

8902
05:31:02,160 --> 05:31:03,680
architecture and how deep it is inside

8903
05:31:03,680 --> 05:31:05,200
your system you might as well have it

8904
05:31:05,200 --> 05:31:06,558
sitting off the border router because

8905
05:31:06,558 --> 05:31:07,760
from a web application point of view

8906
05:31:07,760 --> 05:31:09,600
you're providing zero security for it

8907
05:31:09,600 --> 05:31:10,400
and this is a room a security

8908
05:31:10,400 --> 05:31:11,280
professional's writing they said who

8909
05:31:11,280 --> 05:31:12,878
wants to put this app up there and

8910
05:31:12,878 --> 05:31:14,400
there's a pretty silent sort of moment

8911
05:31:14,400 --> 05:31:16,638
um

8912
05:31:16,958 --> 05:31:17,840
yeah that's what we need to be thinking

8913
05:31:17,840 --> 05:31:18,798
yeah

8914
05:31:18,798 --> 05:31:20,638
everyone focuses on the network still a

8915
05:31:20,638 --> 05:31:23,840
little bit i think um

8916
05:31:23,840 --> 05:31:25,360
oh yeah definitely

8917
05:31:25,360 --> 05:31:26,798
but you know it was

8918
05:31:26,798 --> 05:31:29,360
10 years ago

8919
05:31:29,360 --> 05:31:31,520
attackers have moved on yeah

8920
05:31:31,520 --> 05:31:33,440
i talk a lot about layer 7 security with

8921
05:31:33,440 --> 05:31:36,320
web app but um there's a interesting

8922
05:31:36,320 --> 05:31:38,798
concept of layer eight security which is

8923
05:31:38,798 --> 05:31:39,920
what we do around user into the

8924
05:31:39,920 --> 05:31:41,440
interaction with applications as well

8925
05:31:41,440 --> 05:31:44,558
yeah yep yeah definitely

8926
05:31:44,558 --> 05:31:46,480
no fantastic thank you very much staff

8927
05:31:46,480 --> 05:31:48,558
that was a great talk and um if anyone

8928
05:31:48,558 --> 05:31:50,080
has any questions please feel free to

8929
05:31:50,080 --> 05:31:52,080
ask them and um definitely take away the

8930
05:31:52,080 --> 05:31:54,958
lessons and the actionable stuff as well

8931
05:31:54,958 --> 05:31:56,080
thanks so much everyone appreciate your

8932
05:31:56,080 --> 05:31:57,040
time

8933

no worries

8934
05:31:59,360 --> 05:32:01,520
i think it's time for a break shanna

8935
05:32:01,520 --> 05:32:02,878
i think it's time for break as well i

8936
05:32:02,878 --> 05:32:05,280
think it's time for a refill and some

8937
05:32:05,280 --> 05:32:07,680
some some food and

8938
05:32:07,680 --> 05:32:08,958
i have to feed the dogs because they've

8939
05:32:08,958 --> 05:32:11,680
been whining for the last half an hour

8940
05:32:11,680 --> 05:32:13,440
um because if they don't get fed they

8941
05:32:13,440 --> 05:32:15,440
get grumpy this whole daylight savings

8942
05:32:15,440 --> 05:32:17,600
thing by the way sucks

8943
05:32:17,600 --> 05:32:19,280
because

8944
05:32:19,280 --> 05:32:21,680
i can change daylight savings but my

8945
05:32:21,680 --> 05:32:24,480
dogs still think it's now 6 p.m

8946
05:32:24,480 --> 05:32:26,080
and i've not fed them

8947
05:32:26,080 --> 05:32:27,760
yeah and also i wake up in the morning

8948
05:32:27,760 --> 05:32:30,240
and my body thinks oh it's it's it's 7

8949
05:32:30,240 --> 05:32:34,160
pm no it's whatever time so um

8950
05:32:34,160 --> 05:32:36,958

um and i think it's fair to say that

9029
05:58:12,878 --> 05:58:15,040
does not mean we're in a bad third we

9030
05:58:15,040 --> 05:58:17,520
still have a lot of amazing speakers

9031
05:58:17,520 --> 05:58:18,718
um

9032
05:58:18,718 --> 05:58:20,558
i'm just starting now so we can make

9033
05:58:20,558 --> 05:58:23,040
sure we started exactly six for lizette

um who will be speaking next

9035
05:58:25,600 --> 05:58:26,400
but

9036
05:58:26,400 --> 05:58:28,240
i've also become a pillow apparently

9037
05:58:28,240 --> 05:58:31,040
because i'm also comfy and again this

9038
05:58:31,040 --> 05:58:33,600
falls within the theory of comfy con so

9039
05:58:33,600 --> 05:58:35,200
why not become

9040
05:58:35,200 --> 05:58:38,160
a comfy hello

9041
05:58:38,160 --> 05:58:40,160
um i can also i've also been kicked out

9042
05:58:40,160 --> 05:58:41,440
of my kitchen because someone has

9043
05:58:41,440 --> 05:58:44,000
decided to go cook chicken in there

9044
05:58:44,000 --> 05:58:47,360
so um there's not really much i can do

9045
05:58:47,360 --> 05:58:49,280
right now other than just

9046
05:58:49,280 --> 05:58:51,280
sit here i guess

9047
05:58:51,280 --> 05:58:53,040
it sucks to me

9048
05:58:53,040 --> 05:58:56,240
why thanks that's really helpful

9049
05:58:56,240 --> 05:58:58,638
that was rhetorical by the way oh

9050
05:58:58,638 --> 05:59:00,000
that's what she said

9051
05:59:00,000 --> 05:59:01,680
um

9052
05:59:01,680 --> 05:59:03,280
i don't think that's relevant though uh

9053
05:59:03,280 --> 05:59:04,240
anyway

9054
05:59:04,240 --> 05:59:05,200
um

9055
05:59:05,200 --> 05:59:07,600
so while our next speaker just gets um

9056
05:59:07,600 --> 05:59:09,520
organized um and they tell us that

9057
05:59:09,520 --> 05:59:11,120
they're good to go

9058
05:59:11,120 --> 05:59:13,280
um a reminder we've got a couple more

9059
05:59:13,280 --> 05:59:16,240
talks after this so we've got

9060
05:59:16,240 --> 05:59:18,320
uh sarah talking about

9061
05:59:18,320 --> 05:59:19,520
learning the difference between a

9062
05:59:19,520 --> 05:59:21,440
security strategy and a plan which is

9063
05:59:21,440 --> 05:59:22,798
going to be in the context of harry

9064
05:59:22,798 --> 05:59:24,240
potter

9065
05:59:24,240 --> 05:59:25,520
super fun

9066
05:59:25,520 --> 05:59:27,360
yes shanna is also going to be showing

9067
05:59:27,360 --> 05:59:29,920
us how to cook attendees her way

9068
05:59:29,920 --> 05:59:32,878
uh alex who is currently in my kitchen

9069
05:59:32,878 --> 05:59:34,558
is going to be

9070
05:59:34,558 --> 05:59:36,320
talking about deus ex promised me cool

9071
05:59:36,320 --> 05:59:38,798
augments and all we have is dystopia

9072
05:59:38,798 --> 05:59:41,600
which i am really interested in hearing

9073
05:59:41,600 --> 05:59:44,558
and then our lock notes or what was the

9074
05:59:44,558 --> 05:59:46,480
other term george used

9075
05:59:46,480 --> 05:59:49,120
last talk charlie or something he's not

9076
05:59:49,120 --> 05:59:50,320
here at the moment to be able to talk

9077
05:59:50,320 --> 05:59:53,040
about it um will be from alexi who's

9078
05:59:53,040 --> 05:59:55,360
going to be talking about big bounties

9079
05:59:55,360 --> 05:59:57,680
so um i'm just going to check lizette

9080

so i will add you to the stream

9087
06:00:10,320 --> 06:00:12,000
thank you

9088
06:00:12,000 --> 06:00:14,878
no worries how are you doing today

9089
06:00:14,878 --> 06:00:17,040
very good and today has been actually

9090
06:00:17,040 --> 06:00:18,878
quite hot in canberra

9091
06:00:18,878 --> 06:00:20,558
ah yes what

9092
06:00:20,558 --> 06:00:24,718
24 degrees so hot it's pretty insane um

9093
06:00:24,718 --> 06:00:26,480
i mean i'm in canberra too and i had to

9094
06:00:26,480 --> 06:00:27,680
put the aircon on because we were

9095
06:00:27,680 --> 06:00:30,840
boiling in my living room

9096
06:00:30,840 --> 06:00:33,520
yeah yeah

9097
06:00:33,520 --> 06:00:35,840
sitting in for once it's not raining

9098
06:00:35,840 --> 06:00:38,638
yes finally just for today or tomorrow

9099
06:00:38,638 --> 06:00:40,878
but yeah it will come again

9100
06:00:40,878 --> 06:00:42,798
perfect um do you want do you want your

9101
06:00:42,798 --> 06:00:45,280
camera on or awful is that

9102
06:00:45,280 --> 06:00:48,160
uh i don't mind pretty much on but i

9103
06:00:48,160 --> 06:00:50,958
still like i see myself frozen can you

9104
06:00:50,958 --> 06:00:53,040
actually see me moving at the moment we

9105
06:00:53,040 --> 06:00:54,718
can't see you at the moment i don't

9106
06:00:54,718 --> 06:00:56,160
think it's currently showing up on the

9107
06:00:56,160 --> 06:00:58,320
stream yard so you might need to

9108
06:00:58,320 --> 06:01:00,958
um

9109
06:01:00,958 --> 06:01:04,878
refresh or change the video settings

9110
06:01:04,878 --> 06:01:06,798
all right

9111
06:01:06,798 --> 06:01:08,320
how about now

9112
06:01:08,320 --> 06:01:11,360
let's give me a sec something happened

9113
06:01:11,360 --> 06:01:14,360
oh

9114
06:01:24,558 --> 06:01:26,240

and definitely you cannot see me i don't

9118
06:01:32,480 --> 06:01:35,200
know why i'm sorry i thought

9119
06:01:35,200 --> 06:01:36,240
to go

9120
06:01:36,240 --> 06:01:38,480
and you can't even see my presentation

9121
06:01:38,480 --> 06:01:40,320
right i can see the presentation so

9122
06:01:40,320 --> 06:01:42,958
here's the presentation

9123
06:01:42,958 --> 06:01:44,240
yeah so

9124
06:01:44,240 --> 06:01:45,760
i don't know what's going on there i'm

9125
06:01:45,760 --> 06:01:47,040
really sorry

9126
06:01:47,040 --> 06:01:48,240
um

9127
06:01:48,240 --> 06:01:51,840
okay uh edit my avatar maybe i should

9128
06:01:51,840 --> 06:01:54,000
edit my avatar but i'm planning to put

9129
06:01:54,000 --> 06:01:56,320
my face there but it's not happening

9130
06:01:56,320 --> 06:01:57,760
somehow

9131
06:01:57,760 --> 06:01:59,440
probably we should just keep going i

9132
06:01:59,440 --> 06:02:01,840
guess oh sorry that would be great no no

9133
06:02:01,840 --> 06:02:03,360
no it's not your fault i'm sure it's our

9134
06:02:03,360 --> 06:02:04,878
technology that's going wrong and this

9135
06:02:04,878 --> 06:02:07,040
is the things that we have that we're on

9136
06:02:07,040 --> 06:02:09,600
this new platform as well but um look i

9137

for talking for the first time here um

9139
06:02:13,360 --> 06:02:14,878
we really hope that we're going to be a

9140
06:02:14,878 --> 06:02:17,120
really good audience for you and um i

9141
06:02:17,120 --> 06:02:18,718
will just introduce you and then you can

9142
06:02:18,718 --> 06:02:20,480
slightly talk

9143
06:02:20,480 --> 06:02:21,600

yes

9146
06:02:25,200 --> 06:02:27,200
so you're a proper i'm going to say in

9147
06:02:27,200 --> 06:02:29,040
quotes a proper engineer in that you're

9148
06:02:29,040 --> 06:02:31,840
in cosy certified and i don't think many

9149
06:02:31,840 --> 06:02:33,920
of us are um

9150
06:02:33,920 --> 06:02:35,760
your bio says you know there's a lot of

9151
06:02:35,760 --> 06:02:39,360
engineering iso 12 207 cboc all these

9152
06:02:39,360 --> 06:02:41,280
things that i find really scary when it

9153
06:02:41,280 --> 06:02:42,958
comes to proper engineering but i'm

9154
06:02:42,958 --> 06:02:45,600
really keen to um to hear your talk on

9155
06:02:45,600 --> 06:02:48,558
human factor engineering in the sdlc so

9156
06:02:48,558 --> 06:02:50,958
um i will hand it over to you if that's

9157
06:02:50,958 --> 06:02:54,877
okay sure thank you

9158
06:02:55,440 --> 06:02:56,878
okay

9159
06:02:56,878 --> 06:02:58,878
hello everyone i'm sorry you can't not

9160
06:02:58,878 --> 06:03:00,958
see me i'm having technical issues with

9161
06:03:00,958 --> 06:03:03,360
my camera but the good thing is you can

9162
06:03:03,360 --> 06:03:05,040
see my presentation

9163
06:03:05,040 --> 06:03:06,638
i am going to be talking about human

9164
06:03:06,638 --> 06:03:08,320
factor engineering in the system

9165
06:03:08,320 --> 06:03:10,160
development life cycle

9166
06:03:10,160 --> 06:03:12,160
and thank you conficon for hiring me

9167
06:03:12,160 --> 06:03:14,718
this time

9168
06:03:15,680 --> 06:03:17,040
i want to

9169
06:03:17,040 --> 06:03:19,760
start my presentation by asking you a

9170
06:03:19,760 --> 06:03:22,080
question to you all

9171
06:03:22,080 --> 06:03:23,840
is what's the purpose of designing

9172
06:03:23,840 --> 06:03:25,200
systems

9173
06:03:25,200 --> 06:03:28,718
at the end of the day it's about

9174
06:03:28,718 --> 06:03:31,760
developing systems fit for purpose

9175
06:03:31,760 --> 06:03:32,840
or

9176
06:03:32,840 --> 06:03:34,638
meeting

9177
06:03:34,638 --> 06:03:37,520
users needs and requirements

9178
06:03:37,520 --> 06:03:40,080
but what happens if you don't have

9179
06:03:40,080 --> 06:03:42,638
access to user requirements

9180
06:03:42,638 --> 06:03:45,520
and this is because

9181
06:03:45,680 --> 06:03:47,200
you're working in

9182
06:03:47,200 --> 06:03:49,840
research and development industries or

9183
06:03:49,840 --> 06:03:52,798
organizations or simply you don't have

9184
06:03:52,798 --> 06:03:55,120
access to users

9185
06:03:55,120 --> 06:03:58,000
and what i'm going to show you next

9186
06:03:58,000 --> 06:04:00,558
is a system that we are very familiar

9187
06:04:00,558 --> 06:04:01,440
with

9188
06:04:01,440 --> 06:04:03,440
on a daily basis

9189
06:04:03,440 --> 06:04:05,680
this is about doors

9190
06:04:05,680 --> 06:04:07,520
can you tell me

9191
06:04:07,520 --> 06:04:10,400
can you pull or push

9192
06:04:10,400 --> 06:04:12,638
these doors have handles and there is a

9193
06:04:12,638 --> 06:04:15,760
sign of what action is required from you

9194
06:04:15,760 --> 06:04:17,920
but i encounter this many times with

9195
06:04:17,920 --> 06:04:19,360
myself

9196
06:04:19,360 --> 06:04:22,718
instead of pulling you actually pushing

9197
06:04:22,718 --> 06:04:24,558
and then you feel like

9198
06:04:24,558 --> 06:04:26,878
oh what i'm doing

9199
06:04:26,878 --> 06:04:28,840
yes i'm embarrassed

9200
06:04:28,840 --> 06:04:32,000
but never mind i'll try to figure out

9201
06:04:32,000 --> 06:04:34,798
myself and eventually i pull instead of

9202
06:04:34,798 --> 06:04:36,400
pushing the door

9203
06:04:36,400 --> 06:04:39,360
but what about these doors

9204
06:04:39,360 --> 06:04:41,840
these doors don't have a signage don't

9205
06:04:41,840 --> 06:04:43,760
have handles

9206
06:04:43,760 --> 06:04:46,240
would you open this door faster

9207
06:04:46,240 --> 06:04:49,840
i think you would for sure

9208
06:04:56,798 --> 06:04:58,878
and this is what i wanted to talk to you

9209
06:04:58,878 --> 06:05:01,760
about human factor engineering

9210
06:05:01,760 --> 06:05:04,558
is understand the user to develop a

9211
06:05:04,558 --> 06:05:06,958
system of technology and technology that

9212
06:05:06,958 --> 06:05:09,120
is fit for purpose

9213
06:05:09,120 --> 06:05:10,718
because

9214
06:05:10,718 --> 06:05:13,120
good design takes care of planning and

9215
06:05:13,120 --> 06:05:14,400
understanding

9216
06:05:14,400 --> 06:05:17,760
of how people behave

9217
06:05:18,718 --> 06:05:21,760
so enough about those the next slide is

9218
06:05:21,760 --> 06:05:24,480
about talking

9219
06:05:24,480 --> 06:05:26,718
what happens if something doesn't go

9220
06:05:26,718 --> 06:05:28,400
well in the system development life

9221
06:05:28,400 --> 06:05:30,320
cycle

9222
06:05:30,320 --> 06:05:32,320
i will put together more realistic

9223
06:05:32,320 --> 06:05:35,040
examples in my next slides

9224
06:05:35,040 --> 06:05:37,040
but i'm going to have like what impacts

9225
06:05:37,040 --> 06:05:38,160
might be

9226
06:05:38,160 --> 06:05:40,400
when something goes wrong when you're

9227
06:05:40,400 --> 06:05:42,638
designing systems

9228
06:05:42,638 --> 06:05:45,360
the first one for example is poor user

9229
06:05:45,360 --> 06:05:46,558
experience

9230
06:05:46,558 --> 06:05:47,680
when you

9231
06:05:47,680 --> 06:05:49,200
interacting

9232
06:05:49,200 --> 06:05:50,718
all the time with different ui

9233
06:05:50,718 --> 06:05:54,680
environments or platforms

9234
06:05:55,040 --> 06:05:59,120
in this case increased cost market loss

9235
06:05:59,120 --> 06:06:01,520
something goes wrong with the design

9236
06:06:01,520 --> 06:06:04,878
you wanted to access a internet service

9237
06:06:04,878 --> 06:06:05,600
and

9238
06:06:05,600 --> 06:06:09,520
you simply can't access it

9239
06:06:09,520 --> 06:06:14,400
or the last one human life at risk

9240
06:06:15,760 --> 06:06:19,120
in my industry human life is at risk if

9241
06:06:19,120 --> 06:06:20,878
the system development life cycle

9242
06:06:20,878 --> 06:06:22,718
doesn't go well

9243
06:06:22,718 --> 06:06:24,480
it's like in the telecommunications

9244
06:06:24,480 --> 06:06:27,040
sector on the cyber security space in

9245
06:06:27,040 --> 06:06:30,878
the aviation industry for example

9246
06:06:32,000 --> 06:06:33,600
now we're going to be

9247
06:06:33,600 --> 06:06:35,680
talking about industry-based examples

9248
06:06:35,680 --> 06:06:37,120
and the first one

9249
06:06:37,120 --> 06:06:40,000
we have user experience design

9250
06:06:40,000 --> 06:06:42,160
when the developer believes is making a

9251
06:06:42,160 --> 06:06:45,200
simple intuitive ui

9252
06:06:45,200 --> 06:06:49,120
platform and how the users are consuming

9253
06:06:49,120 --> 06:06:50,958
or using it here we go

9254
06:06:50,958 --> 06:06:52,400
so

9255
06:06:52,400 --> 06:06:54,240
what i wanted to have like here is the

9256
06:06:54,240 --> 06:06:57,200
existence of human error is always

9257
06:06:57,200 --> 06:06:58,480
prevalent

9258
06:06:58,480 --> 06:07:01,440
but it's not about eliminating it but

9259
06:07:01,440 --> 06:07:05,040
reducing it

9260
06:07:05,040 --> 06:07:07,200
the next example

9261
06:07:07,200 --> 06:07:08,080
is

9262
06:07:08,080 --> 06:07:12,320
about expensive market loss

9263
06:07:12,320 --> 06:07:14,480
and what i'm going to be talking about

9264
06:07:14,480 --> 06:07:15,920
is

9265
06:07:15,920 --> 06:07:17,280
the online

9266
06:07:17,280 --> 06:07:18,400
banking

9267
06:07:18,400 --> 06:07:21,040
this is about banking industry

9268
06:07:21,040 --> 06:07:24,240
and cryptographic

9269
06:07:24,638 --> 06:07:27,920
communications so we now

9270
06:07:27,920 --> 06:07:31,120
access online banking to our laptops

9271
06:07:31,120 --> 06:07:33,920
mobile devices or ipads

9272
06:07:33,920 --> 06:07:36,000
this is called encrypted communications

9273
06:07:36,000 --> 06:07:37,680
as we all know it

9274
06:07:37,680 --> 06:07:39,600
and that's the way now moving forward in

9275
06:07:39,600 --> 06:07:40,798
this world

9276
06:07:40,798 --> 06:07:44,878
and this is enabled by pki framework in

9277
06:07:44,878 --> 06:07:46,798
which we have a certificate

9278
06:07:46,798 --> 06:07:49,920
and a key pair

9279
06:07:49,920 --> 06:07:53,040
so the next slide is about the process

9280
06:07:53,040 --> 06:07:54,958
of how we

9281
06:07:54,958 --> 06:07:57,200
doing this certificate update process at

9282
06:07:57,200 --> 06:07:58,400
the

9283
06:07:58,400 --> 06:08:02,240
organization oh this is in the bank

9284
06:08:02,240 --> 06:08:03,680
we have our

9285
06:08:03,680 --> 06:08:06,160
angels are mobile devices where we have

9286
06:08:06,160 --> 06:08:08,638
the certificate and public key loaded

9287
06:08:08,638 --> 06:08:09,760
onto them

9288
06:08:09,760 --> 06:08:12,558
we are doing a web browser connection

9289
06:08:12,558 --> 06:08:16,240
that enables the tls

9290
06:08:16,558 --> 06:08:18,480
to do online banking

9291
06:08:18,480 --> 06:08:20,638
to access to the web server

9292
06:08:20,638 --> 06:08:22,080
in the bank

9293
06:08:22,080 --> 06:08:23,920
in the web server we have the private

9294
06:08:23,920 --> 06:08:26,958
key and the certificate

9295
06:08:26,958 --> 06:08:29,440
for certificates we have a certificate

9296
06:08:29,440 --> 06:08:31,760
authority that issues these certificates

9297
06:08:31,760 --> 06:08:35,359
and authenticates the keys

9298
06:08:39,200 --> 06:08:40,480
in the bank

9299
06:08:40,480 --> 06:08:42,958
or in the enterprise in this case the

9300
06:08:42,958 --> 06:08:45,920
way to manage certificates of keys there

9301
06:08:45,920 --> 06:08:48,558
is a monitoring system

9302
06:08:48,558 --> 06:08:50,558
which does that

9303
06:08:50,558 --> 06:08:54,000
but this monitoring system doesn't work

9304
06:08:54,000 --> 06:08:58,240
or functions on its own it needs

9305
06:08:58,240 --> 06:09:00,320
user input

9306
06:09:00,320 --> 06:09:02,080
and what i'm going to show you next is

9307
06:09:02,080 --> 06:09:03,760
what happens

9308
06:09:03,760 --> 06:09:05,360
is something goes wrong in the

9309
06:09:05,360 --> 06:09:07,520
monitoring system

9310
06:09:07,520 --> 06:09:10,000
and the example is the certificate that

9311
06:09:10,000 --> 06:09:12,240
the certificate authority

9312
06:09:12,240 --> 06:09:13,280
issues

9313
06:09:13,280 --> 06:09:15,280
has expiry date

9314
06:09:15,280 --> 06:09:18,718
and this example is the certificate

9315
06:09:18,718 --> 06:09:21,120
has expired

9316
06:09:21,120 --> 06:09:24,080
and it has a change reaction

9317
06:09:24,080 --> 06:09:26,798
obviously the certificate authority

9318
06:09:26,798 --> 06:09:29,040
wasn't notified to issue

9319
06:09:29,040 --> 06:09:31,920
a new certificate wasn't told to do so

9320
06:09:31,920 --> 06:09:34,638
it's no other job to do the monitoring

9321
06:09:34,638 --> 06:09:37,040
part of it

9322
06:09:37,040 --> 06:09:39,920
but the certificate is expired and

9323
06:09:39,920 --> 06:09:44,000
therefore it stops working

9324
06:09:46,160 --> 06:09:47,600
and therefore

9325
06:09:47,600 --> 06:09:50,558
in the web server is aspire and

9326
06:09:50,558 --> 06:09:51,600
in the end

9327
06:09:51,600 --> 06:09:54,798
on your devices and you can connect and

9328
06:09:54,798 --> 06:09:57,440
do online banking

9329
06:09:57,440 --> 06:09:59,680
and here we go we are familiar maybe

9330
06:09:59,680 --> 06:10:02,400
with this message that yes you could

9331
06:10:02,400 --> 06:10:04,240
proceed probably at your own risk you

9332
06:10:04,240 --> 06:10:05,920
will be able to connect to the online

9333
06:10:05,920 --> 06:10:08,878
banking but that doesn't assure you that

9334
06:10:08,878 --> 06:10:12,000
this connection will be secure

9335
06:10:12,000 --> 06:10:13,360
and i'm going to be talking about this

9336
06:10:13,360 --> 06:10:16,558
example in my next slide

9337
06:10:16,558 --> 06:10:19,360
but the responsibilities of the end user

9338
06:10:19,360 --> 06:10:21,120
and it shouldn't be because you're you

9339
06:10:21,120 --> 06:10:23,200
can be compromised so your data can be

9340
06:10:23,200 --> 06:10:25,680
exposed

9341
06:10:26,000 --> 06:10:28,080
this next example is about human life at

9342
06:10:28,080 --> 06:10:30,000
risk

9343
06:10:30,000 --> 06:10:32,000
it's a short video that are going it's

9344
06:10:32,000 --> 06:10:34,080
going to give you a bit of more context

9345
06:10:34,080 --> 06:10:36,878
of the importance of implementing or

9346
06:10:36,878 --> 06:10:38,798
having into consideration the human

9347
06:10:38,798 --> 06:10:40,480
factor engineering

9348
06:10:40,480 --> 06:10:43,040
where error in the system design can be

9349
06:10:43,040 --> 06:10:44,638
catastrophic

9350
06:10:44,638 --> 06:10:48,680
i hope you enjoyed this video

9351
06:10:51,680 --> 06:10:53,280
the two biggest airplane manufacturers

9352
06:10:53,280 --> 06:10:55,200
in the world are airbus and boeing and

9353
06:10:55,200 --> 06:10:57,040
they have a fierce rivalry

9354
06:10:57,040 --> 06:11:01,320
if one of them can offer a better plane

9355
06:11:02,878 --> 06:11:05,200
the other could lose a lot of money

9356
06:11:05,200 --> 06:11:06,798
that's exactly what was about to happen

9357
06:11:06,798 --> 06:11:08,160
in 2010

9358
06:11:08,160 --> 06:11:09,440
airbus announced that they would update

9359
06:11:09,440 --> 06:11:11,440
their most popular model

9360
06:11:11,440 --> 06:11:13,920
the eighth

9361
06:11:17,360 --> 06:11:19,680
320 a single aisle airplane that

9362
06:11:19,680 --> 06:11:21,680
services many domestic flights you've

9363
06:11:21,680 --> 06:11:24,480
probably been on one

9364
06:11:24,558 --> 06:11:26,400
for this new plane airbus had a big

9365
06:11:26,400 --> 06:11:28,840
update it would have a new kind of

9366
06:11:28,840 --> 06:11:31,120
engine it was much larger than the

9367
06:11:31,120 --> 06:11:32,798
previous engine but it would make the

9368
06:11:32,798 --> 06:11:35,440
plane 15 more fuel efficient

9369
06:11:35,440 --> 06:11:37,440
and just as importantly this upgrade

9370
06:11:37,440 --> 06:11:39,360
wouldn't change the plane that much

9371
06:11:39,360 --> 06:11:40,958
a pilot could walk into the new model

9372
06:11:40,958 --> 06:11:42,718
with little additional training and be

9373
06:11:42,718 --> 06:11:44,638
on their way

9374
06:11:44,638 --> 06:11:47,120
it was called the a320 neo and it would

9375
06:11:47,120 --> 06:11:50,320
save airlines a lot of money

9376
06:11:50,320 --> 06:11:51,730
this was a problem for boeing

9377
06:11:51,730 --> 06:11:53,120
[Music]

9378
06:11:53,120 --> 06:11:55,040
to compete with airbus boeing's obvious

9379
06:11:55,040 --> 06:11:56,798
move was to upgrade the engine on their

9380
06:11:56,798 --> 06:11:59,680
single aisle plane the 737 but there is

9381
06:11:59,680 --> 06:12:01,120
one issue

9382
06:12:01,120 --> 06:12:03,280
here's a sketch of the 737 next to the

9383
06:12:03,280 --> 06:12:06,000
airbus a320

9384
06:12:06,000 --> 06:12:08,080
notice how the 737 is lowered to the

9385
06:12:08,080 --> 06:12:10,080
ground than the a320

9386
06:12:10,080 --> 06:12:11,840
this man airbus could slide a new engine

9387
06:12:11,840 --> 06:12:14,638
under the wing of their a320

9388
06:12:14,638 --> 06:12:16,080
but there wasn't enough room under the

9389
06:12:16,080 --> 06:12:18,878
wing of the boeing 737

9390
06:12:18,878 --> 06:12:20,878
but a few months later boeing's product

9391
06:12:20,878 --> 06:12:23,680
development head had big news

9392
06:12:23,680 --> 06:12:26,160
he said we figured out a way to get a

9393
06:12:26,160 --> 06:12:29,520
big enough engine under the wing

9394
06:12:30,000 --> 06:12:32,320
their solution was to move up the engine

9395
06:12:32,320 --> 06:12:34,240
on the wing so that it would be slightly

9396
06:12:34,240 --> 06:12:37,920
higher and it would fit on their 737s

9397
06:12:37,920 --> 06:12:39,360
here's a promotional video of that

9398
06:12:39,360 --> 06:12:41,520
updated 737 in the air

9399
06:12:41,520 --> 06:12:43,040
you can actually see that the top of the

9400
06:12:43,040 --> 06:12:45,440
engine is above the wing

9401
06:12:45,440 --> 06:12:49,360
boeing called this model the 737 max

9402
06:12:49,360 --> 06:12:51,360
and just like airbus with the a320

9403
06:12:51,360 --> 06:12:53,120
boeing said that their new plane was so

9404
06:12:53,120 --> 06:12:54,798
similar to its predecessor that pilots

9405
06:12:54,798 --> 06:12:56,320
would only need minimal additional

9406
06:12:56,320 --> 06:12:58,718
training

9407
06:12:58,798 --> 06:13:01,360
the 737 max became the hottest selling

9408
06:13:01,360 --> 06:13:03,520
plane on the market

9409
06:13:03,520 --> 06:13:06,958
and it helped bowen keep up with airbus

9410
06:13:06,958 --> 06:13:10,000
except moving the engine up on the 737

9411
06:13:10,000 --> 06:13:11,920
had a side effect

9412
06:13:11,920 --> 06:13:14,718
when the 737 max was in full thrust like

9413
06:13:14,718 --> 06:13:16,958
during takeoff the nose tended to point

9414
06:13:16,958 --> 06:13:18,638
too far upward which could lead to a

9415
06:13:18,638 --> 06:13:19,760
stall

9416
06:13:19,760 --> 06:13:21,920
this was a problem because these planes

9417
06:13:21,920 --> 06:13:23,600
were supposed to behave exactly like the

9418
06:13:23,600 --> 06:13:24,718
old ones

9419
06:13:24,718 --> 06:13:27,520
so boeing came up with a workaround

9420
06:13:27,520 --> 06:13:29,520
instead of re-engineering the planes

9421
06:13:29,520 --> 06:13:31,200
they installed software that

9422
06:13:31,200 --> 06:13:32,958
automatically pushed the nose downward

9423
06:13:32,958 --> 06:13:34,638
if the pilot flew the plane at too high

9424
06:13:34,638 --> 06:13:36,798
of an angle

9425
06:13:36,798 --> 06:13:38,080
they called it the maneuvering

9426
06:13:38,080 --> 06:13:40,798
characteristics augmentation system

9427
06:13:40,798 --> 06:13:43,360
or mcas

9428
06:13:43,360 --> 06:13:45,600
but because boeing was selling the 737

9429
06:13:45,600 --> 06:13:47,680
max as pretty much the same plane as the

9430
06:13:47,680 --> 06:13:50,240
737 they didn't highlight the new mcas

9431
06:13:50,240 --> 06:13:51,680
system

9432
06:13:51,680 --> 06:13:53,920
many pilots only got a two hour ipad

9433
06:13:53,920 --> 06:13:55,520
course before entering the cockpit for

9434
06:13:55,520 --> 06:13:57,200
the first time

9435
06:13:57,200 --> 06:13:59,360
and the training material didn't mention

9436
06:13:59,360 --> 06:14:02,160
the mcas software

9437
06:14:02,160 --> 06:14:04,400
in 2018 several american pilots

9438
06:14:04,400 --> 06:14:05,760
complained to the federal government

9439
06:14:05,760 --> 06:14:08,480
that the 737 max was suddenly nosing

9440
06:14:08,480 --> 06:14:10,638
down

9441
06:14:10,638 --> 06:14:15,040
on october 29th 2018 lion air flight 610

9442
06:14:15,040 --> 06:14:17,680
took off from jakarta

9443
06:14:17,680 --> 06:14:19,040
in the flight report which shows the

9444
06:14:19,040 --> 06:14:21,040
plane's altitude over time you can see

9445
06:14:21,040 --> 06:14:22,958
that the plane was in full thrust during

9446
06:14:22,958 --> 06:14:24,718
takeoff

9447
06:14:24,718 --> 06:14:26,718
but at a certain point the nose of the

9448
06:14:26,718 --> 06:14:30,160
plane kept lurching downward

9449
06:14:30,160 --> 06:14:31,680
the pilots couldn't figure out why this

9450
06:14:31,680 --> 06:14:33,520
was happening the captain asked the

9451
06:14:33,520 --> 06:14:34,878
first officer to check the quick

9452
06:14:34,878 --> 06:14:36,320
reference handbook

9453
06:14:36,320 --> 06:14:38,080
they couldn't find the solution the

9454
06:14:38,080 --> 06:14:40,480
pilots continued to fight with the mcas

9455
06:14:40,480 --> 06:14:44,000
the plane struggled to gain altitude

9456
06:14:44,000 --> 06:14:45,840
reports show it was likely because the

9457
06:14:45,840 --> 06:14:47,520
computer was getting incorrect sensor

9458
06:14:47,520 --> 06:14:49,520
data pushing the plane toward the earth

9459
06:14:49,520 --> 06:14:51,040
below

9460
06:14:51,040 --> 06:14:53,440
12 minutes after takeoff

9461
06:14:53,440 --> 06:14:58,359
the plane crashed into the java sea

9462
06:14:59,220 --> 06:15:00,878
[Music]

9463
06:15:00,878 --> 06:15:03,280
and this is just a short video

9464
06:15:03,280 --> 06:15:04,878
hopefully

9465
06:15:04,878 --> 06:15:07,520
it wasn't too boring for you but what i

9466
06:15:07,520 --> 06:15:09,360
just going to mention that there was

9467
06:15:09,360 --> 06:15:11,040
another accident

9468
06:15:11,040 --> 06:15:15,200
another airplane crash and in total 346

9469
06:15:15,200 --> 06:15:16,958
people perish

9470
06:15:16,958 --> 06:15:19,040
and this could happen when human factor

9471
06:15:19,040 --> 06:15:21,680
engineering isn't considered in the

9472
06:15:21,680 --> 06:15:24,000
system design

9473
06:15:24,000 --> 06:15:26,878
there was another

9474
06:15:26,878 --> 06:15:30,000
airplane crash in china not sure if you

9475
06:15:30,000 --> 06:15:32,240
have heard about it but it happened on

9476
06:15:32,240 --> 06:15:34,400
the 21st of march

9477
06:15:34,400 --> 06:15:36,878
in a domestic flight in china and it

9478
06:15:36,878 --> 06:15:38,240
happens to be

9479
06:15:38,240 --> 06:15:41,798
avoiding 737

9480
06:15:42,480 --> 06:15:44,958
the black boxes have been found but we

9481
06:15:44,958 --> 06:15:47,280
don't know yet the investigations are

9482
06:15:47,280 --> 06:15:49,840
outcomes but i'll be very interested to

9483
06:15:49,840 --> 06:15:52,480
know what happened if it was human error

9484
06:15:52,480 --> 06:15:56,320
or system error in this case

9485
06:15:56,320 --> 06:15:58,000
i'll leave to you for your own

9486
06:15:58,000 --> 06:15:59,680
conclusions

9487
06:15:59,680 --> 06:16:01,360
but i'm going to talk about your biggest

9488
06:16:01,360 --> 06:16:03,680
airplane manufacturers in the world

9489
06:16:03,680 --> 06:16:06,480
next one this is my back story i wanted

9490
06:16:06,480 --> 06:16:09,280
to talk to you about a bit about myself

9491
06:16:09,280 --> 06:16:11,280
and why i got interested about human

9492
06:16:11,280 --> 06:16:12,798
factory engineering

9493
06:16:12,798 --> 06:16:15,760
i am from peru and i work in the it

9494
06:16:15,760 --> 06:16:18,160
industry or telecommunications industry

9495
06:16:18,160 --> 06:16:21,680
pretty much in peru colombia panama

9496
06:16:21,680 --> 06:16:22,798
chile

9497
06:16:22,798 --> 06:16:24,798
and in other little cities in south

9498
06:16:24,798 --> 06:16:26,480
america

9499
06:16:26,480 --> 06:16:27,798
and in

9500
06:16:27,798 --> 06:16:30,798
2010 i graduated

9501
06:16:30,798 --> 06:16:34,240
i have my mba done sorry that's the only

9502
06:16:34,240 --> 06:16:35,680
photo i have

9503
06:16:35,680 --> 06:16:38,878
um kind of got rid of my body my bestie

9504
06:16:38,878 --> 06:16:40,798
there but i thought the only photo i

9505
06:16:40,798 --> 06:16:43,040
have i was so ready to take the work and

9506
06:16:43,040 --> 06:16:45,200
i got very interested about business in

9507
06:16:45,200 --> 06:16:46,958
the business area of things

9508
06:16:46,958 --> 06:16:48,878
which helped me to

9509
06:16:48,878 --> 06:16:51,440
integrate human factor in everything

9510
06:16:51,440 --> 06:16:54,160
that i do when it comes to technology

9511
06:16:54,160 --> 06:16:58,240
and in the same year i came to australia

9512
06:16:58,240 --> 06:17:00,480
i started working

9513
06:17:00,480 --> 06:17:02,558
in the academia

9514
06:17:02,558 --> 06:17:04,638
first and then i'm in

9515
06:17:04,638 --> 06:17:06,400
it back again

9516
06:17:06,400 --> 06:17:09,520
but what happened is um

9517
06:17:09,520 --> 06:17:12,080
between

9518
06:17:12,240 --> 06:17:15,680
peru and australia

9519
06:17:15,680 --> 06:17:18,798
i made such a big change or transition

9520
06:17:18,798 --> 06:17:20,480
between culture

9521
06:17:20,480 --> 06:17:22,558
languages

9522
06:17:22,558 --> 06:17:23,280
and

9523
06:17:23,280 --> 06:17:24,798
industries

9524
06:17:24,798 --> 06:17:26,958
at the same time all together

9525
06:17:26,958 --> 06:17:30,000
but i'm still here in australia which i

9526
06:17:30,000 --> 06:17:31,920
love this country by the way especially

9527
06:17:31,920 --> 06:17:32,958
canberra

9528
06:17:32,958 --> 06:17:34,718
and online

9529
06:17:34,718 --> 06:17:36,798
but what happens is there's a common

9530
06:17:36,798 --> 06:17:39,360
thing keep going to my photo pack sorry

9531
06:17:39,360 --> 06:17:40,798
between peru

9532
06:17:40,798 --> 06:17:43,360
and australia i'm working in in these

9533
06:17:43,360 --> 06:17:46,000
industries you're working with people

9534
06:17:46,000 --> 06:17:46,878
it's

9535
06:17:46,878 --> 06:17:48,638
that's a common thing just there's just

9536
06:17:48,638 --> 06:17:50,878
people and they use your

9537
06:17:50,878 --> 06:17:53,520
products they use your systems and you

9538
06:17:53,520 --> 06:17:56,718
work with developers engineers project

9539
06:17:56,718 --> 06:18:00,000
managers senior executive staff

9540
06:18:00,000 --> 06:18:03,600
etc and they're just just people and we

9541
06:18:03,600 --> 06:18:07,760
as humans we are full of imagination

9542
06:18:07,760 --> 06:18:11,040
we have cognition we have emotion when

9543
06:18:11,040 --> 06:18:14,480
we interact interacting with technology

9544
06:18:14,480 --> 06:18:16,718
and with human factor engineering i know

9545
06:18:16,718 --> 06:18:19,200
asking you to become a psychologist is

9546
06:18:19,200 --> 06:18:21,520
just to have into consideration this

9547
06:18:21,520 --> 06:18:24,400
human factor

9548
06:18:25,760 --> 06:18:29,440
in 2018 i finished a master's degree in

9549
06:18:29,440 --> 06:18:31,120
systems engineer

9550
06:18:31,120 --> 06:18:33,040
that has been part of my introduction i

9551
06:18:33,040 --> 06:18:35,440
also i'm certified in conci

9552
06:18:35,440 --> 06:18:38,480
associate systems engineer

9553
06:18:38,480 --> 06:18:39,520
where we

9554
06:18:39,520 --> 06:18:41,040
i got so passionate about systems

9555
06:18:41,040 --> 06:18:42,240
engineering

9556
06:18:42,240 --> 06:18:44,000
because it's a

9557
06:18:44,000 --> 06:18:46,400
whole concept methodology where you

9558
06:18:46,400 --> 06:18:48,958
start talking or

9559
06:18:48,958 --> 06:18:51,520
applying from cradle to grave when

9560
06:18:51,520 --> 06:18:52,878
you're developing

9561
06:18:52,878 --> 06:18:55,360
systems

9562
06:18:55,360 --> 06:18:58,240
and the next one i'm going to show you

9563
06:18:58,240 --> 06:19:00,000
next is about what is factory

9564
06:19:00,000 --> 06:19:02,638
engineering finally

9565
06:19:02,638 --> 06:19:06,400
and this focuses on how systems work in

9566
06:19:06,400 --> 06:19:09,520
actual practice with real and fallible

9567
06:19:09,520 --> 06:19:12,400
human beings at the controls and

9568
06:19:12,400 --> 06:19:14,798
attempts to design systems

9569
06:19:14,798 --> 06:19:17,680
that optimize safety and minimize the

9570
06:19:17,680 --> 06:19:22,958
risk of error in complex environments

9571
06:19:23,120 --> 06:19:26,240
human factor engineering focuses on four

9572
06:19:26,240 --> 06:19:29,520
areas one is the cognitive

9573
06:19:29,520 --> 06:19:33,760
sensory physical and theme dynamic

9574
06:19:33,760 --> 06:19:36,400
the first one we got cognitive relates

9575
06:19:36,400 --> 06:19:39,120
to knowledge memory thinking

9576
06:19:39,120 --> 06:19:42,160
reasoning behavior and judgment

9577
06:19:42,160 --> 06:19:44,478
and going back to my example with boeing

9578
06:19:44,478 --> 06:19:46,080
737

9579
06:19:46,080 --> 06:19:48,638
these pilots knew how to flight they

9580
06:19:48,638 --> 06:19:50,958
have a number of hours

9581
06:19:50,958 --> 06:19:52,478
of flight there is a requirement to

9582
06:19:52,478 --> 06:19:55,200
become a pilot they were familiar with

9583
06:19:55,200 --> 06:19:57,360
the instruments in the aircraft

9584
06:19:57,360 --> 06:19:59,680
basically they know they knew how to

9585
06:19:59,680 --> 06:20:01,680
flight

9586
06:20:01,680 --> 06:20:04,400
my other example the certificate update

9587
06:20:04,400 --> 06:20:06,400
the administrator of the web server

9588
06:20:06,400 --> 06:20:09,040
knows how to use the monitoring system

9589
06:20:09,040 --> 06:20:10,638
and is familiar with it because it

9590
06:20:10,638 --> 06:20:13,040
requires its input and the monitoring

9591
06:20:13,040 --> 06:20:15,680
system will do what is pretty much told

9592
06:20:15,680 --> 06:20:18,240
what to do

9593
06:20:19,600 --> 06:20:22,160
the physical the physical one relates to

9594
06:20:22,160 --> 06:20:24,638
identifying physical action

9595
06:20:24,638 --> 06:20:27,040
and also identifying any impairments

9596
06:20:27,040 --> 06:20:30,718
like hearing visual physical etc

9597
06:20:30,718 --> 06:20:32,478
and i wanted to go back to the first

9598
06:20:32,478 --> 06:20:34,958
example when you opening doors

9599
06:20:34,958 --> 06:20:37,920
and instead of being required to even

9600
06:20:37,920 --> 06:20:39,600
knowing what the action is required for

9601
06:20:39,600 --> 06:20:40,798
you from you

9602
06:20:40,798 --> 06:20:42,400
you actually try to push and this

9603
06:20:42,400 --> 06:20:44,478
happens many times and it has happened

9604
06:20:44,478 --> 06:20:45,360
to me

9605
06:20:45,360 --> 06:20:47,920
it's clearly that you evidently that you

9606
06:20:47,920 --> 06:20:50,478
know what to do but it

9607
06:20:50,478 --> 06:20:52,240
comes naturally

9608
06:20:52,240 --> 06:20:53,680
to just push

9609
06:20:53,680 --> 06:20:56,000
instead of pulling

9610
06:20:56,000 --> 06:20:59,200
with a 737

9611
06:20:59,360 --> 06:21:03,280
max example is the pilots

9612
06:21:03,280 --> 06:21:05,360
flying the aircraft

9613
06:21:05,360 --> 06:21:07,920
noticing that they're losing altitude

9614
06:21:07,920 --> 06:21:09,200
they continue

9615
06:21:09,200 --> 06:21:11,200
pulling

9616
06:21:11,200 --> 06:21:12,080
their

9617
06:21:12,080 --> 06:21:13,040
wheel

9618
06:21:13,040 --> 06:21:15,680
and the more they were pulling up to try

9619
06:21:15,680 --> 06:21:17,600
to keep altitude

9620
06:21:17,600 --> 06:21:20,718
the more the aircraft was nosing down

9621
06:21:20,718 --> 06:21:23,840
and clears the tragedy

9622
06:21:23,840 --> 06:21:26,478
when it comes to sensory this relates to

9623
06:21:26,478 --> 06:21:28,718
words of phrases that connect to the

9624
06:21:28,718 --> 06:21:31,600
five senses that describe how something

9625
06:21:31,600 --> 06:21:36,240
looks smells tastes feels or sounds

9626
06:21:36,240 --> 06:21:39,120
back to my example again in the air

9627
06:21:39,120 --> 06:21:41,440
the pilots were able to see evidently on

9628
06:21:41,440 --> 06:21:43,280
the instruments they're losing altitude

9629
06:21:43,280 --> 06:21:45,120
and there was a warning there and they

9630
06:21:45,120 --> 06:21:48,160
were trying to fix to find a solution

9631
06:21:48,160 --> 06:21:51,440
but this software called mcas in in the

9632
06:21:51,440 --> 06:21:53,280
video you might remember

9633
06:21:53,280 --> 06:21:54,958
wasn't highlighted

9634
06:21:54,958 --> 06:21:57,920
they didn't actually know that this new

9635
06:21:57,920 --> 06:22:00,400
software existed

9636
06:22:00,400 --> 06:22:02,320
so there was no description of what they

9637
06:22:02,320 --> 06:22:05,280
needed to do eventually they realized

9638
06:22:05,280 --> 06:22:08,160
that it was a simple turn off

9639
06:22:08,160 --> 06:22:12,320
of disabled function for encase to stop

9640
06:22:12,320 --> 06:22:15,680
bringing the airplane down

9641
06:22:15,680 --> 06:22:17,280
thing dynamics

9642
06:22:17,280 --> 06:22:19,520
this is the last one relates to how

9643
06:22:19,520 --> 06:22:22,320
people work together and share purpose

9644
06:22:22,320 --> 06:22:26,840
values trust openness accountability

9645
06:22:26,840 --> 06:22:31,760
ownership communication etc

9646
06:22:31,760 --> 06:22:33,280
when you are in this situation you're

9647
06:22:33,280 --> 06:22:36,160
working as a team you lean on each other

9648
06:22:36,160 --> 06:22:37,920
you have um

9649
06:22:37,920 --> 06:22:41,360
definitely a skill to to work as a team

9650
06:22:41,360 --> 06:22:43,680
and when i started doing my research of

9651
06:22:43,680 --> 06:22:47,440
this case study for boeing 737

9652
06:22:47,440 --> 06:22:48,718
these two

9653
06:22:48,718 --> 06:22:49,600
air

9654
06:22:49,600 --> 06:22:51,600
airplane crashes that happened in the

9655
06:22:51,600 --> 06:22:54,958
past the last one was 2018.

9656
06:22:54,958 --> 06:22:57,760
they were able to find that the pilots

9657
06:22:57,760 --> 06:22:59,680
trying to solve the issue and they were

9658
06:22:59,680 --> 06:23:01,280
discussing and in the end they found the

9659
06:23:01,280 --> 06:23:04,080
solution just to disable the mcas but it

9660
06:23:04,080 --> 06:23:06,320
was too late because they only had 10

9661
06:23:06,320 --> 06:23:09,520
seconds to turn and cast off but

9662
06:23:09,520 --> 06:23:11,600
unfortunately was

9663
06:23:11,600 --> 06:23:13,920
linked

9664
06:23:16,000 --> 06:23:18,558
with the certificate update

9665
06:23:18,558 --> 06:23:21,280
it requires an input user input from the

9666
06:23:21,280 --> 06:23:22,638
administrator

9667
06:23:22,638 --> 06:23:23,680
but

9668
06:23:23,680 --> 06:23:26,080
the monitoring system

9669
06:23:26,080 --> 06:23:27,200
didn't

9670
06:23:27,200 --> 06:23:29,200
let the administrator know when the

9671
06:23:29,200 --> 06:23:31,600
certificates were about to expire

9672
06:23:31,600 --> 06:23:33,920
so perhaps we have an enhanced feature

9673
06:23:33,920 --> 06:23:36,400
or a reminder to be added into this

9674
06:23:36,400 --> 06:23:37,600
system

9675
06:23:37,600 --> 06:23:38,798
sometimes

9676
06:23:38,798 --> 06:23:41,360
these technical solutions can be put in

9677
06:23:41,360 --> 06:23:43,760
place otherwise there must be a

9678
06:23:43,760 --> 06:23:47,200
procedural control like a manager

9679
06:23:47,200 --> 06:23:49,440
to work together with administrator

9680
06:23:49,440 --> 06:23:50,840
to

9681
06:23:50,840 --> 06:23:53,760
oversee this process

9682
06:23:53,760 --> 06:23:56,399
and avoid

9683
06:23:56,638 --> 06:23:59,440
the issue that they happen with with a

9684
06:23:59,440 --> 06:24:02,798
certificate's update process

9685
06:24:02,798 --> 06:24:04,400
the next one is just

9686
06:24:04,400 --> 06:24:07,360
a message that i wanted to share with

9687
06:24:07,360 --> 06:24:08,400
you

9688
06:24:08,400 --> 06:24:11,040
as as a systems engineer

9689
06:24:11,040 --> 06:24:14,000
is when engineers or designers or in

9690
06:24:14,000 --> 06:24:16,080
this case developers of many of you here

9691
06:24:16,080 --> 06:24:17,360
probably

9692
06:24:17,360 --> 06:24:19,280
need to focus their attention on the

9693
06:24:19,280 --> 06:24:21,920
cases where things go wrong not just

9694
06:24:21,920 --> 06:24:24,400
when things work as planned

9695
06:24:24,400 --> 06:24:26,080
and there's always a debate between

9696
06:24:26,080 --> 06:24:30,000
human or system error

9697
06:24:30,878 --> 06:24:32,160
i'm going to show you some of the

9698
06:24:32,160 --> 06:24:35,280
benefits of human factor engineering if

9699
06:24:35,280 --> 06:24:37,440
you are willing to

9700
06:24:37,440 --> 06:24:39,600
take on these suggestions this is only

9701
06:24:39,600 --> 06:24:42,000
my suggestions

9702
06:24:42,000 --> 06:24:43,760
and how to implement

9703
06:24:43,760 --> 06:24:45,920
human factor engineering

9704
06:24:45,920 --> 06:24:48,400
the first one we're talking about

9705
06:24:48,400 --> 06:24:51,120
empathize

9706
06:24:51,200 --> 06:24:52,798
is a hard thing to do

9707
06:24:52,798 --> 06:24:55,040
but try to put yourself into the user's

9708
06:24:55,040 --> 06:24:56,160
shoes

9709
06:24:56,160 --> 06:24:57,360
who are they

9710
06:24:57,360 --> 06:24:59,040
what do they need

9711
06:24:59,040 --> 06:25:00,718
what do they want

9712
06:25:00,718 --> 06:25:03,200
what roles and processes they deal with

9713
06:25:03,200 --> 06:25:05,440
on a daily basis

9714
06:25:05,440 --> 06:25:07,440
let's try to put into consideration

9715
06:25:07,440 --> 06:25:09,120
those cognitive

9716
06:25:09,120 --> 06:25:11,440
sensory thermodynamics

9717
06:25:11,440 --> 06:25:12,558
areas

9718
06:25:12,558 --> 06:25:14,840
at this first step

9719
06:25:14,840 --> 06:25:17,760
and it's part of the concept

9720
06:25:17,760 --> 06:25:19,920
learning about your audience

9721
06:25:19,920 --> 06:25:22,558
the second one is the analysis probably

9722
06:25:22,558 --> 06:25:24,878
you will have user requirements here

9723
06:25:24,878 --> 06:25:27,040
create a point of view that is based on

9724
06:25:27,040 --> 06:25:30,798
user needs so spend time in identifying

9725
06:25:30,798 --> 06:25:33,200
what is the problem

9726
06:25:33,200 --> 06:25:35,280
what are we trying to solve here instead

9727
06:25:35,280 --> 06:25:40,000
of coming up quickly to solutions

9728
06:25:40,240 --> 06:25:42,718
the third one is edate is designed

9729
06:25:42,718 --> 06:25:45,360
developed or brainstorm and come up with

9730
06:25:45,360 --> 06:25:48,320
as many creative solutions as possible

9731
06:25:48,320 --> 06:25:50,558
probably a constraint attached to this

9732
06:25:50,558 --> 06:25:53,600
one with budget time resources but

9733
06:25:53,600 --> 06:25:56,400
pretty sure it can be done

9734
06:25:56,400 --> 06:25:59,440
prototype this is the production

9735
06:25:59,440 --> 06:26:00,798
of a

9736
06:26:00,798 --> 06:26:02,718
physical factor of building a

9737
06:26:02,718 --> 06:26:04,718
representation of one or more of your

9738
06:26:04,718 --> 06:26:07,280
ideas to show others or show a

9739
06:26:07,280 --> 06:26:09,120
preliminary version of the solution that

9740
06:26:09,120 --> 06:26:11,200
you're putting together

9741
06:26:11,200 --> 06:26:13,680
and give it to your end users and see

9742
06:26:13,680 --> 06:26:15,040
how they interact

9743
06:26:15,040 --> 06:26:16,558
how they're using it and this is a

9744
06:26:16,558 --> 06:26:18,878
valuable feedback that you can have

9745
06:26:18,878 --> 06:26:21,360
which is part of the testing bit

9746
06:26:21,360 --> 06:26:23,920
and it's the utilization so you're

9747
06:26:23,920 --> 06:26:26,240
sharing your prototype and you will get

9748
06:26:26,240 --> 06:26:28,400
ideas you will get this feedback that

9749
06:26:28,400 --> 06:26:31,040
will be really valuable to implement in

9750
06:26:31,040 --> 06:26:33,040
your system design or improve

9751
06:26:33,040 --> 06:26:35,760
some areas in your system

9752
06:26:35,760 --> 06:26:37,760
and of course this is a iterative

9753
06:26:37,760 --> 06:26:40,080
process

9754
06:26:40,080 --> 06:26:43,280
so in in the end

9755
06:26:43,840 --> 06:26:45,360
you just

9756
06:26:45,360 --> 06:26:47,040
sorry

9757
06:26:47,040 --> 06:26:50,638
having a system that is fit for purpose

9758
06:26:50,638 --> 06:26:52,958
meets user requirements and is easy to

9759
06:26:52,958 --> 06:26:55,360
interact with

9760
06:26:55,360 --> 06:26:57,760
and will give you the actual actions

9761
06:26:57,760 --> 06:27:00,638
hatefully what the user needs to do

9762
06:27:00,638 --> 06:27:02,400
and it will be a happy

9763
06:27:02,400 --> 06:27:03,920
pretty much

9764
06:27:03,920 --> 06:27:05,680
user in the end

9765
06:27:05,680 --> 06:27:08,718
because we don't redesign humans we

9766
06:27:08,718 --> 06:27:10,638
redesign the system

9767
06:27:10,638 --> 06:27:13,360
within which humans work

9768
06:27:13,360 --> 06:27:16,000
and good design starts with an

9769
06:27:16,000 --> 06:27:19,360
understanding of people

9770
06:27:21,200 --> 06:27:22,638
and technology

9771
06:27:22,638 --> 06:27:24,958
good design requires good communication

9772
06:27:24,958 --> 06:27:27,120
especially from machine to person

9773
06:27:27,120 --> 06:27:29,440
indicating what actions are possible

9774
06:27:29,440 --> 06:27:31,440
what is happening and what is about to

9775
06:27:31,440 --> 06:27:34,440
happen

9776
06:27:37,120 --> 06:27:39,440
and this is me that's it thank you very

9777
06:27:39,440 --> 06:27:41,680
much

9778
06:27:42,958 --> 06:27:45,600
that was an amazing talk

9779
06:27:45,600 --> 06:27:47,680
oh thank you sorry about this

9780
06:27:47,680 --> 06:27:50,080
ugly chest no no no don't say sorry at

9781
06:27:50,080 --> 06:27:51,760
all it's it's entirely probably our

9782
06:27:51,760 --> 06:27:53,440
fault but honestly that was a really

9783
06:27:53,440 --> 06:27:56,400
good um talk um

9784
06:27:56,400 --> 06:27:58,638
one of the interesting things is and i

9785
06:27:58,638 --> 06:27:59,920
know shannon's got some thoughts on this

9786
06:27:59,920 --> 06:28:01,680
as well um

9787
06:28:01,680 --> 06:28:04,000
so my dad actually works as a system

9788
06:28:04,000 --> 06:28:05,680
safety engineer and the amount of

9789
06:28:05,680 --> 06:28:07,360
conversations we've had about cyber

9790
06:28:07,360 --> 06:28:09,600
security and considering sub-security on

9791
06:28:09,600 --> 06:28:11,200
its own versus safety and the

9792
06:28:11,200 --> 06:28:12,798
relationship between cyber security and

9793
06:28:12,798 --> 06:28:15,280
safety there are so many

9794
06:28:15,280 --> 06:28:17,040
linkages about considering them in the

9795
06:28:17,040 --> 06:28:19,120
same way that we should really just

9796
06:28:19,120 --> 06:28:20,798
treat cyber security as a safety problem

9797
06:28:20,798 --> 06:28:22,558
more than a you know a security problem

9798
06:28:22,558 --> 06:28:23,760
on its own

9799
06:28:23,760 --> 06:28:26,558
yes i agree

9800
06:28:26,558 --> 06:28:28,558
yeah thank you

9801
06:28:28,558 --> 06:28:30,958
yeah that was absolutely

9802
06:28:30,958 --> 06:28:32,798
slow down my great and i still can't do

9803
06:28:32,798 --> 06:28:35,440
it i'm sorry

9804
06:28:36,638 --> 06:28:38,160
um i recently watched there's a

9805
06:28:38,160 --> 06:28:39,840
documentary i think it's on netflix or

9806
06:28:39,840 --> 06:28:41,600
prime or something my partner likes

9807
06:28:41,600 --> 06:28:43,840
watching lots of documentaries on the on

9808
06:28:43,840 --> 06:28:45,680
the seven um

9809
06:28:45,680 --> 06:28:47,760
seven three seven max

9810
06:28:47,760 --> 06:28:49,920
yes questions

9811
06:28:49,920 --> 06:28:52,160
yes super fascinating been sort of

9812
06:28:52,160 --> 06:28:54,638
talking about this in the discord

9813
06:28:54,638 --> 06:28:55,440
um

9814
06:28:55,440 --> 06:28:57,040
and i watch it and yeah

9815
06:28:57,040 --> 06:28:59,120
yeah there are other issues underlying

9816
06:28:59,120 --> 06:29:01,440
about changing culture changing

9817
06:29:01,440 --> 06:29:04,080
priorities they got a more promitable

9818
06:29:04,080 --> 06:29:06,558
sort of focus uh in the end just not

9819
06:29:06,558 --> 06:29:08,798
caring much more about um

9820
06:29:08,798 --> 06:29:11,520
much about safety anymore or a good

9821
06:29:11,520 --> 06:29:13,680
quality manufacturing products for

9822
06:29:13,680 --> 06:29:15,280
example so yes i watched that

9823
06:29:15,280 --> 06:29:18,080
documentary as well i got fascinated and

9824
06:29:18,080 --> 06:29:20,240
a bit frustrated too

9825
06:29:20,240 --> 06:29:22,400
they just blamed the pilots and people

9826
06:29:22,400 --> 06:29:25,040
came out and because the pilot were the

9827
06:29:25,040 --> 06:29:26,718
first one was from indonesia who

9828
06:29:26,718 --> 06:29:28,400
actually trained in the us

9829
06:29:28,400 --> 06:29:30,958
but they're actually boeing and some

9830
06:29:30,958 --> 06:29:32,718
airline experts in the u.s came out and

9831
06:29:32,718 --> 06:29:34,400
said if this was in the u.s that would

9832
06:29:34,400 --> 06:29:36,638
never have happened that was prior to

9833
06:29:36,638 --> 06:29:38,718
when they found out what what had gone

9834
06:29:38,718 --> 06:29:39,440
on

9835
06:29:39,440 --> 06:29:41,440
it's a bit crazy where they just sort of

9836
06:29:41,440 --> 06:29:43,280
threw that at the

9837
06:29:43,280 --> 06:29:45,760
you know let's call the pilot the user

9838
06:29:45,760 --> 06:29:48,160
um it was user error at the time which

9839
06:29:48,160 --> 06:29:49,600
is a little bit you know it kind of

9840
06:29:49,600 --> 06:29:53,199
happens a lot mm-hmm

9841
06:29:53,600 --> 06:29:55,280
no i don't know the other thing i wanted

9842
06:29:55,280 --> 06:29:56,400
to point out

9843
06:29:56,400 --> 06:29:59,840
was you echoed it was alan i think that

9844
06:29:59,840 --> 06:30:00,718
said

9845
06:30:00,718 --> 06:30:02,878
if you can't open the door

9846
06:30:02,878 --> 06:30:04,958
then it's your fault not sorry if i

9847
06:30:04,958 --> 06:30:06,558
can't open the door and you've designed

9848
06:30:06,558 --> 06:30:09,520
a door then it's your fault not mine um

9849
06:30:09,520 --> 06:30:11,120
you talked about that too a little bit

9850
06:30:11,120 --> 06:30:13,440
if if the design is not created for

9851
06:30:13,440 --> 06:30:15,680
people to make you know for it for it to

9852
06:30:15,680 --> 06:30:18,160
be easy for people to use

9853
06:30:18,160 --> 06:30:20,320
then it's on the designer not really on

9854
06:30:20,320 --> 06:30:22,080
the user so

9855
06:30:22,080 --> 06:30:23,440
some really really good points that

9856
06:30:23,440 --> 06:30:25,200
you've brought up and a really great way

9857
06:30:25,200 --> 06:30:26,718
to

9858
06:30:26,718 --> 06:30:28,638
put those into context you know you know

9859
06:30:28,638 --> 06:30:30,718
really simple and everybody

9860
06:30:30,718 --> 06:30:31,920
knows that

9861
06:30:31,920 --> 06:30:34,080
push pull the uh midvale school of the

9862
06:30:34,080 --> 06:30:36,400
gifted

9863
06:30:36,400 --> 06:30:38,478
and lastly

9864
06:30:38,478 --> 06:30:40,878
i big props to you

9865
06:30:40,878 --> 06:30:42,878
for doing presentations in a second

9866
06:30:42,878 --> 06:30:43,840

thing to say

9904
06:32:08,638 --> 06:32:10,478

comedian um but we will move on to our

9910
06:32:18,878 --> 06:32:21,120
next speaker who i think everyone will

9911
06:32:21,120 --> 06:32:23,280
love hearing because they've tied in

9912
06:32:23,280 --> 06:32:24,958
their talk into harry potter which i

9913
06:32:24,958 --> 06:32:26,958
know the person sleeping on me next to

9914
06:32:26,958 --> 06:32:28,878
me was playing sleep

9915
06:32:28,878 --> 06:32:30,798
was playing lego harry potter about 30

9916
06:32:30,798 --> 06:32:31,920
seconds ago

9917
06:32:31,920 --> 06:32:36,079
so um let me bring in sarah

9918
06:32:36,160 --> 06:32:38,400

9919
06:32:38,400 --> 06:32:42,000
yeah not too bad not too bad

9920
06:32:42,000 --> 06:32:44,320
now sarah also is a first-time speaker

9921
06:32:44,320 --> 06:32:46,240
so i've just seen her like taking deep

9922
06:32:46,240 --> 06:32:47,840
breaths but

9923
06:32:47,840 --> 06:32:49,520
everyone's been really nice

9924
06:32:49,520 --> 06:32:52,000
so um they will have no problems and

9925
06:32:52,000 --> 06:32:53,440
they will be very complimentary about

9926
06:32:53,440 --> 06:32:56,000
your talk i'm sure again xero is making

9927
06:32:56,000 --> 06:32:59,680
noise in order to support you as well um

9928
06:32:59,680 --> 06:33:00,958
of course the question i have to ask

9929
06:33:00,958 --> 06:33:02,000
everyone it's going to get boring at

9930
06:33:02,000 --> 06:33:04,638
some point nuggies versus attendees

9931
06:33:04,638 --> 06:33:05,600
sarah

9932
06:33:05,600 --> 06:33:07,520
oh man i have to admit i stayed up last

9933
06:33:07,520 --> 06:33:09,200
night thinking about this it has been

9934
06:33:09,200 --> 06:33:10,638
weighing on my mind since you've been

9935
06:33:10,638 --> 06:33:12,718
asking everyone and to be honest for me

9936
06:33:12,718 --> 06:33:14,638
it's probably korean fried chicken

9937
06:33:14,638 --> 06:33:17,440
before nugs or attendees um but it would

9938
06:33:17,440 --> 06:33:19,840
be uh tendees during the day but nuggets

9939
06:33:19,840 --> 06:33:22,320
after a after a little bit to drink

9940
06:33:22,320 --> 06:33:23,600
nuggies is really good because

9941
06:33:23,600 --> 06:33:26,400

9944
06:33:30,478 --> 06:33:32,240

for you on the value of having a clear

9971
06:34:22,000 --> 06:34:23,280
cyber security strategy and

9972
06:34:23,280 --> 06:34:25,520
complementary plans

9973
06:34:25,520 --> 06:34:27,600
um so before we jump into this one's at

9974
06:34:27,600 --> 06:34:29,200
the ready a little bit about me and i

9975
06:34:29,200 --> 06:34:30,878
think this is already been introduced

9976
06:34:30,878 --> 06:34:32,958
but yes i'm a cyber strategy and

9977
06:34:32,958 --> 06:34:36,240
influence and program lead at seek i sit

9978
06:34:36,240 --> 06:34:38,718
in that data protection cyber

9979
06:34:38,718 --> 06:34:41,520
strategy security culture space

9980
06:34:41,520 --> 06:34:43,120
over the years i've done some

9981
06:34:43,120 --> 06:34:44,638
interesting things i've led a data

9982
06:34:44,638 --> 06:34:46,080
protection office

9983
06:34:46,080 --> 06:34:47,360
had the pleasure to build security

9984
06:34:47,360 --> 06:34:49,040
awareness insider threat incident

9985
06:34:49,040 --> 06:34:51,120
response programs from scratch and just

9986
06:34:51,120 --> 06:34:53,760
generally spent my career in that cyber

9987
06:34:53,760 --> 06:34:56,638
security cyber risk space

9988
06:34:56,638 --> 06:34:59,200
at this point my passion is lying in the

9989
06:34:59,200 --> 06:35:01,280
cyber security strategy and education

9990
06:35:01,280 --> 06:35:02,798
space but you know that change seems to

9991
06:35:02,798 --> 06:35:04,878
change every five years so maybe i'll be

9992
06:35:04,878 --> 06:35:07,840
in comfy con 2026

9993
06:35:07,840 --> 06:35:09,280
and have have totally changed that

9994
06:35:09,280 --> 06:35:12,478
direction um but yes i am a pop culture

9995
06:35:12,478 --> 06:35:14,558
bit of a pop culture nerd and i do have

9996
06:35:14,558 --> 06:35:17,520
a healthy obsession with coffee

9997
06:35:17,520 --> 06:35:19,360
this comes no surprise because of my

9998
06:35:19,360 --> 06:35:20,878
talk steam and you know the jug of

9999
06:35:20,878 --> 06:35:23,760
coffee in front of me today

10000
06:35:23,760 --> 06:35:26,558
um so to get started over the course of

10001
06:35:26,558 --> 06:35:28,478
my career i've noticed the common

10002
06:35:28,478 --> 06:35:30,240
misconception in the industry that a

10003
06:35:30,240 --> 06:35:32,160
strategy is a plan a plan is a strategy

10004
06:35:32,160 --> 06:35:34,240
and better yet let's slap strategic plan

10005
06:35:34,240 --> 06:35:36,878
on a listing of work outputs and vamp

10006
06:35:36,878 --> 06:35:38,638
you know solid achievement chicken

10007
06:35:38,638 --> 06:35:40,718
ticking boxes pat's on the back job well

10008
06:35:40,718 --> 06:35:42,080
done

10009
06:35:42,080 --> 06:35:43,840
honestly i'm sure we've all heard you

10010
06:35:43,840 --> 06:35:45,520
know we need to create a strategic plan

10011
06:35:45,520 --> 06:35:47,200
which is usually linked to that work out

10012
06:35:47,200 --> 06:35:49,280
outputs more than we have heard we need

10013
06:35:49,280 --> 06:35:51,680
to create a strategy and hand on heart i

10014
06:35:51,680 --> 06:35:54,400
can definitely say i've 100 done this in

10015
06:35:54,400 --> 06:35:57,040
my uh in my career especially earlier on

10016
06:35:57,040 --> 06:35:58,400
where i'd confuse you know the next

10017
06:35:58,400 --> 06:36:00,080
quarter caught a plan the next quarter

10018
06:36:00,080 --> 06:36:02,080
of projects we're working on as our

10019
06:36:02,080 --> 06:36:04,400
business strategy our security strategy

10020
06:36:04,400 --> 06:36:05,920
um when i should have really been asking

10021
06:36:05,920 --> 06:36:07,360
questions around you know how do these

10022
06:36:07,360 --> 06:36:09,280
plans and projects that we've spun up

10023
06:36:09,280 --> 06:36:10,798
support our overarching business

10024
06:36:10,798 --> 06:36:12,558
objectives or our security strategy if

10025
06:36:12,558 --> 06:36:15,360
we if we had one um but you know

10026
06:36:15,360 --> 06:36:17,120
confidence is probably another talk

10027
06:36:17,120 --> 06:36:19,120
topic in and of itself

10028
06:36:19,120 --> 06:36:20,718
so my message today is that a clear

10029
06:36:20,718 --> 06:36:22,958
cyber security strategy on underlying

10030
06:36:22,958 --> 06:36:24,958
plans is critical to the success of any

10031
06:36:24,958 --> 06:36:27,040
security program but as mentioned we

10032
06:36:27,040 --> 06:36:30,000
commonly um mix these up and i i think

10033
06:36:30,000 --> 06:36:31,600
it's valuable to unpack this and ensure

10034
06:36:31,600 --> 06:36:33,280
that we're harnessing both to their full

10035
06:36:33,280 --> 06:36:34,798
potential so through the lens of harry

10036
06:36:34,798 --> 06:36:36,638
potter as hopefully a bit of a memory

10037
06:36:36,638 --> 06:36:38,558
aid and i'm probably

10038
06:36:38,558 --> 06:36:39,920
showing my age here considering they

10039
06:36:39,920 --> 06:36:41,760
just did that amazon

10040
06:36:41,760 --> 06:36:43,840
reunion special i'm going to spend the

10041
06:36:43,840 --> 06:36:45,440
next few minutes just drilling down into

10042
06:36:45,440 --> 06:36:47,520
what is a strategy what is a plan when

10043
06:36:47,520 --> 06:36:49,280
they're needed and some quick fire steps

10044
06:36:49,280 --> 06:36:51,920
to creation

10045
06:36:52,000 --> 06:36:54,958
so strategy a strategy is storytelling

10046
06:36:54,958 --> 06:36:57,040
it is your journey your choices um in

10047
06:36:57,040 --> 06:36:59,200
the words of albus dumbledore it is our

10048
06:36:59,200 --> 06:37:01,120
choices harry that show what we truly

10049
06:37:01,120 --> 06:37:03,280
are far more than our abilities and i i

10050
06:37:03,280 --> 06:37:04,798
would have tried to put on an accent but

10051
06:37:04,798 --> 06:37:07,360
i'm absolutely brutal at that um so

10052
06:37:07,360 --> 06:37:09,520
strategy is the making of an integrated

10053
06:37:09,520 --> 06:37:10,878
set of choices it's going to

10054
06:37:10,878 --> 06:37:12,958
collectively position your firm business

10055
06:37:12,958 --> 06:37:15,520
area team in its industry or company so

10056
06:37:15,520 --> 06:37:17,440
as to create sustainable advantage so

10057
06:37:17,440 --> 06:37:19,360
what you're aiming for is to deliver

10058
06:37:19,360 --> 06:37:21,680
superior return get better value

10059
06:37:21,680 --> 06:37:23,280
it's your narrative of high-level

10060
06:37:23,280 --> 06:37:25,040
choices and themes to go towards your

10061
06:37:25,040 --> 06:37:26,400
final showdown

10062
06:37:26,400 --> 06:37:28,000
you and your team are the authors of

10063
06:37:28,000 --> 06:37:30,400
this story

10064
06:37:30,400 --> 06:37:32,400
but as an author you still want people

10065
06:37:32,400 --> 06:37:34,240
to read your book so it's important

10066
06:37:34,240 --> 06:37:35,840
therefore that for you to understand the

10067
06:37:35,840 --> 06:37:38,000
business landscape in which your book

10068
06:37:38,000 --> 06:37:40,080
will be released weigh up potential

10069
06:37:40,080 --> 06:37:42,080
risks against its potential successes

10070
06:37:42,080 --> 06:37:44,000
and consider ways in which you can be

10071
06:37:44,000 --> 06:37:45,600
competitive so you can ensure key

10072
06:37:45,600 --> 06:37:48,400
messages resonate with your audience

10073
06:37:48,400 --> 06:37:50,718
a strategy maps to this it identifies

10074
06:37:50,718 --> 06:37:52,478
what you need to do to meet one or more

10075
06:37:52,478 --> 06:37:55,120
core business objectives it outlines how

10076
06:37:55,120 --> 06:37:56,798
you will overcome challenges confront

10077
06:37:56,798 --> 06:37:58,478
your vulnerabilities and leverage your

10078
06:37:58,478 --> 06:38:00,400
assets to navigate through the journey

10079
06:38:00,400 --> 06:38:02,220
to arrive at your final destination

10080
06:38:02,220 --> 06:38:03,840
[Music]

10081
06:38:03,840 --> 06:38:05,840
so in harry potter there is a group

10082
06:38:05,840 --> 06:38:08,320
called the order of the phoenix their

10083
06:38:08,320 --> 06:38:09,920
overarching aim could really be boiled

10084
06:38:09,920 --> 06:38:11,360
down to something along the lines of you

10085
06:38:11,360 --> 06:38:13,200
know all life is valid or you know

10086
06:38:13,200 --> 06:38:16,240
hashtag down with blood purity um this

10087
06:38:16,240 --> 06:38:17,840
order of the phoenix was established to

10088
06:38:17,840 --> 06:38:19,840
directly combat the death eaters the bad

10089
06:38:19,840 --> 06:38:22,400
guys who placed value in blood purity

10090
06:38:22,400 --> 06:38:24,160
their internal orders had a clear

10091
06:38:24,160 --> 06:38:26,000
strategy that aligned their troops to a

10092
06:38:26,000 --> 06:38:28,000
central mission you know become hashtag

10093
06:38:28,000 --> 06:38:29,920
number one in the market i.e defeat the

10094
06:38:29,920 --> 06:38:31,840
bad guy voldemort

10095
06:38:31,840 --> 06:38:33,440
these orders were not a prescriptive

10096
06:38:33,440 --> 06:38:35,120
step-by-step details and i'll note

10097
06:38:35,120 --> 06:38:36,958
dumbledore held details quite close to

10098
06:38:36,958 --> 06:38:38,958
his his chest but they provided the

10099
06:38:38,958 --> 06:38:40,478
governing principles to progress the

10100
06:38:40,478 --> 06:38:42,160
order of the phoenix towards their end

10101
06:38:42,160 --> 06:38:43,760
goal and allowed that little bit of

10102
06:38:43,760 --> 06:38:45,840
creativity in their planning which we'll

10103
06:38:45,840 --> 06:38:48,320
get to in a moment to be able to

10104
06:38:48,320 --> 06:38:50,160
continuously innovate to get to that end

10105
06:38:50,160 --> 06:38:51,840
goal

10106
06:38:51,840 --> 06:38:54,558
a security strategy should be similar it

10107
06:38:54,558 --> 06:38:56,160
should align to your business objectives

10108
06:38:56,160 --> 06:38:58,000
and provide the themes for your journey

10109
06:38:58,000 --> 06:38:59,760
it will rally the team to your central

10110
06:38:59,760 --> 06:39:01,440
mission and also give them the power to

10111
06:39:01,440 --> 06:39:03,360
manage their time and projects based on

10112
06:39:03,360 --> 06:39:06,478
how it relates to the strategy uh i am

10113
06:39:06,478 --> 06:39:08,558
pretty sure we

10114
06:39:08,558 --> 06:39:11,040
all cyber security and it teams are very

10115
06:39:11,040 --> 06:39:13,200
busy we have drive buyers all the time

10116
06:39:13,200 --> 06:39:14,958
of projects coming in and we also have

10117
06:39:14,958 --> 06:39:16,400
things that we see in the external

10118
06:39:16,400 --> 06:39:18,000
environment that we might want to work

10119
06:39:18,000 --> 06:39:20,320
on so having a clear security strategy

10120
06:39:20,320 --> 06:39:21,760
allows us to put a business case

10121
06:39:21,760 --> 06:39:23,360
together and say hey this is critical to

10122
06:39:23,360 --> 06:39:24,878
deliver on our security strategy and

10123
06:39:24,878 --> 06:39:26,320
therefore deliver on the business

10124
06:39:26,320 --> 06:39:28,558
objectives or just to save to those

10125
06:39:28,558 --> 06:39:31,120
driveways hey look really happy to help

10126
06:39:31,120 --> 06:39:32,718
but come come back in june because we've

10127
06:39:32,718 --> 06:39:34,240
got these critical projects that we need

10128
06:39:34,240 --> 06:39:35,760
to do to get the business to where they

10129
06:39:35,760 --> 06:39:38,878
want to be in five years time

10130
06:39:38,878 --> 06:39:41,680
um so i would say that having a clear

10131
06:39:41,680 --> 06:39:43,520
strategy is always needed but that's you

10132
06:39:43,520 --> 06:39:45,120
know my personal opinion having that

10133
06:39:45,120 --> 06:39:46,718
clear cyber security strategy that's

10134
06:39:46,718 --> 06:39:48,878
documented and communicated and mapped

10135
06:39:48,878 --> 06:39:51,440
to business objectives um and yes i know

10136
06:39:51,440 --> 06:39:53,520
i've said mapped to business objectives

10137
06:39:53,520 --> 06:39:55,440
about five times now but i truly think

10138
06:39:55,440 --> 06:39:57,440
of security as an enabler of business

10139
06:39:57,440 --> 06:40:00,320
you know we we can't be the no police

10140
06:40:00,320 --> 06:40:02,558
so generally a strategy is needed though

10141
06:40:02,558 --> 06:40:04,558
um when you have an unclear destination

10142
06:40:04,558 --> 06:40:06,000
there's a changing landscape you're

10143
06:40:06,000 --> 06:40:08,240
pivoting directions maybe you are

10144
06:40:08,240 --> 06:40:11,120
unifying you know across across asia and

10145
06:40:11,120 --> 06:40:12,638
you need to unify your your tech

10146
06:40:12,638 --> 06:40:14,240
infrastructure and there's just so much

10147
06:40:14,240 --> 06:40:15,600
going on that you need this clear

10148
06:40:15,600 --> 06:40:17,280
security direction to be able to get to

10149
06:40:17,280 --> 06:40:20,399
your business's end goal

10150
06:40:21,600 --> 06:40:24,160
so now moving on to plans a plan is an

10151
06:40:24,160 --> 06:40:25,840
arrangement a in patent program or a

10152
06:40:25,840 --> 06:40:27,600
scheme for a definitive purpose it

10153
06:40:27,600 --> 06:40:29,040
really takes me back to high school that

10154
06:40:29,040 --> 06:40:30,878
kind of who what when how to achieve

10155
06:40:30,878 --> 06:40:33,440
that specific goal or objective

10156
06:40:33,440 --> 06:40:34,878
you know generally they're short-term

10157
06:40:34,878 --> 06:40:36,478
but i just say you know shorter than a

10158
06:40:36,478 --> 06:40:37,520
strategy

10159
06:40:37,520 --> 06:40:39,680
a plan is more limited more limited in

10160
06:40:39,680 --> 06:40:41,680
scope than a strategy and the process

10161
06:40:41,680 --> 06:40:43,040
for developing a plan should be more

10162
06:40:43,040 --> 06:40:44,798
focused and quicker so you can get into

10163
06:40:44,798 --> 06:40:46,478
action as soon as possible so it's that

10164
06:40:46,478 --> 06:40:47,920
action stage

10165
06:40:47,920 --> 06:40:49,520
if we put the strategy and plan together

10166
06:40:49,520 --> 06:40:51,120
in a timeline typically the strategy is

10167
06:40:51,120 --> 06:40:52,080
going to come first where you're

10168
06:40:52,080 --> 06:40:54,000
defining your overarching vision and

10169
06:40:54,000 --> 06:40:56,160
objectives and then you'll have

10170
06:40:56,160 --> 06:40:58,000
underlying plans so commonly plans are

10171
06:40:58,000 --> 06:41:01,280
developed to accomplish your strategy

10172
06:41:01,280 --> 06:41:03,040
so now think of this it might be a dream

10173
06:41:03,040 --> 06:41:04,478
come true for some of you but you're in

10174
06:41:04,478 --> 06:41:05,760
the order of the phoenix and you've been

10175
06:41:05,760 --> 06:41:07,600
tasked to hunt horcruxes with the golden

10176
06:41:07,600 --> 06:41:08,400
trio

10177
06:41:08,400 --> 06:41:09,680
for those of you who haven't read harry

10178
06:41:09,680 --> 06:41:11,440
potter a horcrux is an object that

10179
06:41:11,440 --> 06:41:13,200
harbors a shard of voldemort's soul

10180
06:41:13,200 --> 06:41:14,400
split through the casting of the

10181
06:41:14,400 --> 06:41:16,718
forbidden killing purse which allows him

10182
06:41:16,718 --> 06:41:18,638
to unnaturally lengthen his life so

10183
06:41:18,638 --> 06:41:19,920
these things are straight up bad news

10184
06:41:19,920 --> 06:41:21,440
and i'm not going to help you get to

10185
06:41:21,440 --> 06:41:23,040
your you know number one in the market

10186
06:41:23,040 --> 06:41:26,080
initiative if he can't die

10187
06:41:26,080 --> 06:41:27,840
so based on your intel there is a

10188
06:41:27,840 --> 06:41:30,160
horcrux within greenbox bank so now to

10189
06:41:30,160 --> 06:41:31,840
achieve your overarching strategy ie

10190
06:41:31,840 --> 06:41:33,360
defeat the dark lord number one in the

10191
06:41:33,360 --> 06:41:35,920
market you need to destroy the hashtag

10192
06:41:35,920 --> 06:41:38,478
number of horcruxes and as each horcrux

10193
06:41:38,478 --> 06:41:40,160
is hidden in a different object you have

10194
06:41:40,160 --> 06:41:41,840
different plans and plays for destroying

10195
06:41:41,840 --> 06:41:43,200
each one with the ultimate goal of

10196
06:41:43,200 --> 06:41:44,478
delivering upon your overarching

10197
06:41:44,478 --> 06:41:46,240
strategy so you've defined your

10198
06:41:46,240 --> 06:41:49,040
expectations you know find a destroy get

10199
06:41:49,040 --> 06:41:51,440
horcruxes um outlined your milestones

10200
06:41:51,440 --> 06:41:52,958
the number of them destroyed and you've

10201
06:41:52,958 --> 06:41:55,200
had different plays and plans to destroy

10202
06:41:55,200 --> 06:41:57,600
your horcrux so plan is generally needed

10203
06:41:57,600 --> 06:41:58,478
when

10204
06:41:58,478 --> 06:42:00,718
you have that lack of clarity

10205
06:42:00,718 --> 06:42:02,320
and alignment you need to allocate and

10206
06:42:02,320 --> 06:42:04,000
assign your resources especially when

10207
06:42:04,000 --> 06:42:06,240
they're limited you need to manage your

10208
06:42:06,240 --> 06:42:08,878
you know people clarify roles and just

10209
06:42:08,878 --> 06:42:10,638
get everything into alignment to deliver

10210
06:42:10,638 --> 06:42:13,600
some swift action

10211
06:42:14,798 --> 06:42:16,478
so you can have a plan without a

10212
06:42:16,478 --> 06:42:18,638
strategy but a strategy without a plan

10213
06:42:18,638 --> 06:42:21,040
is a story unfulfilled i'm sure we all

10214
06:42:21,040 --> 06:42:22,478
have a plan of what our team is doing

10215
06:42:22,478 --> 06:42:23,920
for the next quarter a listing of

10216
06:42:23,920 --> 06:42:25,840
projects um but if it does not map to an

10217
06:42:25,840 --> 06:42:27,520
overarching security strategy or simply

10218
06:42:27,520 --> 06:42:29,920
your business strategy it's not going to

10219
06:42:29,920 --> 06:42:32,000
tell the story story that we want and

10220
06:42:32,000 --> 06:42:33,360
we're not going to be able to deliver on

10221
06:42:33,360 --> 06:42:35,600
firm objectives you know how do we know

10222
06:42:35,600 --> 06:42:37,200
that all these fantastic initiatives

10223
06:42:37,200 --> 06:42:38,878
that we're doing will achieve the

10224
06:42:38,878 --> 06:42:40,558
strategic goals and sometimes you know

10225
06:42:40,558 --> 06:42:42,558
we we do know that in cyber security we

10226
06:42:42,558 --> 06:42:44,000
know that these are critical projects

10227
06:42:44,000 --> 06:42:45,440
but it's telling that narrative to the

10228
06:42:45,440 --> 06:42:47,360
business to show to show that what we

10229
06:42:47,360 --> 06:42:48,878
are doing is going to have a really good

10230
06:42:48,878 --> 06:42:50,478
value and you know keep keep the lights

10231
06:42:50,478 --> 06:42:52,638
on

10232
06:42:53,360 --> 06:42:54,958
now i can spend hours drilling into how

10233
06:42:54,958 --> 06:42:56,718
to create a successful strategy or a

10234
06:42:56,718 --> 06:43:00,160
plan but i am uh only on 10 minutes so i

10235
06:43:00,160 --> 06:43:02,000
am going to do a quick fire away as if

10236
06:43:02,000 --> 06:43:03,840
you know a norwegian witchback dragon is

10237
06:43:03,840 --> 06:43:06,798
flaming at my heels uh so for a strategy

10238
06:43:06,798 --> 06:43:08,638
thinking should be very long term

10239
06:43:08,638 --> 06:43:10,400
building your strategy should include

10240
06:43:10,400 --> 06:43:12,638
you know uh thinking of your vision

10241
06:43:12,638 --> 06:43:15,040
mission and values ensuring alignment

10242
06:43:15,040 --> 06:43:17,360
with your business objectives developing

10243
06:43:17,360 --> 06:43:19,680
your vision oops sorry i've said that

10244
06:43:19,680 --> 06:43:21,280
assessing organizational risk and

10245
06:43:21,280 --> 06:43:23,200
stakeholder expectations

10246
06:43:23,200 --> 06:43:25,680
enabling a comprehensive current state

10247
06:43:25,680 --> 06:43:27,520
assessment and then prioritizing your

10248
06:43:27,520 --> 06:43:29,360
kind of core initiatives and building

10249
06:43:29,360 --> 06:43:31,920
out that security roadmap

10250
06:43:31,920 --> 06:43:34,160
when it comes to a plan you focus on a

10251
06:43:34,160 --> 06:43:36,558
goal and you break that down into small

10252
06:43:36,558 --> 06:43:38,240
goals or objectives

10253
06:43:38,240 --> 06:43:39,760
then you work out the who what when how

10254
06:43:39,760 --> 06:43:41,200
to achieve that specific goal or

10255
06:43:41,200 --> 06:43:43,840
objectives you need to define your goal

10256
06:43:43,840 --> 06:43:46,160
and where it maps to the strategy

10257
06:43:46,160 --> 06:43:48,478
divide the goal into your key milestones

10258
06:43:48,478 --> 06:43:50,958
identify the resources needed prioritize

10259
06:43:50,958 --> 06:43:52,638
and assign all related tasks and then

10260
06:43:52,638 --> 06:43:54,160
you know review reflect reply and do

10261
06:43:54,160 --> 06:43:57,840
some retros as you go

10262
06:43:58,320 --> 06:44:01,040
so to wrap up guys let's let's swipe

10263
06:44:01,040 --> 06:44:02,958
right on changing the narrative to let's

10264
06:44:02,958 --> 06:44:04,478
create a security strategy with

10265
06:44:04,478 --> 06:44:07,040
underlying plans to support i think it's

10266
06:44:07,040 --> 06:44:08,798
quite quite important to have a security

10267
06:44:08,798 --> 06:44:10,638
strategy that enables our communication

10268
06:44:10,638 --> 06:44:12,160
to the business

10269
06:44:12,160 --> 06:44:13,360
and my hope is that with these

10270
06:44:13,360 --> 06:44:15,600
clarifications today um you'll be able

10271
06:44:15,600 --> 06:44:17,440
to deliver upon your objectives at work

10272
06:44:17,440 --> 06:44:19,040
make sure we're really communicating our

10273
06:44:19,040 --> 06:44:20,558
value to the business and making sure

10274
06:44:20,558 --> 06:44:21,600
that we are

10275
06:44:21,600 --> 06:44:23,120
mapping our projects to business

10276
06:44:23,120 --> 06:44:24,718
objectives and you know perhaps you will

10277
06:44:24,718 --> 06:44:28,638
overthrow a dark wizard overlord or two

10278
06:44:30,798 --> 06:44:32,400
that was

10279
06:44:32,400 --> 06:44:34,240
absolutely frigging amazing

10280
06:44:34,240 --> 06:44:37,520
that was so good sarah

10281
06:44:38,080 --> 06:44:41,760
it was interesting yeah yeah amazing

10282
06:44:41,760 --> 06:44:43,200
and i think everyone is going to go away

10283
06:44:43,200 --> 06:44:44,558
remembering it because of the harry

10284
06:44:44,558 --> 06:44:46,160
potter thing which i think is really

10285
06:44:46,160 --> 06:44:47,840
really good as well there's a lot of

10286
06:44:47,840 --> 06:44:49,440
people memory aid

10287
06:44:49,440 --> 06:44:50,958
a lot of people who other than arguing

10288
06:44:50,958 --> 06:44:52,160
with me about canberra being the best

10289
06:44:52,160 --> 06:44:53,840
town are saying they love harry potter

10290
06:44:53,840 --> 06:44:55,680
and they love the talk as well i've had

10291
06:44:55,680 --> 06:44:57,520
messages as well by the way from people

10292
06:44:57,520 --> 06:45:00,000
saying they loved it too so yeah

10293
06:45:00,000 --> 06:45:02,798
really great talk

10294
06:45:03,360 --> 06:45:05,440
and i think if anyone has a question i

10295
06:45:05,440 --> 06:45:06,400
haven't seen

10296
06:45:06,400 --> 06:45:08,558
any questions i actually might have hang

10297
06:45:08,558 --> 06:45:09,920
on

10298
06:45:09,920 --> 06:45:11,440
no it's all about chicken for some

10299
06:45:11,440 --> 06:45:12,638
reason i think we've overdone the

10300
06:45:12,638 --> 06:45:14,000
chicken thing shanna

10301
06:45:14,000 --> 06:45:16,160
um well i hope not because we have

10302
06:45:16,160 --> 06:45:17,760
another video on chicken i know but i

10303
06:45:17,760 --> 06:45:18,958
think the really good thing about when

10304
06:45:18,958 --> 06:45:20,400
you have a talk that has no questions i

10305
06:45:20,400 --> 06:45:21,840
think that the thing to take away from

10306
06:45:21,840 --> 06:45:23,440
it is there are no questions because

10307
06:45:23,440 --> 06:45:25,440
you're able to explain it so clearly

10308
06:45:25,440 --> 06:45:27,280
and that's what i think is a really good

10309
06:45:27,280 --> 06:45:29,120
hallmark of a good talk as well so thank

10310
06:45:29,120 --> 06:45:30,878
and dan yeah dan is putting his thumbs

10311
06:45:30,878 --> 06:45:32,400
up as well so thank you very much for

10312
06:45:32,400 --> 06:45:33,680
coming and i hope

10313
06:45:33,680 --> 06:45:35,680
everyone is able to go away and use the

10314
06:45:35,680 --> 06:45:37,040
proper language when they are talking

10315
06:45:37,040 --> 06:45:39,520
about strategies versus plans and not

10316
06:45:39,520 --> 06:45:41,120
just mix them up and actually have clear

10317
06:45:41,120 --> 06:45:43,520
articulation on what they mean

10318
06:45:43,520 --> 06:45:45,920
brilliant thanks for having me guys

10319
06:45:45,920 --> 06:45:49,040
not a problem thank you very much

10320
06:45:49,040 --> 06:45:51,360
um yeah you're right i hope nobody's

10321
06:45:51,360 --> 06:45:53,600
overdone with chicken because

10322
06:45:53,600 --> 06:45:55,920
apparently i put a slot in saying shanna

10323
06:45:55,920 --> 06:45:57,200
cooks chicken

10324
06:45:57,200 --> 06:45:59,200
yeah and also

10325
06:45:59,200 --> 06:46:00,958
you don't talk at your own conference

10326
06:46:00,958 --> 06:46:02,718
it's a bit gaudy

10327
06:46:02,718 --> 06:46:05,280
meanwhile

10328
06:46:05,840 --> 06:46:08,240
meanwhile

10329
06:46:08,240 --> 06:46:09,600
so you're gonna have to stick around now

10330
06:46:09,600 --> 06:46:11,520
you're on mute you put yourself on mute

10331
06:46:11,520 --> 06:46:13,120
i didn't even do that

10332
06:46:13,120 --> 06:46:14,878
i've been told off i've had my wrist

10333
06:46:14,878 --> 06:46:17,840
slapped i understand

10334
06:46:18,718 --> 06:46:20,320
so yeah so i did a video earlier it's

10335
06:46:20,320 --> 06:46:21,760
about 13 minutes if you're not

10336
06:46:21,760 --> 06:46:23,280
interested in frying chicken and me

10337
06:46:23,280 --> 06:46:25,200
talking while frying chicken this

10338
06:46:25,200 --> 06:46:26,558
is a

10339
06:46:26,558 --> 06:46:28,320
video that i took from yesterday through

10340
06:46:28,320 --> 06:46:31,120
today making my fried chicken and doing

10341
06:46:31,120 --> 06:46:32,478
a little bit of a walk through of how

10342
06:46:32,478 --> 06:46:34,240
that looks so

10343
06:46:34,240 --> 06:46:35,600
can you stick around like we'll stick

10344
06:46:35,600 --> 06:46:37,040
around and we can do some commentary if

10345
06:46:37,040 --> 06:46:38,558
needed and

10346
06:46:38,558 --> 06:46:41,760
sure i will do that yes let us do that

10347
06:46:41,760 --> 06:46:44,478
because otherwise

10348
06:46:45,520 --> 06:46:47,360
yeah so is this us making fun of you

10349
06:46:47,360 --> 06:46:48,558
making chicken or do you want

10350
06:46:48,558 --> 06:46:50,718
constructive criticism

10351
06:46:50,718 --> 06:46:52,400
we'll see let's see how it goes okay i

10352
06:46:52,400 --> 06:46:53,840
haven't actually um

10353
06:46:53,840 --> 06:46:55,600
re-watched the video to check it's you

10354
06:46:55,600 --> 06:46:56,718
know all right okay

10355
06:46:56,718 --> 06:46:59,840
so um we will for those of you

10356
06:46:59,840 --> 06:47:02,080
we will see how this goes hopefully this

10357
06:47:02,080 --> 06:47:04,718
will work so welcome i

10358
06:47:04,718 --> 06:47:06,958
am i love coming to do this live well

10359
06:47:06,958 --> 06:47:08,718
not this fast anyway because there is

10360
06:47:08,718 --> 06:47:11,360
quite a bit of work that goes into

10361
06:47:11,360 --> 06:47:13,520
making and the tattoo too

10362
06:47:13,520 --> 06:47:15,680
and now just because if they're small

10363
06:47:15,680 --> 06:47:17,840
they're not nuggets so

10364
06:47:17,840 --> 06:47:20,400
i'm starting with i've got my chicken

10365
06:47:20,400 --> 06:47:23,680
breasts here and that's what she said

10366
06:47:23,680 --> 06:47:25,120
into

10367
06:47:25,120 --> 06:47:26,558
pieces

10368
06:47:26,558 --> 06:47:28,160
and if you know

10369
06:47:28,160 --> 06:47:29,680
try and get them

10370
06:47:29,680 --> 06:47:32,320
somewhat even it's not a really big deal

10371
06:47:32,320 --> 06:47:33,680
you can just cook the ones that are a

10372
06:47:33,680 --> 06:47:35,600
different size together

10373
06:47:35,600 --> 06:47:37,600
but if you can cook you can cut them all

10374
06:47:37,600 --> 06:47:39,440
around about the same size and it's a

10375
06:47:39,440 --> 06:47:41,440
bit easier later on sounds a bit

10376
06:47:41,440 --> 06:47:42,798
aggressive the night cutting doesn't

10377
06:47:42,798 --> 06:47:44,160
mean

10378
06:47:44,160 --> 06:47:47,360
you're letting out your anger

10379
06:47:49,440 --> 06:47:51,040
i will have to disappear within with

10380
06:47:51,040 --> 06:47:52,478
five minutes i can let the next speaker

10381
06:47:52,478 --> 06:47:54,400
get ready by the way crew with me yeah

10382
06:47:54,400 --> 06:47:56,798
i'm waiting for any drop chicken

10383
06:47:56,798 --> 06:47:59,280
and that's super important to make sure

10384
06:47:59,280 --> 06:48:01,200
that you have your clean up crew

10385
06:48:01,200 --> 06:48:03,440
around you at all times it could be a

10386
06:48:03,440 --> 06:48:05,280
nice little interlude for people if they

10387
06:48:05,280 --> 06:48:07,040
want to go grab a drink

10388
06:48:07,040 --> 06:48:08,478
of perfect time for the drink which is

10389
06:48:08,478 --> 06:48:11,840
what i think alex is doing right now too

10390
06:48:11,840 --> 06:48:13,600
so next wash your hands because you know

10391
06:48:13,600 --> 06:48:15,520
what again again oh comment from sound

10392
06:48:15,520 --> 06:48:18,400
wise i don't mind uneven breasts to the

10393
06:48:18,400 --> 06:48:21,400
magnets

10394
06:48:29,790 --> 06:48:32,849
[Music]

10395
06:48:33,680 --> 06:48:34,840
one

10396
06:48:34,840 --> 06:48:38,958
more spicy this one's got truffle in it

10397
06:48:38,958 --> 06:48:41,280
just because i'm a bit fancy

10398
06:48:41,280 --> 06:48:43,520
and about a cup of buttermilk

10399
06:48:43,520 --> 06:48:45,680
so the buttermilk has some acid in it

10400
06:48:45,680 --> 06:48:48,878
which helps to break down and keep the

10401
06:48:48,878 --> 06:48:52,160
chicken moist and tender

10402
06:48:52,160 --> 06:48:54,240
so i'm just going to throw moist in

10403
06:48:54,240 --> 06:48:56,080
there i think so

10404
06:48:56,080 --> 06:48:59,920
some people don't like the word moist

10405
06:49:00,478 --> 06:49:03,478
moist

10406
06:49:10,638 --> 06:49:12,718
wanted to see chicken

10407
06:49:12,718 --> 06:49:14,878
it's all right you can slime

10408
06:49:14,878 --> 06:49:18,600
this you mixed it

10409
06:49:19,200 --> 06:49:21,040
throw your chicken in

10410
06:49:21,040 --> 06:49:23,040
well not throw it in but you know put

10411
06:49:23,040 --> 06:49:25,680
your ticket in

10412
06:49:25,920 --> 06:49:29,958
and make sure they're all coated

10413
06:49:36,718 --> 06:49:38,958
voila once you've done that you want to

10414
06:49:38,958 --> 06:49:40,958
keep them in the buttermilk for at least

10415
06:49:40,958 --> 06:49:43,600
30 minutes or longer if you can

10416
06:49:43,600 --> 06:49:45,280
i'm not going to put them in the fridge

10417
06:49:45,280 --> 06:49:47,520
because putting it in the fridge

10418
06:49:47,520 --> 06:49:50,240
will make the chicken cool and i want to

10419
06:49:50,240 --> 06:49:51,920
keep the chicken a little bit more at

10420
06:49:51,920 --> 06:49:53,280
room temperature

10421
06:49:53,280 --> 06:49:55,920
and continue this on our next break

10422
06:49:55,920 --> 06:49:59,478
thank you for joining

10423
06:50:02,080 --> 06:50:02,958
all right

10424
06:50:02,958 --> 06:50:05,680
back for part two of

10425
06:50:05,680 --> 06:50:08,400
chicken candies deep fried chicken um

10426
06:50:08,400 --> 06:50:10,958
first ingredient for now because it's

10427
06:50:10,958 --> 06:50:12,638
after five not that that ever really

10428
06:50:12,638 --> 06:50:15,840
stops me

10429
06:50:17,440 --> 06:50:18,718
and then

10430
06:50:18,718 --> 06:50:20,240
this next part is where it gets a little

10431
06:50:20,240 --> 06:50:21,520
bit messy

10432
06:50:21,520 --> 06:50:22,638
so

10433
06:50:22,638 --> 06:50:25,120
i have my

10434
06:50:25,120 --> 06:50:26,958
bowls out ready

10435
06:50:26,958 --> 06:50:28,400
to go

10436
06:50:28,400 --> 06:50:30,638
hopefully i think i've got all all that

10437
06:50:30,638 --> 06:50:32,798
i need wait for the chicken to go on

10438
06:50:32,798 --> 06:50:34,160
um

10439
06:50:34,160 --> 06:50:35,600
i'm going to use two different types of

10440
06:50:35,600 --> 06:50:38,000
flour for this i normally only use one

10441
06:50:38,000 --> 06:50:40,160
like an all-purpose flour today i'm

10442
06:50:40,160 --> 06:50:41,760
going to use two

10443
06:50:41,760 --> 06:50:44,160
so put about two cups of flour in so i'm

10444
06:50:44,160 --> 06:50:45,200
gonna put

10445
06:50:45,200 --> 06:50:47,040
like one and a half cups

10446
06:50:47,040 --> 06:50:50,080
of plain flour

10447
06:50:54,080 --> 06:50:55,440
and then

10448
06:50:55,440 --> 06:50:58,160
i'm using a semolina flour

10449
06:50:58,160 --> 06:50:59,120
which

10450
06:50:59,120 --> 06:51:01,680
should in theory

10451
06:51:01,680 --> 06:51:03,440
make the chicken a little bit more

10452
06:51:03,440 --> 06:51:06,638
crispy so it's super fine

10453
06:51:06,638 --> 06:51:08,478
so let's see if this works this is my

10454
06:51:08,478 --> 06:51:10,080
first time and well the camera's going

10455
06:51:10,080 --> 06:51:13,360
crazy consuming

10456
06:51:17,280 --> 06:51:18,798
all right so let's mix my flower in

10457
06:51:18,798 --> 06:51:19,840
together

10458
06:51:19,840 --> 06:51:21,600
and we just add spices you can add

10459
06:51:21,600 --> 06:51:22,840
whatever you like

10460
06:51:22,840 --> 06:51:25,600
um you know

10461
06:51:25,600 --> 06:51:27,440
okay see

10462
06:51:27,440 --> 06:51:30,080
12 11 herbs and slices how many there

10463
06:51:30,080 --> 06:51:30,958
are

10464
06:51:30,958 --> 06:51:32,798
um

10465
06:51:32,798 --> 06:51:34,638
adding random

10466
06:51:34,638 --> 06:51:38,920
make sure there's some salt in there

10467
06:51:40,958 --> 06:51:44,638
got some pretty paprika

10468
06:51:45,760 --> 06:51:47,440
and i'm going to put in some more chili

10469
06:51:47,440 --> 06:51:50,520
as well

10470
06:51:52,000 --> 06:51:54,160
if i look away from the camera

10471
06:51:54,160 --> 06:51:56,240
it goes crazy

10472
06:51:56,240 --> 06:51:59,120
all right so this is kashmiri chili

10473
06:51:59,120 --> 06:52:02,360
pretty spicy

10474
06:52:14,080 --> 06:52:16,080
mix up your flour mixture now make sure

10475
06:52:16,080 --> 06:52:17,600
you've got enough spices in there for

10476
06:52:17,600 --> 06:52:18,798
the amount of flour you want to make

10477
06:52:18,798 --> 06:52:20,478
sure that you've got a good flavor

10478
06:52:20,478 --> 06:52:24,000
that's going through all of the chicken

10479
06:52:25,360 --> 06:52:26,718
then you can always add more salt later

10480
06:52:26,718 --> 06:52:28,558
too i'm going to do two rounds of frying

10481
06:52:28,558 --> 06:52:30,240
so i can sometimes put an extra round of

10482
06:52:30,240 --> 06:52:32,400
salt in between both of those all right

10483
06:52:32,400 --> 06:52:35,040
so my flour's ready crap everywhere i

10484
06:52:35,040 --> 06:52:36,160
have some little flower all down my

10485
06:52:36,160 --> 06:52:39,360
front and a couple eggs i wrote on adam

10486
06:52:39,360 --> 06:52:40,958
leals the cook up last night but you

10487
06:52:40,958 --> 06:52:44,160
just smash it on a flat surface and you

10488
06:52:44,160 --> 06:52:46,000
don't get

10489
06:52:46,000 --> 06:52:48,878
the um gel in the

10490
06:52:57,870 --> 06:53:01,009
[Music]

10491
06:53:06,530 --> 06:53:09,570
[Music]

10492
06:53:14,638 --> 06:53:17,638
again

10493
06:53:18,240 --> 06:53:20,080
i could i could speed the whole thing up

10494
06:53:20,080 --> 06:53:21,680
and i was like oh maybe i could just do

10495
06:53:21,680 --> 06:53:24,718
it all in one two five next step is to

10496
06:53:24,718 --> 06:53:26,798
take your chicken and

10497
06:53:26,798 --> 06:53:28,160
we're going to

10498
06:53:28,160 --> 06:53:30,638
going to strain out the buttermilk so

10499
06:53:30,638 --> 06:53:32,240
look how fast i was whipping those eggs

10500
06:53:32,240 --> 06:53:34,798
hey son

10501
06:53:36,400 --> 06:53:38,558
oh we're back

10502
06:53:38,558 --> 06:53:40,080
as you can hear my dogs uh around

10503
06:53:40,080 --> 06:53:41,120
yourself

10504
06:53:41,120 --> 06:53:41,840
so

10505
06:53:41,840 --> 06:53:44,160
i have drained out and because the speed

10506
06:53:44,160 --> 06:53:46,558
has returned to normal from the

10507
06:53:46,558 --> 06:53:49,280
buttermilk mixture so i'm gonna do flour

10508
06:53:49,280 --> 06:53:50,958
mixture

10509
06:53:50,958 --> 06:53:52,320
egg

10510
06:53:52,320 --> 06:53:54,400
back in the flour mixture then onto a

10511
06:53:54,400 --> 06:53:57,040
plate i know it's really hard to see

10512
06:53:57,040 --> 06:53:58,558
but i will

10513
06:53:58,558 --> 06:54:00,478
try and do this

10514
06:54:00,478 --> 06:54:02,478
so that you can sort of see it's gets

10515
06:54:02,478 --> 06:54:04,160
super messy

10516
06:54:04,160 --> 06:54:06,160
this is where it gets really messy

10517
06:54:06,160 --> 06:54:08,320
so

10518
06:54:08,320 --> 06:54:10,798
but you want to

10519
06:54:10,798 --> 06:54:14,399
flour coat your candies

10520
06:54:15,520 --> 06:54:17,280
put them in

10521
06:54:17,280 --> 06:54:20,160
the egg i do a few at a time just make

10522
06:54:20,160 --> 06:54:22,240
it a bit faster really hard to make like

10523
06:54:22,240 --> 06:54:24,478
battering stuff

10524
06:54:24,478 --> 06:54:28,320
you know interesting all over them

10525
06:54:28,638 --> 06:54:30,400
i think i will run with that that's what

10526
06:54:30,400 --> 06:54:32,240
she said

10527
06:54:32,240 --> 06:54:35,280
um the podcast or the the chef the

10528
06:54:35,280 --> 06:54:36,878
cooking show

10529
06:54:36,878 --> 06:54:39,280
that's what she said

10530
06:54:39,280 --> 06:54:41,280
now put these back in the flour mixture

10531
06:54:41,280 --> 06:54:43,120
again now

10532
06:54:43,120 --> 06:54:47,160
that gives them a good batter

10533
06:54:55,840 --> 06:54:58,000
keen to see uh your thoughts alex once

10534
06:54:58,000 --> 06:55:00,000
this is done i'm gonna keep doing these

10535
06:55:00,000 --> 06:55:01,520
and i'll come back to you

10536
06:55:01,520 --> 06:55:03,680
when they're done

10537
06:55:03,680 --> 06:55:05,680
all right so i'm up to

10538
06:55:05,680 --> 06:55:07,440
my last couple of attendees that i'm

10539
06:55:07,440 --> 06:55:10,798
just putting through the flower here

10540
06:55:12,240 --> 06:55:13,840
and then just for good measure just

10541
06:55:13,840 --> 06:55:15,920
because i tend to chuck them all back

10542
06:55:15,920 --> 06:55:18,320
into the flower again

10543
06:55:18,320 --> 06:55:22,160
just to give them a really good coating

10544
06:55:22,160 --> 06:55:25,120
starting from some of the older ones

10545
06:55:25,120 --> 06:55:28,320
come tune in to come together

10546
06:55:29,840 --> 06:55:32,160
good coating of color and no seasonings

10547
06:55:32,160 --> 06:55:33,440
on there

10548
06:55:33,440 --> 06:55:37,280
and that will keep them very crispy

10549
06:55:37,280 --> 06:55:38,638
and by now they've dried out a little

10550
06:55:38,638 --> 06:55:42,399
bit so it makes it a little bit easier

10551
06:55:49,200 --> 06:55:52,400
no real science to this

10552
06:55:53,520 --> 06:55:55,440
and check those back in

10553
06:55:55,440 --> 06:55:57,120
and i'm making a massive mess and i'm

10554
06:55:57,120 --> 06:56:00,760
going to show you my bench

10555
06:56:08,160 --> 06:56:10,000
really somebody is walking down the road

10556
06:56:10,000 --> 06:56:11,440
in the lab too all right so i have a

10557
06:56:11,440 --> 06:56:12,958
heap of flour left make sure you check

10558
06:56:12,958 --> 06:56:14,240
it out we're dealing with raw chicken

10559
06:56:14,240 --> 06:56:15,920
here you don't want to keep it

10560
06:56:15,920 --> 06:56:18,478
but i do have my plate of attendees

10561
06:56:18,478 --> 06:56:20,718
ready to be fried so

10562
06:56:20,718 --> 06:56:24,718
i will get the next step underway

10563
06:56:25,520 --> 06:56:28,478
okay so for now at the end of day one of

10564
06:56:28,478 --> 06:56:30,798
configuring it's quarter to nine

10565
06:56:30,798 --> 06:56:32,478
i'm a little bit tired and i still have

10566
06:56:32,478 --> 06:56:34,638
to cook my chicken um

10567
06:56:34,638 --> 06:56:36,558
but

10568
06:56:36,558 --> 06:56:38,558
i'm gonna do two fries because it makes

10569
06:56:38,558 --> 06:56:39,760
them crispier makes them better so i'm

10570
06:56:39,760 --> 06:56:41,920
gonna do the first fry tonight and then

10571
06:56:41,920 --> 06:56:43,040
i'm gonna put them in the fridge

10572
06:56:43,040 --> 06:56:44,478
overnight and i'll do the second fry

10573
06:56:44,478 --> 06:56:45,600
tomorrow

10574
06:56:45,600 --> 06:56:47,200
i also

10575
06:56:47,200 --> 06:56:50,240
i'm going to move this

10576
06:56:50,400 --> 06:56:51,680
and let me

10577
06:56:51,680 --> 06:56:53,520
i board

10578
06:56:53,520 --> 06:56:56,000
an electric deep fryer this week

10579
06:56:56,000 --> 06:56:58,000
just got a cheapish one

10580
06:56:58,000 --> 06:56:59,120
sunbeam

10581
06:56:59,120 --> 06:57:02,638
deep breath cause it's super easy so

10582
06:57:02,638 --> 06:57:05,840
first fry is done

10583
06:57:05,840 --> 06:57:08,558
on a lower temperature so you wanted to

10584
06:57:08,558 --> 06:57:10,958
kind of cook the chicken through

10585
06:57:10,958 --> 06:57:12,558
for a little bit longer so maybe four or

10586
06:57:12,558 --> 06:57:15,360
five minutes and then the second fry

10587
06:57:15,360 --> 06:57:17,520
will be a hot temperature

10588
06:57:17,520 --> 06:57:19,120
for a shorter amount of time just to

10589
06:57:19,120 --> 06:57:21,440
give it that golden brown so i'm gonna

10590
06:57:21,440 --> 06:57:25,200
do about four minutes

10591
06:57:25,200 --> 06:57:26,878
for each of these because they're quite

10592
06:57:26,878 --> 06:57:29,120
small and then i'm going to put them on

10593
06:57:29,120 --> 06:57:30,080
a plate and i'm going to put them in the

10594
06:57:30,080 --> 06:57:31,920
fridge overnight uncovered to dry them

10595
06:57:31,920 --> 06:57:36,320
out and then tomorrow i will finish this

10596
06:57:36,798 --> 06:57:39,600
now i'm just waiting for the deep fryer

10597
06:57:39,600 --> 06:57:42,638
to heat up

10598
06:57:42,638 --> 06:57:44,558
a little bit of a tray

10599
06:57:44,558 --> 06:57:46,240
take another video

10600
06:57:46,240 --> 06:57:49,120
on some frying

10601
06:57:53,840 --> 06:57:55,440
all right so i'm not sure how well that

10602
06:57:55,440 --> 06:57:57,040
these chicken attendees are going to go

10603
06:57:57,040 --> 06:57:59,280
considering they've been left

10604
06:57:59,280 --> 06:58:03,600
so long after i've added them but

10605
06:58:03,600 --> 06:58:06,400
yolo right

10606
06:58:06,400 --> 06:58:11,160
tld worked out really well

10607
06:58:11,280 --> 06:58:13,360
yes alex did you find they dry out after

10608
06:58:13,360 --> 06:58:16,080
a day and that actually makes it better

10609
06:58:16,080 --> 06:58:17,920
which i know you can't hear me but my

10610
06:58:17,920 --> 06:58:20,557
timer

10611
06:58:20,718 --> 06:58:22,798
i'll type it as well

10612
06:58:22,798 --> 06:58:25,200
that's all right i can hear you now um

10613
06:58:25,200 --> 06:58:27,200
it sounds really good i only remind you

10614
06:58:27,200 --> 06:58:29,360
for about 15 minutes deep fry these for

10615
06:58:29,360 --> 06:58:31,360
a couple of minutes

10616
06:58:31,360 --> 06:58:32,638
and then i'll come back when they're

10617
06:58:32,638 --> 06:58:34,878
done see i'm only friends i know

10618
06:58:34,878 --> 06:58:36,798
somebody else can also smell what's

10619
06:58:36,798 --> 06:58:38,558
going on in here

10620
06:58:38,558 --> 06:58:39,520
but

10621
06:58:39,520 --> 06:58:42,320
first fries looking pretty delicious so

10622
06:58:42,320 --> 06:58:44,638
all i'm doing

10623
06:58:44,638 --> 06:58:46,000
is cooking them

10624
06:58:46,000 --> 06:58:49,478
taking them out

10625
06:58:54,240 --> 06:58:57,440
and putting in some more

10626
06:58:59,680 --> 06:59:02,000
these are looking pretty good

10627
06:59:02,000 --> 06:59:03,840
and just because i needed some dinner

10628
06:59:03,840 --> 06:59:05,440
i'm gonna double cook some for myself

10629
06:59:05,440 --> 06:59:06,798
now but

10630
06:59:06,798 --> 06:59:09,120
i'm gonna put this plate in the fridge

10631
06:59:09,120 --> 06:59:11,680
and i'm gonna finish this tomorrow

10632
06:59:11,680 --> 06:59:14,558
and i will be seeing you all at conflict

10633

10645
06:59:43,890 --> 06:59:45,360
[Music]

ready for me to eat

10648
06:59:55,120 --> 06:59:57,360
done

10649
06:59:58,478 --> 07:00:00,080
incredible that looks really good they

10650
07:00:00,080 --> 07:00:02,400
were like the perfect color they were

10651
07:00:02,400 --> 07:00:03,840
yeah they turned out really well how

10652
07:00:03,840 --> 07:00:05,840
does that go with this compared to how

10653
07:00:05,840 --> 07:00:07,520
you make your

10654
07:00:07,520 --> 07:00:10,240
korean chicken alex i'm super interested

10655
07:00:10,240 --> 07:00:12,240
um i do mine

10656
07:00:12,240 --> 07:00:15,200
double fry about 15 5 15 minutes apart i

10657
07:00:15,200 --> 07:00:16,798
was a bit hurry today so it was a bit of

10658
07:00:16,798 --> 07:00:17,440
a

10659
07:00:17,440 --> 07:00:18,878
shorter time

10660
07:00:18,878 --> 07:00:20,558
um but other than that it's like the

10661
07:00:20,558 --> 07:00:22,718
same kind of thing i just brined for a

10662
07:00:22,718 --> 07:00:24,080
day beforehand

10663
07:00:24,080 --> 07:00:26,240
yeah yeah if you if you put them in the

10664
07:00:26,240 --> 07:00:27,680
fridge overnight

10665
07:00:27,680 --> 07:00:30,320
um after the first fry it dries them out

10666
07:00:30,320 --> 07:00:32,798
a little which helps with the crispiness

10667
07:00:32,798 --> 07:00:34,718
of the batter

10668
07:00:34,718 --> 07:00:36,958
that's clever that was almost like that

10669
07:00:36,958 --> 07:00:39,520
i left

10670
07:00:39,600 --> 07:00:40,958
i was like in my mind i'm like it's

10671
07:00:40,958 --> 07:00:42,718
going to dry them out but no in a good

10672
07:00:42,718 --> 07:00:43,600
way

10673
07:00:43,600 --> 07:00:45,200
yeah i will try that

10674
07:00:45,200 --> 07:00:46,798
yeah it just just makes it a little bit

10675
07:00:46,798 --> 07:00:48,958
crispy and then you get the

10676
07:00:48,958 --> 07:00:50,000
um

10677
07:00:50,000 --> 07:00:51,760
i think the semolina helped as well this

10678
07:00:51,760 --> 07:00:54,558
is the first time i used semolina

10679
07:00:54,558 --> 07:00:57,040
as well as all-purpose flour so

10680
07:00:57,040 --> 07:00:59,440
yeah i do a lot of cooking um so if

10681
07:00:59,440 --> 07:01:01,120
anyone wants to hit me up about cooking

10682
07:01:01,120 --> 07:01:02,320
i

10683
07:01:02,320 --> 07:01:04,798
cook a bunch of stuff

10684
07:01:04,798 --> 07:01:05,680
but

10685
07:01:05,680 --> 07:01:07,600
alex you did some cooking where you are

10686
07:01:07,600 --> 07:01:09,200
but you're not going to be talking to us

10687
07:01:09,200 --> 07:01:11,120
about cooking tonight are you

10688
07:01:11,120 --> 07:01:13,040
no no

10689
07:01:13,040 --> 07:01:15,520
i'm gonna be talking to

10690
07:01:15,520 --> 07:01:17,200
you and everybody else on the stream

10691
07:01:17,200 --> 07:01:19,360
about augmentation

10692
07:01:19,360 --> 07:01:20,478
um

10693
07:01:20,478 --> 07:01:21,280
so

10694
07:01:21,280 --> 07:01:22,718
i'm sure there are a lot of cyberpunk

10695
07:01:22,718 --> 07:01:24,240
fans in here so why don't we have a

10696
07:01:24,240 --> 07:01:25,680
robot like this is kind of the topic of

10697
07:01:25,680 --> 07:01:27,520
my talk i agree you know i played

10698
07:01:27,520 --> 07:01:30,558
cyberpunk i loved it i really wanted to

10699
07:01:30,558 --> 07:01:33,120
get my own implants and i'm left

10700
07:01:33,120 --> 07:01:34,958
wondering the same thing so i'm just now

10701
07:01:34,958 --> 07:01:37,680
looking for your bio here

10702
07:01:37,680 --> 07:01:38,840
let me get

10703
07:01:38,840 --> 07:01:41,200
that so

10704
07:01:41,200 --> 07:01:42,320
alex

10705
07:01:42,320 --> 07:01:45,200
you are a biomechanical engineer

10706
07:01:45,200 --> 07:01:47,760
nope i've lost it again

10707
07:01:47,760 --> 07:01:49,040
here we go

10708
07:01:49,040 --> 07:01:50,958
a biomechanical engineer currently

10709
07:01:50,958 --> 07:01:52,798
working on the sap security of a medical

10710
07:01:52,798 --> 07:01:55,280
device they have a background across

10711
07:01:55,280 --> 07:01:58,080
many aspects of the healthcare system

10712
07:01:58,080 --> 07:02:00,718
and the devices and implants that enable

10713
07:02:00,718 --> 07:02:04,000
us to live happy and healthy lives

10714
07:02:04,000 --> 07:02:05,760
they are a keen interest in how health

10715
07:02:05,760 --> 07:02:08,160
security intersects with economic social

10716
07:02:08,160 --> 07:02:08,958
and

10717
07:02:08,958 --> 07:02:11,040
systemic factors when working to deliver

10718
07:02:11,040 --> 07:02:13,280
the best possible outcomes for patients

10719
07:02:13,280 --> 07:02:16,878
so today alex is talking to us about how

10720
07:02:16,878 --> 07:02:19,120
do we attach augments and what body

10721
07:02:19,120 --> 07:02:21,680
systems that will replace and enhance

10722
07:02:21,680 --> 07:02:23,600
and i'm not going to go through the rest

10723
07:02:23,600 --> 07:02:25,280
of the synopsis because i'm pretty sure

10724
07:02:25,280 --> 07:02:27,440
you can cover it in your talk

10725
07:02:27,440 --> 07:02:29,520
and you've got control

10726
07:02:29,520 --> 07:02:33,760
so take it away cool spooky

10727
07:02:34,000 --> 07:02:35,600
uh i don't know how to drop you off i

10728
07:02:35,600 --> 07:02:38,000
just realized there we go um dan set up

10729
07:02:38,000 --> 07:02:40,400
for me so um hi everyone let me just

10730
07:02:40,400 --> 07:02:45,120
bring my slides up as shauna said um

10731
07:02:45,120 --> 07:02:46,478
i will be talking today about

10732
07:02:46,478 --> 07:02:48,320
augmentation um i know there's a lot of

10733
07:02:48,320 --> 07:02:50,160
cyberpunk fans in the room so we can

10734
07:02:50,160 --> 07:02:53,200
kind of get kicked off from there um

10735
07:02:53,200 --> 07:02:55,360
just a quick heads up content warning

10736
07:02:55,360 --> 07:02:57,040
for this talk i do have some medical and

10737
07:02:57,040 --> 07:02:59,600
surgical images they will be

10738
07:02:59,600 --> 07:03:01,520
grayed out when the slide comes up on

10739
07:03:01,520 --> 07:03:03,520
the screen and the topic or the content

10740
07:03:03,520 --> 07:03:04,478
underneath

10741
07:03:04,478 --> 07:03:06,400
um will be displayed and then the gray

10742
07:03:06,400 --> 07:03:07,680
out will fade and you'll see the image

10743
07:03:07,680 --> 07:03:09,520
it's not too graphic um but just i

10744
07:03:09,520 --> 07:03:11,600
figured i would give you all a heads up

10745
07:03:11,600 --> 07:03:13,760
and uh some self control of the kind of

10746
07:03:13,760 --> 07:03:16,000
content that you have on your screen

10747
07:03:16,000 --> 07:03:18,958
um so a little bit about me um i

10748
07:03:18,958 --> 07:03:20,240
originally studied biomedical

10749
07:03:20,240 --> 07:03:22,000
engineering because i thought robot legs

10750
07:03:22,000 --> 07:03:24,240
were sick

10751
07:03:24,240 --> 07:03:26,320
um and that's literally how i got into

10752
07:03:26,320 --> 07:03:28,638
it um and i have a background in

10753
07:03:28,638 --> 07:03:30,478
transcutaneous orthopedics and

10754
07:03:30,478 --> 07:03:31,840
prosthetics

10755
07:03:31,840 --> 07:03:33,680
the medical industry loves jargon just

10756
07:03:33,680 --> 07:03:35,360
as much as the cyber security industry

10757
07:03:35,360 --> 07:03:37,600
so basically that means implants that

10758
07:03:37,600 --> 07:03:39,520
are inside of you and outside of you at

10759
07:03:39,520 --> 07:03:40,958
the same time

10760
07:03:40,958 --> 07:03:43,120
in this particular case uh looking at

10761
07:03:43,120 --> 07:03:44,558
bolting prosthetics to a person's

10762
07:03:44,558 --> 07:03:46,240
skeleton

10763
07:03:46,240 --> 07:03:49,440
um i currently work as a test engineer

10764
07:03:49,440 --> 07:03:50,878
for medical devices with security

10765
07:03:50,878 --> 07:03:52,958
becoming an increasingly big focus in

10766
07:03:52,958 --> 07:03:54,080
this area

10767
07:03:54,080 --> 07:03:55,680
um i had blue hair and pronouns when i

10768
07:03:55,680 --> 07:03:57,280
started writing this talk um i have pink

10769
07:03:57,280 --> 07:04:00,478
hair now um my pronouns are they and

10770
07:04:00,478 --> 07:04:02,160
them i'm also pretty big on queer

10771
07:04:02,160 --> 07:04:04,638
representation in stem

10772
07:04:04,638 --> 07:04:06,478
um

10773
07:04:06,478 --> 07:04:08,400
not much else of note um at some point i

10774
07:04:08,400 --> 07:04:10,240
might get some certifications

10775
07:04:10,240 --> 07:04:12,000
try and drop a zero day for clout but

10776
07:04:12,000 --> 07:04:14,160
i'll get there when we get there um of

10777
07:04:14,160 --> 07:04:16,798
course the disclaimer uh views of my own

10778
07:04:16,798 --> 07:04:19,520
um do not represent my organization any

10779
07:04:19,520 --> 07:04:21,680
of my affiliations um not that anyone

10780
07:04:21,680 --> 07:04:23,040
would be stupid enough to have the same

10781
07:04:23,040 --> 07:04:25,680
views as me anyway

10782
07:04:25,680 --> 07:04:27,360
so let's go through our cyberpunk

10783
07:04:27,360 --> 07:04:28,478
checklist

10784
07:04:28,478 --> 07:04:31,200
we have increasing social stratification

10785
07:04:31,200 --> 07:04:32,000
um

10786
07:04:32,000 --> 07:04:33,440
we have the mechanization and

10787
07:04:33,440 --> 07:04:35,760
militarization of police forces

10788
07:04:35,760 --> 07:04:37,760
use of surveillance technology by the

10789
07:04:37,760 --> 07:04:38,798
state

10790
07:04:38,798 --> 07:04:40,638
and corporate monopolization control

10791
07:04:40,638 --> 07:04:42,798
monetization of goods and services that

10792
07:04:42,798 --> 07:04:44,320
we rely on

10793
07:04:44,320 --> 07:04:46,558
but there seems to be one big thing

10794
07:04:46,558 --> 07:04:48,400
missing when we look at ourselves on the

10795
07:04:48,400 --> 07:04:50,240
cyberpunk timeline

10796
07:04:50,240 --> 07:04:51,040
oh

10797
07:04:51,040 --> 07:04:53,440
lost my mouse sorry about that

10798
07:04:53,440 --> 07:04:57,399
let's bring us back up

10799
07:04:57,440 --> 07:04:59,280
that's the wrong window apologies there

10800
07:04:59,280 --> 07:05:00,160
we go

10801
07:05:00,160 --> 07:05:02,478
um so the one thing missing is the cool

10802
07:05:02,478 --> 07:05:04,240
robot lens

10803
07:05:04,240 --> 07:05:06,080
but when we talk about augmentation we

10804
07:05:06,080 --> 07:05:06,958
have to know what we're talking about

10805
07:05:06,958 --> 07:05:09,440
when we talk about augmentation so it's

10806
07:05:09,440 --> 07:05:11,760
a bit of a fun buzzword but what it is

10807
07:05:11,760 --> 07:05:14,638
is the ability to replace assist alter

10808
07:05:14,638 --> 07:05:16,240
or enhance

10809
07:05:16,240 --> 07:05:17,840
physical or mental capabilities it's a

10810
07:05:17,840 --> 07:05:19,440
bit of a mouthful

10811
07:05:19,440 --> 07:05:20,638
there are different pathways to

10812
07:05:20,638 --> 07:05:22,160
augmentation

10813
07:05:22,160 --> 07:05:23,920
first one would be chemical think your

10814
07:05:23,920 --> 07:05:26,000
performance enhancing drugs steroids

10815
07:05:26,000 --> 07:05:28,718
blood doping uh nootropics is another

10816
07:05:28,718 --> 07:05:31,840
buzz fun buzzword modafinil university

10817
07:05:31,840 --> 07:05:33,920
students taking adhd meditate uh

10818
07:05:33,920 --> 07:05:36,080
medications to help them focus

10819
07:05:36,080 --> 07:05:38,718
and medical pathways augmentation so

10820
07:05:38,718 --> 07:05:40,878
implants um pacemakers and joint

10821
07:05:40,878 --> 07:05:43,200
replacements uh prosthetics so

10822
07:05:43,200 --> 07:05:46,240
um robot hands robot legs and wearable

10823
07:05:46,240 --> 07:05:48,798
devices such as insulin pumps

10824
07:05:48,798 --> 07:05:50,798
nano augmentation is a while off yet so

10825
07:05:50,798 --> 07:05:53,200
apologies all you are inspector fans um

10826
07:05:53,200 --> 07:05:54,878
you're not going to be looking like jc

10827
07:05:54,878 --> 07:05:57,120
denton anytime soon

10828
07:05:57,120 --> 07:06:00,160
um like many fields what the public

10829
07:06:00,160 --> 07:06:02,878
thinks of that field isn't necessarily

10830
07:06:02,878 --> 07:06:04,718
reflective of the status

10831
07:06:04,718 --> 07:06:06,958
augmentation is a bit of a funny um

10832
07:06:06,958 --> 07:06:08,798
buzzword people think of cyberpunk stuff

10833
07:06:08,798 --> 07:06:10,320
they don't necessarily understand what

10834
07:06:10,320 --> 07:06:11,840
the state of the

10835
07:06:11,840 --> 07:06:14,958
topic is at the time um and it can feel

10836
07:06:14,958 --> 07:06:17,040
a bit snake oily so

10837
07:06:17,040 --> 07:06:18,878
uh think about elon musk's neural

10838
07:06:18,878 --> 07:06:21,360
neurolink he claimed it would be due by

10839
07:06:21,360 --> 07:06:24,798
2020 in heads um that's obviously not

10840
07:06:24,798 --> 07:06:27,360
the case and we've seen some pretty

10841
07:06:27,360 --> 07:06:29,040
questionable ethical decision making

10842
07:06:29,040 --> 07:06:30,240
around the way that they've been doing

10843
07:06:30,240 --> 07:06:31,680
testing as the news came out earlier

10844
07:06:31,680 --> 07:06:32,958
this year

10845
07:06:32,958 --> 07:06:34,160
and then for those of you who are really

10846
07:06:34,160 --> 07:06:36,638
into that kind of dystopic cyberpunk

10847
07:06:36,638 --> 07:06:38,878
media you know you think of blade runner

10848
07:06:38,878 --> 07:06:41,200
as some of the foundational media of the

10849
07:06:41,200 --> 07:06:43,280
genre set in the far-flung future of

10850
07:06:43,280 --> 07:06:44,958
2019

10851
07:06:44,958 --> 07:06:46,160
um

10852
07:06:46,160 --> 07:06:47,520
but

10853
07:06:47,520 --> 07:06:49,600
looking at this and going okay well

10854
07:06:49,600 --> 07:06:51,680
we're not there yet the reality is we've

10855
07:06:51,680 --> 07:06:53,360
actually been trying to do this for a

10856
07:06:53,360 --> 07:06:54,878
while um

10857
07:06:54,878 --> 07:06:56,400
humans have been trying to live longer

10858
07:06:56,400 --> 07:06:59,600
fight harder be smarter since we've been

10859
07:06:59,600 --> 07:07:02,000
human um and a peak back in history

10860
07:07:02,000 --> 07:07:04,478
gives us a look at some of this stuff so

10861
07:07:04,478 --> 07:07:05,360
think about the development of

10862
07:07:05,360 --> 07:07:06,958
protective suits you just look at armor

10863
07:07:06,958 --> 07:07:08,798
and stuff i really love dive suits

10864
07:07:08,798 --> 07:07:10,878
because they look ridiculous and the

10865
07:07:10,878 --> 07:07:12,478
first atmospheric pressure suit was

10866
07:07:12,478 --> 07:07:15,200
actually built in 1710 again designed to

10867
07:07:15,200 --> 07:07:17,680
let uh humans be able to exist in

10868
07:07:17,680 --> 07:07:19,600
environment that is incredibly hostile

10869
07:07:19,600 --> 07:07:21,040
to them

10870
07:07:21,040 --> 07:07:23,280
on the chemical side we saw widespread

10871
07:07:23,280 --> 07:07:26,798
amphetamine used during world war ii um

10872
07:07:26,798 --> 07:07:28,400
providing performance enhancements in

10873
07:07:28,400 --> 07:07:29,760
combat across all

10874
07:07:29,760 --> 07:07:32,718
theaters and by all sides of the war

10875
07:07:32,718 --> 07:07:35,520
um first use of steroids in the 1954

10876
07:07:35,520 --> 07:07:38,160
olympics um of interest to myself as

10877
07:07:38,160 --> 07:07:39,760
someone who spent the last few years

10878
07:07:39,760 --> 07:07:41,600
turning their endocrine system into

10879
07:07:41,600 --> 07:07:44,558
their biochemistry experiment or uh the

10880
07:07:44,558 --> 07:07:46,160
biological equivalent of a home lab if

10881
07:07:46,160 --> 07:07:46,958
you will

10882
07:07:46,958 --> 07:07:49,040
um the first published use of hormone

10883
07:07:49,040 --> 07:07:51,040
replacement therapy in a transgender

10884
07:07:51,040 --> 07:07:54,240
individual in 1954

10885
07:07:54,240 --> 07:07:55,280
um

10886
07:07:55,280 --> 07:07:58,160
people think of lily elba she underwent

10887
07:07:58,160 --> 07:07:59,360
surgeries but she actually never

10888
07:07:59,360 --> 07:08:01,360
actually had a hormone replacement

10889
07:08:01,360 --> 07:08:02,958
therapy

10890
07:08:02,958 --> 07:08:03,760
um

10891
07:08:03,760 --> 07:08:06,798
so now you know what augmentation is

10892
07:08:06,798 --> 07:08:09,920
why can't you have them why don't they

10893
07:08:09,920 --> 07:08:11,200
exist

10894
07:08:11,200 --> 07:08:14,080
in the consumer market as it were

10895
07:08:14,080 --> 07:08:16,958
so the reality is that the human body is

10896
07:08:16,958 --> 07:08:18,958
really really really complex there's a

10897
07:08:18,958 --> 07:08:20,558
lot of challenges involved in

10898
07:08:20,558 --> 07:08:22,958
integrating anything into the body

10899
07:08:22,958 --> 07:08:24,638
notably an attachment and integration

10900
07:08:24,638 --> 07:08:26,558
into the nervous system if you think

10901
07:08:26,558 --> 07:08:28,718
about viewing the human body as a system

10902
07:08:28,718 --> 07:08:31,040
it's a really really complex one and

10903
07:08:31,040 --> 07:08:34,000
even plugging into a small part of that

10904
07:08:34,000 --> 07:08:36,558
system and trying to communicate with it

10905
07:08:36,558 --> 07:08:39,040
we're not really very good at

10906
07:08:39,040 --> 07:08:41,360
um it's also kind of worth noting that

10907
07:08:41,360 --> 07:08:43,360
as of yet there are no prosthetics on

10908
07:08:43,360 --> 07:08:45,760
the market that can outperform a normal

10909
07:08:45,760 --> 07:08:48,160
human limb um people have these had

10910
07:08:48,160 --> 07:08:49,680
discussions around things like oscar

10911
07:08:49,680 --> 07:08:51,680
pistorius and um

10912
07:08:51,680 --> 07:08:54,160
para athletes competing with regular

10913
07:08:54,160 --> 07:08:55,680
athletes but

10914
07:08:55,680 --> 07:08:57,600
despite a lot of media buzz they still

10915
07:08:57,600 --> 07:08:59,600
can't perform better than

10916
07:08:59,600 --> 07:09:01,840
an able-bodied athlete

10917
07:09:01,840 --> 07:09:03,760
so in kind of thinking about these

10918
07:09:03,760 --> 07:09:05,280
complexes

10919
07:09:05,280 --> 07:09:08,320
or these complex systems um entered the

10920
07:09:08,320 --> 07:09:11,120
body systems interconnect model it's a

10921
07:09:11,120 --> 07:09:12,958
really really really genius model i came

10922
07:09:12,958 --> 07:09:15,280
up with it last night when i was trying

10923
07:09:15,280 --> 07:09:17,120
to figure out a good way to explain a

10924
07:09:17,120 --> 07:09:18,638
complex system to a group of cyber

10925
07:09:18,638 --> 07:09:20,878
security professionals um my model is

10926
07:09:20,878 --> 07:09:22,320
better than the osi model because it

10927
07:09:22,320 --> 07:09:24,958
only has three layers um so

10928
07:09:24,958 --> 07:09:27,760
the first one is attachment so how do we

10929
07:09:27,760 --> 07:09:29,680
mechanically connect

10930
07:09:29,680 --> 07:09:31,680
and augment a prosthesis

10931
07:09:31,680 --> 07:09:33,600
to the body it's really difficult we've

10932
07:09:33,600 --> 07:09:34,958
been trying to attach stuff to the human

10933
07:09:34,958 --> 07:09:37,840
body for a long time i'm sure all of you

10934
07:09:37,840 --> 07:09:40,160
have worn shoes and i'm sure all of you

10935
07:09:40,160 --> 07:09:42,240
have gotten blisters from shoes

10936
07:09:42,240 --> 07:09:44,000
just to kind of highlight how difficult

10937
07:09:44,000 --> 07:09:45,360
it is to put something even

10938
07:09:45,360 --> 07:09:48,080
semi-permanent on the body

10939
07:09:48,080 --> 07:09:50,400
second is signaling so

10940
07:09:50,400 --> 07:09:52,080
okay

10941
07:09:52,080 --> 07:09:54,798
ignoring attachment how do i

10942
07:09:54,798 --> 07:09:57,920
interface and communicate with the body

10943
07:09:57,920 --> 07:09:59,680
systems how do i send signals into the

10944
07:09:59,680 --> 07:10:02,080
body how do i receive signals with the

10945
07:10:02,080 --> 07:10:02,878
body

10946
07:10:02,878 --> 07:10:05,600
and then kind of the last one is control

10947
07:10:05,600 --> 07:10:07,360
once you've got those signals what are

10948
07:10:07,360 --> 07:10:08,638
you doing with them what kind of

10949
07:10:08,638 --> 07:10:10,878
applications and software are you

10950
07:10:10,878 --> 07:10:13,040
putting in place to

10951
07:10:13,040 --> 07:10:15,040
tell your augment or have it communicate

10952
07:10:15,040 --> 07:10:16,478
with other systems and then into the

10953
07:10:16,478 --> 07:10:18,080
body so think of this as your layer six

10954
07:10:18,080 --> 07:10:19,680
and seven on your osi and this is

10955
07:10:19,680 --> 07:10:21,280
actually probably the

10956
07:10:21,280 --> 07:10:24,320
um part of my super special model that

10957
07:10:24,320 --> 07:10:25,920
is the most

10958
07:10:25,920 --> 07:10:28,478
well researched

10959
07:10:28,478 --> 07:10:31,120
so let's start looking at attachment so

10960
07:10:31,120 --> 07:10:32,558
the way we would normally attach a

10961
07:10:32,558 --> 07:10:34,160
prosthesis is with a negative pressure

10962
07:10:34,160 --> 07:10:36,000
socket a valve allows air out as the

10963
07:10:36,000 --> 07:10:37,680
limb is inserted and it suctions onto

10964
07:10:37,680 --> 07:10:39,760
the residual limb

10965
07:10:39,760 --> 07:10:41,120
that's

10966
07:10:41,120 --> 07:10:43,680
kind of difficult um you're trying to

10967
07:10:43,680 --> 07:10:45,760
transmit load into what's left of the

10968
07:10:45,760 --> 07:10:46,638
bone

10969
07:10:46,638 --> 07:10:48,160
through all the

10970
07:10:48,160 --> 07:10:49,760
soft tissue that surrounds it if you

10971
07:10:49,760 --> 07:10:50,958
talk to a prosthetist they would

10972
07:10:50,958 --> 07:10:52,878
describe it as like trying to balance a

10973
07:10:52,878 --> 07:10:55,360
stick in a bucket of jelly

10974
07:10:55,360 --> 07:10:56,958
advances have made it possible to bolt

10975
07:10:56,958 --> 07:10:58,958
it directly to the skeleton

10976
07:10:58,958 --> 07:11:00,798
um the implant is inserted into cavity

10977
07:11:00,798 --> 07:11:02,160
in the bone which goes into the surface

10978
07:11:02,160 --> 07:11:04,958
of the implant over time um basically we

10979
07:11:04,958 --> 07:11:06,718
looked at dental implants and said how

10980
07:11:06,718 --> 07:11:08,320
can i make that bigger and put it in a

10981
07:11:08,320 --> 07:11:11,120
leg so on the left here i've got an

10982
07:11:11,120 --> 07:11:13,680
x-ray of both a um

10983
07:11:13,680 --> 07:11:15,120
osteo integrated implant which is the

10984
07:11:15,120 --> 07:11:17,600
bone anchored and a socket and you can

10985
07:11:17,600 --> 07:11:20,558
see that the actual bone aligns much

10986
07:11:20,558 --> 07:11:22,718
better with the prosthesis

10987
07:11:22,718 --> 07:11:25,040
in the implant and it also gives an idea

10988
07:11:25,040 --> 07:11:26,798
of just how much soft tissue is around

10989
07:11:26,798 --> 07:11:28,798
the bone and how difficult it is to kind

10990
07:11:28,798 --> 07:11:29,920
of control

10991
07:11:29,920 --> 07:11:32,320
the implant itself passes through the

10992
07:11:32,320 --> 07:11:35,120
distal end of the stump um which is just

10993
07:11:35,120 --> 07:11:36,958
the end furthest away from the center of

10994
07:11:36,958 --> 07:11:38,160
mass

10995
07:11:38,160 --> 07:11:39,680
and it passes through the skin

10996
07:11:39,680 --> 07:11:41,040
externally and attaches to the

10997
07:11:41,040 --> 07:11:43,440
prosthesis itself

10998
07:11:43,440 --> 07:11:44,878
so

10999
07:11:44,878 --> 07:11:47,040
let's have a look at where it is at um

11000
07:11:47,040 --> 07:11:48,798
so the first human implantation actually

11001
07:11:48,798 --> 07:11:51,200
go to 1990 we've been doing this for 32

11002
07:11:51,200 --> 07:11:52,558
years um

11003
07:11:52,558 --> 07:11:54,558
hasn't really been kind of in the public

11004
07:11:54,558 --> 07:11:56,320
consciousness for that long um but

11005
07:11:56,320 --> 07:11:57,760
funnily enough here in australia we've

11006
07:11:57,760 --> 07:11:59,200
been doing a lot of really good research

11007
07:11:59,200 --> 07:12:00,718
around it there's a really good surgeon

11008
07:12:00,718 --> 07:12:02,080
down in sydney

11009
07:12:02,080 --> 07:12:04,718
doing some interesting stuff with it

11010
07:12:04,718 --> 07:12:06,638
amputees that get this procedure report

11011
07:12:06,638 --> 07:12:08,558
a pretty significant increased quality

11012
07:12:08,558 --> 07:12:10,638
of life they're more active and engaged

11013
07:12:10,638 --> 07:12:12,478
in their communities they feel like they

11014
07:12:12,478 --> 07:12:14,798
can participate in sports more than more

11015
07:12:14,798 --> 07:12:17,360
confident on the limb um this is really

11016
07:12:17,360 --> 07:12:19,440
good because we see improved walking

11017
07:12:19,440 --> 07:12:21,360
symmetry in especially unilateral

11018
07:12:21,360 --> 07:12:22,478
amputees

11019
07:12:22,478 --> 07:12:24,558
so basically they walk more naturally

11020
07:12:24,558 --> 07:12:26,638
they have a more natural gait

11021
07:12:26,638 --> 07:12:29,840
gait is the term that we use um for

11022
07:12:29,840 --> 07:12:32,558
the study of walking

11023
07:12:32,558 --> 07:12:34,000
improved walking symmetry is really

11024
07:12:34,000 --> 07:12:35,920
important because

11025
07:12:35,920 --> 07:12:39,280
imbalance loads in amputees cause

11026
07:12:39,280 --> 07:12:41,840
arthritis and osteoporosis so we see a

11027
07:12:41,840 --> 07:12:43,840
reduced risk of arthritis in these

11028
07:12:43,840 --> 07:12:44,958
individuals

11029
07:12:44,958 --> 07:12:47,280
um it's easy to take on and off putting

11030
07:12:47,280 --> 07:12:50,478
on a socket is actually quite annoying

11031
07:12:50,478 --> 07:12:52,958
again imagine like a

11032
07:12:52,958 --> 07:12:55,280
12 eye hole boot you have to unlace the

11033
07:12:55,280 --> 07:12:56,638
whole thing

11034
07:12:56,638 --> 07:12:58,400
put your foot into it and then lace it

11035
07:12:58,400 --> 07:13:00,878
back up versus slip-ons is kind of how i

11036
07:13:00,878 --> 07:13:02,638
would equate it we don't really think

11037
07:13:02,638 --> 07:13:04,558
about it that much

11038
07:13:04,558 --> 07:13:06,320
but for an amputee having to do that for

11039
07:13:06,320 --> 07:13:08,878
their entire leg it gets old think about

11040
07:13:08,878 --> 07:13:10,160
having to do that in the middle of the

11041
07:13:10,160 --> 07:13:12,878
night when you want to go to the toilet

11042
07:13:12,878 --> 07:13:13,680
um

11043
07:13:13,680 --> 07:13:15,280
i think one of the most interesting kind

11044
07:13:15,280 --> 07:13:16,718
of side effects that's come out of this

11045
07:13:16,718 --> 07:13:19,520
is bone conduction so because the bone

11046
07:13:19,520 --> 07:13:21,680
grows into the implant over time and it

11047
07:13:21,680 --> 07:13:23,520
essentially becomes a part of you they

11048
07:13:23,520 --> 07:13:25,840
can feel the prosthesis through

11049
07:13:25,840 --> 07:13:27,760
osteoperception mechanoperception

11050
07:13:27,760 --> 07:13:29,200
there's a bunch of different terms for

11051
07:13:29,200 --> 07:13:30,878
it um

11052
07:13:30,878 --> 07:13:33,200
funnily enough if you play if you attach

11053
07:13:33,200 --> 07:13:35,360
like a little vibrating speaker

11054
07:13:35,360 --> 07:13:36,958
to the end of the

11055
07:13:36,958 --> 07:13:38,798
external part of the implant and play a

11056
07:13:38,798 --> 07:13:40,160
song they can hear it in their ears

11057
07:13:40,160 --> 07:13:41,680
through bone conduction which is kind of

11058
07:13:41,680 --> 07:13:44,400
just like a wild side effect

11059
07:13:44,400 --> 07:13:45,840
so this seems really great right what's

11060
07:13:45,840 --> 07:13:47,200
the catch

11061
07:13:47,200 --> 07:13:50,160
all right so it's not simple um

11062
07:13:50,160 --> 07:13:52,000
it's a really complex surgical procedure

11063
07:13:52,000 --> 07:13:53,600
it's really difficult

11064
07:13:53,600 --> 07:13:55,920
rehabilitation is time consuming and

11065
07:13:55,920 --> 07:13:58,240
painful congratulations you've now got a

11066
07:13:58,240 --> 07:14:00,160
titanium rod inserted directly into your

11067
07:14:00,160 --> 07:14:02,160
bone and now you feel like someone has

11068
07:14:02,160 --> 07:14:04,000
just inserted a titanium rod directly

11069
07:14:04,000 --> 07:14:05,840
into your phone

11070
07:14:05,840 --> 07:14:07,920
it's really expensive on an individual

11071
07:14:07,920 --> 07:14:09,680
case-by-case basis you're looking at

11072
07:14:09,680 --> 07:14:11,760
well over six figures in cost

11073
07:14:11,760 --> 07:14:13,840
have patients remortgage their homes to

11074
07:14:13,840 --> 07:14:16,638
pay for these um part of that is the

11075
07:14:16,638 --> 07:14:18,558
surgical cost the actual prosthetic

11076
07:14:18,558 --> 07:14:20,878
itself is very very expensive and if

11077
07:14:20,878 --> 07:14:22,878
you're getting an implant you want the

11078
07:14:22,878 --> 07:14:25,200
top of the line prosthetic leg part of

11079
07:14:25,200 --> 07:14:26,958
that is for safety

11080
07:14:26,958 --> 07:14:30,080
because if you overload the implant you

11081
07:14:30,080 --> 07:14:32,478
can damage break

11082
07:14:32,478 --> 07:14:34,638
snap the bone to the point where you may

11083
07:14:34,638 --> 07:14:38,160
need to have your leg re-amputated and

11084
07:14:38,160 --> 07:14:40,798
once your amputation is high enough you

11085
07:14:40,798 --> 07:14:43,040
can't get another implant

11086
07:14:43,040 --> 07:14:46,000
um another big risk is infection

11087
07:14:46,000 --> 07:14:47,600
congratulations you have now have an

11088
07:14:47,600 --> 07:14:49,440
open wound for the rest of your life

11089
07:14:49,440 --> 07:14:51,920
it's called a stoma um

11090
07:14:51,920 --> 07:14:54,240
diabetics that use insulin pumps people

11091
07:14:54,240 --> 07:14:56,160
that have undergone chemotherapy and had

11092
07:14:56,160 --> 07:14:59,760
a port installed um have similar

11093
07:14:59,760 --> 07:15:01,840
well it's a similar kind of process

11094
07:15:01,840 --> 07:15:03,040
um

11095
07:15:03,040 --> 07:15:04,320
because there is such a high risk of

11096
07:15:04,320 --> 07:15:05,600
infection

11097
07:15:05,600 --> 07:15:07,680
antibiotic use is quite common um

11098
07:15:07,680 --> 07:15:09,280
antibiotics also have a lot of really

11099
07:15:09,280 --> 07:15:10,798
nasty side effects when you take them

11100
07:15:10,798 --> 07:15:12,958
for a long time hepatotoxicity which is

11101
07:15:12,958 --> 07:15:15,120
basically liver toxicity you take

11102
07:15:15,120 --> 07:15:16,718
antibiotics for too long and your liver

11103
07:15:16,718 --> 07:15:19,360
will shut down

11104
07:15:19,360 --> 07:15:22,080
this is a trade-off um and for a lot of

11105
07:15:22,080 --> 07:15:23,600
people it's actually a trade-off that

11106
07:15:23,600 --> 07:15:25,120
they're willing to make

11107
07:15:25,120 --> 07:15:27,440
i had one patient that i had a

11108
07:15:27,440 --> 07:15:30,878
discussion with and his response was

11109
07:15:30,878 --> 07:15:35,040
i would rather have a

11110
07:15:35,040 --> 07:15:38,080
the ability to walk than a functioning

11111
07:15:38,080 --> 07:15:39,600
liver

11112
07:15:39,600 --> 07:15:40,400
but

11113
07:15:40,400 --> 07:15:41,920
it's still a trade-off that people have

11114
07:15:41,920 --> 07:15:43,440
to consider you know you're not getting

11115
07:15:43,440 --> 07:15:45,760
a a cool robot leg and you can sprint

11116
07:15:45,760 --> 07:15:48,000
like adam jensen you have to consider

11117
07:15:48,000 --> 07:15:49,760
this

11118
07:15:49,760 --> 07:15:50,878
so

11119
07:15:50,878 --> 07:15:52,558
that's kind of an overview of attachment

11120
07:15:52,558 --> 07:15:54,000
let's start looking at signaling and

11121
07:15:54,000 --> 07:15:55,840
integration um

11122
07:15:55,840 --> 07:15:57,280
when we think about interfacing with the

11123
07:15:57,280 --> 07:15:59,680
nervous system electrophysiology is the

11124
07:15:59,680 --> 07:16:01,440
study of your body's electrical signals

11125
07:16:01,440 --> 07:16:03,680
um you've probably heard the terms eeg

11126
07:16:03,680 --> 07:16:08,000
ecg emg it's just electro something ram

11127
07:16:08,000 --> 07:16:10,958
um in this case uh encephalo's brain

11128
07:16:10,958 --> 07:16:13,840
c for cardio is heart m for maya was the

11129
07:16:13,840 --> 07:16:14,638
um

11130
07:16:14,638 --> 07:16:16,878
the muscle these are just specific sub

11131
07:16:16,878 --> 07:16:19,520
areas to get the electrical signals out

11132
07:16:19,520 --> 07:16:21,520
of those parts of the body

11133
07:16:21,520 --> 07:16:23,760
um you may have seen those little rounds

11134
07:16:23,760 --> 07:16:25,520
surface electrodes that are relatively

11135
07:16:25,520 --> 07:16:28,240
common um unfortunately

11136
07:16:28,240 --> 07:16:30,638
they're not very good for interfacing

11137
07:16:30,638 --> 07:16:32,240
with the nervous system beyond very

11138
07:16:32,240 --> 07:16:34,718
surface level readings um because when

11139
07:16:34,718 --> 07:16:35,760
you're trying to get to a nerve and

11140
07:16:35,760 --> 07:16:37,920
there's a lot of skin and flesh that's a

11141
07:16:37,920 --> 07:16:40,240
lot of interference in between what's

11142
07:16:40,240 --> 07:16:41,440
picking up the signal and where the

11143
07:16:41,440 --> 07:16:44,000
signal is coming from for such tiny tiny

11144
07:16:44,000 --> 07:16:45,920
voltages so to get more accurate

11145
07:16:45,920 --> 07:16:47,280
measurements you need to go in

11146
07:16:47,280 --> 07:16:48,878
invasively

11147
07:16:48,878 --> 07:16:51,280
which means putting something into or

11148
07:16:51,280 --> 07:16:53,680
directly wrapped around the nerve

11149
07:16:53,680 --> 07:16:54,638
and then the other thing is more

11150
07:16:54,638 --> 07:16:57,040
electrodes is better data it's very rare

11151
07:16:57,040 --> 07:16:58,478
that a nerve

11152
07:16:58,478 --> 07:17:01,840
bundle is going to be doing exactly one

11153
07:17:01,840 --> 07:17:03,920
thing so the more electrodes you put

11154
07:17:03,920 --> 07:17:05,600
around the more signals you can collect

11155
07:17:05,600 --> 07:17:07,280
the better you can process it the better

11156
07:17:07,280 --> 07:17:09,280
you have an idea of what's going on so

11157
07:17:09,280 --> 07:17:11,280
here you can kind of see some of the um

11158
07:17:11,280 --> 07:17:13,680
surface mount electrodes and a needle

11159
07:17:13,680 --> 07:17:15,440
electrode which in this specific use

11160
07:17:15,440 --> 07:17:17,280
case would go into a muscle so you could

11161
07:17:17,280 --> 07:17:19,840
look at muscle activation

11162
07:17:19,840 --> 07:17:21,520
um

11163
07:17:21,520 --> 07:17:23,120
kind of i guess a bit of a case study a

11164
07:17:23,120 --> 07:17:24,320
look at some of the implants that are

11165
07:17:24,320 --> 07:17:26,398
going on with this um two of the primary

11166
07:17:26,398 --> 07:17:27,520
ones in neurostimulation

11167
07:17:27,520 --> 07:17:30,398
electroceuticals um neurostimulation

11168
07:17:30,398 --> 07:17:32,878
falls kind of under the herbie of brain

11169
07:17:32,878 --> 07:17:34,718
computer interfaces depending on the one

11170
07:17:34,718 --> 07:17:36,398
that you're getting um these can be

11171
07:17:36,398 --> 07:17:38,958
invasive or partially invasive which is

11172
07:17:38,958 --> 07:17:40,320
a bit of a misnomer if you're not a

11173
07:17:40,320 --> 07:17:41,600
medical person

11174
07:17:41,600 --> 07:17:43,040
both of them are going inside of you and

11175
07:17:43,040 --> 07:17:45,120
both of them require surgery invasive is

11176
07:17:45,120 --> 07:17:46,958
just going into your brain itself

11177
07:17:46,958 --> 07:17:49,120
partially invasive sits between the

11178
07:17:49,120 --> 07:17:51,200
brain and your skull

11179
07:17:51,200 --> 07:17:53,680
um so really they're both invasive just

11180
07:17:53,680 --> 07:17:55,760
one slightly more than the other

11181
07:17:55,760 --> 07:17:58,000
on the neurostimulation side um we've

11182
07:17:58,000 --> 07:18:00,080
seen treatments in parkinson's and

11183
07:18:00,080 --> 07:18:02,398
epilepsy through deep brain stimulation

11184
07:18:02,398 --> 07:18:04,240
put a needle into the motor cortex and

11185
07:18:04,240 --> 07:18:05,520
see what it does

11186
07:18:05,520 --> 07:18:07,120
there's really interesting footage

11187
07:18:07,120 --> 07:18:09,200
because you have to be awake when it's

11188
07:18:09,200 --> 07:18:11,520
implanted to have a look at how your

11189
07:18:11,520 --> 07:18:14,478
parkinson's shakes change with the

11190
07:18:14,478 --> 07:18:16,638
stimulation in the brain so there's good

11191
07:18:16,638 --> 07:18:18,878
footage of someone playing the banjo

11192
07:18:18,878 --> 07:18:20,878
while the neurosurgeon is wrist deep in

11193
07:18:20,878 --> 07:18:22,558
their skull if that's the kind of thing

11194
07:18:22,558 --> 07:18:25,040
that you're into it's really really cool

11195
07:18:25,040 --> 07:18:27,120
um another kind of interesting

11196
07:18:27,120 --> 07:18:28,718
application of neurostimulation is

11197
07:18:28,718 --> 07:18:31,280
cochlear implants um two part implant

11198
07:18:31,280 --> 07:18:33,440
external and internal external has a

11199
07:18:33,440 --> 07:18:36,160
microphone an audio processor internal

11200
07:18:36,160 --> 07:18:38,478
has a microprocessor that takes that

11201
07:18:38,478 --> 07:18:41,600
audio converts it into a signal that the

11202
07:18:41,600 --> 07:18:43,360
nerve can use and then part of it is

11203
07:18:43,360 --> 07:18:45,280
implanted into the auditory nerve and

11204
07:18:45,280 --> 07:18:48,080
then the brain can process those signals

11205
07:18:48,080 --> 07:18:51,760
into what we would hear is speech

11206
07:18:51,760 --> 07:18:53,600
electroceuticals are another area of

11207
07:18:53,600 --> 07:18:56,798
interest um it's like drugs but electro

11208
07:18:56,798 --> 07:18:58,080
so

11209
07:18:58,080 --> 07:18:59,840
basically think about instead of taking

11210
07:18:59,840 --> 07:19:01,040
a pill in the morning you have an

11211
07:19:01,040 --> 07:19:02,958
implant that tells your body to do what

11212
07:19:02,958 --> 07:19:05,680
it needs to do so uh i guess a way that

11213
07:19:05,680 --> 07:19:07,040
i would explain this is if you're a

11214
07:19:07,040 --> 07:19:08,958
diabetic you need to take

11215
07:19:08,958 --> 07:19:11,280
insulin or in some cases you may need to

11216
07:19:11,280 --> 07:19:12,798
take insulin

11217
07:19:12,798 --> 07:19:14,320
which means usually needles and

11218
07:19:14,320 --> 07:19:15,920
injections and having to remember and

11219
07:19:15,920 --> 07:19:18,320
check your blood sugar now imagine you

11220
07:19:18,320 --> 07:19:20,080
had an implant that just adapts to your

11221
07:19:20,080 --> 07:19:21,840
pancreas and forced it to make insulin

11222
07:19:21,840 --> 07:19:22,718
again

11223
07:19:22,718 --> 07:19:25,440
it's kind of how electrosuitables work

11224
07:19:25,440 --> 07:19:27,200
um

11225
07:19:27,200 --> 07:19:29,680
we're starting to see their use in

11226
07:19:29,680 --> 07:19:32,240
stimulation of the vagus nerve now the

11227
07:19:32,240 --> 07:19:35,200
vagus nerve for those who um

11228
07:19:35,200 --> 07:19:38,320
don't have a background in anatomy it is

11229
07:19:38,320 --> 07:19:40,320
um it controls the parasympathetic

11230
07:19:40,320 --> 07:19:42,958
nervous system so again a bit of medical

11231
07:19:42,958 --> 07:19:44,240
jargon

11232
07:19:44,240 --> 07:19:46,000
basically the parasympathetic nervous

11233
07:19:46,000 --> 07:19:48,718
system is the control system of your

11234
07:19:48,718 --> 07:19:49,600
body

11235
07:19:49,600 --> 07:19:51,760
that keeps everything running that

11236
07:19:51,760 --> 07:19:53,600
you're not aware of

11237
07:19:53,600 --> 07:19:56,638
rest digest feed and breed is

11238
07:19:56,638 --> 07:19:58,798
a bit of a

11239
07:19:58,798 --> 07:20:02,240
mnemonic for what it does

11240
07:20:02,240 --> 07:20:02,958
so

11241
07:20:02,958 --> 07:20:04,320
it actually

11242
07:20:04,320 --> 07:20:06,398
covering so much um

11243
07:20:06,398 --> 07:20:08,240
we're seeing stimulation of the vagus

11244
07:20:08,240 --> 07:20:09,840
nerve actually

11245
07:20:09,840 --> 07:20:12,160
see positive outcomes in things such as

11246
07:20:12,160 --> 07:20:13,280
depression

11247
07:20:13,280 --> 07:20:14,160
um

11248
07:20:14,160 --> 07:20:15,440
ptsd

11249
07:20:15,440 --> 07:20:17,360
and interestingly you see a lot of talk

11250
07:20:17,360 --> 07:20:19,440
about the brain guy interface in things

11251
07:20:19,440 --> 07:20:21,440
like inflammatory bowel disease in

11252
07:20:21,440 --> 07:20:23,360
autoimmune disorders because you can

11253
07:20:23,360 --> 07:20:25,600
down regulate the activity of the immune

11254
07:20:25,600 --> 07:20:28,878
system in specific parts of the body

11255
07:20:28,878 --> 07:20:31,280
so and this is just one nerve kind of

11256
07:20:31,280 --> 07:20:32,878
comes down from the base of your skull

11257
07:20:32,878 --> 07:20:34,478
and it is controlling a lot of this

11258
07:20:34,478 --> 07:20:36,240
stuff so if you can tap into that system

11259
07:20:36,240 --> 07:20:38,240
effectively you can tell your body to do

11260
07:20:38,240 --> 07:20:40,878
a lot of really interesting things

11261
07:20:40,878 --> 07:20:42,240
again

11262
07:20:42,240 --> 07:20:44,638
what's the catch

11263
07:20:44,638 --> 07:20:48,160
so the first one is material science um

11264
07:20:48,160 --> 07:20:49,840
electrodes don't bend the way the tissue

11265
07:20:49,840 --> 07:20:51,040
does there is difference in the

11266
07:20:51,040 --> 07:20:52,958
mechanical properties of the electrode

11267
07:20:52,958 --> 07:20:55,280
and the nerve that's implanted into over

11268
07:20:55,280 --> 07:20:57,040
time this can lead to migration of the

11269
07:20:57,040 --> 07:20:59,280
electrode which can lead to scar tissue

11270
07:20:59,280 --> 07:21:01,040
in the nerves

11271
07:21:01,040 --> 07:21:03,600
not a particularly pleasant experience

11272
07:21:03,600 --> 07:21:05,040
um

11273
07:21:05,040 --> 07:21:06,558
the other thing is you can get a foreign

11274
07:21:06,558 --> 07:21:09,040
body response causing glial cell beat up

11275
07:21:09,040 --> 07:21:09,840
uh

11276
07:21:09,840 --> 07:21:12,000
you know build up yes for those of you

11277
07:21:12,000 --> 07:21:13,440
who've played deus ex that is what

11278
07:21:13,440 --> 07:21:14,718
neuropathy

11279
07:21:14,718 --> 07:21:18,080
um stops though i also build up

11280
07:21:18,080 --> 07:21:19,840
and then for anyone who has any kind of

11281
07:21:19,840 --> 07:21:21,920
understanding of electrochemistry

11282
07:21:21,920 --> 07:21:23,600
reduction and oxidation reactions when

11283
07:21:23,600 --> 07:21:26,160
you have a cathode in an anode

11284
07:21:26,160 --> 07:21:27,520
and depending on whether the electrode

11285
07:21:27,520 --> 07:21:29,440
is a cathode or an anode it can either

11286
07:21:29,440 --> 07:21:30,398
degrade

11287
07:21:30,398 --> 07:21:32,478
and disappear into the nerve leaving a

11288
07:21:32,478 --> 07:21:34,958
lot of nasty toxic buildup in the nerve

11289
07:21:34,958 --> 07:21:36,958
also super painful super unpleasant

11290
07:21:36,958 --> 07:21:40,320
definitely not what you want um

11291
07:21:40,320 --> 07:21:42,080
on the flip side you can get oxidative

11292
07:21:42,080 --> 07:21:45,280
buildups around the electrode itself

11293
07:21:45,280 --> 07:21:47,600
which limits its ability to send and

11294
07:21:47,600 --> 07:21:49,440
receive any signals because suddenly

11295
07:21:49,440 --> 07:21:51,360
you've got all this crap around it and

11296
07:21:51,360 --> 07:21:52,958
it can't really pick up the signals very

11297
07:21:52,958 --> 07:21:54,798
well

11298
07:21:54,798 --> 07:21:57,199
the other

11299
07:21:57,280 --> 07:21:59,120
complexity is

11300
07:21:59,120 --> 07:22:01,120
nervous system complexity

11301
07:22:01,120 --> 07:22:03,520
as i said the nervous system is super

11302
07:22:03,520 --> 07:22:06,398
complex um mapping it is really really

11303
07:22:06,398 --> 07:22:08,320
really difficult we still don't have a

11304
07:22:08,320 --> 07:22:10,398
very good map of what it does

11305
07:22:10,398 --> 07:22:13,280
and it varies from person to person the

11306
07:22:13,280 --> 07:22:15,440
other thing is it's an adaptive system

11307
07:22:15,440 --> 07:22:18,478
it changes based on input when you put

11308
07:22:18,478 --> 07:22:20,478
an implant into the nervous system the

11309
07:22:20,478 --> 07:22:22,000
nervous system will accommodate this can

11310
07:22:22,000 --> 07:22:24,958
be positive or negative things like um

11311
07:22:24,958 --> 07:22:27,840
cochlear implants your brain adjusts to

11312
07:22:27,840 --> 07:22:30,160
understand what those signals are and

11313
07:22:30,160 --> 07:22:32,320
how to translate them to speech in other

11314
07:22:32,320 --> 07:22:34,638
systems it can adjust so that it's going

11315
07:22:34,638 --> 07:22:36,638
to ignore that input depending on what

11316
07:22:36,638 --> 07:22:38,160
is going on

11317
07:22:38,160 --> 07:22:39,360
um

11318
07:22:39,360 --> 07:22:41,760
it's also really difficult to target a

11319
07:22:41,760 --> 07:22:44,160
single nerve um i said that vagus nerve

11320
07:22:44,160 --> 07:22:45,840
covered rest digest feed and breed

11321
07:22:45,840 --> 07:22:48,080
that's a lot of functions

11322
07:22:48,080 --> 07:22:50,718
what happens if you get that wrong

11323
07:22:50,718 --> 07:22:52,000
so

11324
07:22:52,000 --> 07:22:53,600
in the case of things like deep brain

11325
07:22:53,600 --> 07:22:56,000
stimulation um i think this is because

11326
07:22:56,000 --> 07:22:57,840
the motor cortex is supposed to be close

11327
07:22:57,840 --> 07:22:59,680
to the visual cortex you can get things

11328
07:22:59,680 --> 07:23:02,000
such as hallucinations you can see

11329
07:23:02,000 --> 07:23:04,878
personality shifts because you know it's

11330
07:23:04,878 --> 07:23:07,520
neurosurgery um

11331
07:23:07,520 --> 07:23:09,760
from vagus nerve simulation you can see

11332
07:23:09,760 --> 07:23:11,360
changes in voice patterns which is kind

11333
07:23:11,360 --> 07:23:12,718
of an odd

11334
07:23:12,718 --> 07:23:14,160
it wasn't

11335
07:23:14,160 --> 07:23:16,240
kind of realized how much the vagus

11336
07:23:16,240 --> 07:23:18,160
nerve did and how

11337
07:23:18,160 --> 07:23:20,478
many tangential systems it touched

11338
07:23:20,478 --> 07:23:22,240
until people started having changes in

11339
07:23:22,240 --> 07:23:26,080
voice cadence in pitch in tone

11340
07:23:26,080 --> 07:23:27,120
when they

11341
07:23:27,120 --> 07:23:30,398
kind of underwent these surgeries

11342
07:23:30,398 --> 07:23:31,280
so

11343
07:23:31,280 --> 07:23:33,360
that's interfacing let's have a look at

11344
07:23:33,360 --> 07:23:35,120
control and it's a cyber security

11345
07:23:35,120 --> 07:23:36,638
conference um

11346
07:23:36,638 --> 07:23:37,920
and we can kind of touch on that a

11347
07:23:37,920 --> 07:23:39,680
little bit i've got some time because

11348
07:23:39,680 --> 07:23:41,120
control is where we start thinking about

11349
07:23:41,120 --> 07:23:43,120
security considerations nobody wants to

11350
07:23:43,120 --> 07:23:44,558
end up like ghost in the shell where

11351
07:23:44,558 --> 07:23:45,840
they can have their brain hacked and

11352
07:23:45,840 --> 07:23:49,440
have a person censor their face off

11353
07:23:49,440 --> 07:23:50,718
so

11354
07:23:50,718 --> 07:23:52,320
a lot of this tech is pre-market it's

11355
07:23:52,320 --> 07:23:53,680
really difficult to assess security

11356
07:23:53,680 --> 07:23:56,478
considerations of stuff that

11357
07:23:56,478 --> 07:23:58,000
doesn't exist in the market and that

11358
07:23:58,000 --> 07:23:59,840
security researchers don't have access

11359
07:23:59,840 --> 07:24:02,160
to but broadly i would lump this

11360
07:24:02,160 --> 07:24:05,520
technology into kind of two overarching

11361
07:24:05,520 --> 07:24:07,760
categories the first one being similar

11362
07:24:07,760 --> 07:24:10,558
to iot devices

11363
07:24:10,558 --> 07:24:12,878
along with the same considerations um

11364
07:24:12,878 --> 07:24:14,320
that you would have in security and

11365
07:24:14,320 --> 07:24:15,840
software architecture that come with

11366
07:24:15,840 --> 07:24:17,760
those you've got client side and a

11367
07:24:17,760 --> 07:24:19,120
server side

11368
07:24:19,120 --> 07:24:20,478
um

11369
07:24:20,478 --> 07:24:22,240
a lot of these systems uh there are

11370
07:24:22,240 --> 07:24:23,760
companies that make prosthetic legs that

11371
07:24:23,760 --> 07:24:25,920
have a little bluetooth signal that have

11372
07:24:25,920 --> 07:24:27,520
an application on your phone and then

11373
07:24:27,520 --> 07:24:28,878
there's server-side data that goes

11374
07:24:28,878 --> 07:24:30,160
around and that's how you can control

11375
07:24:30,160 --> 07:24:32,718
and adjust the behavior of the leg

11376
07:24:32,718 --> 07:24:35,040
uh the other kind of family that i would

11377
07:24:35,040 --> 07:24:37,920
uh lump stuff into is similar to ot or

11378
07:24:37,920 --> 07:24:39,920
industrial control systems not quite at

11379
07:24:39,920 --> 07:24:41,520
the same stuff as

11380
07:24:41,520 --> 07:24:44,478
scada but

11381
07:24:44,478 --> 07:24:46,080
for the use case of throwing broad

11382
07:24:46,080 --> 07:24:48,398
brushes i think this is the most kind of

11383
07:24:48,398 --> 07:24:49,360
uh

11384
07:24:49,360 --> 07:24:51,120
applicable example

11385
07:24:51,120 --> 07:24:53,520
um an interesting case study on security

11386
07:24:53,520 --> 07:24:55,840
is that in 2019

11387
07:24:55,840 --> 07:24:57,920
some kaspersky researchers demonstrated

11388
07:24:57,920 --> 07:24:59,600
vulnerabilities in a bionic account by

11389
07:24:59,600 --> 07:25:02,240
motorica and they weren't able to access

11390
07:25:02,240 --> 07:25:04,798
the firmware of the arm itself but they

11391
07:25:04,798 --> 07:25:06,878
got into the phone application they were

11392
07:25:06,878 --> 07:25:08,718
able to adjust some of the

11393
07:25:08,718 --> 07:25:11,680
communications protocols and settings

11394
07:25:11,680 --> 07:25:12,718
in the

11395
07:25:12,718 --> 07:25:14,398
um that way and then they were able to

11396
07:25:14,398 --> 07:25:15,680
get onto the server side and steal a

11397
07:25:15,680 --> 07:25:17,200
bunch of patient information they were

11398
07:25:17,200 --> 07:25:18,638
researchers so they were really good

11399
07:25:18,638 --> 07:25:21,440
about it and and notified motorica but

11400
07:25:21,440 --> 07:25:23,520
you know nobody wants their arm punching

11401
07:25:23,520 --> 07:25:26,000
them in the face

11402
07:25:26,000 --> 07:25:27,440
another thing when we start looking at

11403
07:25:27,440 --> 07:25:30,398
brain implants is neurosecurity um so

11404
07:25:30,398 --> 07:25:32,478
this is an

11405
07:25:32,478 --> 07:25:34,638
recent ish term i believe was coined by

11406
07:25:34,638 --> 07:25:36,798
darpa in the early 2000s i'm sure you

11407
07:25:36,798 --> 07:25:38,638
can guess from the term it concerns the

11408
07:25:38,638 --> 07:25:41,040
security of neurological devices

11409
07:25:41,040 --> 07:25:43,680
in fact in 2017 some auckland university

11410
07:25:43,680 --> 07:25:45,840
researchers managed to hack a brain

11411
07:25:45,840 --> 07:25:47,680
computer interface um this was just an

11412
07:25:47,680 --> 07:25:49,280
external one so one of those ones that

11413
07:25:49,280 --> 07:25:51,120
sits on your skull doesn't require any

11414
07:25:51,120 --> 07:25:52,878
surgery it's not going into your brain

11415
07:25:52,878 --> 07:25:54,798
but they use a replay attack to violate

11416
07:25:54,798 --> 07:25:56,958
the integrity of the um system and they

11417
07:25:56,958 --> 07:25:58,878
were able to alter the commands that

11418
07:25:58,878 --> 07:26:00,798
were recorded from the brain and then

11419
07:26:00,798 --> 07:26:02,558
sent to the host

11420
07:26:02,558 --> 07:26:04,320
system

11421
07:26:04,320 --> 07:26:05,520
it's not

11422
07:26:05,520 --> 07:26:07,840
a particularly surprising fact that they

11423
07:26:07,840 --> 07:26:10,160
were able to do this replay attacks are

11424
07:26:10,160 --> 07:26:12,000
not new

11425
07:26:12,000 --> 07:26:13,920
in this specific case the fact that they

11426
07:26:13,920 --> 07:26:15,840
were able to do it is also unsurprising

11427
07:26:15,840 --> 07:26:17,280
given that it was kind of a an

11428
07:26:17,280 --> 07:26:18,878
experimental system security

11429
07:26:18,878 --> 07:26:20,398
considerations hadn't necessarily been

11430
07:26:20,398 --> 07:26:22,878
baked into it but it does

11431
07:26:22,878 --> 07:26:25,600
raise some interesting conundrums

11432
07:26:25,600 --> 07:26:27,760
nobody wants their brain hijacked nobody

11433
07:26:27,760 --> 07:26:28,718
wants

11434
07:26:28,718 --> 07:26:30,798
things read out of their brain and

11435
07:26:30,798 --> 07:26:33,120
nobody wants things written

11436
07:26:33,120 --> 07:26:35,360
into their brain they have no control

11437
07:26:35,360 --> 07:26:36,958
over

11438
07:26:36,958 --> 07:26:39,920
so on that note um it kind of comes to

11439
07:26:39,920 --> 07:26:42,958
the end of my talk i hope that i was

11440
07:26:42,958 --> 07:26:45,120
able to give you an overview of an

11441
07:26:45,120 --> 07:26:46,878
interesting area of technology that

11442
07:26:46,878 --> 07:26:48,240
maybe a lot of you haven't necessarily

11443
07:26:48,240 --> 07:26:49,760
been exposed to

11444
07:26:49,760 --> 07:26:50,840
um

11445
07:26:50,840 --> 07:26:53,760
and thank you for listening i'm in the

11446
07:26:53,760 --> 07:26:55,360
discord channel so if you have any

11447
07:26:55,360 --> 07:26:57,680
questions feel free to ping me you can

11448
07:26:57,680 --> 07:26:59,520
also find me on twitter and there's my

11449
07:26:59,520 --> 07:27:01,600
discord handle um i can't guarantee that

11450
07:27:01,600 --> 07:27:03,040
you won't lose a few brain cells if you

11451
07:27:03,040 --> 07:27:04,558
do choose to follow me on twitter so

11452
07:27:04,558 --> 07:27:07,840
apologies about that

11453
07:27:09,360 --> 07:27:10,798
i have control over games computer at

11454
07:27:10,798 --> 07:27:12,558
the moment so i will

11455
07:27:12,558 --> 07:27:16,160
stop sharing and yeah

11456
07:27:16,160 --> 07:27:17,440
thank you

11457
07:27:17,440 --> 07:27:20,239
you're very welcome

11458
07:27:20,320 --> 07:27:21,760
sure

11459
07:27:21,760 --> 07:27:23,040
i want to take him back over hand it

11460
07:27:23,040 --> 07:27:25,040
back over and we'll hand it back to ian

11461
07:27:25,040 --> 07:27:27,760
okay unless you have questions for me um

11462
07:27:27,760 --> 07:27:29,360
questions in the discord okay um that'd

11463
07:27:29,360 --> 07:27:30,958
be really good to get your thoughts on

11464
07:27:30,958 --> 07:27:33,360
all right um so yeah have a look just

11465
07:27:33,360 --> 07:27:34,718
for when you get a chance all right

11466
07:27:34,718 --> 07:27:36,878
there's actually a few actually um okay

11467
07:27:36,878 --> 07:27:38,878
pinga also says a few things so yeah i

11468
07:27:38,878 --> 07:27:40,558
will get to those and hand control back

11469
07:27:40,558 --> 07:27:42,878
to ian who's seen that anxiously i

11470
07:27:42,878 --> 07:27:44,798
wasn't sitting there anxiously standing

11471
07:27:44,798 --> 07:27:48,240
i was not standing there anxiously

11472
07:27:48,240 --> 07:27:49,760
i was stuck

11473
07:27:49,760 --> 07:27:52,320
i was perfectly capable of oh god i'm

11474
07:27:52,320 --> 07:27:54,398
tripping alex over i was perfectly

11475
07:27:54,398 --> 07:27:56,320
capable of handing over control to other

11476
07:27:56,320 --> 07:27:58,320
people

11477
07:27:58,320 --> 07:28:00,718
honest

11478
07:28:01,440 --> 07:28:03,840
um

11479
07:28:04,160 --> 07:28:05,120

this is not sponsored by

11564
07:31:07,600 --> 07:31:09,360
actually you probably are

11565
07:31:09,360 --> 07:31:10,798
well we probably are known in fact we're

11566
07:31:10,798 --> 07:31:13,440
sponsored by big farming and big chicken

11567
07:31:13,440 --> 07:31:15,600
like it honestly wouldn't surprise me at

11568
07:31:15,600 --> 07:31:17,920
this point the next comfy con we don't

11569
07:31:17,920 --> 07:31:20,080
take sponsorship from cyber security

11570
07:31:20,080 --> 07:31:21,520
vendors

11571
07:31:21,520 --> 07:31:23,520
sponsorship from

11572
07:31:23,520 --> 07:31:24,638
chicken

11573
07:31:24,638 --> 07:31:27,360
production places so england's kfc red

11574
07:31:27,360 --> 07:31:30,000
rooster bring on your sponsorship

11575
07:31:30,000 --> 07:31:31,520
say that in a joking manner but that's

11576
07:31:31,520 --> 07:31:32,478
the model

11577
07:31:32,478 --> 07:31:35,120
jokingly the ltt takes the linus tech

11578
07:31:35,120 --> 07:31:36,958
tips they get sponsorship from all this

11579
07:31:36,958 --> 07:31:38,878
random crap because it's not competitors

11580
07:31:38,878 --> 07:31:41,280
to them and also if they insult them

11581
07:31:41,280 --> 07:31:43,440
during their reviews that they don't

11582
07:31:43,440 --> 07:31:45,120
have to worry about the money so like

11583
07:31:45,120 --> 07:31:46,798
they have coffee they have rugs they

11584
07:31:46,798 --> 07:31:48,000
have a whole bunch of different things

11585
07:31:48,000 --> 07:31:49,360
and it's literally because it's

11586
07:31:49,360 --> 07:31:52,958
divestifying their um diversifying sorry

11587
07:31:52,958 --> 07:31:54,000
their

11588
07:31:54,000 --> 07:31:55,520
advertising revenue

11589
07:31:55,520 --> 07:31:57,280
i mean we're already advertising chicken

11590
07:31:57,280 --> 07:32:00,398
and fried chicken like this

11591
07:32:00,398 --> 07:32:02,558

need to plug our sponsors i mean i'm

11593
07:32:04,478 --> 07:32:06,000
pretty sure that we've you know we got

11594
07:32:06,000 --> 07:32:07,440
that covered we could just

11595
07:32:07,440 --> 07:32:09,920
print out discord and say hey kfc

11596

07:33:40,878 --> 07:33:43,120
well done well done to the crew

11642
07:33:43,120 --> 07:33:44,478
um

11643
07:33:44,478 --> 07:33:46,638
today yeah i want to talk about big

11644
07:33:46,638 --> 07:33:49,440
bounty hall of fame or shame depending

11645
07:33:49,440 --> 07:33:50,718
on how you look at it

11646
07:33:50,718 --> 07:33:53,120
a bit of a sneak peek to the best or

11647
07:33:53,120 --> 07:33:54,320
worst

11648
07:33:54,320 --> 07:33:56,478
submissions that we've

11649
07:33:56,478 --> 07:33:57,840
received

11650
07:33:57,840 --> 07:33:58,718
um

11651
07:33:58,718 --> 07:34:01,360
we'll have a look at why they exist

11652
07:34:01,360 --> 07:34:03,120
what can we do about them

11653
07:34:03,120 --> 07:34:04,558
if anything

11654
07:34:04,558 --> 07:34:07,920
um yeah and how to how to go forward

11655
07:34:07,920 --> 07:34:09,280
so

11656
07:34:09,280 --> 07:34:11,360
first up

11657
07:34:11,360 --> 07:34:13,200
do you mean bug bounty did you make a

11658
07:34:13,200 --> 07:34:16,638
typo um no no there's a bit of a meme in

11659
07:34:16,638 --> 07:34:19,200
the industry it's called big bounty

11660
07:34:19,200 --> 07:34:22,240
whereby you submit a finding that

11661
07:34:22,240 --> 07:34:24,320
doesn't really have any impact and then

11662
07:34:24,320 --> 07:34:26,240
you just keep annoying the person and

11663
07:34:26,240 --> 07:34:27,840
hopefully get paid

11664
07:34:27,840 --> 07:34:29,040
we'll talk about different types in a

11665
07:34:29,040 --> 07:34:30,718
sec but this is basically it it's like

11666
07:34:30,718 --> 07:34:32,958
hey you know i found your websites

11667
07:34:32,958 --> 07:34:34,798
online it doesn't have any x frame

11668
07:34:34,798 --> 07:34:37,600
options header um can i have 50 top 50

11669
07:34:37,600 --> 07:34:40,080
please and it's like well okay cool but

11670
07:34:40,080 --> 07:34:42,958
what's the impact

11671
07:34:43,040 --> 07:34:45,360
um

11672
07:34:46,558 --> 07:34:49,520
kind of three main types that i've

11673
07:34:49,520 --> 07:34:51,920
seen um i'm sure there's

11674
07:34:51,920 --> 07:34:53,920
more but they kind of fit into this type

11675
07:34:53,920 --> 07:34:56,478
of category um the main one is the

11676
07:34:56,478 --> 07:34:58,160
unintentional ones and the people who

11677
07:34:58,160 --> 07:35:00,798
are learning right they genuine mistake

11678
07:35:00,798 --> 07:35:02,798
they look at your scope they look at

11679
07:35:02,798 --> 07:35:05,440
your website and they go oh cool i found

11680
07:35:05,440 --> 07:35:08,478
this i read that this is a bug in a book

11681
07:35:08,478 --> 07:35:10,240
um they haven't really gotten to the

11682
07:35:10,240 --> 07:35:13,120
stage of really figuring out an impact

11683
07:35:13,120 --> 07:35:15,200
or context or anything like that they

11684
07:35:15,200 --> 07:35:17,280
submit it they get excited

11685
07:35:17,280 --> 07:35:18,398
okay

11686
07:35:18,398 --> 07:35:20,958
fair enough attempt not so bad

11687
07:35:20,958 --> 07:35:22,718
um then there are the spray and pray

11688
07:35:22,718 --> 07:35:24,398
ones the ones that you can obviously

11689
07:35:24,398 --> 07:35:26,798
tell they've sent the submission to just

11690
07:35:26,798 --> 07:35:29,600
everyone hoping for the best

11691
07:35:29,600 --> 07:35:31,920
hoping to pick out people that

11692
07:35:31,920 --> 07:35:34,958
maybe aren't as security conscious and

11693
07:35:34,958 --> 07:35:37,920
and go uh yeah you know that looks bad i

11694
07:35:37,920 --> 07:35:39,600
should probably fix it and yeah they're

11695
07:35:39,600 --> 07:35:40,958
asking to be paid i guess that's fair

11696
07:35:40,958 --> 07:35:42,798
enough i'll just pay them

11697
07:35:42,798 --> 07:35:45,120
i've had clients come up to me and go

11698
07:35:45,120 --> 07:35:47,680
hey we received this this submission

11699
07:35:47,680 --> 07:35:48,718
is it

11700
07:35:48,718 --> 07:35:50,718
actually something we should worry about

11701
07:35:50,718 --> 07:35:52,080
and that's something that i investigated

11702
07:35:52,080 --> 07:35:53,440
before

11703
07:35:53,440 --> 07:35:55,040
the third one and the worst is the

11704
07:35:55,040 --> 07:35:56,878
misleading and malicious ones is that

11705
07:35:56,878 --> 07:35:58,958
they they're actively trying to trick

11706
07:35:58,958 --> 07:36:00,000
people

11707
07:36:00,000 --> 07:36:02,240
into believing their vulnerabilities in

11708
07:36:02,240 --> 07:36:04,958
their websites or in their scope

11709
07:36:04,958 --> 07:36:06,638
i have one example actually maybe a

11710
07:36:06,638 --> 07:36:08,160
couple of examples

11711
07:36:08,160 --> 07:36:10,160
of these and what they look like but

11712
07:36:10,160 --> 07:36:10,958
yeah

11713
07:36:10,958 --> 07:36:14,240
these are again they're not really

11714
07:36:14,240 --> 07:36:15,520
just hoping for the best they're

11715
07:36:15,520 --> 07:36:17,120
intentionally trying to mislead and

11716
07:36:17,120 --> 07:36:17,920
trick

11717
07:36:17,920 --> 07:36:19,520
people that don't

11718
07:36:19,520 --> 07:36:22,240
know as much about infosec as maybe a

11719
07:36:22,240 --> 07:36:24,240
lot of people in this room

11720
07:36:24,240 --> 07:36:26,478
um so i've got a bunch of cool examples

11721
07:36:26,478 --> 07:36:28,798
of all of these it's going to be fun

11722
07:36:28,798 --> 07:36:30,478
um but firstly i do want to mention

11723
07:36:30,478 --> 07:36:31,920
right like and this is probably the only

11724
07:36:31,920 --> 07:36:33,600
time i want to talk about vulcas at all

11725
07:36:33,600 --> 07:36:36,240
but we do have a bug bounty uh

11726
07:36:36,240 --> 07:36:38,718
vulnerability disclosure program and it

11727
07:36:38,718 --> 07:36:40,718
does specifically say

11728
07:36:40,718 --> 07:36:42,638
these things are out of scope

11729
07:36:42,638 --> 07:36:43,680
right

11730
07:36:43,680 --> 07:36:46,878
regardless of that we still see so many

11731
07:36:46,878 --> 07:36:49,680
bug bounties like we're a small company

11732
07:36:49,680 --> 07:36:53,120
um i didn't expect to see so many

11733
07:36:53,120 --> 07:36:55,440
as a side note yeah

11734
07:36:55,440 --> 07:36:58,000
matt who's sitting just there

11735
07:36:58,000 --> 07:37:01,440
will make you cookies if you find a p1

11736
07:37:01,440 --> 07:37:02,320
so

11737
07:37:02,320 --> 07:37:05,760
this is just these are just the emails

11738
07:37:05,760 --> 07:37:07,600
that were sent

11739
07:37:07,600 --> 07:37:10,398
through our contact form online like

11740
07:37:10,398 --> 07:37:12,478
this is people just testing a contact us

11741
07:37:12,478 --> 07:37:14,398
form this isn't even like all the other

11742
07:37:14,398 --> 07:37:15,440
stuff

11743
07:37:15,440 --> 07:37:17,600
you can see there's just

11744
07:37:17,600 --> 07:37:19,440
a bunch of it

11745
07:37:19,440 --> 07:37:22,080
and a bunch of it and it just never ends

11746
07:37:22,080 --> 07:37:24,320
and it's always fun

11747
07:37:24,320 --> 07:37:25,360
so

11748
07:37:25,360 --> 07:37:27,840
let's talk about some of the examples

11749
07:37:27,840 --> 07:37:31,040
and the different types right

11750
07:37:31,040 --> 07:37:32,638
i'm not going to make you read this but

11751
07:37:32,638 --> 07:37:34,398
it's basically kind of carrying on from

11752
07:37:34,398 --> 07:37:36,478
the example i gave earlier hey you don't

11753
07:37:36,478 --> 07:37:38,958
have x frame options in your

11754
07:37:38,958 --> 07:37:41,680
handbook website um

11755
07:37:41,680 --> 07:37:42,878
okay

11756
07:37:42,878 --> 07:37:45,520
what's what's the impact

11757
07:37:45,520 --> 07:37:47,760
um

11758
07:37:48,080 --> 07:37:50,718
here they're saying you know they can

11759
07:37:50,718 --> 07:37:52,718
send them malicious links

11760
07:37:52,718 --> 07:37:54,398
user opens and clicks some image and

11761
07:37:54,398 --> 07:37:55,920
their account

11762
07:37:55,920 --> 07:37:58,000
unconsciously has been deactivated i'm

11763
07:37:58,000 --> 07:37:59,600
like oh cool i didn't know we had

11764
07:37:59,600 --> 07:38:02,240
accounts in handbook did you

11765
07:38:02,240 --> 07:38:04,878
no i didn't either

11766
07:38:04,878 --> 07:38:07,440
so you know try and give them the

11767
07:38:07,440 --> 07:38:09,360
benefit of the doubt and go i don't

11768
07:38:09,360 --> 07:38:11,440
really understand the impact here you're

11769
07:38:11,440 --> 07:38:12,558
talking about accounts we don't have

11770
07:38:12,558 --> 07:38:14,718
accounts um can you just clarify what

11771
07:38:14,718 --> 07:38:17,840
the impact is if any

11772
07:38:17,840 --> 07:38:19,600
you know to their credit they go yep i

11773
07:38:19,600 --> 07:38:20,958
know it's static but there must be a

11774
07:38:20,958 --> 07:38:23,600
next frame options header like wow okay

11775
07:38:23,600 --> 07:38:25,040
must be

11776
07:38:25,040 --> 07:38:27,040
to prevent click checking okay fair

11777
07:38:27,040 --> 07:38:27,920
enough

11778
07:38:27,920 --> 07:38:29,120
um

11779
07:38:29,120 --> 07:38:31,520
our friend unite here doubles down goes

11780
07:38:31,520 --> 07:38:33,280
he's a security professional

11781
07:38:33,280 --> 07:38:34,558
professional

11782
07:38:34,558 --> 07:38:38,240
who works with hakka one and buck crowd

11783
07:38:38,240 --> 07:38:40,160
they've been paid for this bug multiple

11784
07:38:40,160 --> 07:38:42,080
times before so

11785
07:38:42,080 --> 07:38:44,000
you know seemingly they think they're

11786
07:38:44,000 --> 07:38:46,000
entitled to get paid from us okay fair

11787
07:38:46,000 --> 07:38:48,958
enough fair enough

11788
07:38:48,958 --> 07:38:50,000
um

11789
07:38:50,000 --> 07:38:52,000
just kind of reply sorry didn't really

11790
07:38:52,000 --> 07:38:54,240
answer my question you know i understand

11791
07:38:54,240 --> 07:38:56,160
what click checking is and the generic

11792
07:38:56,160 --> 07:38:58,240
impact of it but what does it what does

11793
07:38:58,240 --> 07:39:00,478
it mean to us um in in the instance that

11794
07:39:00,478 --> 07:39:03,680
you found on our specific scope how can

11795
07:39:03,680 --> 07:39:06,160
this actually be abused

11796
07:39:06,160 --> 07:39:08,160
okay

11797
07:39:08,160 --> 07:39:09,280
um

11798
07:39:09,280 --> 07:39:12,638
lucky for us unlucky for our friend here

11799
07:39:12,638 --> 07:39:14,958
um their pc wasn't working so they

11800
07:39:14,958 --> 07:39:17,440
couldn't actually exploit it

11801
07:39:17,440 --> 07:39:19,680
tough luck i get it it's happened to the

11802
07:39:19,680 --> 07:39:21,040
best of us

11803
07:39:21,040 --> 07:39:23,280
i'm like okay cool no worries um if your

11804
07:39:23,280 --> 07:39:26,558
pc works again just come back

11805
07:39:26,558 --> 07:39:28,558
submit another submission or just

11806
07:39:28,558 --> 07:39:29,920
contact me again once you've got a

11807
07:39:29,920 --> 07:39:32,160
working exploit or you can just prove

11808
07:39:32,160 --> 07:39:33,920
even real world impact and we'll

11809
07:39:33,920 --> 07:39:35,040
reassess

11810
07:39:35,040 --> 07:39:36,958
happy hacking

11811
07:39:36,958 --> 07:39:38,878
um so this one

11812
07:39:38,878 --> 07:39:40,958
you know i don't think it was malicious

11813
07:39:40,958 --> 07:39:43,440
um however i also don't think this was

11814
07:39:43,440 --> 07:39:44,638
an honest

11815
07:39:44,638 --> 07:39:47,040
mistake i think that

11816
07:39:47,040 --> 07:39:48,638
this person

11817
07:39:48,638 --> 07:39:50,558
found something they probably

11818
07:39:50,558 --> 07:39:52,478
overestimated

11819
07:39:52,478 --> 07:39:55,920
the impact and when they realized that

11820
07:39:55,920 --> 07:39:57,360
hey they weren't this is it wasn't going

11821
07:39:57,360 --> 07:39:58,878
to be easy they tried to double down

11822
07:39:58,878 --> 07:40:00,558
with the whole professional i've been

11823
07:40:00,558 --> 07:40:03,200
paid for this before sort of thing so

11824
07:40:03,200 --> 07:40:05,120
it was kind of a hail mary attempt at

11825
07:40:05,120 --> 07:40:07,440
getting paid so probably in the middle

11826
07:40:07,440 --> 07:40:10,718
not too bad

11827
07:40:10,718 --> 07:40:11,840
um

11828
07:40:11,840 --> 07:40:13,440
then yeah then there was this one this

11829
07:40:13,440 --> 07:40:15,840
one was quite interesting because

11830
07:40:15,840 --> 07:40:18,718
they've um again you can read it as i'm

11831
07:40:18,718 --> 07:40:19,920
talking but

11832
07:40:19,920 --> 07:40:23,040
they've framed this not just as a volume

11833
07:40:23,040 --> 07:40:26,160
with click jacking but as a bypass

11834
07:40:26,160 --> 07:40:29,200
for the content security policy header

11835
07:40:29,200 --> 07:40:31,840
csp header which

11836
07:40:31,840 --> 07:40:33,520
among other things protects you from

11837
07:40:33,520 --> 07:40:34,798
click checking

11838
07:40:34,798 --> 07:40:35,840
and

11839
07:40:35,840 --> 07:40:37,120
this was interesting to me right

11840
07:40:37,120 --> 07:40:38,160
genuinely interesting because i'm like

11841
07:40:38,160 --> 07:40:40,320
okay cool we have this we do protect

11842
07:40:40,320 --> 07:40:41,920
against this

11843
07:40:41,920 --> 07:40:42,798
what's

11844
07:40:42,798 --> 07:40:44,878
the bypass is this

11845
07:40:44,878 --> 07:40:47,840
really some ingenious vulnerability that

11846
07:40:47,840 --> 07:40:49,280
they found

11847
07:40:49,280 --> 07:40:50,878
um so there were two attachments

11848
07:40:50,878 --> 07:40:53,000
one.html2

11849
07:40:53,000 --> 07:40:54,958
one.html was

11850
07:40:54,958 --> 07:40:55,920
just

11851
07:40:55,920 --> 07:40:57,200
um

11852
07:40:57,200 --> 07:41:00,558
our website in an iframe going uh

11853
07:41:00,558 --> 07:41:01,920
yeah this

11854
07:41:01,920 --> 07:41:03,760
you know it's blocked like it's supposed

11855
07:41:03,760 --> 07:41:06,398
to be 2.html actually did open up our

11856
07:41:06,398 --> 07:41:08,320
website in and out in an iframe which

11857
07:41:08,320 --> 07:41:09,680
was okay that's interesting shouldn't be

11858
07:41:09,680 --> 07:41:11,200
able to do that

11859
07:41:11,200 --> 07:41:12,878
so i opened up um this kind what it

11860
07:41:12,878 --> 07:41:14,398
looked like

11861
07:41:14,398 --> 07:41:15,600
um

11862
07:41:15,600 --> 07:41:16,718
this shouldn't happen right i'm like

11863
07:41:16,718 --> 07:41:18,478
okay let's go exploring

11864
07:41:18,478 --> 07:41:20,558
open up the html file and what this

11865
07:41:20,558 --> 07:41:22,958
person's actually done is they've used

11866
07:41:22,958 --> 07:41:24,240
a proxy

11867
07:41:24,240 --> 07:41:27,440
to go to our website pull down the html

11868
07:41:27,440 --> 07:41:28,718
and then

11869
07:41:28,718 --> 07:41:29,680
through

11870
07:41:29,680 --> 07:41:33,360
that website display it in the iframe so

11871
07:41:33,360 --> 07:41:36,000
it's not really a bypass it's just

11872
07:41:36,000 --> 07:41:37,520
proxying

11873
07:41:37,520 --> 07:41:40,000
um and that actually took me a while to

11874
07:41:40,000 --> 07:41:41,280
figure out you know i was looking at

11875
07:41:41,280 --> 07:41:43,360
this for like a good 15

11876
07:41:43,360 --> 07:41:45,120
minutes going

11877
07:41:45,120 --> 07:41:47,120
how's this working okay i followed the

11878
07:41:47,120 --> 07:41:49,600
steps i get it this isn't actually a

11879
07:41:49,600 --> 07:41:52,000
bypass this is getting into the more bit

11880
07:41:52,000 --> 07:41:53,840
more the malicious

11881
07:41:53,840 --> 07:41:56,478
side right like they probably know what

11882
07:41:56,478 --> 07:41:58,878
they're doing here um and they're

11883
07:41:58,878 --> 07:42:01,200
probably hoping to catch people out

11884
07:42:01,200 --> 07:42:03,440
going hey we thought we protected

11885
07:42:03,440 --> 07:42:04,638
against this

11886
07:42:04,638 --> 07:42:07,360
but there's obviously a bypass

11887
07:42:07,360 --> 07:42:10,638
let's maybe pay this person

11888
07:42:10,638 --> 07:42:12,638
not so great

11889
07:42:12,638 --> 07:42:14,558
this one was fun um

11890
07:42:14,558 --> 07:42:15,680
this is

11891
07:42:15,680 --> 07:42:16,558
let me know if there's too many

11892
07:42:16,558 --> 07:42:18,878
screenshots about like our website

11893
07:42:18,878 --> 07:42:22,478
specifically i can just not do it um

11894
07:42:22,478 --> 07:42:24,080
but this was obviously just a spray and

11895
07:42:24,080 --> 07:42:26,160
pray hey we found crack passwords in

11896
07:42:26,160 --> 07:42:28,080
your domain yes there was a blog post

11897
07:42:28,080 --> 07:42:31,200
about cracking passwords that's it

11898
07:42:31,200 --> 07:42:32,160
um

11899
07:42:32,160 --> 07:42:35,120
again just a hail mary attempt at

11900
07:42:35,120 --> 07:42:37,760
getting a bounty

11901
07:42:37,760 --> 07:42:40,079
um

11902
07:42:40,398 --> 07:42:42,638
a lot to say about this one other than

11903
07:42:42,638 --> 07:42:46,638
this just yeah look ssrf in your website

11904
07:42:46,638 --> 07:42:48,558
um there was just no

11905
07:42:48,558 --> 07:42:51,360
ssrf in our website like i tried to go

11906
07:42:51,360 --> 07:42:52,718
through these steps

11907
07:42:52,718 --> 07:42:55,520
um it's just not a thing but

11908
07:42:55,520 --> 07:43:00,558
nice try nice try then

11909
07:43:01,280 --> 07:43:02,398
we have

11910
07:43:02,398 --> 07:43:05,680
uh this one this one's a bit more recent

11911
07:43:05,680 --> 07:43:07,040
so

11912
07:43:07,040 --> 07:43:08,160
you can

11913
07:43:08,160 --> 07:43:09,280
the reason why i'm showing you more and

11914
07:43:09,280 --> 07:43:12,958
more is you can kind of see the um

11915
07:43:12,958 --> 07:43:15,040
the layout that they're using it's

11916
07:43:15,040 --> 07:43:17,360
usually some fairly generic description

11917
07:43:17,360 --> 07:43:18,398
at the top

11918
07:43:18,398 --> 07:43:20,878
then steps to reproduce that

11919
07:43:20,878 --> 07:43:22,958
you know they might have copy pasted

11920
07:43:22,958 --> 07:43:25,040
into your specific website what this

11921
07:43:25,040 --> 07:43:27,600
one's doing is it's basically just going

11922
07:43:27,600 --> 07:43:30,240
hey open up your browser and insert this

11923
07:43:30,240 --> 07:43:32,718
into the dom directly

11924
07:43:32,718 --> 07:43:34,798
and then an image will pop up

11925
07:43:34,798 --> 07:43:36,878
and i'm like yes

11926
07:43:36,878 --> 07:43:38,478
yes it will

11927
07:43:38,478 --> 07:43:39,440
um

11928
07:43:39,440 --> 07:43:41,120
and then often at the bottom they give a

11929
07:43:41,120 --> 07:43:43,680
reference to some generic

11930
07:43:43,680 --> 07:43:47,440
usage of this bug on hacker one usually

11931
07:43:47,440 --> 07:43:49,280
um sometimes they throw in some of their

11932
07:43:49,280 --> 07:43:51,040
own credentials

11933
07:43:51,040 --> 07:43:53,120
i've got ceh

11934
07:43:53,120 --> 07:43:55,520
cool congratulations

11935
07:43:55,520 --> 07:43:56,478
um

11936
07:43:56,478 --> 07:43:58,160
however

11937
07:43:58,160 --> 07:44:01,200
yeah this one was just odd i was like

11938
07:44:01,200 --> 07:44:02,878
not a not a vol

11939
07:44:02,878 --> 07:44:04,240
as you can see

11940
07:44:04,240 --> 07:44:06,958
um threw back an email going we actually

11941
07:44:06,958 --> 07:44:08,718
do have a content security policy header

11942
07:44:08,718 --> 07:44:09,920
there it is

11943
07:44:09,920 --> 07:44:12,798
just explaining at the bottom that hey

11944
07:44:12,798 --> 07:44:14,718
you know opening up

11945
07:44:14,718 --> 07:44:16,478
um

11946
07:44:16,478 --> 07:44:19,120
inspect element which we now all know

11947
07:44:19,120 --> 07:44:20,718
is a crime

11948
07:44:20,718 --> 07:44:21,680
um

11949
07:44:21,680 --> 07:44:23,200
for those who don't know

11950
07:44:23,200 --> 07:44:24,878
there was

11951
07:44:24,878 --> 07:44:25,840
there wasn't really going to be a

11952
07:44:25,840 --> 07:44:27,760
prosecution but there was some

11953
07:44:27,760 --> 07:44:29,520
politician in the u.s going inspect

11954
07:44:29,520 --> 07:44:31,120
element as a crime

11955
07:44:31,120 --> 07:44:32,000
um

11956
07:44:32,000 --> 07:44:33,760
so basically saying hey this is all

11957
07:44:33,760 --> 07:44:36,558
client-side no real impact

11958
07:44:36,558 --> 07:44:40,320
not a bug but nice try

11959
07:44:40,958 --> 07:44:44,320
um finally this one was quite good i

11960
07:44:44,320 --> 07:44:46,160
actually appreciated this submission and

11961
07:44:46,160 --> 07:44:49,360
i did feel like this one was an honest

11962
07:44:49,360 --> 07:44:52,958
mistake or an honest misunderstanding of

11963
07:44:52,958 --> 07:44:55,200
um of this vulnerability and if it

11964
07:44:55,200 --> 07:44:56,638
actually exists

11965
07:44:56,638 --> 07:44:59,040
so as we saw from the talk yesterday

11966
07:44:59,040 --> 07:45:01,680
about dmarc records and how to prevent

11967
07:45:01,680 --> 07:45:05,200
this type of submission um we basically

11968
07:45:05,200 --> 07:45:06,160
followed

11969
07:45:06,160 --> 07:45:07,520
that methodology and we still get this

11970
07:45:07,520 --> 07:45:09,440
type of submission every now and then

11971
07:45:09,440 --> 07:45:11,440
but essentially um

11972
07:45:11,440 --> 07:45:13,440
dmacc record's missing for this other

11973
07:45:13,440 --> 07:45:15,840
domain that we just don't use like this

11974
07:45:15,840 --> 07:45:16,558
is

11975
07:45:16,558 --> 07:45:19,520
a domain that we hold um

11976
07:45:19,520 --> 07:45:20,478
and

11977
07:45:20,478 --> 07:45:22,558
yeah there's never any email supposed to

11978
07:45:22,558 --> 07:45:23,600
be

11979
07:45:23,600 --> 07:45:26,240
sent from that domain right

11980
07:45:26,240 --> 07:45:27,440
um

11981
07:45:27,440 --> 07:45:30,000
so okay i kind of gave this person the

11982
07:45:30,000 --> 07:45:32,878
benefit of the doubt and

11983
07:45:32,878 --> 07:45:35,120
started engaging with them going hey

11984
07:45:35,120 --> 07:45:36,240
actually

11985
07:45:36,240 --> 07:45:38,000
um i think you misinterpreted what

11986
07:45:38,000 --> 07:45:39,600
you've what you're seeing here in this

11987
07:45:39,600 --> 07:45:40,638
um

11988
07:45:40,638 --> 07:45:42,718
mx toolbox

11989
07:45:42,718 --> 07:45:44,958
website

11990
07:45:44,958 --> 07:45:48,160
the voc.is domain doesn't actually send

11991
07:45:48,160 --> 07:45:49,360
any emails

11992
07:45:49,360 --> 07:45:52,958
you can see by the spf record there the

11993
07:45:52,958 --> 07:45:54,638
minus all

11994
07:45:54,638 --> 07:45:56,320
means that

11995
07:45:56,320 --> 07:45:58,240
nothing can send

11996
07:45:58,240 --> 07:46:00,160
emails from this domain so if you try

11997
07:46:00,160 --> 07:46:01,600
and spoof

11998
07:46:01,600 --> 07:46:04,000
um an email coming from this domain it's

11999
07:46:04,000 --> 07:46:06,398
gonna be at best thrown into quarantine

12000
07:46:06,398 --> 07:46:09,600
or junk and at worst

12001
07:46:09,600 --> 07:46:11,760
uh just not sent at all like you're just

12002
07:46:11,760 --> 07:46:13,520
not gonna see it

12003
07:46:13,520 --> 07:46:15,200
um

12004
07:46:15,200 --> 07:46:17,840
yeah this person was nice okay thanks

12005
07:46:17,840 --> 07:46:19,600
cool that's it

12006
07:46:19,600 --> 07:46:23,680
great hopefully they learn something

12007
07:46:24,000 --> 07:46:25,440
and

12008
07:46:25,440 --> 07:46:28,558
yeah this one just just did my head in

12009
07:46:28,558 --> 07:46:30,638
like i'll give you a second to read this

12010
07:46:30,638 --> 07:46:31,840
one it's just

12011
07:46:31,840 --> 07:46:33,200
literally

12012
07:46:33,200 --> 07:46:35,600
a copy paste i don't know how many

12013
07:46:35,600 --> 07:46:37,840
people they've submitted this bug to but

12014
07:46:37,840 --> 07:46:39,760
it's just not a thing like it doesn't

12015
07:46:39,760 --> 07:46:41,520
even have an endpoint

12016
07:46:41,520 --> 07:46:43,600
it's just a bunch of steps going hey if

12017
07:46:43,600 --> 07:46:45,600
there's an account you could reset

12018
07:46:45,600 --> 07:46:47,520
passwords and then log out and then i

12019
07:46:47,520 --> 07:46:49,200
don't even know right

12020
07:46:49,200 --> 07:46:51,600
but um i replied going what endpoint are

12021
07:46:51,600 --> 07:46:53,120
you referring to because like we don't

12022
07:46:53,120 --> 07:46:55,360
have many things

12023
07:46:55,360 --> 07:46:56,478
that have accounts we don't have

12024
07:46:56,478 --> 07:46:58,080
anything exposed the internet that has

12025
07:46:58,080 --> 07:46:59,600
accounts so

12026
07:46:59,600 --> 07:47:01,840
what the hell are you referring to

12027
07:47:01,840 --> 07:47:03,920
and they helpfully reply going yeah i'm

12028
07:47:03,920 --> 07:47:05,920
referring to sign up and login pages of

12029
07:47:05,920 --> 07:47:08,638
course um if you want to test yeah just

12030
07:47:08,638 --> 07:47:10,478
go in and test all your sub domains and

12031
07:47:10,478 --> 07:47:12,558
your main main scope i'm like yeah cool

12032
07:47:12,558 --> 07:47:14,478
thanks man i'll go do that

12033
07:47:14,478 --> 07:47:18,320
um so at this point like i'm just

12034
07:47:18,320 --> 07:47:21,520
why like why why is this happening

12035
07:47:21,520 --> 07:47:22,638
um

12036
07:47:22,638 --> 07:47:25,200
i did have a bit of thought about

12037
07:47:25,200 --> 07:47:26,160
what

12038
07:47:26,160 --> 07:47:27,840
what what's the root cause of all this

12039
07:47:27,840 --> 07:47:30,398
um and obviously the first motivator is

12040
07:47:30,398 --> 07:47:31,280
money

12041
07:47:31,280 --> 07:47:35,440
people want an easy dollar um

12042
07:47:35,440 --> 07:47:37,120
the second point there kind of dives

12043
07:47:37,120 --> 07:47:39,360
into it it looks easy on on twitter and

12044
07:47:39,360 --> 07:47:41,440
other social media platforms right it's

12045
07:47:41,440 --> 07:47:44,240
it's the same social media curses

12046
07:47:44,240 --> 07:47:45,600
with anything else

12047
07:47:45,600 --> 07:47:47,280
it looks like everyone around you is

12048
07:47:47,280 --> 07:47:48,958
succeeding everyone around you is making

12049
07:47:48,958 --> 07:47:52,000
millions of dollars doing bug bounties

12050
07:47:52,000 --> 07:47:53,120
there are

12051
07:47:53,120 --> 07:47:54,638
a thousand

12052
07:47:54,638 --> 07:47:56,320
buck bounty billion millionaires out

12053
07:47:56,320 --> 07:47:59,280
there or whatever and you know looks

12054
07:47:59,280 --> 07:48:01,120
easy i think i can do it

12055
07:48:01,120 --> 07:48:04,080
and so people go and

12056
07:48:04,080 --> 07:48:06,798
they try it they significantly

12057
07:48:06,798 --> 07:48:08,160
underestimate

12058
07:48:08,160 --> 07:48:09,920
the amount of effort it takes to learn

12059
07:48:09,920 --> 07:48:11,120
this stuff

12060
07:48:11,120 --> 07:48:12,798
in detail

12061
07:48:12,798 --> 07:48:15,600
they do some silly little course or they

12062
07:48:15,600 --> 07:48:17,920
read a little book and go yep cool i'm

12063
07:48:17,920 --> 07:48:20,398
gonna start doing it now and when they

12064
07:48:20,398 --> 07:48:21,840
don't get a payout

12065
07:48:21,840 --> 07:48:23,440
they get frustrated they're like maybe

12066
07:48:23,440 --> 07:48:25,040
i'm just not submitting enough

12067
07:48:25,040 --> 07:48:27,440
vulnerabilities

12068
07:48:27,440 --> 07:48:31,920
massive over emphasis on tools as well

12069
07:48:32,080 --> 07:48:35,360
we in the industry we kind of glorify a

12070
07:48:35,360 --> 07:48:37,760
lot of tools right like

12071
07:48:37,760 --> 07:48:39,120
i'm sure most people have heard

12072
07:48:39,120 --> 07:48:40,638
especially in like the offensive

12073
07:48:40,638 --> 07:48:42,958
security side i've heard of bloodhound

12074
07:48:42,958 --> 07:48:44,398
crack map exec

12075
07:48:44,398 --> 07:48:46,240
like these are great tools but we kind

12076
07:48:46,240 --> 07:48:48,958
of glorify them they themselves don't do

12077
07:48:48,958 --> 07:48:51,120
anything without context without some

12078
07:48:51,120 --> 07:48:54,080
person sitting there going um yeah what

12079
07:48:54,080 --> 07:48:55,680
does this all actually mean in this

12080
07:48:55,680 --> 07:48:57,200
context

12081
07:48:57,200 --> 07:48:59,520
so we should probably start

12082
07:48:59,520 --> 07:49:03,520
not emphasizing tools so much and

12083
07:49:03,520 --> 07:49:04,878
kind of

12084
07:49:04,878 --> 07:49:06,558
step back onto the

12085
07:49:06,558 --> 07:49:08,558
you know the human aspect of this is

12086
07:49:08,558 --> 07:49:10,320
like you're the person doing it you're

12087
07:49:10,320 --> 07:49:12,478
the consultant take a step back

12088
07:49:12,478 --> 07:49:14,840
is the tool accurate is it what you

12089
07:49:14,840 --> 07:49:16,798
expect um

12090
07:49:16,798 --> 07:49:18,320
a lot of people are just lazy they don't

12091
07:49:18,320 --> 07:49:20,000
want to understand the scope or the

12092
07:49:20,000 --> 07:49:22,240
company they want quick wins quick easy

12093
07:49:22,240 --> 07:49:23,840
wins that's it

12094
07:49:23,840 --> 07:49:25,920
um a lot of these people just have low

12095
07:49:25,920 --> 07:49:28,320
skill and low impact understanding

12096
07:49:28,320 --> 07:49:30,080
either they don't want to get better or

12097
07:49:30,080 --> 07:49:31,760
they just haven't gotten better yet and

12098
07:49:31,760 --> 07:49:34,240
that's fine if it's genuinely a learning

12099
07:49:34,240 --> 07:49:37,600
exercise for them that's great um

12100
07:49:37,600 --> 07:49:39,200
and yeah they can keep going and

12101
07:49:39,200 --> 07:49:41,120
hopefully they start doing better

12102
07:49:41,120 --> 07:49:43,440
submissions

12103
07:49:43,440 --> 07:49:45,040
there are a lot of bug bounty

12104
07:49:45,040 --> 07:49:48,878
courses out there um there's 101 udemy

12105
07:49:48,878 --> 07:49:50,958
courses that say

12106
07:49:50,958 --> 07:49:53,360
intro to bug bounty and it's just the

12107
07:49:53,360 --> 07:49:54,320
same

12108
07:49:54,320 --> 07:49:57,280
crap that won't get you bugs

12109
07:49:57,280 --> 07:49:58,638
um

12110
07:49:58,638 --> 07:50:00,160
yeah we need

12111
07:50:00,160 --> 07:50:01,920
better courses we need courses that

12112
07:50:01,920 --> 07:50:04,398
don't focus on bug bounties

12113
07:50:04,398 --> 07:50:07,600
but actually a focus on security impact

12114
07:50:07,600 --> 07:50:09,360
business risk

12115
07:50:09,360 --> 07:50:10,558
all of these things that you need to

12116
07:50:10,558 --> 07:50:13,120
understand the context of an actual

12117
07:50:13,120 --> 07:50:14,718
vulnerability

12118
07:50:14,718 --> 07:50:16,798
so what can we actually

12119
07:50:16,798 --> 07:50:20,958
do about it if anything um

12120
07:50:21,200 --> 07:50:22,798
if you're running a bug bounty program

12121
07:50:22,798 --> 07:50:25,040
or a vulnerability disclosure program

12122
07:50:25,040 --> 07:50:28,160
your scope needs to be clear and short

12123
07:50:28,160 --> 07:50:30,080
um also what's out of scope needs to be

12124
07:50:30,080 --> 07:50:32,240
clear and short people aren't going to

12125
07:50:32,240 --> 07:50:34,240
read a massive essay

12126
07:50:34,240 --> 07:50:36,240
about what should i what am i allowed to

12127
07:50:36,240 --> 07:50:38,160
hack what am i not allowed to hack

12128
07:50:38,160 --> 07:50:39,760
they're going to skim through it and go

12129
07:50:39,760 --> 07:50:41,680
yep i think that's good enough at best

12130
07:50:41,680 --> 07:50:42,878
they're going to skim through it right

12131
07:50:42,878 --> 07:50:44,000
at worst they're just not going to read

12132
07:50:44,000 --> 07:50:45,040
it at all

12133
07:50:45,040 --> 07:50:46,240
um

12134
07:50:46,240 --> 07:50:48,080
the talk today from cole

12135
07:50:48,080 --> 07:50:50,398
about writing anything

12136
07:50:50,398 --> 07:50:51,920
follow that advice with your

12137
07:50:51,920 --> 07:50:53,600
vulnerability disclosure policies as

12138
07:50:53,600 --> 07:50:54,558
well

12139
07:50:54,558 --> 07:50:56,398
we need better education like i said

12140
07:50:56,398 --> 07:50:59,120
before and we also need people just call

12141
07:50:59,120 --> 07:51:00,798
out courses like if they're a waste

12142
07:51:00,798 --> 07:51:02,080
of money

12143
07:51:02,080 --> 07:51:03,040
then

12144
07:51:03,040 --> 07:51:04,478
people just need to say that no this

12145
07:51:04,478 --> 07:51:06,638
one's not good avoid it

12146
07:51:06,638 --> 07:51:10,718
shout out to hack luke farah and codingo

12147
07:51:10,718 --> 07:51:12,958
there are many many more people that are

12148
07:51:12,958 --> 07:51:14,798
doing really good education in this

12149
07:51:14,798 --> 07:51:17,520
space um follow them if you want but

12150
07:51:17,520 --> 07:51:19,920
there's yeah they're doing great and

12151
07:51:19,920 --> 07:51:21,920
they're also preaching the same sort of

12152
07:51:21,920 --> 07:51:24,240
thing of don't use common tools

12153
07:51:24,240 --> 07:51:27,280
understand impact blah blah blah

12154
07:51:27,280 --> 07:51:29,040
um

12155
07:51:29,040 --> 07:51:29,920
yeah

12156
07:51:29,920 --> 07:51:31,760
when i say it again stop over hyping

12157
07:51:31,760 --> 07:51:32,798
tools

12158
07:51:32,798 --> 07:51:34,718
every time i hear the term automated pen

12159
07:51:34,718 --> 07:51:36,558
test it makes me throw up in my mouth a

12160
07:51:36,558 --> 07:51:37,920
little bit

12161
07:51:37,920 --> 07:51:40,320
they don't work well

12162
07:51:40,320 --> 07:51:41,600
if they did

12163
07:51:41,600 --> 07:51:45,120
we wouldn't have a job simple as that

12164
07:51:45,120 --> 07:51:47,040
and then block malicious reporters so if

12165
07:51:47,040 --> 07:51:48,398
you see someone actually doing a

12166
07:51:48,398 --> 07:51:51,360
malicious report then block them don't

12167
07:51:51,360 --> 07:51:53,120
interact with them again it's a waste of

12168
07:51:53,120 --> 07:51:54,558
your time

12169
07:51:54,558 --> 07:51:57,120
they don't they don't need the feedback

12170
07:51:57,120 --> 07:51:58,958
um yeah

12171
07:51:58,958 --> 07:52:00,878
for the ones that aren't malicious find

12172
07:52:00,878 --> 07:52:02,798
teachable moments so

12173
07:52:02,798 --> 07:52:05,680
although it's frustrating and

12174
07:52:05,680 --> 07:52:07,840
it's easy for us to sort of step back

12175
07:52:07,840 --> 07:52:09,600
and and laugh

12176
07:52:09,600 --> 07:52:12,320
try and not do that um try and find the

12177
07:52:12,320 --> 07:52:14,160
moments and give people

12178
07:52:14,160 --> 07:52:16,718
a chance to sort of explain themselves

12179
07:52:16,718 --> 07:52:18,718
assume good intent right this is just i

12180
07:52:18,718 --> 07:52:20,240
mean good advice for life but assume

12181
07:52:20,240 --> 07:52:21,440
good intent

12182
07:52:21,440 --> 07:52:22,398
with

12183
07:52:22,398 --> 07:52:25,200
your submissions give them a chance

12184
07:52:25,200 --> 07:52:27,680
to explain them and if you really see

12185
07:52:27,680 --> 07:52:30,000
them pushing for nothing then yeah cut

12186
07:52:30,000 --> 07:52:30,958
them off

12187
07:52:30,958 --> 07:52:34,958
um but as always with everything

12188
07:52:34,958 --> 07:52:37,520
show love show empathy

12189
07:52:37,520 --> 07:52:39,040
it's

12190
07:52:39,040 --> 07:52:40,718
you'll just feel better about yourself

12191
07:52:40,718 --> 07:52:43,360
if you still treat these people kindly

12192
07:52:43,360 --> 07:52:44,798
with respect

12193
07:52:44,798 --> 07:52:46,958
even if it is annoying um so even though

12194
07:52:46,958 --> 07:52:48,798
you're sort of dead inside you still

12195
07:52:48,798 --> 07:52:50,478
gotta show love

12196
07:52:50,478 --> 07:52:52,398

07:53:03,360 --> 07:53:04,160

um

12212
07:53:22,000 --> 07:53:24,000
when sebastian talked earlier you know

12213
07:53:24,000 --> 07:53:25,840
he talked about going through the acsc

12214
07:53:25,840 --> 07:53:29,200
when it came to notifying people about

12215
07:53:29,200 --> 07:53:30,638
you know what's essentially a

12216
07:53:30,638 --> 07:53:33,040
vulnerability and what was going on and

12217
07:53:33,040 --> 07:53:34,878
these people are contacting you and a

12218
07:53:34,878 --> 07:53:36,558
lot of them are saying oh yeah i'm a bug

12219
07:53:36,558 --> 07:53:38,320
bounty researcher with hakawan or

12220
07:53:38,320 --> 07:53:40,080
macaroni and

12221
07:53:40,080 --> 07:53:43,840
a bug crowd is it not a valid response

12222
07:53:43,840 --> 07:53:44,798
to say

12223
07:53:44,798 --> 07:53:46,638
that's great

12224
07:53:46,638 --> 07:53:48,958
thanks for contacting me

12225
07:53:48,958 --> 07:53:50,878
but put your submission through the

12226
07:53:50,878 --> 07:53:54,478
proper channels such as bug crowd hacka1

12227
07:53:54,478 --> 07:53:57,120
um to try and prevent because they're

12228
07:53:57,120 --> 07:53:58,798
obviously i

12229
07:53:58,798 --> 07:54:00,798
it reminds me of there was a scam and

12230
07:54:00,798 --> 07:54:02,958
there probably still is of uh car parks

12231
07:54:02,958 --> 07:54:05,360
australia or something where you go into

12232
07:54:05,360 --> 07:54:08,080
the car park and you're meant to pay for

12233
07:54:08,080 --> 07:54:09,600
the ticket but there's not a lot of

12234
07:54:09,600 --> 07:54:11,520
signage there's no

12235
07:54:11,520 --> 07:54:13,760
um you know boom gates or anything like

12236
07:54:13,760 --> 07:54:15,040
that and

12237
07:54:15,040 --> 07:54:17,040
i parked i didn't even park there there

12238
07:54:17,040 --> 07:54:19,600
was one time where i got a ticket

12239
07:54:19,600 --> 07:54:22,840
that you know i'd parked at a car park

12240
07:54:22,840 --> 07:54:26,000
in padstow or something at woolworth's

12241
07:54:26,000 --> 07:54:27,600
and they would they they were like you

12242
07:54:27,600 --> 07:54:29,360
know you owe us the money and the fine

12243
07:54:29,360 --> 07:54:31,280
of a hundred dollars

12244
07:54:31,280 --> 07:54:34,638
so many people on facebook would pay it

12245
07:54:34,638 --> 07:54:37,200
right they get this and they're like wow

12246
07:54:37,200 --> 07:54:38,958
i've got this fine

12247
07:54:38,958 --> 07:54:40,638
holy crap and a lot of people would get

12248
07:54:40,638 --> 07:54:43,120
these emails and go oh okay yeah

12249
07:54:43,120 --> 07:54:44,878
i'll pay you thank you because they

12250
07:54:44,878 --> 07:54:46,958
don't know any better when you know this

12251
07:54:46,958 --> 07:54:48,478
car park australia thing was a scam i

12252
07:54:48,478 --> 07:54:51,120
was like i was in hong kong there is no

12253
07:54:51,120 --> 07:54:52,638
physical way

12254
07:54:52,638 --> 07:54:54,718
i was here are my visa stamps of being

12255
07:54:54,718 --> 07:54:57,360
in hong kong at that time like go away

12256
07:54:57,360 --> 07:54:58,398
um

12257
07:54:58,398 --> 07:55:00,160
but i think it's the same as this where

12258
07:55:00,160 --> 07:55:01,760
they just like you said at the first

12259
07:55:01,760 --> 07:55:04,240
slide right spray and pray just throw it

12260
07:55:04,240 --> 07:55:06,080
out there so maybe a way of avoiding

12261
07:55:06,080 --> 07:55:07,360
that is

12262
07:55:07,360 --> 07:55:09,280
normalizing you need to go through the

12263
07:55:09,280 --> 07:55:11,120
channels to do this like don't don't

12264
07:55:11,120 --> 07:55:13,200
contact us directly

12265
07:55:13,200 --> 07:55:15,360
you know we've got a bug bounty program

12266
07:55:15,360 --> 07:55:16,398
through

12267
07:55:16,398 --> 07:55:19,200
this channel or acsc or something like

12268
07:55:19,200 --> 07:55:22,160
that and they're less likely to be

12269
07:55:22,160 --> 07:55:23,760
throwing out this

12270
07:55:23,760 --> 07:55:25,520
you know which is

12271
07:55:25,520 --> 07:55:27,360
honestly they're just doing it because

12272
07:55:27,360 --> 07:55:29,760
people will pay and they'll pay because

12273
07:55:29,760 --> 07:55:32,000
they don't know any better and that's

12274
07:55:32,000 --> 07:55:33,600
really bad for

12275
07:55:33,600 --> 07:55:35,680
small organizations that just go ahead

12276
07:55:35,680 --> 07:55:36,798
and pay it

12277
07:55:36,798 --> 07:55:38,878
and they just don't know

12278
07:55:38,878 --> 07:55:40,478
anyway that might be an unpopular

12279
07:55:40,478 --> 07:55:43,440
opinion but um maybe normalizing the use

12280
07:55:43,440 --> 07:55:45,520
of haka one and bug dancing or something

12281
07:55:45,520 --> 07:55:46,718
like that

12282
07:55:46,718 --> 07:55:49,600
well i mean businesses pay

12283
07:55:49,600 --> 07:55:52,160
for the privilege of being on bug crowd

12284
07:55:52,160 --> 07:55:54,000
and hackaroni

12285
07:55:54,000 --> 07:55:56,878
for that triage basically right

12286
07:55:56,878 --> 07:55:59,440
as far as i'm aware like that's the main

12287
07:55:59,440 --> 07:56:01,840
selling point is that

12288
07:56:01,840 --> 07:56:05,200
your will triage all of this crap and if

12289
07:56:05,200 --> 07:56:08,080
anyone works for those places

12290
07:56:08,080 --> 07:56:09,840
you'll know right you you probably see

12291
07:56:09,840 --> 07:56:13,040
this and there's no better ones

12292
07:56:13,040 --> 07:56:14,638
i do encourage

12293
07:56:14,638 --> 07:56:16,478
like most actually i do encourage every

12294
07:56:16,478 --> 07:56:18,478
organization to have a bug bounty

12295
07:56:18,478 --> 07:56:20,638
program or at least a vulnerability

12296
07:56:20,638 --> 07:56:22,398
disclosure program

12297
07:56:22,398 --> 07:56:23,920
if people

12298
07:56:23,920 --> 07:56:26,080
are going to hack you and we all know

12299
07:56:26,080 --> 07:56:28,398
that they just are because we're all on

12300
07:56:28,398 --> 07:56:29,760
the internet

12301
07:56:29,760 --> 07:56:31,520
better that they have a chance to go

12302
07:56:31,520 --> 07:56:33,120
through you first

12303
07:56:33,120 --> 07:56:36,478
than to just go there's no policy here

12304
07:56:36,478 --> 07:56:38,398
i'm going to sell it on some dodgy forum

12305
07:56:38,398 --> 07:56:39,600
right

12306
07:56:39,600 --> 07:56:41,040
um

12307
07:56:41,040 --> 07:56:42,958
yeah disclose io

12308
07:56:42,958 --> 07:56:46,000
dan is is great so go to disclose io

12309
07:56:46,000 --> 07:56:48,398
the template

12310
07:56:48,398 --> 07:56:51,040
yeah was from disclose io they have a

12311
07:56:51,040 --> 07:56:52,718
really good template

12312
07:56:52,718 --> 07:56:56,000
for your von disclosure policy and shout

12313
07:56:56,000 --> 07:56:59,360
out to casey and all of uh his team for

12314
07:56:59,360 --> 07:57:00,958
for doing that and making that open

12315
07:57:00,958 --> 07:57:02,160
source so

12316
07:57:02,160 --> 07:57:04,240
that's really awesome um

12317
07:57:04,240 --> 07:57:05,760
but that doesn't you know just having

12318
07:57:05,760 --> 07:57:07,760
the policy doesn't

12319
07:57:07,760 --> 07:57:10,240
prevent bad submissions and you do need

12320
07:57:10,240 --> 07:57:11,360
someone

12321
07:57:11,360 --> 07:57:12,478
if you're not

12322
07:57:12,478 --> 07:57:14,160
if you don't have a technical

12323
07:57:14,160 --> 07:57:15,200
team

12324
07:57:15,200 --> 07:57:16,878
to go and

12325
07:57:16,878 --> 07:57:19,840
triage these and go is this a valid bug

12326
07:57:19,840 --> 07:57:20,958
um

12327
07:57:20,958 --> 07:57:23,520
and that in itself can be a cost but

12328
07:57:23,520 --> 07:57:27,200
yeah i think you know we do need to

12329
07:57:27,200 --> 07:57:29,280
encourage people to sort of do the

12330
07:57:29,280 --> 07:57:31,200
quote-unquote right thing

12331
07:57:31,200 --> 07:57:34,000
and submit to the companies rather than

12332
07:57:34,000 --> 07:57:34,878
just

12333
07:57:34,878 --> 07:57:36,958
brag about it on some forum or sell to

12334
07:57:36,958 --> 07:57:38,878
someone else because yeah the ones that

12335
07:57:38,878 --> 07:57:41,360
i showed had no impact

12336
07:57:41,360 --> 07:57:42,558
but

12337
07:57:42,558 --> 07:57:44,160
like

12338
07:57:44,160 --> 07:57:46,000
what if someone does find a proper

12339
07:57:46,000 --> 07:57:48,398
volume and go cool i've tried to reach

12340
07:57:48,398 --> 07:57:49,760
out to this organization i've got

12341
07:57:49,760 --> 07:57:50,958
nothing back

12342
07:57:50,958 --> 07:57:52,638
um why should i bother i'm just going to

12343
07:57:52,638 --> 07:57:55,840
go and yeah sell it on the

12344
07:57:55,840 --> 07:57:59,360
on some dodgy forum

12345
07:58:02,000 --> 07:58:03,680
there is actually a talk from the very

12346
07:58:03,680 --> 07:58:05,280
first comfy con that somebody will

12347
07:58:05,280 --> 07:58:07,200
hopefully provide in the chat and looks

12348
07:58:07,200 --> 07:58:09,840
like he's providing it um that was from

12349
07:58:09,840 --> 07:58:11,920
kc on disclose i o i think it was when

12350
07:58:11,920 --> 07:58:13,440
it was in the really early stages as

12351
07:58:13,440 --> 07:58:15,200
well but encouraging people to add the

12352
07:58:15,200 --> 07:58:17,280
details there you know develop their own

12353
07:58:17,280 --> 07:58:19,760
bug by any program and i think it's

12354
07:58:19,760 --> 07:58:21,200
definitely something over covered that

12355
07:58:21,200 --> 07:58:24,478
has grown a lot more but in two ways one

12356
07:58:24,478 --> 07:58:25,920
companies are putting more bug banners

12357
07:58:25,920 --> 07:58:28,478
out but two

12358
07:58:28,478 --> 07:58:30,398
people who have potentially lost jobs

12359
07:58:30,398 --> 07:58:31,840
and are looking to

12360
07:58:31,840 --> 07:58:34,638
earn money again have now moved into bug

12361
07:58:34,638 --> 07:58:36,798
bounties bag bounties whatever because

12362
07:58:36,798 --> 07:58:38,398
they see it is a really easy way to make

12363
07:58:38,398 --> 07:58:39,850
money and then

12364
07:58:39,850 --> 07:58:41,040
[Music]

12365
07:58:41,040 --> 07:58:43,360
you sort of

12366
07:58:43,360 --> 07:58:45,120
mark the waters a little bit you have

12367
07:58:45,120 --> 07:58:47,680
the good people you have the bad people

12368
07:58:47,680 --> 07:58:50,958
you have a mix in between and it's very

12369
07:58:50,958 --> 07:58:52,878
hard i guess to evolve but it's also

12370
07:58:52,878 --> 07:58:54,320
you've got the people who

12371
07:58:54,320 --> 07:58:56,558
are just spouting random crap all the

12372
07:58:56,558 --> 07:58:58,878
time like it's about like in some ways

12373
07:58:58,878 --> 07:59:00,160
like all the

12374
07:59:00,160 --> 07:59:01,920
all the low-hanging fruit have been

12375
07:59:01,920 --> 07:59:03,440
picked now you've actually got to go

12376
07:59:03,440 --> 07:59:04,958
find the new stuff

12377
07:59:04,958 --> 07:59:07,200
um and the low-hanging fruit does get

12378
07:59:07,200 --> 07:59:08,718
created over time but it's not getting

12379
07:59:08,718 --> 07:59:10,240
credited to the volume that people are

12380
07:59:10,240 --> 07:59:11,920
expecting i guess

12381
07:59:11,920 --> 07:59:13,600
yeah

12382
07:59:13,600 --> 07:59:16,398
yeah um that's fair enough so there was

12383
07:59:16,398 --> 07:59:18,000
one thing and this is more a satirical

12384
07:59:18,000 --> 07:59:19,440
comment but i thought pen testers just

12385
07:59:19,440 --> 07:59:22,717
use nessus to do their job

12386
07:59:23,040 --> 07:59:24,398
is that not right

12387
07:59:24,398 --> 07:59:26,638
that's what i thought was the job right

12388
07:59:26,638 --> 07:59:29,120
where is my troll all right

12389
07:59:29,120 --> 07:59:30,638
i thought they'd just use nests and they

12390
07:59:30,638 --> 07:59:32,398
just print out a nessus report and

12391
07:59:32,398 --> 07:59:33,360
that's it

12392
07:59:33,360 --> 07:59:35,680
we can't afford an essence

12393
07:59:35,680 --> 07:59:39,360
yeah i was gonna say sorry open bus

12394
07:59:39,360 --> 07:59:40,320
yeah yeah

12395
07:59:40,320 --> 07:59:42,080
it's not necessary

12396
07:59:42,080 --> 07:59:43,520
oh yeah we're not allowed to talk about

12397
07:59:43,520 --> 07:59:46,080
that one or um

12398
07:59:46,080 --> 07:59:47,360
i can't remember anything off the top of

12399
07:59:47,360 --> 07:59:49,120
my head but yeah it's you know i thought

12400
07:59:49,120 --> 07:59:50,398
that's just what it was that's just the

12401
07:59:50,398 --> 07:59:52,638
report right

12402
07:59:52,638 --> 07:59:54,080
um i will say this is probably a good

12403
07:59:54,080 --> 07:59:55,920
time to also mention when cole was

12404
07:59:55,920 --> 07:59:58,638
talking about content um in his talk

12405
07:59:58,638 --> 08:00:00,878
earlier in terms of writing content that

12406
08:00:00,878 --> 08:00:02,718
uh you guys have released a tool called

12407
08:00:02,718 --> 08:00:05,920
report ranger that um you have released

12408
08:00:05,920 --> 08:00:06,958
it right

12409
08:00:06,958 --> 08:00:09,200
yeah it's open source yeah it's also

12410
08:00:09,200 --> 08:00:10,558
report ranger which is used for pen

12411
08:00:10,558 --> 08:00:12,398
testing reports so if you're looking for

12412
08:00:12,398 --> 08:00:13,680
a tool to assist you not with the

12413
08:00:13,680 --> 08:00:15,200
content but at least the structure and

12414
08:00:15,200 --> 08:00:17,200
writing the uh the um

12415
08:00:17,200 --> 08:00:18,320
the content that's something to

12416
08:00:18,320 --> 08:00:19,440
definitely look for the other thing i

12417
08:00:19,440 --> 08:00:21,040
will say about volcanoes and i'm not

12418
08:00:21,040 --> 08:00:23,680
upping vocals but this is a unique thing

12419
08:00:23,680 --> 08:00:25,360
uh as uh

12420
08:00:25,360 --> 08:00:27,440
alexi used as an example their entire

12421
08:00:27,440 --> 08:00:29,600
handbook is online so you can use that

12422
08:00:29,600 --> 08:00:31,360
handbook to look through to get ideas

12423
08:00:31,360 --> 08:00:33,520
from um and they're very good at

12424
08:00:33,520 --> 08:00:35,040
providing a lot of open source stuff

12425
08:00:35,040 --> 08:00:36,638
which is why i have no issues uh

12426
08:00:36,638 --> 08:00:37,760
wrapping them

12427
08:00:37,760 --> 08:00:40,558
essentially so um very awesome stuff

12428
08:00:40,558 --> 08:00:43,040
that you guys have

12429
08:00:43,040 --> 08:00:45,600
thank you really that's awesome yeah

12430
08:00:45,600 --> 08:00:47,760
report range is open source um check it

12431
08:00:47,760 --> 08:00:50,398
out it's yeah it like it won't write the

12432
08:00:50,398 --> 08:00:52,638
content for you obviously um you have to

12433
08:00:52,638 --> 08:00:54,160
write your own templates in that but if

12434
08:00:54,160 --> 08:00:57,200
you hate word as much as we do it's

12435
08:00:57,200 --> 08:00:59,040
yeah it's just great to

12436
08:00:59,040 --> 08:01:00,160
build

12437
08:01:00,160 --> 08:01:03,200
reports in bits and pieces in markdown

12438
08:01:03,200 --> 08:01:05,840
and run one thing like you'd run

12439
08:01:05,840 --> 08:01:08,320
a code compiler pretty much

12440
08:01:08,320 --> 08:01:10,558
code compiler spits out an executable

12441
08:01:10,558 --> 08:01:13,280
report ranger spits out a dot pdf or i

12442
08:01:13,280 --> 08:01:15,520
mean it can spit out a docx

12443
08:01:15,520 --> 08:01:18,798
or markdown or html if you want

12444
08:01:18,798 --> 08:01:20,478
it's there

12445
08:01:20,478 --> 08:01:21,600
absolutely

12446
08:01:21,600 --> 08:01:23,040
thank you very much lexi it's been great

12447
08:01:23,040 --> 08:01:24,320
to have you and thank you matt who i

12448
08:01:24,320 --> 08:01:26,050

08:01:26,050 --> 08:01:28,080

thank you hey matt

12451
08:01:30,080 --> 08:01:31,600

12452
08:01:31,600 --> 08:01:34,000
naughty on your pc again

12453
08:01:34,000 --> 08:01:36,958

12454
08:01:36,958 --> 08:01:39,280
for having us again cheers no worries

12455
08:01:39,280 --> 08:01:41,520
mate

12456
08:01:41,520 --> 08:01:45,920
my god it is 8 p.m pretty much exactly

12457
08:01:45,920 --> 08:01:48,558
wow how did we do that like

12458
08:01:48,558 --> 08:01:50,398
we must be like professionals of this

12459
08:01:50,398 --> 08:01:53,680
kind of crap or something i know right

12460
08:01:53,680 --> 08:01:55,040
no

12461
08:01:55,040 --> 08:01:57,760
why aren't we not paying us to do this

12462
08:01:57,760 --> 08:01:59,200
i think we've talked about that before

12463
08:01:59,200 --> 08:02:01,680
and both of us said no we couldn't do it

12464
08:02:01,680 --> 08:02:03,040
on a professional basis and definitely

12465
08:02:03,040 --> 08:02:07,240
not on a physical basis either

12466
08:02:07,520 --> 08:02:10,320
don't no don't you have that look

12467
08:02:10,320 --> 08:02:12,000
no no they're getting paid for it thing

12468
08:02:12,000 --> 08:02:14,798
it's not getting paid for a thing yeah i

12469
08:02:14,798 --> 08:02:17,200
happily get paid to do this but yeah i i

12470
08:02:17,200 --> 08:02:19,120
am i'm actually just updating the

12471
08:02:19,120 --> 08:02:21,200
website you know take down the call for

12472
08:02:21,200 --> 08:02:23,040
papers and the schedule and things like

12473
08:02:23,040 --> 08:02:25,120
that and i'm putting up a

12474
08:02:25,120 --> 08:02:27,360
bit of a guidance on call for papers and

12475
08:02:27,360 --> 08:02:29,120
one of the things that i'm putting in

12476
08:02:29,120 --> 08:02:31,680
there is that there is no intention for

12477
08:02:31,680 --> 08:02:34,000
comfy con to turn into an in-person

12478
08:02:34,000 --> 08:02:36,000
event and i know that a few people have

12479
08:02:36,000 --> 08:02:37,520
suggested that over the last couple of

12480
08:02:37,520 --> 08:02:38,558
years

12481
08:02:38,558 --> 08:02:39,760
but no

12482
08:02:39,760 --> 08:02:40,478
no

12483
08:02:40,478 --> 08:02:44,160
no no no like you look at us right now

12484
08:02:44,160 --> 08:02:45,840
we are relatively cool and collected

12485
08:02:45,840 --> 08:02:48,000
imagine this on it's like imagine your

12486
08:02:48,000 --> 08:02:50,718
kids on meth imagine your kids running a

12487
08:02:50,718 --> 08:02:53,360
physical conference you would not uh be

12488
08:02:53,360 --> 08:02:54,798
able to cover it

12489
08:02:54,798 --> 08:02:56,000
um

12490
08:02:56,000 --> 08:02:57,680
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

12491
08:02:57,680 --> 08:02:59,520
be really embarrassing to all the people

12492
08:02:59,520 --> 08:03:01,120
who are backstage right now apart from

12493
08:03:01,120 --> 08:03:02,478
alexi who's still hiding there because

12494
08:03:02,478 --> 08:03:05,280
he doesn't close the bloody window um

12495
08:03:05,280 --> 08:03:07,120
he's giving me a funny look is i'm going

12496
08:03:07,120 --> 08:03:09,040
to bring everyone on stage to give her a

12497
08:03:09,040 --> 08:03:10,718
couple of thoughts so for those of you

12498
08:03:10,718 --> 08:03:12,798
who don't know comfy con is not just me

12499
08:03:12,798 --> 08:03:15,680
and shanna comfy con is also uh helped

12500
08:03:15,680 --> 08:03:18,320
by brian and hoodypony who is sitting

12501
08:03:18,320 --> 08:03:20,878
next to me on the sofa uh brian i have

12502
08:03:20,878 --> 08:03:22,320
put you on the spot but you're okay with

12503
08:03:22,320 --> 08:03:24,240
that if you just make a sign

12504
08:03:24,240 --> 08:03:26,718
yeah okay

12505
08:03:26,718 --> 08:03:29,440
so forever

12506
08:03:29,440 --> 08:03:31,600
you're unaware of it and dan's in twice

12507
08:03:31,600 --> 08:03:33,120
so for everyone who doesn't know comfy

12508
08:03:33,120 --> 08:03:34,798
con pretty much couldn't exist without

12509
08:03:34,798 --> 08:03:36,638
any of these people um

12510
08:03:36,638 --> 08:03:38,080
i think it's fair to say we all take the

12511
08:03:38,080 --> 08:03:40,638
workload a bit and we all help out it's

12512
08:03:40,638 --> 08:03:42,000
not just me it's not just shanna it's

12513
08:03:42,000 --> 08:03:44,798
everyone so what i would be keen to hear

12514
08:03:44,798 --> 08:03:46,798
is what everyone's

12515
08:03:46,798 --> 08:03:48,558
best thing that came from the conference

12516
08:03:48,558 --> 08:03:51,520
this year was so um brian i think we

12517
08:03:51,520 --> 08:03:54,320
should start with you

12518
08:03:54,558 --> 08:03:56,000
the best thing this year was probably

12519
08:03:56,000 --> 08:03:59,280
the sheer diversity of talks i mean

12520
08:03:59,280 --> 08:04:01,200
it wasn't just

12521
08:04:01,200 --> 08:04:02,958
pure cyber security it wasn't pen

12522
08:04:02,958 --> 08:04:04,558
testing it wasn't

12523
08:04:04,558 --> 08:04:07,280
any one topic it was the breadth of

12524
08:04:07,280 --> 08:04:08,878
breadth of cyber in the breadth of

12525
08:04:08,878 --> 08:04:10,080
anything actually because we also had

12526
08:04:10,080 --> 08:04:13,920
like knitting we had social interests so

12527
08:04:13,920 --> 08:04:15,600
it's basically

12528
08:04:15,600 --> 08:04:18,080
the community rather than

12529
08:04:18,080 --> 08:04:21,600
just the tech which is always

12530
08:04:21,600 --> 08:04:23,440
why i keep coming back and helping these

12531
08:04:23,440 --> 08:04:24,718
things is

12532
08:04:24,718 --> 08:04:26,160
this is the one conference that actually

12533
08:04:26,160 --> 08:04:28,638
does it rather than pretending to be for

12534
08:04:28,638 --> 08:04:30,718
the community this one actually is

12535
08:04:30,718 --> 08:04:33,040
um and we could not do that without all

12536
08:04:33,040 --> 08:04:35,520
our wonderful speakers um

12537
08:04:35,520 --> 08:04:38,320
this year last year year before

12538
08:04:38,320 --> 08:04:39,920
i can't believe we've done this three

12539
08:04:39,920 --> 08:04:42,398
times already um

12540
08:04:42,398 --> 08:04:43,600
but um

12541
08:04:43,600 --> 08:04:46,080
yeah um i hope everyone

12542
08:04:46,080 --> 08:04:47,680
has some thoughts about what they might

12543
08:04:47,680 --> 08:04:50,160
want to present next time should this

12544
08:04:50,160 --> 08:04:51,520
happen again

12545
08:04:51,520 --> 08:04:53,120
and um

12546
08:04:53,120 --> 08:04:54,718
yeah just taking another thoughts never

12547
08:04:54,718 --> 08:04:56,798
physical because we don't want to have

12548
08:04:56,798 --> 08:04:58,878
to worry about insurance

12549
08:04:58,878 --> 08:05:00,320
at the very least

12550
08:05:00,320 --> 08:05:01,120
um

12551
08:05:01,120 --> 08:05:02,878
but also like you look at it we're

12552
08:05:02,878 --> 08:05:04,398
running this whole conference with four

12553
08:05:04,398 --> 08:05:05,280
people

12554
08:05:05,280 --> 08:05:06,398
plus

12555
08:05:06,398 --> 08:05:08,398
some other helpers off the side that

12556
08:05:08,398 --> 08:05:10,878
are not here at the moment but

12557
08:05:10,878 --> 08:05:13,520
you can't do this thing physically with

12558
08:05:13,520 --> 08:05:14,718
just four people

12559
08:05:14,718 --> 08:05:16,080
and do it well

12560
08:05:16,080 --> 08:05:17,680
so

12561
08:05:17,680 --> 08:05:20,398
it also detracts from the focus on the

12562
08:05:20,398 --> 08:05:21,520
information

12563
08:05:21,520 --> 08:05:22,878
so

12564
08:05:22,878 --> 08:05:24,638
yeah we could not do this without the

12565
08:05:24,638 --> 08:05:27,760
audience or the speakers for ian and

12566
08:05:27,760 --> 08:05:29,760
sharna who

12567
08:05:29,760 --> 08:05:32,000
brought this all together

12568
08:05:32,000 --> 08:05:33,760
initially the last moment from an

12569
08:05:33,760 --> 08:05:36,638
airport lounge and now

12570
08:05:36,638 --> 08:05:38,080
we have it formally we have it

12571
08:05:38,080 --> 08:05:42,398
physically we have a sop for this

12572
08:05:42,398 --> 08:05:45,200
and here we are

12573
08:05:45,920 --> 08:05:47,120
i think the one thing that's quite

12574
08:05:47,120 --> 08:05:49,440
interesting is i never have to ask brian

12575
08:05:49,440 --> 08:05:50,878
if he's in

12576
08:05:50,878 --> 08:05:53,360
i can basically i know that brian will

12577
08:05:53,360 --> 08:05:54,958
be in and brian will be there ready to

12578
08:05:54,958 --> 08:05:56,958
help like i it's kind of a bad thing

12579
08:05:56,958 --> 08:05:59,440
that i never ask him but like

12580
08:05:59,440 --> 08:06:00,878
it's it's just an assumed thing that we

12581
08:06:00,878 --> 08:06:02,558
know brian is there and able to help us

12582
08:06:02,558 --> 08:06:03,920
so it's it's really great from that

12583
08:06:03,920 --> 08:06:05,680
perspective the other thing i'll add is

12584
08:06:05,680 --> 08:06:07,520
from a cost perspective

12585
08:06:07,520 --> 08:06:09,840
there are minimal costs involved as well

12586
08:06:09,840 --> 08:06:11,600
like the the reason we're able to do

12587
08:06:11,600 --> 08:06:13,040
this is because literally it's an

12588
08:06:13,040 --> 08:06:15,520
investment of our time not cost

12589
08:06:15,520 --> 08:06:16,878
um

12590
08:06:16,878 --> 08:06:19,040
dan you want to go next

12591
08:06:19,040 --> 08:06:20,478
sure

12592
08:06:20,478 --> 08:06:22,718
um

12593
08:06:23,120 --> 08:06:24,398
restaurants

12594
08:06:24,398 --> 08:06:25,680
max speak up

12595
08:06:25,680 --> 08:06:28,478
oh yeah okay

12596
08:06:28,478 --> 08:06:31,478
um

12597
08:06:32,240 --> 08:06:35,200
cyber as in like all the squishy parts

12598
08:06:35,200 --> 08:06:37,360
outside of the technical capability of

12599
08:06:37,360 --> 08:06:38,638
cyber

12600
08:06:38,638 --> 08:06:39,840
um

12601
08:06:39,840 --> 08:06:42,160
yeah just that whole

12602
08:06:42,160 --> 08:06:44,240
experience around that

12603
08:06:44,240 --> 08:06:47,680
because uh let's see

12604
08:06:47,680 --> 08:06:49,920
um

12605
08:06:50,240 --> 08:06:52,080
that's my bad

12606
08:06:52,080 --> 08:06:54,000
okay now you're blocking yourself that's

12607
08:06:54,000 --> 08:06:55,840
fun

12608
08:06:55,840 --> 08:06:56,718
but

12609
08:06:56,718 --> 08:06:58,398
there's so much more to cyber security

12610
08:06:58,398 --> 08:07:00,558
than lead hacks and

12611
08:07:00,558 --> 08:07:02,160
whatever you're new all day you're

12612
08:07:02,160 --> 08:07:03,840
dropping on stage or the new tool that

12613
08:07:03,840 --> 08:07:06,000
you're dropping on stage

12614
08:07:06,000 --> 08:07:09,760
um or the next vendor product

12615
08:07:09,760 --> 08:07:12,320
excuse me sorry um

12616
08:07:12,320 --> 08:07:13,360
but

12617
08:07:13,360 --> 08:07:15,840
that cyber is stuffed by humans by

12618
08:07:15,840 --> 08:07:17,280
people by

12619
08:07:17,280 --> 08:07:19,360
people with lives and that we are

12620
08:07:19,360 --> 08:07:20,798
dealing with people and i think that

12621
08:07:20,798 --> 08:07:23,200
came across a lot true

12622
08:07:23,200 --> 08:07:25,200
serendipitously through a lot of the

12623
08:07:25,200 --> 08:07:27,520
talks that happened over this weekend

12624
08:07:27,520 --> 08:07:30,080
um and i think that was

12625
08:07:30,080 --> 08:07:31,920
and people being comfortable to share

12626
08:07:31,920 --> 08:07:36,080
that at a conference like comfy corn

12627
08:07:36,080 --> 08:07:37,760
i think that's what makes

12628
08:07:37,760 --> 08:07:39,680
it really exciting and great and what i

12629
08:07:39,680 --> 08:07:41,520
loved about it

12630
08:07:41,520 --> 08:07:43,360
especially this time around

12631
08:07:43,360 --> 08:07:44,958
and i love the fact that

12632
08:07:44,958 --> 08:07:46,398
hoodie lives in a completely different

12633
08:07:46,398 --> 08:07:48,958
city from me but he decided to come and

12634
08:07:48,958 --> 08:07:50,878
we had a physical con with alex who's

12635
08:07:50,878 --> 08:07:53,760
also hiding in my corner and waving um

12636
08:07:53,760 --> 08:07:55,680
because we're like it canberra

12637
08:07:55,680 --> 08:07:57,600
let's just come around to my place and

12638
08:07:57,600 --> 08:07:59,760
just do so that was really good as

12639
08:07:59,760 --> 08:08:01,760
well yeah alex is on screen now you

12640
08:08:01,760 --> 08:08:02,798
can't hide

12641
08:08:02,798 --> 08:08:05,120
i don't know i know what a shame

12642
08:08:05,120 --> 08:08:06,080
um

12643
08:08:06,080 --> 08:08:08,878
shanna what do you think my my trouble

12644
08:08:08,878 --> 08:08:11,760
my troubled duo the two of us

12645
08:08:11,760 --> 08:08:14,080
um i think i've talked enough about what

12646
08:08:14,080 --> 08:08:15,520
i love about the con

12647
08:08:15,520 --> 08:08:17,840
um but i think one of the things that

12648
08:08:17,840 --> 08:08:20,320
makes it so great is that accessibility

12649
08:08:20,320 --> 08:08:21,760
i love the fact that we've had people

12650
08:08:21,760 --> 08:08:23,120
talking from

12651
08:08:23,120 --> 08:08:25,760
sydney melbourne queensland

12652
08:08:25,760 --> 08:08:26,878
wa

12653
08:08:26,878 --> 08:08:28,478
south australia

12654
08:08:28,478 --> 08:08:29,520
europe

12655
08:08:29,520 --> 08:08:32,160
uh do we have new zealand do we have any

12656
08:08:32,160 --> 08:08:34,958
new zealanders yeah um

12657
08:08:34,958 --> 08:08:38,718
so we've had people from all over and

12658
08:08:38,718 --> 08:08:40,160
you know especially over the past couple

12659
08:08:40,160 --> 08:08:41,440
of years where

12660
08:08:41,440 --> 08:08:43,600
getting around has been really difficult

12661
08:08:43,600 --> 08:08:46,798
that accessibility of this conference

12662
08:08:46,798 --> 08:08:49,200
means that we're able to

12663
08:08:49,200 --> 08:08:51,040
reach a whole bunch of people that we

12664
08:08:51,040 --> 08:08:53,040
otherwise wouldn't get to reach if we

12665
08:08:53,040 --> 08:08:55,520
were doing in person

12666
08:08:55,520 --> 08:08:58,240
and just the quality of talks just

12667
08:08:58,240 --> 08:09:01,120
always blows me away just absolutely

12668
08:09:01,120 --> 08:09:03,200
blows me away how

12669
08:09:03,200 --> 08:09:05,840
much talent we have and the people

12670
08:09:05,840 --> 08:09:07,520
willing to give up their time on a

12671
08:09:07,520 --> 08:09:10,240
weekend to share all of their knowledge

12672
08:09:10,240 --> 08:09:12,638
and just such a beautiful experience

12673
08:09:12,638 --> 08:09:14,718

12674

12677
08:09:22,000 --> 08:09:24,320
not feel like such an idiot up on stage

12678
08:09:24,320 --> 08:09:25,200

12679
08:09:25,200 --> 08:09:27,280

shout out to hoodie thanks so much for

12684
08:09:36,958 --> 08:09:39,200
stream yard um the zoom that we used

12685
08:09:39,200 --> 08:09:40,878
previously was free

12686
08:09:40,878 --> 08:09:41,840
through

12687
08:09:41,840 --> 08:09:45,120
paraflare um but it had its challenges

12688
08:09:45,120 --> 08:09:46,558
and one of those was having we'd have

12689
08:09:46,558 --> 08:09:49,760
like multiple zoom channels and

12690
08:09:49,760 --> 08:09:52,320
it was it was very difficult to manage

12691
08:09:52,320 --> 08:09:54,718
and and streaming out this time has made

12692
08:09:54,718 --> 08:09:56,878
it so much more

12693
08:09:56,878 --> 08:10:00,240
um seamless um and without you know

12694
08:10:00,240 --> 08:10:03,520

12696
08:10:05,520 --> 08:10:07,760
runchi has been i've just been able to

12697
08:10:07,760 --> 08:10:09,280

12699
08:10:11,760 --> 08:10:14,638
everyone who watched

12700
08:10:15,040 --> 08:10:16,958
um so basically everyone has talked

12701
08:10:16,958 --> 08:10:18,160
about everything that i'm going to talk

12702
08:10:18,160 --> 08:10:19,360
about so i'm going to keep it short and

12703
08:10:19,360 --> 08:10:21,760
sweet and then say good night um two

12704
08:10:21,760 --> 08:10:23,280
things that i really love i'll just echo

12705
08:10:23,280 --> 08:10:25,360
what shanna said um providing a really

12706
08:10:25,360 --> 08:10:28,638
safe atmosphere for people who um

12707
08:10:28,638 --> 08:10:30,798
haven't spoken to before or had spoken

12708
08:10:30,798 --> 08:10:32,878
before and weren't comfortable with it

12709
08:10:32,878 --> 08:10:35,200
and just being able to provide

12710
08:10:35,200 --> 08:10:37,600
an area which was tailored to them like

12711
08:10:37,600 --> 08:10:39,520
we did a lot we spent a lot of effort

12712
08:10:39,520 --> 08:10:40,718
trying to tailor whatever we're doing

12713
08:10:40,718 --> 08:10:41,920
like if you wanted to record you could

12714
08:10:41,920 --> 08:10:43,760
record if you wanted to have your camera

12715
08:10:43,760 --> 08:10:45,360
on and off you could have your camera on

12716
08:10:45,360 --> 08:10:46,958
and off um

12717
08:10:46,958 --> 08:10:48,718
size of talks somebody said that i think

12718
08:10:48,718 --> 08:10:50,240
it was louisa one of the louise has said

12719
08:10:50,240 --> 08:10:52,000
like the fact that we had 10 to 30

12720
08:10:52,000 --> 08:10:53,680
minute talks rather than a whole you

12721
08:10:53,680 --> 08:10:55,280
must do 30 minute talks means we can get

12722
08:10:55,280 --> 08:10:58,398
a really amazing amount of things so um

12723
08:10:58,398 --> 08:11:01,040
without all you speakers we've pretty

12724
08:11:01,040 --> 08:11:01,840
much

12725
08:11:01,840 --> 08:11:04,478
you know we wouldn't be doing our job

12726
08:11:04,478 --> 08:11:05,360
um

12727
08:11:05,360 --> 08:11:06,718
and then

12728
08:11:06,718 --> 08:11:08,398
the other thing is i'm awaiting all the

12729
08:11:08,398 --> 08:11:10,240
money from big chicken because i've been

12730
08:11:10,240 --> 08:11:12,958
bloody advertising all weekend

12731
08:11:12,958 --> 08:11:15,440
if kfc don't give me some money

12732
08:11:15,440 --> 08:11:18,320
then i'm i'm going home

12733
08:11:18,320 --> 08:11:20,000
but i'm going back to my

12734
08:11:20,000 --> 08:11:22,080
dollhouse and throwing a tantrum

12735
08:11:22,080 --> 08:11:24,240

12736
08:11:24,240 --> 08:11:26,080
binghams definitely owes me something

12737
08:11:26,080 --> 08:11:27,680

12738
08:11:27,680 --> 08:11:30,478
to chicken i swear to god um

12739
08:11:30,478 --> 08:11:33,200
