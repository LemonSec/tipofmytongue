why are we here again

6
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,079

7
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,840
time it's my fault

8
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,079
this yeah we've already discussed that

9
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,840
it's my fault it's always my fault i

10
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,680
always take full responsibility honestly

11
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,720

12
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,880
um

13
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,439
yeah so comfy con 2022

14
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,040
who would have thought two years after

15
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720
the first one that we'd be running a

16
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,840
third one

17
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,680
and also that

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,520
we would still be dealing with covert

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,079
and all the fun and people kept still

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,439
cancelling conferences and

21
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,119

23
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,639
last couple years i think

24

weekend first

56
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,080
i'm pretty excited i've gotten some

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,360
sneak previews into some of the

58
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,920

59
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,200
awesome

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,599
so i think there is going to be a lot

61
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,040
going on

62
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
i am going to make sure that everyone

63
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,720
goes away with the knowledge that

64
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,560
attendees are superior to nuggies

65
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
just my

66
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,360
yeah i think so let's do a poll let's

67
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,799
get this going

68
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,720

amazing that people are so willing to

78
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,599

i apologize i don't know the appropriate

122
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,240
form of wording for new zealand as well

123
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,800
but we also welcome those um aboriginal

124

comfycon is um where have you been but

128
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,320
um basically

129
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,880
this was started because we were crazy

130
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,160
and we wanted to run a conference when a

131
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,280
whole bunch of conferences were getting

132
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,240
cancelled

133
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,400
and now we run it roughly every year and

134
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,759
have the discord community which

135
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,759
hopefully you're a member of

136
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,000
um and you can join in and and chat

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,919
through that community

138
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,280
um

139
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,520
not only do i love our community but i

140
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,479
love our sponsors

141
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,960
our sponsors nuka cola aperture science

142

arasaka and lttstore.com

143
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,919
um just because

144
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,000
i'm kidding um this is because someone

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
annoyed me this week so i'm just proving

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,199
a point

147
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,120
comic con has no sponsors we are not

148
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,800
corporately driven

149
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
we explicitly ask that all of our

150
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,400
speakers do not present on their

151
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,680
companies

152
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,039
uh they're allowed to talk about who

153
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,240
they work for in the first couple of

154
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,759
slides and that's about it we accept no

155
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,240
money from corporates we accept no

156
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,080
bribes even my own company is trying to

157
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,160
give me some money you know it's 100

158
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,319
community driven community wrong

159
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,240
so what you can hear today is some

160
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,160
amazing talks um

161
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
and it's about to be

162
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,520
it's about having the sharing of

163
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,639
knowledge no matter what company you

164
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,479

172
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,680
okay dan's paying for stream yard so we

173
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,720
love dan

174
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,039
um but uh that's probably about the only

175
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,199
expense that we have which is oh and

176
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,039
alcohol and caffeine

177
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,599
um how do we interact um so for those

178
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,880
who are watching on youtube the youtube

179
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,720
chat is turned off

180
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,240
the reason the youtube chat is turned

181
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,919
off is because we want everyone to join

182
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,800
discord um that is so the a we can have

183
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,440
a single point of conversation and b

184
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,800
so that we don't have to moderate three

185
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,240
different things which is a bit of a

186
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,440
pain in the ass for those people who

187
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,280
have volunteered to moderate so there is

188
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,039
a link on the web page you can also scan

189
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,199
the qr code if you're feeling willing to

190
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,240
scan qr codes although i think after

191
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,919
contact tracing everyone's kind of used

192
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,199
the idea of scanning things they don't

193
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,520
trust anymore um so that's probably

194
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
helpful

195
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,680
um code of conduct very quickly um

196
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,960
there's a full code of contact on the

197
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,360
web page but simply put don't be a dick

198
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
um it is not up to you to decide what

199
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,960
constitutes being a dick it's up to us

200
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,240
to constitute is a dick um and if we

201
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,919
decide that it's being a dick then we

202
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,840
will kick you out it's as simple as that

203
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,879
we've

204
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,440
we're lucky in that we've had no issues

205
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,840
bar won in the last two conferences so

206
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,360
we don't anticipate any of this time but

207
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,479
just

208
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,319
everyone is here to enjoy themselves

209
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,120
everyone are here to learn new things

210
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,759
and um just help with that atmosphere of

211
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,759
learning and supporting and

212
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,000
there's some people

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,840
who are speakers today who's the first

214
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
time speaking all those people who've

215
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,680
been here a while and are still nervous

216
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,400
we just encourage you to um

217
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,080
think positively about what they're

218
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
saying um it's taken a lot of effort for

219
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,000
a lot of people to speak today and so

220
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,719
therefore um it's to be appreciative to

221
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,279
them as well

222
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,519
uh one thing we haven't announced that i

223
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,200
will announce now that all the speakers

224
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,560
and all the helpers will be getting a

225
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,720
badge um a digital badge that's

226
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,240
available on i believe it's called

227
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,279
badger

228
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,399
um

229
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,640
basically this will say that you were a

230
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,080
speaker at comfy con and you can use it

231
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,440
in a whole bunch of different places and

232
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,279
all the volunteers will get one as well

233
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,760
i haven't told brian and uh hoodie yet

234
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,120
but they're also getting a special one

235
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,839
because they are our amazing admins

236
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,600
running the entire thing as well so they

237
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,480
will be getting one too um but we will

238
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,320
probably at some point also be extending

239
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,839
this backwards to the previous comfycon

240
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,839
speakers but this is our way of saying

241
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,440
thank you to all the amazing speakers

242
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,200
who are coming forward and are giving up

243
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,959
their time

244
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,839
which leads me on to our first wonderful

245
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,920
amazing speaker who

246
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,000

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
know who she is so laura is the founder

all right cool um

276
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
just kind of oriented myself a little

277
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,600
bit on this uh right cool um hello

278
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,120
everyone i don't normally have such

279
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,680
flowing uh luscious red hair nor do i

280
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,760
have a mermaid tail but i was encouraged

281
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,160
to join wholeheartedly into today's

282
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,560
proceedings uh my name is laura um you

283
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,240
may have seen me from other such talks

284
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,079
in other such places but that's not why

285
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,760
we're here today we're here to talk

286
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,720
about amazing things now this talk and

287
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,160
the position in the conference is more

288
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,079
of a keynote type slot which means i get

289
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,880
the luxury of talking in kind of high

290
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,240
level terms and trying to get you to

291
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,680
think of it differently um so

292
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
without further ado i'm going to jump

293
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,079
into something so some bits about me

294
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,800
um i do lots of businessy professional

295
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,480
stuff but that's not why i'm here i'm an

296
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,959
engineer i'm a connector of people and

297
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,760
of things and i'm a storyteller i am the

298
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,160
type of nerd that sits and restores old

299
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,240
technology from 100 years ago

300
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,200
makes it work because i love the way

301
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,279
that how we have done things before it's

302
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,680
connected to how we do things now and i

303
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,839
also love that things that are

304
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,600
overlooked and forgotten have so much

305
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,959
value

306
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,399
but

307
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,200
i've also had a really interesting path

308
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,800
and it's an interesting path not to kind

309
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,560
of go oh i did lots of things my mom's

310
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,480
proud of me you don't need to care

311
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,519
but it's taken me through some really

312
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,160
really interesting technologies and

313
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,959
interesting technical challenges

314
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,720
now i think that's important as a

315
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
security person right now because i want

316
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,880
us to change the way that we think of

317
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
ourselves and forgive me it's going to

318
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,440
be that kind of talk um i've been lucky

319
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,120
enough to be involved in all sorts of

320
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,200
things from space robots

321
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,279
that unfortunately kind of never made it

322
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,320
to mars uh through to cern and the large

323
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
hadron collider and

324
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,360
to penetration testing awesome systems

325
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
that will literally change the world

326
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,040
someday

327
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,519
but the wonderful thing about this

328
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,760
amazing adventure and in fact about all

329
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,360
of the technology we're building today

330
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,360
is it's a goddamn awful mess every last

331
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,440
bit of it and building amazing things is

332
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,399
messy

333
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,920
it's not the case that we go you know

334
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,200
what would be really cool i'm going to

335
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,279
go and put a space rocket and put it on

336
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,200
another planet that'll be cool

337
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,320
we don't just go from a to b and have a

338
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,160
glorious adventure we blow stuff up on

339
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,959
the way we destroy them we make mistakes

340
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,480
now our careers as security people

341
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
largely are profiting off other people's

342
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,639
mistakes we're there to find them

343
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,120
in the name of staying safe

344
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,279
now i want us to focus less on the

345
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,040
mistakes though and hopefully through

346
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,920
the courses talk how our role

347
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,160
works in conjunction with these amazing

348
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
things which let's face it are the main

349
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,680
event

350
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,519
now this picture here

351
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,959
for those who haven't been traveling

352
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,560
much so all of us um is part of the roof

353
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,279
at a very famous what's called minor

354
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,519
cathedral in barcelona called sagrada

355
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,880
familia and it's still not finished it's

356
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,199
been in progress now for 130 years

357
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,160
and it is a beautiful thing

358
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,320
in its time it was going to be

359
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,680
revolutionary breathtaking uh gaudy

360
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,800
light art essentially but you know in

361
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,880
religious icon form

362
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,160
now they're still working on it now

363
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,839
now why is this relevant to a security

364
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,800
conference well because it's imperfect

365
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,480
it's something that we are going to look

366
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,160
back at and we have already been looking

367
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,519
at for 100 years now as a an engineering

368
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,360
masterwork

369
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
that even though it's not done we still

370
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,519
think it's amazing even though it

371
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,760
literally has holes in the walls we

372
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,519
still think it's amazing

373
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,320
and

374
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,160
we didn't we don't tell the story from

375
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,920
the perspective of the structural

376
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,079
engineer who said to gowdy hey that's a

377
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,519
really dumb idea you should perhaps not

378
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,839
do that we tell it because of the

379
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,399
inspiration and because of the new

380
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,519
things it brought with it

381
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,680
now these are three people you've

382
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,639
probably never heard of

383
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,480
so i want you to just think for a second

384
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,079
of what they could have in common and

385
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,519
i'm kind of going to give you the story

386
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,120
and why it's important that we're

387
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,360
sharing it today

388
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,160
so marie of ambition brown she was

389
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,560
famous in 1969 her big achievement nils

390
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,279
bolin uh about the same time and maria

391
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,040
beasley earlier than that now these are

392
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,440
three incredible inventors you've

393
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
probably never heard of

394
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,120
marie van britten brown in 1969 was the

395
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,360
first person to invent spy holes that

396
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,680
came with security cameras so she was

397
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
really paranoid about being attacked in

398
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,079
her home in new york and she literally

399
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,480
drilled holes in her door inserted small

400
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,079
cameras into them so that she could see

401
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,360
who was outside there was also a

402
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,120
microphone involved so she could have a

403
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,199
talk with them so for us all going

404
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,880
around saying that nest and all of these

405
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,040
home alarm systems are new and novel

406
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,240
 marie was doing in 1969 with

407
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,399
the tech that was around then

408
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,920
she was arguably a security person

409
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,360
neil bolen

410
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,959
i will have mispronounced that name i do

411
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,560
apologize for anyone of scandinavian

412
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,160
origin um is the person who invented the

413
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,560
seatbelt the invention that we all use

414
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,639
every time we're in a vehicle to stay

415
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,199
safe that has saved literally millions

416
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,199
of lives around the planet

417
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,880
but we don't talk about him we talk

418
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,120
about teslas and we talk about fast cars

419
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,360
and we talk about you know what's bond

420
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,800
driving this year

421
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,880
not the seat belt

422
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,360
and maria beasley maria beasley was one

423
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,839
of the pioneers that redesigned the

424
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,160
lifeboat so whenever we've had a

425
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,079
large-scale ocean

426
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,839
misadventure where people have been

427
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,560
saved because of those lifeboats maria

428
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,399
was actually one of the pivotal people

429
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,360
in that

430
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,320
they are all safety and security people

431
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,000
and they are all people you've never

432
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,759
heard of and will probably never hear of

433
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,560
again

434
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,000
um you can go read about them they're

435
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,519
fascinating people

436
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,600
but the point here is

437
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,079
their job was still important even

438
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,440
though they're not the people we talk

439
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,480
about

440
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,000
the important part of the story the

441
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,920
story that persisted was the excitement

442
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,680
it was new technologies that spawn

443
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
surveillance systems albeit not all of

444
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
those are good

445
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,440
the technology that made cars

446
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,680
something that could go faster and kill

447
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,040
less people which was a really important

448
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,519
thing for mass adoption and could keep

449
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,120
us safe on large

450
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,480
voyages whether we're shipping big

451
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,079
things around the world like you know

452
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,119
vehicles or people

453
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,720
now when you look at building amazing

454
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,319
things today i am genuinely super

455
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,079
excited about the technology we're

456
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,079
building today and i'm a security person

457
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,599
you know i am the type of person like

458
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,280
most of you who goes to a party and can

459
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,799
tell you the 15 ways that this is going

460
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,799
to go horribly wrong

461
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,640
because i'm wired that way but at the

462
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,000
same time

463
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,559
i think it is an incredible time to be

464
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,079
in technology

465
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,919
we are building amazing things that are

466
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,520
taking us to space

467
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,679
that are changing the way we deal with

468
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,720
money sex food education friendships

469
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,679
games

470
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,919
every element of our life now some of

471
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,520
it's not great you know i'm not gonna

472
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,000
say all technology is wonderful but if

473
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,440
you are like me and you were ever a

474
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,200
sci-fi nerd and you read those books

475
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,120
from you know arthur c clarke and even

476
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,880
way before then

477
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,200
the technologies that they predicted

478
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,120
were going to change the world are now

479
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,679
becoming real things

480
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,919
now as security people we're not famed

481
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,520
for being involved in this we're not the

482
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,960
people who are going to build additional

483
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,320
cathedral we're not the modern day gowdy

484
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,120
but we are the modern day inventor of a

485
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,080
seatbelt or of a life jacket or of a

486
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,240
security system we are the people who

487
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,480
are going to turn this amazing digital

488
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
legacy this transformational age we're

489
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,200
in

490
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,120
into something safe

491
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,720
and in the process of it we're going to

492
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,000
be forgotten

493
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
and that's okay

494
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,360
i want to tell you a little bit the

495
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,039
story about this talk today today's

496
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,039
talk's a bit interesting to me and you

497
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,559
can't tell because i'm wearing a dodgy

498
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,200
wig and under that you still can't tell

499
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,120
but i'm wearing hearing aids

500
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
i have what's called low frequency

501
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,000
hearing loss so

502
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,679
sorry guys who are listening i can't

503
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,120
hear you it's not just an excuse

504
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,799
genuinely can't physically hear the

505
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,640
frequency of your voice

506
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,160
which is kind of a bit of a pain when

507
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,880
you're like one of 20 women in 3 000 men

508
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,720
in security but anyway that's a side

509
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,760
story

510
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,120
um

511
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,640
i got new hearing aids on wednesday

512
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,240
now hearing aids have come a long way

513
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,840
from you know sticking a little cone in

514
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,000
your ear and shouting obnoxiously at

515
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,039
people

516
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,480
the hearing aids that are in my ears

517
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,160
today are the reason i'm talking to you

518
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
the microphone that i'm using is built

519
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,440
into my hearing aids not into the

520
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,880
computer

521
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,679
the uh speakers that i can hear the

522
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,120
other presenters that i can hear the

523
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,360
talks that i can arrange myself with the

524
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,520
conference organizers that's going

525
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,080
directly into my ears into the into my

526
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,960
head

527
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,440
and in fact so is at the same time the

528
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,320
tv in the house and my phone and about

529
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,720
five other devices

530
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,360
now on a cool technology kind of sense

531
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,200
this is amazing

532
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,799
this tiny little thing they are

533
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,000
literally

534
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,720
four centimeters long they weigh less

535
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,240
than 50 grams

536
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,720
is revolutionizing how i hear but then i

537
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,880
put my security nerd hat on

538
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,720
because what i've just told you is that

539
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,919
there are two baby microphones sat in

540
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,000
deeply embedded in my ears

541
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,919
and little headphones

542
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,600
that are recording and listening to

543
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,520
absolutely everything in my world right

544
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,799
now

545
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,400
now for those of us who freaked out

546
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,720
about an amazon echo or

547
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,640
the you know the google things stick in

548
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,720
our living rooms or

549
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,280
siri listening to every move on a phone

550
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,520
now welcome to my world it's not my

551
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,440
phone that's listening to me literally

552
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,679
in my ear there is a device i need that

553
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,159
is listening to everything too

554
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,280
now

555
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,200
is it right for me to then freak out and

556
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,720
say hey well dangerous future we

557
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,240
shouldn't do this no

558
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,919
my job as a security person is to try

559
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,080
and figure out how we do this understand

560
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,520
how it could go wrong

561
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,600
and then still do it anyway and that

562
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,840
terrifies me as a security person i'll

563
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
be really honest

564
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,679
it's what the future needs us to do but

565
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,120
it's the most uncomfortable thing for us

566
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,039
to do we need to see these amazing

567
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,799
inventions and how they could all go

568
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,760
wrong

569
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,080
swallow that fear and figure out how we

570
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,320
make it happen

571
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,000
so when it comes to my hearing aids for

572
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,200
example what's the worst thing that

573
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,559
could happen well

574
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,240
i go into a lot of rooms with a lot of

575
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,039
people and this is my chrono recording

576
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,480
device it's connected to computing

577
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,360
devices so either you could torture me

578
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,840
by sending you know horrific songs my

579
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,120
direction please don't do that it's

580
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,679
really unkind or you could listen to

581
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,600
whatever else is going on in the room

582
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,080
now if this sounds like spy tech well it

583
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,640
really is this is the exactly the same

584
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,559
technology just on a different scale in

585
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,440
a different way that is used in close

586
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,600
surveillance

587
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,520
i think that's amazing but also

588
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,360
terrifying what is this world we're

589
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,000
living in this is way beyond app sex

590
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,679
security and you know is there a sequel

591
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,400
injection in your ears

592
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,799
this is a really cool picture this is uh

593
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,559
taken this year because kovit has

594
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,960
brought many many new uses of technology

595
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,080
and in fact there's an australian

596
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,480
company that's helping in this space

597
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,039
but we're using drones autonomous drones

598
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,440
to deliver medical supplies to areas

599
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,640
that need them now those medical

600
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,960
supplies can be masks they can be

601
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,440
vaccines they can be

602
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,080
any kind of medical equipment to places

603
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,480
like pacific islands where it's not the

604
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,320
case you can just drive to your local

605
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,640
hospital and get help

606
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,440
now

607
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
exciting technology right we've got

608
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,360
drones instead of you know being used to

609
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,039
hurt each other or hurt other people

610
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,240
they're they're getting things to where

611
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,600
they needed now this is way beyond

612
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,919
amazon drops goodies on your doorstep

613
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,039
this is this is helpful tech right

614
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,960
how could it go wrong though well

615
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,840
you've got medical supplies these are

616
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,120
valuable they're going to at-risk

617
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,960
regions

618
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,640
these drones to do what they do the

619
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,480
technology on them is surveillance

620
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,080
equipment we've got cameras we've got

621
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,240
sensors we've got over the wire

622
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,559
transmissions going on

623
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,159
so as a community our job again is to

624
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,640
feel that excitement and the need

625
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,880
and then figure out how to do it safely

626
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,640
and that feels uncomfortable because

627
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,400
what if we get it wrong

628
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,640
what if we screw up and that drone

629
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,320
doesn't do what it needs to do what if

630
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,480
somebody breaks in and hacks it

631
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,520
and that's what we're seeing in

632
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,000
companies now we see a reluctance to do

633
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
innovation because well if it goes wrong

634
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,840
then people will get hurt and i agree

635
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,520
that's terrifying

636
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,480
but

637
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
what if we don't do it

638
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,200
what's the repercussion if we don't

639
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,880
we've got computer systems that are

640
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,600
diagnosing cancer quicker than humans

641
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,440
because well let's face it this is

642
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,600
pattern recognition and it's literally

643
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,080
that what we build computers to do there

644
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,960
are currently 1.9 million people per

645
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,919
year in america alone diagnosed with

646
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,120
cancer

647
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,760
now that's 1.9 million people's worth of

648
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,480
data that needs to be looked at in great

649
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,200
detail to see if there are traces still

650
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,120
of cancer after treatment

651
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,480
but 1.9 million is the diagnosed version

652
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,559
now that means that there was a much

653
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,720
bigger set that had their data looked at

654
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,799
but weren't diagnosed with cancer

655
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,480
now this is talking about scaling

656
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,520
medicine to entire populations global

657
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,279
populations rather than those who can

658
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,080
get in front of a specialist

659
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,679
but what could go wrong

660
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,640
well

661
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,039
this is health information right this is

662
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,400
super sensitive health information and

663
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,559
not every type of health situation is

664
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,559
data that you'd want to share

665
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,640
and yet we see in the news we don't see

666
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,240
the stories of this we see the stories

667
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,720
of ransomware against hospitals

668
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,360
and we see how this is being disrupted

669
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,039
by cyber prime

670
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,880
when what we need to be doing is

671
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,760
focusing how we help this go faster and

672
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,600
be more secure and that's not gonna look

673
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,279
like patching some windows boxes that's

674
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,559
gonna look like a type security we've

675
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,559
never done before

676
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,559
finally lego now i can't talk about the

677
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,840
future and not have it back to the

678
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,279
future car and talk about lego at the

679
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,640
same time why not um so fun fact

680
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,600
lego produced 350 million minifigures

681
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,039
last year

682
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,159
they sell uh millions of sets each year

683
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,320
and they employ 20 000 people around the

684
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,120
world now is it as important as somebody

685
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,279
diagnosing cancer well you know depends

686
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,960
who you are really i'm probably not

687
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,480
going to argue that

688
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,640
but what i am going to say is to those

689
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,039
20 000 people who work there it is

690
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,600
and to those 350 million people who

691
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,000
might buy a minifigure this year

692
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,440
that's important because fun and play

693
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,559
and games are also part of what we do to

694
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,559
survive they're part of how we relax and

695
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,880
connect and find joy

696
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,440
and so security and securing the future

697
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,840
is going to be about how we embrace

698
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,240
finding these amazing things and keeping

699
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,840
them safe so what goes wrong if someone

700
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,360
hacks lego well

701
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,120
is the world go end well no clearly not

702
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,799
but

703
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,360
there are lots of designs out there

704
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,200
that they are sharing in the background

705
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,360
like many other product companies

706
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,760
and there's 20 000 people who rely on

707
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,600
that company existing and thriving to

708
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
have a job and there's companies all

709
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,240
around the world whether they're two

710
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,640
people or 20 000 or 2 million

711
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,799
who all need that sense of safety and

712
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,440
security so that they can do their bit

713
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,559
of amazing in the world

714
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,279
history history long after we are gone

715
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,960
is going to remember these amazing

716
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,000
things

717
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,159
not the people who help protect them

718
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,320
my legacy isn't going to be you know on

719
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,880
a monument or a web page somewhere

720
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,600
i help companies go really really fast

721
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,960
and put security through what they do

722
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,120
and many of you do the same thing

723
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
and i don't need to be remembered and

724
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,320
neither do you

725
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,880
what we need to focus on as a community

726
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,799
is how we help

727
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,520
more of these amazing creations happen

728
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,440
in a way that's constructive and not

729
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,039
getting in their way and that's really

730
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,279
hard for us because what we're saying is

731
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,960
we know this vulnerability and we know

732
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,400
there's risk and we've got to do it

733
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,159
anyway

734
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,679
that means we need to change what we're

735
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,880
doing now fun fact again there are 3 000

736
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,480
security product companies in the world

737
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,840
right now

738
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,760
there is a nice man in america called

739
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,840
richard steinen who creates a yearbook

740
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,240
of security product companies and he

741
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,840
will show you you can actually read

742
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,279
about every single one of them and he's

743
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,919
putting together the family tree of them

744
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,840
people will disagree with me on this but

745
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,279
none of those companies are going to be

746
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,320
remembered

747
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,760
not really

748
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,400
because what we do is supporting cast

749
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,240
what we do is the background thing that

750
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,360
lets amazing things happen

751
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,840
what we need to do is focusing on giving

752
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,320
a different group of people some skills

753
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
and some ability now i'm not here to

754
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,000
sell you anything i absolutely promise

755
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,880
you

756
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,679
there's 32 million software developers

757
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,279
in the world right now

758
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,600
that's a phenomenal figure

759
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,799
and it grows at 1.2 million per year

760
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,640
now those engineers not all of them are

761
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,480
building amazing things some of them are

762
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,000
you know building the same systems we've

763
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
been building for 40 years

764
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,080
but a number of them are

765
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,880
our job as a security community is not

766
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,559
to stand aside and say hey your baby is

767
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,240
ugly and you should feel bad don't build

768
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,679
that amazing thing

769
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,919
is to actually swallow the fear that we

770
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,880
fear sometimes and go hey 32 million

771
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,760
software engineers how can we help

772
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,000
how can we help you go faster tell me

773
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,399
about your world

774
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,279
now

775
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,279
we tend to think in security that

776
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,520
everything is equal on the other side of

777
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,120
the divide so when we look at

778
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,799
application security engineering for

779
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,919
example

780
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,000
now we've done a survey me and my team

781
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,360
in the last year

782
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,520
we found that less than two percent of

783
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,120
companies globally are actually what we

784
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,320
call cutting edge in terms of

785
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,919
application security and protecting

786
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,520
their amazing things

787
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,159
they're actively doing devops they're

788
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,000
building an application security team

789
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,320
that can actually protect it for them

790
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,919
another 15 percenter in what we call

791
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,480
fragmented exploration that means that

792
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,919
they're doing bits and pieces they're

793
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,080
trying it but they're not really sure if

794
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,000
it's working and i'm going to raise my

795
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,080
hand i've seen way way more of these

796
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,000
than i have the cutting edge and in fact

797
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,520
for some of you you might work for

798
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,600
somewhere that's more in that station at

799
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,480
cutting edge and that's okay too

800
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,240
the biggest group by far however is

801
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,600
emerging

802
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,520
now please don't get me wrong here this

803
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,279
isn't people building amazing things who

804
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,480
don't know what they're doing they know

805
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,600
exactly what they're doing they're

806
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,760
building amazing things

807
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,200
but

808
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
finding a way to balance innovation and

809
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
security is really hard

810
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,320
and so

811
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,840
they haven't got the support around them

812
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,600
they don't have a community like us

813
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
who's helping them find their amazing

814
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,000
things and do something with it

815
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,679
now if this is the case and this is the

816
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,960
breakdown

817
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,039
then we have to rethink the way we do

818
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,159
security

819
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,320
because those two percent of people up

820
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,000
there are the ones buying the fancy

821
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,919
tools who are employing the teams of

822
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,120
people

823
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,159
that 83 down the bottom aren't

824
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,640
and it serves 83 who are you know going

825
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,240
to be doing the crazy systems we can't

826
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,440
even imagine of right now

827
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,399
now how we going to do this well my

828
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,480
mission in life and i say this publicly

829
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,240
and i hope you will too is to make

830
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,440
myself redundant maybe i'm not a mermaid

831
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,120
you know i do have a gloriously sparking

832
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,880
sparkly tail here today

833
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,760
but

834
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,159
my aim is to go live on a beach not

835
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,919
because i'm rich and famous but because

836
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,480
people don't need me to exist anymore as

837
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,679
a professional

838
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,840
i'm the type of person you bring in to

839
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,919
in the nicest possible love-filled way

840
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,520
tell you everything is screwed in your

841
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,640
world and you should probably do

842
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,480
something about it

843
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,279
and if we succeed at this if we give the

844
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,760
teams building amazing things all of the

845
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,840
things they need whether it's tooling

846
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,520
whether it's just support when they need

847
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,399
it whether it's education whether it is

848
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,320
just a different way of protecting our

849
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,240
borders

850
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,960
whatever we give them however we do this

851
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,039
is a step towards us not needing to do

852
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,399
it anymore

853
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,080
i was a penetration tester for a number

854
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,960
of years probably most part of a decade

855
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,120
and it's boring i'm gonna be that person

856
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,559
says you know we have a lot of people

857
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,360
who want to be pentesters but in reality

858
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,440
what we see every single time is the

859
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,240
same issues and it's because if you do

860
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,080
the same process again and again and

861
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,520
again without changing it you get the

862
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,960
same results

863
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,360
we have to change the process

864
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,080
and that's at every stage you know if

865
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,360
you've got one of those friends who is

866
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,120
the ideas person in your group who is

867
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,039
saying hey i really really want to do

868
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,399
this amazing thing it's going to change

869
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,600
the world

870
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,679
some of us myself included we've been

871
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,039
known to be the people who sit down and

872
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,720
go let me buy you a beer and tell you

873
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,559
how this is going to fail

874
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,080
if that's you

875
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,399
we need to reverse that we need to say

876
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:15,840
all right this is a crazy idea i'll give

877
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,440
you that and it can fail in many ways

878
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,440
but here's how we can make it a bit

879
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,679
safer can i help you

880
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,440
we need to protect our legacy systems

881
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,440
the amazing systems that were built 30

882
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,919
years ago really were amazing you know

883
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,000
mainframe computers may not be sexy to

884
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,320
us anymore but they're still going

885
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,840
they're still underpinning our banking

886
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,360
systems they're still handling millions

887
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,919
of transactions a day

888
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,559
but there's nobody left to protect them

889
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,720
there's literally such a shortage of the

890
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,240
skilled engineers to look after them

891
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,080
that people are hoping that the

892
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,240
equipment doesn't fail in some cases

893
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,399
they don't even manufacture the physical

894
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,320
infrastructure that goes on anymore so

895
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,159
it's literally emulators on top of

896
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,880
emulators on top of emulators

897
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
we need to find a way as a community to

898
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,279
protect that too but that's not a sexy

899
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,600
problem it's not cutting edge it's not

900
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,080
you know devsecops it's it's old school

901
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,679
every little bit of this has something

902
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,200
you can help with whether you are

903
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,320
listening to this and you're a pen

904
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,159
tester or you're a security architect or

905
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,919
you're a designer or

906
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,840
you are the type of person who runs

907
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,320
around the edges doing the monitoring

908
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,880
i want you to find a piece of your job

909
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,880
that you can give away to someone who's

910
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,360
not in security and i really don't mean

911
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,440
shifting left if you keep shifting left

912
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,640
infinitely everything ends up in the

913
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,240
ocean i mean collaborate and support

914
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,559
somebody to do what you're doing and

915
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,919
hopefully that somebody will be somebody

916
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,360
who's building something amazing

917
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,279
the final thing i want to leave you with

918
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,960
before i kind of wrap this up and open

919
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,039
if there's any questions out there

920
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,519
is to remind you that the world is very

921
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,919
big and there is a lot of amazing

922
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,159
technology being built right now

923
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,840
if you're currently protecting this

924
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,399
piece of software or equipment or that

925
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,480
you're not excited about

926
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,000
that you don't go to work every day and

927
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,919
go oh my goodness this is going to

928
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,080
change the world or hey this did change

929
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,600
the world like what it's doing to help

930
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,720
people

931
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,880
then find a new job

932
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,679
there are so many roles available all

933
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,200
around new zealand australia and the

934
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,880
wider world right now

935
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,799
and i'm not talking about you know you

936
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,279
know or sock analyst level one jobs i'm

937
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,519
talking about security jobs where you

938
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,440
are helping secure the drones of the

939
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
future there's a drone security company

940
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,519
in australia that's doing just that it's

941
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,200
got a track and trace system for drones

942
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,720
so you can track its activities after

943
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,399
it's stolen from you

944
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,000
there are companies out there that are

945
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,360
helping to

946
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,000
create digital uh listening maps for

947
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
people who are visually impaired so they

948
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,880
will scan the plans of a building and

949
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,440
navigate you silently in your head

950
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,960
through the building so you can find the

951
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,880
bathroom now from a crime perspective

952
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,640
it's amazing because none of this

953
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,279
faffing around with maps thing but

954
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,519
be excited about the technology if you

955
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,200
are the type of kid who were when you

956
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,120
were five you wanted to go to space and

957
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,279
be an astronaut then why the hell aren't

958
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,840
you working in security in the space

959
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,600
industry because that's the time we live

960
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,399
in

961
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,000
if we are going to build the amazing

962
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,359
systems of the future that are going to

963
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,040
solve problems like climate change that

964
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,560
are going to get us to other planets

965
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,079
they're going to make life accessible

966
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,679
for people who are finding it difficult

967
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,879
like me who you know needs help to hear

968
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,239
then we're going to need security people

969
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,320
who are excited about that in roles that

970
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,800
excite them so go find those roles you

971
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,280
will never regret having a mission where

972
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,040
you truly believe in what you're trying

973
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,359
to do

974
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,839
that's it from me i think i'm just a

975
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,839
little under on time if there are any

976
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,079
questions then please do reach out

977
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,040
either here by email or on the twitters

978
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,760
lady underscore nerd um

979
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,480
i'm happy to discuss the debate and to

980
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,719
hear any feedback and thanks for having

981
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,399
me

982
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,079
no that's fantastic thank you very much

983
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,159
laura there's a lot of people

984
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,160
commenting and speaking in the discord i

985
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,359
think one of the main comments is

986
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,280
mainframe is sexy

987
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,160
uh that was a significant number i guess

988
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,240
a question for me before we go and feel

989
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,640
free also to not answer i guess when you

990
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,800
were looking for you know the technology

991
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,599
for yourself the the the um

992
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,760
the uh the hearing aids i you know if i

993
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,119
was in that situation i would ask you

994
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,839
know what is the security of those

995
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,359
was that a question that someone was

996
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,880
able to answer for you or did they just

997
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,800
look blankly at you going

998
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,560
i have no idea what you're talking about

999
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,119
uh in all honesty your audiologist will

1000
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,400
never understand what you're talking

1001
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,119
about um and mainly because i'm 25 years

1002
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,280
younger than most of their clients so

1003
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,720
you know i'm not the type of person who

1004
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,680
normally walks in their door it's

1005
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,440
certainly not the type of question but

1006
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,240
they do actually enjoy thinking about it

1007
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,480
um so what i would say is while they

1008
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,160
weren't able to give great answers that

1009
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,560
they they are curious and i find that in

1010
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,079
a lot of places they've just never been

1011
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,680
asked before

1012
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,960
um and yes mainframe does sexy uh

1013
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,040
um oh we've got a we've got a question

1014
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,800
in the channel too yeah yeah so there's

1015
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,599
a question from um from tim

1016
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,800
heaps of ex heaps of outsourced am i a

1017
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,599
mute

1018
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,520
no i'm not sorry this is how wonderful

1019
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,359
we go heaps of outsourcing

1020
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,960
responsibilities and us versus their

1021
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
mentality with security and developers

1022
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,359
how do we empower developers

1023
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,839
awesome yeah um

1024
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:20,880
now

1025
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,040
in all honesty i don't just want to

1026
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,640
empower developers i really do want to

1027
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,880
give them the keys um and just step out

1028
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,720
the vehicle entirely i you know i'm not

1029
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,800
there to go hey i'm i'm rooting for you

1030
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,160
i'll do this thing for you i really just

1031
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,839
want to get out of their way

1032
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:34,720
um

1033
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,680
i think

1034
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,440
we need to just stop with the

1035
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,040
bingo if i'm honest excuse the language

1036
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,400
to anyone who has small people listening

1037
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,920
at home

1038
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,599
if you're hearing people talking about

1039
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,280
great digital transformation shifting

1040
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,359
left into development

1041
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,280
all of it is nonsense all of it is

1042
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,280
buzzwords the best thing you can do

1043
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,119
is go and actually sit down with your

1044
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,400
engineering teams

1045
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,560
buy them a cup of tea coffee whatever it

1046
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,640
is that they beverage of choice

1047
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,680
and listen listen to what's hurting

1048
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,640
because

1049
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,320
most of the problems that come between

1050
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,079
the disconnect between security and

1051
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,680
engineering when it comes to making

1052
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,839
changes because when we give them

1053
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:10,880
something to do we give them a

1054
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,960
suggestion we've just added pain to

1055
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
their world and their world is already

1056
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,320
really complex we've already got

1057
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,240
performance and scaling and usability

1058
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,160
and all of these other things going on

1059
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,680
let alone making the show that the

1060
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,880
product that she does what it needs to

1061
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,760
do

1062
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,480
and so sit down and listen and and see

1063
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,000
that now in terms of the outsourced

1064
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,839
responsibility and that's this is them

1065
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,800
it's a cultural thing um so call it out

1066
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,240
if you're finding people who are

1067
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,480
dividing between the two areas

1068
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,160
don't pick a side you don't need to go

1069
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,680
pick a side go be with the depths that's

1070
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,880
your side

1071
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,240
um they are your people that are people

1072
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,400
so it it really is going to take all of

1073
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,040
us moving not just closer but standing

1074
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,480
in with the devs and just going like

1075
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,680
there's no difference here we are all

1076
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,920
engineers together

1077
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,359
i think it's one of the important things

1078
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,720
and it's one thing that i know that when

1079
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,400
i'm hiring people or i'm interviewing

1080
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,240
them is quite important is

1081
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,920
there is no such thing as no from a

1082
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,760
security perspective or there should not

1083
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,280
be as i know from a securities

1084
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,720
perspective it always should it always

1085
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,960
should be a a yes but you can do

1086
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,040
something but we need to do this sort of

1087
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,359
mitigating control or we need to do this

1088
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,480
in there because the moment that

1089
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,000
security

1090
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,599
uh stops the business from doing

1091
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,440
anything whether that's a developer or

1092
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
an accountant or whatever

1093
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,200
then you've basically failed as a

1094
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,440
security person you you haven't actually

1095
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,119
implemented what they

1096
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,520
something to support the business

1097
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,119
and it's a very human thing right this

1098
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,359
isn't about security even it's about

1099
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,400
humans

1100
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,119
humans we are stubborn jerks underneath

1101
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,960
it all every single one of us

1102
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,280
and from a young age when someone says

1103
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,079
no to us in any way shape or form

1104
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,680
there is a stubborn toddler that lives

1105
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,440
in everyone's head that goes well screw

1106
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,400
you i'm going to show you i'm going to

1107
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,760
do it anyway

1108
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,079
now that's that's not novel insecurity

1109
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,839
that's just how we're wired same as

1110
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,359
we'll never stop criminals happening

1111
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,200
that's wired into us too

1112
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,000
so

1113
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,320
we just have to remember that people and

1114
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,640
systems we like water we will find the

1115
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,560
path to do what we want to do so the

1116
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,680
best thing you can do is try and make

1117
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,680
that a safe path rather than trying to

1118
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,440
get them to do something more creative

1119
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,839
to avoid you

1120
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,079
so there's one more question um which is

1121
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,480
from katniss who is one of our speakers

1122
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,880
later um when i used to do sock work i

1123
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,960
kept saying insecure stuff done by devs

1124
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,560
and i wonder whether it's just a lack of

1125
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,000
security training in the software

1126
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,079
engineering side what are your thoughts

1127
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,440
on this

1128
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,119
so i'm going to put the big bias warning

1129
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,240
i'm not going to talk about it

1130
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,240
professionally so there we go walking

1131
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,680
away from that look at me go i'm a

1132
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,640
grown-up

1133
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,440
um

1134
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,160
look um so there is partially there's a

1135
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,280
lack of education in some areas and also

1136
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,359
there's also an expectation so i hate

1137
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,880
the phrase one of my least favorite

1138
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,079
phrases in the whole wide world is

1139
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,520
common sense

1140
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,800
where someone goes oh this is common

1141
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,480
sense so everyone knows how to do it or

1142
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,079
i'm a senior engineer i know how to do

1143
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,480
it or even i'm a security person i know

1144
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,079
how to do it even if your background was

1145
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,240
in network engineering and you've never

1146
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,599
actually touched a software stack in

1147
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,720
your life

1148
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,079
um

1149
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,000
we need to stop assuming that people

1150
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
come with the same set of moving parts

1151
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,280
we don't we don't all have the same

1152
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,480
experiences

1153
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,599
and so

1154
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,200
we don't make it safe at the moment for

1155
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,359
people to say i don't know what i'm

1156
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,480
doing

1157
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,319
what should i be doing here because in

1158
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,680
security saying i don't know what i'm

1159
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,200
doing is admitting vulnerability and of

1160
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
all things we don't do we don't talk

1161
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,319
about vulnerabilities

1162
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,440
so

1163
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,680
we need to make it okay for teams to ask

1164
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,520
questions we need to make it okay to

1165
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,200
have that open dialogue when we see

1166
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,240
issues

1167
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,640
um and also find ways if we're seeing

1168
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,240
repeated problems to make those problems

1169
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,680
go away in a different form because

1170
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,880
repeated problems are normally

1171
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,240
systematic there's something else you

1172
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,760
can do that would solve it in many

1173
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,560
places at once

1174
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,119
no that's absolutely fantastic and i

1175
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:45,920
will

1176
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,400

so i just i can i ask one question to

1188
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,160
your audience just really cheekily

1189
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,560
um so aside from businesses um not

1190
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,720

amazing things and i'm literally sitting

1193
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,640
down and collecting the stories it's the

1194
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,960
people who do security for lego and for

1195
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,760
nasa and all of these amazing companies

1196

god that is going to change the world

1199
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,040
help me spot that because i wanted to

1200
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,319
talk to not just their engineers but

1201
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,480
their security person because i want to

1202
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,560
know how you figure out how to protect

1203
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,560
something that is so breathtakingly

1204
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,000
mind-blowing so um follow along

1205
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,520

want to dig into you know

1209
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,079
how do you secure some of these crazy

1210
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,920
things being built in the world then let

1211
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,760
me know because i think it will be quite

1212
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,720
an adventure to go explore it together

you know taking a neutral stance i like

1254
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
it i like it closer to attendees than

1255
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,480
nuggets though oh no they do both it's

1256
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,280
more kind of oppositional defiant

1257
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,720

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,720

1260
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,440
i'll just quickly read through it so 10

1261
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,680
plus years in cyber security a lifetime

1262
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,119
in nerdy collecting which we love and

1263
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,560
the sand is running out fast but

1264
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,960
hopefully not too fast because i'm going

1265

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,560
collection

i'll i'll do that can i just say what an

1279
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,160
honor it is to follow uh laura bell uh

1280
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,359
laura if you're still listening it was

1281
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,119
it was your talk at kiwicon a few years

1282
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,480
ago that encouraged me to go out and buy

1283
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,319
a couple of nintendo's for the encrypted

1284
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,520
piktochat functionality fabulous um look

1285
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,000
in in a nutshell um yes i i've been

1286
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,599
collecting things for many years i

1287
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,200
started with telephones don't ever do

1288
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,359
that they're a gateway drug because once

1289
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:38,720
you start playing with telephones you

1290
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,720
then start wondering what's upstream

1291
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,319
that will take you into telephone

1292
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:43,920
exchanges where you find these wonderful

1293
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,720
things called rotary uni selectors

1294
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,400
which were used to build cryptanalytic

1295
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,319
bombs and the japanese used them to make

1296
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,160
their own cipher machines and then from

1297
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,760
there you start getting interested in in

1298
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,280
kind of control systems for phones and

1299
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,040
things so you might guess and it's true

1300
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,160
i kind of predate a bit of cyber and the

1301
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,599
reason i wanted to build this collection

1302
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:02,800
was because

1303
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,359
it's been my experience in cyber that a

1304
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,800
huge number of people in the general

1305
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,319
public can't really get their heads

1306
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:09,760
around cyber intelligence because it

1307
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,240
doesn't manifest in a physical way plus

1308
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,160
i've been hugely inspired by going to

1309
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,839
some of these museums overseas so i hope

1310
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,200
you like this talk that's kind of where

1311
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,119
it's coming from

1312
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:19,839
so

1313
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:20,800
if you're interested in this kind of

1314
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,319
stuff i tweet occasionally on loop

1315
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,880
disconnect

1316
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,480
so here's just a little snapshot of some

1317
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,520
of the stuff

1318
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,079
i obviously collect cipher machines

1319
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,240
you know cameras recorders bugs um

1320
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,240
enhanced listening systems

1321
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,240
uh and and what i call kind of the birth

1322
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,520
of cyber

1323
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,599
um items you know so i'll show you a

1324
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,040
couple of those later

1325
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,920
um

1326
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,160
i sort of specialize and an area where i

1327
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,839
specialize that's quite different is i

1328
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:46,800
know that there's a couple of

1329
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,280
collections in basements in canberra

1330
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,760
and one day i'm hoping guys please

1331
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,040
do give me an invite i'd love to come

1332
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,319
and see what you've got and compare

1333
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,800
notes i specialize in warsaw pact

1334
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,079
because you know if you're a star wars

1335
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,920
fan i always thought the empire had the

1336
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,240
most evil and coolest stuff

1337
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,000
and so i go happily hunting across you

1338
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,040
know uh belarus romania poland the

1339
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,800
former east germany but i've also got

1340
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,280
gear from you know finland the us uk etc

1341
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,520
etc i collect across four top level

1342
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,839
broad sort of categories um

1343
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,520
top right you'll see the cipher machine

1344
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,920
that's a cx-52 it was the one that first

1345
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,520
freaked out the nsa when they realized

1346
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,960
if it was properly configured it was

1347
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,319
uncrackable

1348
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,400
and i love it um all the wheels are

1349
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,079
based on different primes and stuff so

1350
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,599
if you've got kind of an interest in in

1351
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,359
the nerdy aspects of crypto i've got a

1352
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,119
few things that relate to that

1353
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,000
um the middle one at the top espionage

1354
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,079
um so that's you know your bugs your

1355
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,160
recorders your cameras your your spy

1356
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,839
radios your intercept equipment your

1357
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:46,240
tscm equipment all that kind of stuff

1358
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,160
plus the bit that i actually think is

1359
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,920
most interesting is trade craft

1360
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,960
equipment

1361
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,119
so you know lock breaking

1362
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,079
you know

1363
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,200
forensic

1364
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,720
type equipment

1365
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,000
you know all those kind of interesting

1366
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,880
tradecrafty bits of gear

1367
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,200
i mentioned kind of really early cyber

1368
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,200
so this little this little toy came from

1369
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,119
the estate of an nsa hardware developer

1370
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,200
and it's an early module for a baldo to

1371
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,160
digital

1372
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,319
type conversion and interesting little

1373
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,920
toys like this which is an enigma

1374
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,560
emulator on an atari 2600 cartridge i

1375
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,800
just think that's a fabulous little item

1376
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,240
uh right through to kind of you know

1377
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,720
modern crypto machines um

1378
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,960
and then finally cultural

1379
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,040
you know when i look at our industry and

1380
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,800
compared to other industries i think we

1381
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,960
could do with

1382
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
snapshotting our history as we go so

1383
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,480
eventually we build up with a kind of a

1384
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,640
historical archive of kind of who we are

1385
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,319
and where we've been and and milestones

1386
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,920
that mattered and here's a fabulous

1387
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,160
thing i found recently it's a 1685

1388
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,839
edition of crypto ministers part of

1389
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,079
factor and i've got a number of kind of

1390
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,240
old crypto books like that and things

1391
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,680
that when they first came out were very

1392
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,440
controversial sometimes they were banned

1393
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,119
and there's very few surviving copies

1394
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,079
that that kind of stuff

1395
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,280
when people find out about this

1396
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,440
collection the first reaction is you're

1397
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,599
doing what why would you do that isn't

1398
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,280
that the role of the government well it

1399
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,280
kind of is and it kind of isn't you know

1400
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,280
we as industry

1401
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,280
owe it to ourselves and to future

1402
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,119
generations to also tell the story of

1403
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,280
why we're here and why it's significant

1404
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,680
and i'm a pretty humble person and

1405
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,760
um you know for a long time i i kind of

1406
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,200
felt like i think a lot of people do in

1407
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,640
this industry where you're sort of a bit

1408
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,400
cowed by the power of the intellect of

1409
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,760
all the technical people you're very

1410
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,440
smart people and i honor you for what

1411
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,839
you do but i sit in the audiences at

1412
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,599
these conferences and i hear

1413
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,119
people talking about how it's just

1414
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,640
terrible that we're struggling to

1415
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,400
educate people on cyber and get people

1416
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,880
to enter the industry and i was thinking

1417
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,400
what can i do

1418
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,119
within the span of my capability to be

1419
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,559
able to make a difference so i think

1420
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,160
about the two quotes you know clint

1421
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,400
eastwood famously said a man's got to

1422
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,559
know his limitations but turing said

1423
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:51,839
sometimes it's the people that we

1424
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,520
imagine the least of who do the things

1425
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,280
that nobody imagines and i thought

1426
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,880
somewhere between those two i'll i'll

1427
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,160
find something

1428
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,680
and the other thing that was weighing on

1429
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,839
me was was the importance of of really

1430
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,280
doing something for our country and kind

1431
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,119
of sovereign cyber and so i came up with

1432
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,400
two things the first one was to go and

1433
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,880
join a local sovereign cyber crew and

1434
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,319
i'm i'm very happy there and they're

1435
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,319
hiring like crazy if that sort of

1436
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,319
if you're in the market for a job

1437
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,520
and the other thing was to build this

1438
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,400
historical resource or museum i can tell

1439
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,119
you it's a ludicrously expensive hobby

1440
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,119
uh i'm doing this late in korea and

1441
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,880
that's a good thing and my wife is the

1442
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,319
real hero behind the scenes because

1443
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,480
she's let me kind of take a pause on

1444
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,240
mortgages and renovations and stuff to

1445
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,880
be able to get this thing off the ground

1446
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,920
again i've

1447
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,680
my objectives are one start with

1448
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,280
physical objects because i think they're

1449
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,200
relatable and they bring cyber into the

1450
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,160
real world and also of necessity it will

1451
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,800
create a physical place and i want that

1452
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,280
place to become a backdrop or a platform

1453
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,280
if you like where where the really smart

1454
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,880
people in our industry can come and give

1455
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,800
talks it could be laura bell it could be

1456
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,319
the crypt analyst richard bean from

1457
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,319
brisbane it could be a lady i've only

1458
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:57,599
just discovered in melbourne called

1459
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,680
allison lewis who's written a fabulous

1460
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,520
book about the stasi

1461
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,599
and through that i want to create

1462
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,160
context and and depth to our industry

1463
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,319
and and for it to be a source of pride

1464
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,240
um i want to as i said to be able to

1465
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,000
explain cyber intelligence to the wider

1466
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,200
public and i really wanted to encourage

1467
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,280
kids to get into stem and cyber because

1468
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,880
if we leave that conversation until

1469
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,720
they're late in high school or uni i

1470
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,480
kind of think it's too late

1471
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,480
when i went to bletchley and the nsa

1472
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,640
museum i was i was so inspired by the

1473
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,240
stories there i thought

1474
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,760
we owe it to ourselves to have something

1475
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,960
like that in australia and i thought you

1476
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,160
know i could do that why don't i just

1477
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,520
get it off the ground and we'll see

1478
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,680
where it goes you know and then finally

1479
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,280
i thought i can see retirement on the

1480
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,960
horizon and i don't know about you but

1481
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,480
i'm going to die of boredom if it comes

1482
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,160
down to bingo and lawn bowls so i

1483
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,520
thought i'll kind of build a retirement

1484
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,280
shed for hackers and spooks so there you

1485
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,440
go that's kind of what i'm doing

1486
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,680
so as a case study one of these

1487
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,359
narrative arcs through the collection i

1488
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,720
find it really interesting to look at

1489
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,640
east germany it's a safe space to talk

1490
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,319
about because the country collapsed 30

1491
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,359
years ago so they're not going to whack

1492
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,960
me if i go around telling stories about

1493
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,440
them and they were there on the cusp of

1494
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,359
digital and they've got really really

1495
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,440
cool gear

1496
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,960
can i recommend if this talks of

1497
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,720
interest to you go and have a look at

1498
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,640
the movie called the lives of others

1499
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,040
that's labender anderon

1500
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,640
it's an incredible film for its

1501
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,480
technical accuracy and its description

1502
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,400
of the methodology and all of the stuff

1503
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,960
on it is spot-on um i've got a bunch of

1504
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,800
stuff that comes that was kind of

1505
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,400
highlighted in that film it's a very

1506
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,480
very accurate movie

1507
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,240
um so let's just wind back the clock

1508
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,760
briefly to give you a little bit of the

1509
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,280
context um

1510
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,040
so the berlin wall was kind of really

1511
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:33,839
built

1512
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,440
they they said it was to keep the evil

1513
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,359
west out but actually they had a massive

1514
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,280
problem with the brain drain there were

1515
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,200
so many people escaping from from the

1516
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,359
east into the west they would have all

1517
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:44,880
been the people like you they were you

1518
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,880
know doctors teachers lawyers anyone

1519
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,240
with an education was doing what they

1520
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,760
could to escape same as they are from

1521
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,440
ukraine today

1522
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,079
they put up an initial wall in 52 across

1523
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,760
most of germany with the exception of

1524
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,079
berlin so berlin became a magnet for

1525
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,160
people to escape to the west

1526
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,480
there were popular uprisings in 53 and

1527
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,079
you can see people chucking rocks at

1528
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,160
tanks there a very very brave people

1529
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,280
stood up and then finally in 61 the real

1530
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,960
wall went up and there's the famous

1531
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,520
photo of conrad schumann um jumping over

1532
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,760
the fence as it was going up a couple of

1533
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,920
days later the guards had orders to

1534
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,079
shoot to kill um whether they were women

1535
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,599
or children in the crowd they would they

1536
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,599
would do so so it was it was pretty

1537
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,520
ruthlessly enforced

1538
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,520
i always wondered what was life like

1539
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,440
behind that wall and how did they

1540
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,839
enforce that

1541
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,200
regime and this is the monster that

1542
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,359
drove it this is the headquarters of the

1543
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:38,400
stasi in in berlin and it is literally

1544
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,640
that entire complex it's not one

1545
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,920
building it's a vast vast apparatus

1546
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,720
they had 90 000 full-time staff 200 000

1547
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,319
informers they controlled the mail

1548
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,000
system all the phone exchanges they had

1549
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,920
partial control of the justice systems

1550
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,319
they had secret jails they had their own

1551
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,000
guards divisions that would turn on the

1552
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,240
army if need be and they were backed by

1553
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,760
you know the criminal police the volks

1554
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,839
police the workers battalions and they

1555
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,480
had the kgb and the soviet army behind

1556
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,000
them so they were very very formidable

1557
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,599
this is them

1558
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,240
i gotta say what a bunch of dorks um or

1559
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,720
malignant incels so on the right you've

1560
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,079
kind of got a staff photo and on the

1561
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,440
left you've got some photos from a

1562
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,680
fabulous book called top secret by simon

1563
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,400
menon where he he went to the shazi

1564
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,640
archives and he collected a whole bunch

1565
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,040
of photos from their training programs

1566
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,680
and you know there really was a stasi

1567
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,520
university this is one of their badges

1568
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,960
and they learned their tradecraft and

1569
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,800
would write dissertations on how to spy

1570
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,559
on people and all that kind of stuff and

1571
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,240
this is them trying on different

1572
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,839
disguises and the bottom pictures

1573
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,280
they're trying to imitate what they

1574
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,119
thought western tourists look like kind

1575
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,359
of funny

1576
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,200
but there was a serious side of course

1577
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,280
and you know you're talking about the

1578
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,480
risk of

1579
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,559
constant risk of arrest

1580
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,319
constant surveillance into your life at

1581
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,880
all levels rendition potentially even to

1582
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,119
the ussr where they they executed some

1583
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,520
people something called zazetsum which

1584
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,200
is a form of

1585
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,000
psychological pressure and discrediting

1586
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,920
um people in such a way that they would

1587
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,680
just kind of emotionally collapse so all

1588
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,599
of this stuff was a risk

1589
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,839
and all of this was backed by the kgb

1590
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:14,640
now

1591
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,640
some people know it some don't but

1592
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,400
vladimir putin was actually there in

1593
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,880
germany when the wall came down and he

1594
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,359
was seconded to the stasi as a kgb

1595
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,400
officer and some years later a member of

1596
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,319
the red army faction otherwise known as

1597
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,079
the bada meinhof confessed that they

1598
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,720
were actually meeting regularly

1599
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,160
with the kgb in dresden and were armed

1600
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,480
and supported by that group so you know

1601
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,920
for all of russia's talk about being

1602
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,040
anti-terrorists they were actually

1603
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,359
backing the red army faction at the time

1604
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:44,880
now with all those risks who who were

1605
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,559
they really up against um believe it or

1606
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,640
not they were really anti-gang and

1607
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,119
anti-punk um they spent a lot of time

1608
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,280
surveilling people who looked kind of

1609
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,240
like us right the crazy pink hair um the

1610
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,599
third one across there from the left

1611
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,760
looks remarkably like me back in the 80s

1612
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,480
um

1613
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,599
these are the kind of people they were

1614
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,920
going for and also believe it or not

1615
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,240
early hackers

1616
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,839
so there was there was kind of a group

1617
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:10,000
of computer enthusiasts in east germany

1618
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,799
back in the early 80s hdjt

1619
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,119
and they were bringing in commodore 64s

1620
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,400
from the west

1621
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,400
the stasi started getting worried that

1622
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,920
this was the birth of a kind of a

1623
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,359
counter culture and they were

1624
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,440
surveilling this group

1625
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,599
and and and they weren't they weren't

1626
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,200
trying to shut it down but they were

1627
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,799
actively monitoring it because they were

1628
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,559
worried about what these freedoms would

1629
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,480
grow into interestingly it wasn't so

1630
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,000
much the hardware that they were worried

1631
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,240
about it was the software that they

1632
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,760
didn't have control of because there

1633
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,200
were games like kremlin and

1634
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,720
counter-strike and stuff like that and

1635
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,559
they were worried about about it being

1636
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,400
anti-socialist

1637
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,240
top right you've got a parade through

1638
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,960
the streets of computers from robotron

1639
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,400
and i've been hunting down some of this

1640
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,839
kind of equipment they had really

1641
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,119
bizarre

1642
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:54,880
equipment architectures and stuff back

1643
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,280
in the day

1644
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,680
so onto pervasive surveillance so to

1645
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,960
give you an idea of what you're up

1646
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,520
against all of the streets

1647
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,280
in the main cities were kind of covered

1648
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,359
in video surveillance as they are today

1649
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,119
decades later

1650
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,680
they monitored mail telephone calls

1651
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,079
telexes all of those sorts of things and

1652
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,760
if they thought you were even remotely

1653
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,760
suspicious they would photograph you

1654
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,680
using things like post boxes telephone

1655
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,880
boxes etc etc

1656
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,319
so the first one just to talk about

1657
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,359
video

1658
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:26,720
i don't know a lot about this area i

1659
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,319
don't actually have equipment from this

1660
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,680
area but obviously i'm still sourcing

1661
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,319
they had literally thousands of cameras

1662
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:35,920
in in the big cities and it's quite

1663
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,319
interesting for the 1980s so for example

1664
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:41,680
one one one railway station friedrichs

1665
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,400
there were 400 cameras in that station

1666
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,559
alone and a lot of it was just kind of

1667
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,079
hassling people you know here's a guy

1668
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,680
with long hair who's being dragged off

1669
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,200
by the stars just for kind of sitting

1670
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,520
around um any group that was like you

1671
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,960
know punks or looked a bit kind of

1672
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,880
culture they would hassle as well

1673
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,880
interestingly all of the equipment was

1674
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,400
western and they were buying it with

1675
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,319
hard currency which was a struggle for a

1676
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,400
country that was basically growing broke

1677
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,839
and that's one of the perverse things

1678
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,760
about autocratic regimes right is they

1679
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,520
put so much money into keeping control

1680
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,119
over a dwindling

1681
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:13,680
economy and population

1682
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,799
so an example from the stasi files

1683
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,960
decades after when when the wall came

1684
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,760
down the stasi tried to burn and destroy

1685
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,440
everything the russians were far more

1686
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,280
successful there are very very few

1687
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,200
documents surviving that prove that

1688
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,359
putin was in was in east germany but he

1689
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,799
was there we know that there's a few

1690
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,559
things that survived but here's an

1691
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,240
example of a fellow

1692
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,760
henning funda

1693
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,880
who was arrested in the late 60s because

1694
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,119
he wrote a letter to somebody expressing

1695
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,200
how he'd like to go to the west he was

1696
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,119
arrested had no idea how it happened or

1697
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,000
why it happened but many decades later

1698
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,599
as people are sticky taping all of the

1699
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,520
stasi files back together they found the

1700
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,599
name of this fellow and also the person

1701
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,839
who snitched on him and they were able

1702
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,640
to explain to him how it happened so 50

1703
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,640
years after the fact people are finding

1704
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,440
out who informed on on them um they say

1705
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,040
that the torn up stasi files are the

1706
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,480
biggest puzzle in the world there are

1707
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,319
billions of pieces and they're still

1708
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:09,920
trying to slowly put some of it back

1709
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,760
together to come to terms with the past

1710
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,440
post

1711
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,119
this is a really interesting one

1712
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,559
obviously this still kind of happens

1713
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:19,599
today

1714
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,240
the stasi basically perfected through

1715
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,799
postal surveillance how to take enormous

1716
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:27,119
volumes of post out of the system

1717
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,200
open it and then return it to the postal

1718
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,280
stream in believe it or not only 12

1719
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,319
hours

1720
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,240
they had it down to a fine art and this

1721
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,079
is one of the resealing machines that is

1722
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,079
in one of the the stasi facilities

1723
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:40,400
that's been turned into a museum

1724
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,559
uh to give you an idea of of the type of

1725
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,160
equipment on the left you see something

1726
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,920
that's kind of been jerry rigged out of

1727
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,720
out of a vacuum cleaner and a heater

1728
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,799
and it's called uh a heist luft ge blah

1729
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,160
so we're gonna have some fun with german

1730
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,400
compound words today so a heist look a

1731
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,559
blaster is obviously a warm air blower

1732
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,400
and it was used for softening the glue

1733
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,400
on envelopes um and it was actually

1734
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,640
fairly quick to operate uh the one in

1735
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,400
the top that looks like a combination of

1736
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,079
a kind of a pressure cooker and a

1737
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,920
steamer is is kind of just that it's

1738
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,760
called a height stamp garat

1739
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,079
garat meaning device so it's for it's

1740
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,640
for warm it's a warm steam device and

1741
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,160
the reason it's angled is so you can put

1742
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,839
down two envelopes at a time in a kind

1743
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,359
of a production line

1744
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,280
and then the third one is is a machine

1745
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,960
that came from czech it's actually a

1746
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,480
very big machine i obviously don't have

1747
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,839
one of these

1748
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:27,760
it's called a cold steam device and the

1749
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,680
way it worked is they would put actually

1750
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,599
cold water in the bottom and then a

1751
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,680
layer of cellophane you put a whole

1752
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,839
bunch of mail on it that you want to

1753
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,440
open and then you slowly raise the

1754
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,119
temperature of the water

1755
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,880
and then what they call the cold steam

1756
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,960
process opens a whole lot of mail all at

1757
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,720
the same time

1758
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,720
and then you have this um and there were

1759
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,559
there were various engineering

1760
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,880
departments of the stasi the one that i

1761
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,319
have the most equipment from is called

1762
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:55,599
ots the office of technical services um

1763
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:57,200
and they would build things like this so

1764
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,040
this is this is my favorite long kind of

1765
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,040
german word abba tatisha high stamp

1766
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,319
often lager means a special workbench

1767
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,240
that's built for opening mail

1768
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,839
and you can see exactly what it is there

1769
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:09,440
it's kind of a faster and easier to

1770
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,200
operate thing built into a work surface

1771
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,040
so they can just push mail and bulk

1772
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,480
along and there's an actual shazi

1773
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,240
officer using one of these things so

1774
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,799
that's post

1775
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,839
telephone and bug recording um the stasi

1776
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,839
were incredibly sophisticated with

1777
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,319
what's called audio penetration and if

1778
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,920
you see that movie the lives of others

1779
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,200
you'll see them go storming into a

1780
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,799
building very quickly you know pushing

1781
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,720
bugs down behind wallpaper and all sorts

1782
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,079
of stuff

1783
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,760
this is an example of a fairly modern

1784
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,720
bug

1785
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,240
and the piece that protrudes into the

1786
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,640
room is only about two millimeters wide

1787
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,319
and i challenge anybody to be able to

1788
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:44,400
find this kind of stuff you really only

1789
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,760
find it with a device called a an nljd a

1790
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,440
non-linear junction detector and they

1791
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,960
were already thinking about how to

1792
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,119
defeat the use of those as well these

1793
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,599
are examples of various rooms where you

1794
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:56,640
can see

1795
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,359
large numbers of realtor reel recorders

1796
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,520
deployed gradually becoming more and

1797
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,359
more dense and going vertical in an

1798
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,440
effort to try and cope with the amount

1799
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,799
of recording that was going on of

1800
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,960
people's homes both through bugs and

1801
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,400
through telephone

1802
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,520
and in fact that was one of their

1803
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,960
biggest challenge

1804
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,200
how do we massively increase the number

1805
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,280
of recorders as we start penetrating

1806
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,720
more and more homes with listening

1807
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,960
devices how do we actually do that

1808
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,960
and you'll see on the top right in the

1809
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,079
background there's a little bit of a

1810
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,000
clue as to how they did it

1811
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,599
they they specifically worked with rft

1812
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,839
sorry veb the manufacturing company and

1813
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:33,680
this kind of touches on the modern cyber

1814
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,359
thing where government and industry

1815
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,680
collaborate to turn out devices

1816
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,640
and they built these

1817
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,559
so what i'm holding up and what you see

1818
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:45,599
on the right is a cab e recorder

1819
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,440
i've got a number of these and it's a

1820
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,040
very very interesting device because

1821
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,599
it's purpose-built for surveillance

1822
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,760
obviously these followed the development

1823
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,000
in 1963 of the phillips cassette which

1824
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
allowed surveillance to become much more

1825
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,559
dense it is remotely controlled you can

1826
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,480
see here the ribbon cable connector on

1827
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,760
the back of it

1828
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,240
and these were built into chassis so

1829
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,520
you'd have

1830
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,680
almost like a computer blade enclosure

1831
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,920
if you know what i mean so looking like

1832
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,599
this device on the bottom left you would

1833
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,920
have six recorders in a chassis five

1834
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,559
active and one kind of hot spare

1835
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:20,720
and then these chassis were were mounted

1836
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,960
in bulk into the telephone exchanges

1837
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,520
across germany so so east germany was

1838
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,160
divided up into 15 regions and these

1839
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,599
things were pushed into all the phone

1840
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:31,280
exchanges and they could be remotely

1841
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,359
controlled to turn on uh recording of

1842
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,359
your telephone and they also had ways to

1843
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,960
to to turn the telephone into a

1844
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,119
recording instrument in the room as well

1845
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,119
um it's it's actually pretty shocking

1846
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,119
isn't it i think

1847
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:45,039
to see this manifested as physical

1848
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,720
objects you know we kind of know that

1849
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,160
people can turn on recording of our

1850
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,760
phone lines and stuff but when i think

1851
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,200
when you actually see it turned into

1852
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,359
physical objects in this kind of mass it

1853
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:57,038
it makes a real impact on people

1854
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,520
the stasi being germans

1855
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,440
documented everything

1856
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,440
and so here you almost see the kind of

1857
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,839
stasi itil documentation of exactly what

1858
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,920
each what what equipment models and

1859
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,760
volumes went into each rack and how they

1860
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,200
manage the tapes and all that sort of

1861
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,000
stuff

1862
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,760
i mentioned before these would collapse

1863
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,319
from small exchanges into control hubs

1864
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:18,880
and then from there to to a central uh

1865
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,480
control mechanism

1866
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,960
so that's that's telephone

1867
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,039
and then finally after the wall came

1868
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,960
down this technology was adapted and

1869
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,960
used by the uh the federal republic of

1870
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,799
germany the unified germany's office for

1871
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:33,039
the protection of the constitution and

1872
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,480
they thought it was terribly important

1873
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,480
to still have this kind of capability

1874
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,480
because you have to understand when the

1875
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,000
stasi disbanded there were 90 000 people

1876
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,760
trained in espionage who'd been living

1877
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,599
in bunkers with large armories and stuff

1878
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,200
and until all of that settled down west

1879
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,480
germany felt that they needed the

1880
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,400
ability to be able to monitor telephone

1881
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,720
i've got obviously plenty of photos uh

1882
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,920
there are training manuals and things

1883
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,359
which have been made available as to

1884
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,520
their their techniques for for bug

1885
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,720
planting and whatnot it's all very

1886
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,880
interesting stuff um this is one of the

1887
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,799
most interesting it hasn't arrived in

1888
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,400
australia yet it's it's currently with a

1889
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,160
very big shipment which is in the air

1890
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,079
from poland at the moment

1891
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,920
this is called an acousto optical um bug

1892
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,680
and the way that this one worked uh it

1893
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,839
was actually patented in 83 the patent

1894
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,680
is there in the middle um it's all

1895
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,520
plastic so it can't be picked up with

1896
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,599
you know metal detectors or nljds and

1897
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,440
things like that but at the end of it is

1898
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,599
a little diaphragm that that

1899
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,440
obviously vibrates with speech in the

1900
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,559
room

1901
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,359
and a laser is fired down a fiber optic

1902
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,039
picks up that vibration and turns it

1903
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,440
back into an audio signal at the other

1904
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,359
end the cable is about 20 meters long so

1905
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:41,039
you could use this to push into

1906
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:42,400
apartment buildings and all sorts of

1907
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,640
things

1908
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,200
let's talk about cameras um

1909
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,640
i probably

1910
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,520
have

1911
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,520
the biggest collection of espionage

1912
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,920
cameras in australia i don't really know

1913
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,599
because whoever's out there is playing

1914
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,200
possum

1915
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,799
but but these are some of the examples

1916
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,559
of the cameras i've got um the one in

1917
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,359
the middle at the top is is called a gsk

1918
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:05,359
and it was purpose built for the stasi

1919
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,119
to become a kind of a multi-role

1920
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:09,440
platform like a modular computer

1921
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,640
architecture and you'll see some

1922
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,920
examples of how they repurpose the gsk

1923
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,760
this little one here

1924
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,200
is called a tochka it's it's very rare

1925
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,920
it is effectively the eastern copy of a

1926
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,760
minox and what's interesting about it is

1927
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,359
it has a little pendant hanger at the

1928
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,520
top it was designed to hang around your

1929
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,280
neck and the lens points out the front

1930
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,880
because believe it or not it was purpose

1931
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,520
built to be hidden behind a necktie or

1932
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,920
in small devices like cigarette lighters

1933
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,160
and compacts and things like that bottom

1934
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,520
left is one of my

1935
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,359
long range cameras and of course in many

1936
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,039
cases i've got the western equivalents

1937
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,680
of these kind of things as well

1938
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,599
i've especially got a pretty good

1939
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,760
collection of kind of concealed cameras

1940
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,119
so a good example here is an ajax camera

1941
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,640
built into a little frame which would

1942
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,359
disguise it inside a ladies handbag

1943
01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:00,799
or this thing which is even even kookier

1944
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:03,599
which is um actually a button and a

1945
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:05,119
camera could be hidden behind that and

1946
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:06,480
when you press the little button in your

1947
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,000
pocket you might see behind me it's

1948
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,680
actually opening the window in the

1949
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,640
button

1950
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,440
to be able to take photos through that

1951
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,559
and then bottom left is is a tesena azio

1952
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,319
actually made good use of these as well

1953
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:19,599
they would hide them in things like

1954
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,160
books and the tescena is also the camera

1955
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,079
that was used in the watergate burglary

1956
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:25,599
um i've got a very good camera it

1957
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:26,799
actually

1958
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:28,640
comes with the even rarer strap so

1959
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,319
that's a to my mind that's a really sort

1960
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,760
of james bond piece of kit

1961
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,440
also again currently in the air on the

1962
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,520
way from poland i've managed to track

1963
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,359
down an extraordinarily rare device

1964
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,440
called an fkp

1965
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,680
fkp would typically be hidden in a large

1966
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,920
hardback book and it was given to

1967
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,680
students who were on rotation to the

1968
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,000
west on exchange programs

1969
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,599
they would take it into libraries hidden

1970
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:52,640
in a book

1971
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,680
and it was used for stealing

1972
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,319
intellectual property in micro fish

1973
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:57,839
and they could handle large volumes of

1974
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,520
micro fish it had a very big roll of

1975
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,440
film in it and effectively like a

1976
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,359
photocopier they would just

1977
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,039
move their way through that

1978
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,079
another example is this device

1979
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:11,119
this is called ruben and it is a again a

1980
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:12,960
device which is used for intellectual

1981
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,599
property theft at the bottom is a mirror

1982
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,359
with with a light source and when you

1983
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,359
fill it up with film and batteries

1984
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,520
essentially you push it down

1985
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,280
the rollers engage the battery and light

1986
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,799
it up and then as you drag it across the

1987
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:28,400
surface it records documents

1988
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,480
continuously onto a long roll of film so

1989
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,680
that's a really interesting kind of

1990
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,319
space to explore how ip theft used to

1991
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:38,240
happen before everything went digital

1992
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,960
and then there's compromat

1993
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,000
now for those of you who know the

1994
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,400
history when putin came to power

1995
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,599
um

1996
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,359
there were people who were

1997
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:49,760
investigating those around him

1998
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,280
uh for for uh corruption

1999
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,280
and in fact the lead prosecutor was

2000
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,039
taken down

2001
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,520
on on accusations and there were other

2002
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,319
people who were taken down by compromise

2003
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:03,839
so i've got a couple of examples of

2004
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:05,839
devices in the top left there's there's

2005
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:08,559
a beautifully machined device it's

2006
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:11,039
actually checkmate called an oco

2007
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:12,799
and that one is lens interchangeable

2008
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:14,799
with the one on the right which is again

2009
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,880
it's the the gsk that i mentioned before

2010
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,359
but with a long pinhole lens um the

2011
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:20,560
reason it's shaped like that is

2012
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,920
obviously so that it can be pushed

2013
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,719
through a hole into a wall and it

2014
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,719
literally only has a one millimeter

2015
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,120
opening to be able to to take pictures

2016
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,640
now i want to say this

2017
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,399
every now and again i i get concerned

2018
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:33,679
that people might think that i'm some

2019
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,520
kind of crazy white right winger or

2020
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,120
creep or something um actually the

2021
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,040
opposite is true

2022
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,719
in building this i actually want to

2023
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:42,560
build something which serves as a

2024
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,759
warning

2025
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:46,479
and shows people what to look for

2026
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,640
i think it's frankly a disgrace that

2027
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,960
that airbnbs are used for perving on

2028
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,479
people and stuff like that but if i can

2029
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:54,080
show people what to look out for then

2030
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,920
i'll have rendered a good service but

2031
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,600
these are the kind of examples of kit

2032
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,839
that was used and is still used by the

2033
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:03,198
surveillance services today

2034
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,839
infrared is really interesting obviously

2035
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:07,279
you know you can only operate really

2036
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,040
effectively if you can operate at night

2037
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,479
so i've got a number of pieces of

2038
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,799
equipment that relate to

2039
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,960
all the purpose built for for night um

2040
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,359
at the top is the very very rare hfk

2041
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,359
camera which was built specifically for

2042
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,399
night

2043
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,679
on the right

2044
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,279
not mine that's actually a picture from

2045
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,359
the stasi museum in berlin it's a car

2046
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:26,238
door

2047
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,560
and you can see that behind

2048
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,040
a plexiglas facsimile of the door

2049
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,319
they've actually mounted a whole bunch

2050
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,238
of infrared flashes so you would be

2051
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:35,520
walking along the street and they'd be

2052
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,960
happily snapping photos you would have

2053
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,279
no idea about it you'd be lit up as as

2054
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:40,799
plain as day

2055
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:42,640
this is an interesting toy it's it's

2056
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,479
called an inferior

2057
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,880
and it's a soviet tool used for

2058
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,600
obviously monitoring in pitch black

2059
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,000
very very evolved it was also used in

2060
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
dark rooms and things like that and at

2061
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,600
the bottom you've got one of my robot

2062
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,760
cameras with the solenoid that was used

2063
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,679
for firing the shutter

2064
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,679
these were modified in such a way that

2065
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:03,679
they had extra padding put around the

2066
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,760
the chassis to to minimize the sound of

2067
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,840
the actual mechanism and then built into

2068
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,800
briefcases with with batteries triggers

2069
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,800
and infrared flashes to do the same kind

2070
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,760
of thing take photos surreptitiously

2071
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,640
um

2072
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,480
one of the things that the stasi used to

2073
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,520
do

2074
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,400
and obviously it still happens today but

2075
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,880
they made an industry out of it was was

2076
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,080
conspiratorial search or house search

2077
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,920
and and this takes place in the movie

2078
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,679
the lives of others and a whole crew

2079
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,920
rolls up um and the methodology

2080
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,840
essentially was they would first of all

2081
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,080
use a polaroid camera to take snaps of

2082
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,520
things in a room so that when they put

2083
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,960
things back you wouldn't really know

2084
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,400
that they changed

2085
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,000
their favorite camera for that was the

2086
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,560
polaroid 195 which had atomic lens that

2087
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,320
had a very very good quality lens

2088
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,719
although it was a cheap polaroid camera

2089
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:54,320
so they would first of all lay out the

2090
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,560
room they would go to work with their

2091
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,640
tool kits um and i'm lucky enough to

2092
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,800
have sourced an original what's called a

2093
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,640
criminalist kit and it's literally the

2094
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,880
kit of tools that was used for kind of

2095
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,440
uh hunting um you know for kind of

2096
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,280
counter intelligence purposes as well as

2097
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,520
used by the bug planting crews

2098
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,960
i've got this plus all the books that

2099
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,120
went from the the stars university as

2100
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,800
well it's an interesting artifact

2101
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,159
because it's one of those physical

2102
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,320
tradecraft things and then at the bottom

2103
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,719
right you have yet another variation of

2104
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:25,040
the gsk this time

2105
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,760
with with the lens and a bulk film

2106
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,000
loader for taking hundreds of photos and

2107
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,840
what they were looking for was say in

2108
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,360
your teenager's bedrooms they were

2109
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,880
looking for posters on the walls that

2110
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,719
would express an affiliation with

2111
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,400
everything from i don't know madonna and

2112
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,000
bruce springsteen which might tell them

2113
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,400
that you're leaning western to punk

2114
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,679
items

2115
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,360
they obviously went through literally

2116
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,360
every jar and spray can in the house

2117
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,960
looking for hidden film

2118
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,320
compartments or anything that would

2119
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:53,440
betray espionage capability

2120
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,199
they would then you know implant into

2121
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,120
the house bugs and things and then

2122
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,760
finally a really nasty turn once they

2123
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,440
decided to move away from outright

2124
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,520
torture and stuff they started messing

2125
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,280
with people's minds they would for

2126
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,040
instance take your sock drawer and your

2127
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,880
underwear drawer and swap the contents

2128
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,880
around or they might reorder all the

2129
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,640
books on your bookshelf they might

2130
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,480
change your pots and pans around and

2131
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,600
then they come back and do this

2132
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,199
repeatedly to the point where you

2133
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,960
thought you were going crazy as well as

2134
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,480
spreading rumors about you would work

2135
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,840
and doing other stuff they would play

2136
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,920
these psychological games with people to

2137
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,800
destabilize them

2138
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,880
uh that's a bit

2139
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,480
i guess this is interesting purely

2140
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,480
because you know today we kind of secure

2141
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,560
mail with with certs and things like

2142
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,239
that but back in the day messages went

2143
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,400
back and forth with with wax seals that

2144
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,400
were numbered so that if i sent a

2145
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,159
message to sean or ian they could you

2146
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,000
know in a non-repudiated fashion know

2147
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,440
that it came from me and know that it

2148
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,960
was sealed and not tampered with along

2149
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,040
the way

2150
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,640
um in terms of crypto um

2151
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,880
this is a rotor maze from the fialca

2152
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,719
machine it's not nearly as well known as

2153
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:59,440
enigma but fialca was a very very very

2154
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,840
powerful cipher machine

2155
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,120
10 wheels

2156
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,280
counter rotating

2157
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,159
fed also via a punch card system with

2158
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:09,920
kind of like the day's crypto codes this

2159
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,480
machine was effectively uncrackable if

2160
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,080
configured properly

2161
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:17,199
a very very nice example of kind of cold

2162
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:19,840
war engineering

2163
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,480
um one interesting way that starzy used

2164
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,560
to communicate with agents was they used

2165
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,400
the device on the left called a

2166
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,440
ashbrachmos garat 32620

2167
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,360
and this device would basically take a

2168
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,960
baldo tape

2169
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,600
and then convert that into spoken

2170
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,840
to convert that into speech that could

2171
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,360
then be read out

2172
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,159
over radio and then anybody with any

2173
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:43,679
kind of commercial shortwave could

2174
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,840
listen to that and via a one-time pad

2175
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,320
could then get secure messages and there

2176
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,239
were many many advantages to doing it

2177
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:51,920
that kind of way so i've got some

2178
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,679
examples of the receiving radios that

2179
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,679
were very popular uh the one in the

2180
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:57,600
middle uh interestingly when the

2181
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,159
americans broke a spy ring

2182
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,000
a couple of decades ago

2183
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,679
literally every house they went into

2184
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,440
where they suspected spying they all had

2185
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,920
that exact model of radio if you want to

2186
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,520
hunt one down as a souvenir it's called

2187
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,360
an icf 2010 sony icf 2010

2188
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,560
and you can pick one up for a few

2189
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,560
hundred bucks they're kind of an iconic

2190
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,440
espionage item

2191
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,280
this is one of my favorite toys it's a

2192
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,480
genuine soviet spy radio and r353 these

2193
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,320
were typically buried in forests and

2194
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,760
other places

2195
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,600
awaiting a go code so they were kind of

2196
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,600
a leave behind radio

2197
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,000
in case of emergencies interestingly

2198
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,080
everything inside it is russian but it's

2199
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,400
labeled in english the reason for that

2200
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,920
of course is if someone springs you when

2201
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,080
you're using a radio then you have a you

2202
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,840
have a certain element of

2203
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,159
plausible deniability a very very

2204
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:48,000
powerful radio

2205
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,960
um and this is my recent and and most

2206
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,520
favorite toy um it's called a lich

2207
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,880
brekker garat

2208
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,960
and the lich braca garat is i have a

2209
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,800
pair of these

2210
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,000
probably the only pair in the southern

2211
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,520
hemisphere but basically what this thing

2212
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,320
does

2213
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,360
is i have an earpiece and as i speak

2214
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,520
that is modulated into an infrared

2215
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,280
signal which is good for a couple of

2216
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,280
kilometers and they would use this to

2217
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,880
secretly communicate back and forth

2218
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,480
across the berlin wall

2219
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,159
and with that i'm probably just about

2220
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,640
out of time so i'm going to draw it to a

2221
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,920
close here but i hope you found this

2222
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,040
really interesting and it's been

2223
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,960
illuminating as to some of the tech that

2224
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,360
was used back in the old analog

2225
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,320
espionage days

2226
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,440
that was absolutely fantastic mike thank

2227
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,600
you very much for that um a lot of

2228
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,840
people have commented about

2229
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,080
if you were a historian or a museum

2230
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,679
person they would be very interested in

2231
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:42,000
history right now and they loved

2232
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,760
not just the fact that these things

2233
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,320
existed but were as you are alarmed that

2234
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,920
these things existed in this way and

2235
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,239
that people were able to do these things

2236
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:52,640
yep yep and and and that's why i collect

2237
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,640
the cultural context i think it's really

2238
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,640
really important to understand the

2239
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,159
drivers and the motivations of the

2240
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:00,400
people who who built them but also to

2241
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,640
understand the impact on the people who

2242
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,400
are affected and and i think we need to

2243
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,719
very mindfully as an industry think

2244
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,560
about anything we build particularly if

2245
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,800
it's dual purpose so

2246
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,239
with that i hope that was a good talk

2247
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:13,440
thank you

2248
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,719
yeah there's actually one question i'll

2249
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,880
just ask um if that's okay and it's very

2250
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,040
related to that so do you find having

2251
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,960
the physical history of tech that can be

2252
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,520
tangibly explained helps people grasp

2253
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,920
the more cognitive concepts

2254
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,400
100 and in fact that's a motivation for

2255
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,800
for acquiring these physical objects yes

2256
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,080
exactly

2257
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,000
i think it helps to relate cyber to a

2258
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,560
broader industry to a broader audience

2259
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,800
yeah absolutely and look a lot of um

2260
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,840
like

2261
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,239
uh relationship between well this is

2262
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,000
where cyber came from essentially cyber

2263
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,480
was driven from a lot of these things um

2264
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,159
and it's just enabled another form of

2265
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:50,320
espionage in the current times

2266
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,760
100 yeah yeah not fantastic look thank

2267
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,280
you very much mike um there's a couple

2268
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,560
of other questions what i'll get is

2269
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,719
people um if they can just tag mike in

2270
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:01,600
their questions mike is loop disconnect

2271
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,920
in the uh in the discord and i'm sure

2272
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,120
he's more than happy to answer your

2273
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,800
questions as well so thank you very much

2274
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,159
again mike cheers now

2275
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,440
perfect

2276
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,239
that was a little scary shanna i know i

2277
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,080
love that stuff

2278
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,159
there's a podcast i listen to called i

2279
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:21,199
spy

2280
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:22,560
and it's pretty cool

2281
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,040
um goes back sort of

2282
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,360
real life spy stories and if you've ever

2283
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,520
listened to it the host is quite

2284
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,400
eccentric

2285
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:34,000
um but it's super cool hearing about

2286
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,920
how they used to go about

2287
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,400
all of the espionage prior to it being

2288
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,080
you know maybe somewhat easier these

2289
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,480
days where the data is all online

2290
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,080
you know how the the

2291
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,520
gchq was tapping into

2292
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,159
the um british telecoms

2293
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:54,880
to get all of the communications um

2294
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,679
during world war one or world war ii so

2295
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:59,280
you know now we've got the deep sea

2296
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,199
cables and all of

2297
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:02,880
all of that to worry about but yeah it's

2298
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,400
super scary but super super interesting

2299
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,040
yeah i am

2300
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,600
it's pretty scary i i don't really

2301
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,199
and it's interesting all the same

2302
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:14,640
techniques are being used today like you

2303
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,800
mentioned the airbnb thing like there

2304
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,560
was a video i was reading watching the

2305
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,159
other week about how to detect the spy

2306
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,080
devices in your airbnb and it's just the

2307
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,080
concept that we're doing that

2308
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,360
it's just a little bit freaky um

2309
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,560
yeah

2310
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,040
um so we got our next speaker is ready

2311
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,360
to join so i will just add her in so

2312
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,760
hello debbie how are you i'm very well

2313
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,920
thank you it's a lovely sunny day in

2314
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,600
adelaide um i don't think it's quite so

2315
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,560
sunny here at the moment

2316
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,960
um are you on i have to ask are you on

2317
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,800
the attendees or the nuggets side of the

2318
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,800
debate that we're currently having well

2319
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,480
i'm slightly embarrassed about this i

2320
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,080
mean i've been here for three years and

2321
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,159
i'm not sure i've had attendees i'm not

2322
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:57,040
sure i even know what they are oh oh

2323
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,400
well that's awkward um

2324
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,320
well lucky for you i'm going to go

2325
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,719
through that over this weekend

2326
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:07,280
i'm going to make some

2327
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:07,840
we'll be attendees

2328
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,000
them at some point um alex is also

2329
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,520
cooking some of my place which we might

2330
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,480
see if we can record as well but um yeah

2331
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,400
so um i'll just do a quick introduction

2332
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,159
to you debbie for people who don't know

2333
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:20,880
you when i find when i scroll to the

2334
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,880
right bit on my screen ah here we go so

2335
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,679
debbie holds the dst us dst group

2336
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,040
university of adelaide chair in cyber

2337
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,800
security of course cst is awesome i'm

2338
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,880
biased um in addition she is the

2339
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,159
professor of cyber security at the

2340
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:33,840
university of portsmouth a visiting

2341
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,000
professor at royal holloway university

2342
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,040
of london so obviously debbie is a very

2343
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,800
well-renowned academic and we're really

2344
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,600
happy to have her here um to bring some

2345
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,400
some academic rigor maybe i don't know

2346
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,760
um so yeah she looks nervous now um to

2347
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,840
our conference but um debbie i will add

2348
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,640
your slides and thank you very much

2349
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,040
now thank you ian and thanks for letting

2350
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,840
me have this chance to to speak um i'm

2351
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,159
sorry that's my academic

2352
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:04,159
bio that you've got there i always feel

2353
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:06,400
compelled to say that i came to academia

2354
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,840
late i'm not a particularly good

2355
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,480
academic by academic standards and i

2356
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,560
have done some of this stuff for real

2357
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,880
so that's my disclaimer up front if you

2358
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,679
like

2359
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:17,520
um and what i want to talk about i think

2360
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,120
follows on quite nicely from what laura

2361
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,840
talked about um first thing um so my

2362
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,920
title is not wrestling but dancing

2363
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,840
moving from compliance to concordance

2364
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,920
for secure software development

2365
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,440
and you'll see on the other side of my

2366
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,960
slide that i've got the software

2367
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,800
developer and the security practitioner

2368
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,440
happily dancing together um somebody

2369
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,360
said that i am internal optimist about

2370
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,440
security but i'm i'm sticking with this

2371
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,280
this approach

2372
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,159
okay

2373
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:44,080
so what i want to look at this is some

2374
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:45,760
work that i've been doing for a number

2375
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,639
of years now

2376
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:50,159
and i started off looking at the

2377
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:52,080
relationship between software developers

2378
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,000
and security practitioners and i'm going

2379
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,600
to talk a little bit about what we found

2380
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,239
and and what that revealed

2381
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:00,480
i'm primarily a security practitioner i

2382
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,600
did software development at the

2383
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,199
university like probably most of you did

2384
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,440
i was spectacularly bad at it

2385
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,000
um but i wanted to understand the

2386
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,920
relationship and i'll explain why that

2387
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,600
came to be an issue

2388
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,360
a little bit later on

2389
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,360
then i want to kind of change tack a

2390
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,719
little bit and i want to look at some

2391
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:18,560
research that was done looking at

2392
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,480
interactions between doctors and

2393
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,080
patients

2394
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,840
and this was pointed out to me by a

2395
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,600
colleague who works in psychology and

2396
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,840
what we decided to do was to try and use

2397
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,480
that understanding and that research and

2398
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,239
apply it to what we already knew about

2399
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:34,000
software developers and security

2400
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,360
practitioners

2401
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,360
and see if we could come up with ways to

2402
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:40,239
generate productive security dialogues

2403
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:42,400
so we talked a lot about um

2404
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,920
collaboration between software

2405
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,920
developers and security practitioners

2406
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,840
but sometimes you actually need to have

2407
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,600
some tools and techniques to make that

2408
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,360
happen rather than just saying it's a

2409
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,040
good thing to do and of course what

2410
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,800
we're trying to avoid doing is is

2411
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,560
getting into a situation

2412
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,159
that you can see in the cartoon on the

2413
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:01,360
other side of the slide

2414
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,760
so some years ago i was asked by

2415
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,800
a government organization in the uk

2416
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,040
to find out how they could develop

2417
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,960
constructive interactions between

2418
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,800
security and the business in a way that

2419
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,800
both sides value and that which

2420
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,800
holistically benefits the business that

2421
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,199
was the task that we were set

2422
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:22,960
and of course basically when you unpick

2423
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,360
that statement it's about improving the

2424
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,719
relationship

2425
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:28,800
and when we dug a bit deeper the

2426
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,120
relationship problem that they had was

2427
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,760
that security practitioners and software

2428
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,320
developers didn't speak to each other

2429
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,480
and what they wanted us to do was to try

2430
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,239
and find a way to improve that

2431
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:42,239
relationship so that they did talk to

2432
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:43,440
each other

2433
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,520
and that was kind of the high level

2434
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,080
problem that we were set

2435
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,920
of course when we started to dig into it

2436
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,679
a bit more it turned out that this was

2437
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:53,280
really the issue

2438
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,120
so they were moving to this idea of

2439
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,880
devsecops

2440
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,480
and and we know you know those bullet

2441
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,239
points there being about continuous

2442
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:02,000
integration continuous delivery lean

2443
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
manufacturing secure code processes and

2444
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,280
tools

2445
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,639
but then we come to the last bullet

2446
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:08,880
point it requires trust in a changing

2447
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:09,920
culture

2448
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,400
um and one of the things that that we

2449
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,400
thought we could see was the fact that

2450
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,800
nobody was proactively managing this

2451
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,880
change nobody was proactively doing

2452
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,360
anything to increase trust between these

2453
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,120
two communities

2454
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,600
now at the time somebody just said to me

2455
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,320
oh this is about devsecops and i had no

2456
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:31,199
appreciation for what devsecops was

2457
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:32,400
and i've got lots of friends who are

2458
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,159
software developers and i just said help

2459
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:37,040
me um and they said overwhelm weekend go

2460
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,199
away read the phoenix project

2461
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:41,199
and of course this issue of

2462
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:43,600
building trust and changing culture

2463
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,440
comes through quite strongly in in the

2464
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,159
phoenix project and so we started to

2465
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:50,000
think that there was something here that

2466
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,840
that we did need to address

2467
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,760
and that if we started to unpick the

2468
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,400
problem in more detail we would find a

2469
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,400
way of developing an intervention that

2470
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,199
might help to build this collaboration

2471
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:04,480
the trust um between these two these two

2472
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,560
different but very much related

2473
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,320
communities

2474
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,719
so what we did was we went out and we

2475
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:13,840
spoke to software developers about

2476
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,760
where they what was causing their

2477
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,480
reluctance to actually engage with

2478
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,880
security practitioners

2479
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,639
and what was it actually a reluctance

2480
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:25,520
where was it coming from

2481
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,120
so these are some of the quotes that

2482
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,800
came back from them and i'm going to

2483
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,040
start with shooting the baby because

2484
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,679
laura actually mentioned this too

2485
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:35,040
one of the

2486
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,880
software developers that we interviewed

2487
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,040
said that he didn't want to he didn't

2488
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,840
want to share his ideas with security

2489
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,440
because he was scared they would shoot

2490
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,400
the baby

2491
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,320
and of course we delved into that a

2492
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,639
little bit and of course what came back

2493
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:51,199
was the fact that software developers

2494
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:53,520
generally are very creative people they

2495
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,600
didn't like to come up with ideas that

2496
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,600
in their from their experience they

2497
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,840
would then take to security and security

2498
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,520
would say no

2499
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,400
now

2500
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,080
i know and you know that a lot of

2501
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,679
security practitioners have not liked

2502
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:07,840
that anymore but it's not that long ago

2503
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,719
that i presented this to a community of

2504
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:12,560
security practitioners

2505
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,440
and

2506
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,760
the response back i had was perhaps the

2507
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,199
baby was really ugly and needed shooting

2508
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,520
and for me that kind of encapsulated the

2509
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,280
problem that we were trying to address

2510
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,800
this disconnect between the two

2511
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,800
communities

2512
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,520
another software developer said

2513
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,520
you meaning security practitioners are

2514
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,679
like a rock in a stream we just flow

2515
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:35,760
around you and this was one of the real

2516
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,199
problems that we were seeing in this

2517
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:39,760
organization security was

2518
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:43,679
being bypassed to every opportunity

2519
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:45,600
and what software developers actually

2520
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,960
wanted which we thought was quite

2521
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,440
telling was for security to be seen as

2522
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,600
people like us and fighting for the same

2523
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,600
side so this was obviously something

2524
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,280
where we thought we could make a

2525
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,080
contribution

2526
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,040
now when we started to try and work out

2527
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,719
why this this was such a big deal and

2528
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:05,120
what it actually meant um it became

2529
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,719
apparent that this this was actually

2530
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,719
having an impact on risk

2531
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:11,760
so security practitioners were making

2532
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,520
risk-based decisions when they didn't

2533
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,760
have the full story because software

2534
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,159
developers would only tell them exactly

2535
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:20,400
the answers to the questions that they

2536
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,239
asked they weren't giving them extra

2537
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:25,679
information there was no two-way flow

2538
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:27,199
when there was a good relationship

2539
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:28,960
between software developers and security

2540
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,040
practitioners there was this growing

2541
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,360
level of trust which allowed some areas

2542
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,880
oh i didn't do that which allowed some

2543
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,400
areas to get some things off their

2544
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,239
chests and fess up to some stuff which

2545
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:41,840
we ought to have been told about but

2546
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,239
nobody got around to telling security so

2547
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:46,800
there was stuff that was being hidden

2548
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,920
either by

2549
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:51,199
omission or perhaps deliberately um the

2550
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,800
security practitioners really needed to

2551
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,280
know and and because of the relationship

2552
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,320
that they had with the software

2553
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,159
developers um

2554
01:26:58,159 --> 01:26:59,920
this information wasn't being given to

2555
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:00,880
them

2556
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,880
and so one of the questions that we

2557
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,040
started asking security practitioners

2558
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,719
and software developers

2559
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:09,520
was does security have to be a zero-sum

2560
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,480
game

2561
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,600
or is it really a negotiated compromise

2562
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,600
and of course a lot of folk in security

2563
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,760
do tend to think in binaries or have

2564
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,400
traditionally thought in binaries secure

2565
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,280
insecure authorized access unauthorized

2566
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:27,040
access insider outsider

2567
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:30,080
but we know of course that when projects

2568
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,480
and projects run at some point they have

2569
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,400
to go live the business has to move

2570
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:38,080
forward um systems have to move on so

2571
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,800
in real terms while this zero-sum game

2572
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,400
might feel quite a good place to be

2573
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,719
in actual fact security is always a

2574
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,120
negotiated compromise so let's face up

2575
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,880
to that and work out how to have this

2576
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,280
negotiation

2577
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,880
so this was some time ago now that we

2578
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:58,840
started to have these conversations

2579
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,760
and i went back and i was talking to a

2580
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,679
colleague who is a psychologist and he

2581
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:05,920
said i've just been reading something um

2582
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,679
that i think is applicable to what

2583
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:09,120
you're talking about

2584
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,960
because one of the problems we had was

2585
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,400
how do you how do you improve your

2586
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,719
relationship how do you consciously

2587
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:16,880
improve a relationship

2588
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,239
and he said to me have a look at this

2589
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:20,400
article it's about the doctor-patient

2590
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,760
relationship

2591
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,440
so i'm just going to ask you to bear

2592
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,480
with me now while i flip to have a look

2593
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,400
at some of the research that's been done

2594
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,719
on the relationship between doctors and

2595
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:33,280
their patients

2596
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,040
so generally speaking when you go to see

2597
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,159
a doctor

2598
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:38,480
you take your problem to them and he or

2599
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,719
she will tell you what you should do in

2600
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:43,360
order to fix it and what he or she will

2601
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,360
tell you to do is largely based around

2602
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,679
the notions of adherence and compliance

2603
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:50,159
the doctor is the expert and the doctor

2604
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,760
will tell you what you need to do and

2605
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,440
how you need to comply in order to

2606
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:56,239
rectify your condition and it takes the

2607
01:28:56,239 --> 01:28:58,639
form of things like taking medication at

2608
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:01,480
set times keeping clinic appointments

2609
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:04,960
physiotherapy exercise avoiding

2610
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,880
particular behaviors

2611
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,040
so that sounds good we'll go away and we

2612
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:12,960
do exactly what the doctor said don't we

2613
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,000
actually we don't

2614
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,400
what patients actually do

2615
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,719
is that 50 of patients don't take

2616
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:22,719
prescribed treatments as recommended

2617
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:24,719
they don't follow what the doctor says

2618
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,400
across all the recommendations made

2619
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:30,880
between 15 to 93 fail to act at all

2620
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,120
25 of hospital admissions can be

2621
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,800
attributed to the failure to follow

2622
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,719
health professionals advice and this is

2623
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,480
where it gets really scary because it's

2624
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,800
not confined to minor conditions

2625
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,440
15 of transparent patients don't do what

2626
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,560
the doctor

2627
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:47,040
suggests for aftercare and 30 of those

2628
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:50,080
die as a result

2629
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:52,239
and so you can see that this notion of

2630
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:54,480
adherence and compliance doesn't

2631
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,800
particularly work well even when

2632
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,760
someone's health is at risk

2633
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,000
so we took that idea and we followed up

2634
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,199
the research

2635
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:04,880
and the solution that they were talking

2636
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,639
about in in medicine for the

2637
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:09,120
doctor-patient relationship was to move

2638
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,560
the dialogue

2639
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,239
so to move it from being about

2640
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,159
compliance where patients should do as

2641
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,600
they're told and if they don't it's

2642
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,760
their responsibility

2643
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,719
through to adherence where there is some

2644
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:22,800
engagement to work together to plan and

2645
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,120
implement treatment but the ultimate

2646
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,639
point is to get to this point of

2647
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:28,880
concordance and this is where there's a

2648
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,360
mutual understanding and agreement about

2649
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,760
treatment and its implications

2650
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,360
and one of the examples that we quite

2651
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,360
often talk about when we run some

2652
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,719
workshops

2653
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:39,679
is

2654
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:41,600
around you know a lot of people are told

2655
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,520
to take antibiotics and a lot of people

2656
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,280
don't then finish the course of

2657
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,679
antibiotics what if you could have an

2658
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:49,679
actual conversation with your doctor as

2659
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:51,600
he or she prescribes antibiotics and you

2660
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,560
could say

2661
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,320
do you know what i'm going to a party on

2662
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,080
friday night i really want to have a few

2663
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,320
drinks what's the problem if i start my

2664
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,520
antibiotics on on friday or rather than

2665
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:04,000
thursday or you know and it's a point

2666
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,159
where both sides come together to

2667
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:09,360
negotiate a way through

2668
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,880
so that's the doctor-patient

2669
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,960
relationship and the research

2670
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,199
and what we wanted to do was then

2671
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:17,199
see what happened if we moved this into

2672
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:19,760
the devsecops space if we looked at the

2673
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,880
relationship between software developers

2674
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,880
and security practitioners from a

2675
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,520
similar perspective now i'm not for one

2676
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,000
instance suggesting that software

2677
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,080
developers are somehow sick and need

2678
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,639
treatment from security practitioners

2679
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:36,800
but i am saying that perhaps we could

2680
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,199
start to move the dialogue away from one

2681
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:41,520
of compliance and adherence where

2682
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,639
developers are told what they should do

2683
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:46,320
to a point where there's a mutual

2684
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,159
understanding and agreement about

2685
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:50,239
security and its implications

2686
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,239
so basically what i'm saying is this is

2687
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,320
a more formal um

2688
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,679
more formal way of actually

2689
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:57,760
conceptualizing this need for

2690
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,080
negotiation and collaboration between

2691
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:03,600
these two communities

2692
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,199
so we've got this idea we're going to

2693
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:07,040
move towards concordance what do we

2694
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,600
actually mean by concordance this is

2695
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,440
where the quote dancing not wrestling

2696
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,440
comes from

2697
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,679
so the research on concordance in this

2698
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:18,320
particular medical context talks about

2699
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:19,920
the need for mutual respect and

2700
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,320
expertise recognition of expertise on

2701
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,000
both sides

2702
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,719
and there are five things there that you

2703
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:28,800
really need to have in place in order to

2704
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,400
achieve concordance

2705
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,080
a willingness and commitment to engage

2706
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,400
with each other open discussion sharing

2707
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,480
information listening to each other

2708
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,440
active listening and time

2709
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:42,320
and i have to say that in our research

2710
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:43,679
and in the work that we've done with

2711
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:46,880
devsecops teams time is quite often the

2712
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,159
hardest one

2713
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,080
to get um

2714
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,840
and quite often that's because a lot of

2715
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,560
software developers are contractors and

2716
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,880
organizations very short-sightedly quite

2717
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,360
often won't pay for software developers

2718
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,040
to get engaged in these kinds of

2719
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,480
activities

2720
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:04,080
and i really think that is that is

2721
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,080
short-sighted which is why i think this

2722
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,040
this

2723
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,360
perhaps more slightly structured way of

2724
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,520
understanding how to how to get these

2725
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,520
two communities to work together could

2726
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,760
be quite useful in making the making the

2727
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,199
case for having the time to do this

2728
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:23,120
so we want to move towards concordance

2729
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,679
now i have been a security practitioner

2730
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,360
i've never been a professional software

2731
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,639
developer

2732
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:30,639
so we did spend quite a lot of time

2733
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:32,400
after those first interviews and the

2734
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,639
shooting the baby comment actually

2735
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:36,719
interviewing software developers about

2736
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:38,800
their work about their day about the

2737
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,760
social practice of software development

2738
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,800
and some of the things that came back

2739
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,480
were around the fact that

2740
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,320
software developers have very little

2741
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:51,760
patience when security is performative

2742
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,120
and quite often they have the

2743
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:54,639
responsibility

2744
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:57,199
for delivering secure code but without

2745
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:59,360
having the authority

2746
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,800
to actually determine how that's

2747
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,440
achieved so they talked about security

2748
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,360
being hammered into us this was a

2749
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,440
reference to being forced to undertake

2750
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,199
security training

2751
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:10,320
um

2752
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,800
they also talked about the performative

2753
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,960
nature of security so one of them said

2754
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:15,920
to us

2755
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,520
i can give you the answer we all know to

2756
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,600
be true or i can give you the answer

2757
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,600
that practically is true so they know

2758
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,560
that there's this disconnect between

2759
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,400
what security dialogues um look like in

2760
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,960
practice and what really happens in

2761
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,800
reality

2762
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,320
and they have very little patience with

2763
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,800
this understandably

2764
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,520
but on the other hand

2765
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,040
all the software developers that we

2766
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,719
spoke to

2767
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,159
emphasize the fact that in their

2768
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:45,840
day-to-day jobs aside from what they had

2769
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,080
to do with security they

2770
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,560
they really favored collaboration with

2771
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,480
each other so they talked about the

2772
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,920
importance of listening to each other

2773
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,679
when they were developing code and they

2774
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:57,280
talked about never shutting down the

2775
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,360
conversation and having very little

2776
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,800
patience with colleagues who would just

2777
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,119
say no to everything

2778
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:04,880
they talked about the need to share and

2779
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,440
the desire to share you get out as much

2780
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,080
as you put in and they also gave very

2781
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,400
clear examples about where they engage

2782
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,880
and discuss solutions with each other

2783
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,520
so one particular example that that

2784
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,600
really stood out for us was around

2785
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,920
spiking the notion that you would have a

2786
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,159
good idea you would mock up a prototype

2787
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:25,360
you would take it to the team and

2788
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,199
discuss it with them and if there was

2789
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:29,280
general consensus and buy-in then you'd

2790
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,280
be allowed to move forward with it and

2791
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,880
of course a lot of these teams work on a

2792
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,880
basis where they aim to

2793
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,480
not have

2794
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,719
formal hierarchies in place so anybody

2795
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:41,760
can anybody can chip in and have an idea

2796
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,199
now

2797
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:45,199
this may be slightly ideal idealistic

2798
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:47,600
but this is the way they conceptualized

2799
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,920
their day-to-day working practices

2800
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,560
and so for us it seemed like they were

2801
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,480
right for engaging in this idea of

2802
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,960
concordant dialogue

2803
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,639
so what we wanted to do

2804
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:00,800
was to actually develop a vehicle where

2805
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,000
we could

2806
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
both find out more about the problems

2807
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,679
and what they were experiencing both

2808
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:07,440
sides both security practitioners and

2809
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,600
software developers but also give them

2810
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,000
some very practical tools and techniques

2811
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,679
that they could then use in their

2812
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:14,960
day-to-day

2813
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:18,400
working lives to actually improve this

2814
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,360
move towards a concordant dialogue

2815
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:26,799
so we've run now six workshops in total

2816
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,639
the workshops take two and a half days

2817
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:30,480
which has been quite problematic because

2818
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,000
taking developers and security

2819
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,440
practitioners out of their normal work

2820
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,960
for two and a half days is quite a big

2821
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,480
ask and one of the things that we're

2822
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,239
doing now is working on chopping it up

2823
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:40,159
into smaller bite-sized chunks to

2824
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:41,679
deliver

2825
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:43,760
it was originally three days but

2826
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,679
actually all the participants found it

2827
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:47,199
really tiring

2828
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:49,600
to engage with the material for a whole

2829
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,840
three-day period we've had 72

2830
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,840
participants through

2831
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,199
some of them we've had teams from

2832
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:59,440
public sector government organizations

2833
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,600
we've also had teams from finance sector

2834
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:02,960
private sector

2835
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,800
we've had mixed teams that's been quite

2836
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,280
interesting originally we could only get

2837
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,040
security practitioners to attend these

2838
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,960
workshops software developers were much

2839
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,360
harder sell now we find it much easier

2840
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,280
to get software developers involved as

2841
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,960
well

2842
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,880
and so we were aiming to just give them

2843
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,360
tools and techniques gather more insight

2844
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,679
we use techniques in the workshop that

2845
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:26,560
came from behaviour change that came

2846
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,239
from other aspects of healthcare

2847
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:30,080
research and that also came from

2848
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:32,239
non-directed counselling

2849
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:34,320
they were never badged in this way but

2850
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:37,199
we used the underpinning ideas to create

2851
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:39,520
some activities um and some

2852
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,679
interventions that participants could

2853
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:42,880
engage with

2854
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,119
and we used something called action

2855
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:48,400
research so every time we ran a workshop

2856
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,480
we would reflect on the feedback that we

2857
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,880
got and how things had gone and we would

2858
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:55,119
um we would tailor it and alter it for

2859
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,520
the next iteration so that way we could

2860
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:01,280
build the insight back into the workshop

2861
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,639
so what do we actually do on these

2862
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:04,239
workshops

2863
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:06,159
well the first thing we do is we go back

2864
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:09,520
to that research i showed you on

2865
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,960
doctors and patients and we start to try

2866
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,800
and get participants

2867
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,520
to understand why people do what they do

2868
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,520
and we do this by getting them to put

2869
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,360
themselves into somebody else's

2870
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,280
situation

2871
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,520
for every activity that we do on the

2872
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:26,719
workshop

2873
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:27,920
we

2874
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:31,119
take the um the underpinning idea and we

2875
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:34,320
put it into everyday life so in this

2876
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,719
example it's doctors and patients we

2877
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:38,960
have a later example where we do it um

2878
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,119
for teaching questioning skills and we

2879
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:42,320
use

2880
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,960
negotiation with an insurance company

2881
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,800
once they've done the activity in that

2882
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,800
space we then bring it back into their

2883
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:49,679
world

2884
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:51,360
some of the feedback i've had from these

2885
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,520
workshops has been particularly from

2886
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,679
from organizations not from participants

2887
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:58,800
has been why can't hr just deliver this

2888
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,480
in our experience that doesn't work

2889
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,840
because you have to be from that

2890
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,400
community it would be to be honest it

2891
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,840
would be almost better if it wasn't

2892
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,400
somebody like me coming in to do it but

2893
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,080
if it was grown from inside the

2894
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,800
organization with perhaps provided with

2895
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,800
tools and techniques

2896
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,320
so the first thing is why do people do

2897
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,000
what we what they do and it's getting

2898
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,480
them to understand problems um and

2899
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:24,239
interactions from different perspectives

2900
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:27,040
the second part is actually um helping

2901
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:29,119
them to reflect on the part that they

2902
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:32,560
play in the process and in the

2903
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:35,199
dialogue between software developers and

2904
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:38,320
security practitioners and and this is

2905
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,760
where this takes quite a lot of effort

2906
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:43,119
some people do this quite naturally um

2907
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:44,960
it's sort of cool it's called

2908
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,639
metacognition where you're actually able

2909
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:48,880
to step outside yourself and to watch

2910
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:51,280
what's going on as it happens

2911
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,080
um

2912
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,000
people who do it naturally don't see it

2913
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,159
as any big deal people who don't do it

2914
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:58,639
naturally is quite a big ask to try and

2915
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:00,239
to try and get them into this way of

2916
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:02,239
thinking but basically this is just

2917
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:04,159
about reflection what have you done that

2918
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:05,840
could have been misconstrued or that

2919
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,040
might have had an impact that you

2920
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,400
weren't intending

2921
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,040
and again we take it outside into a into

2922
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,199
a real world everyday situation and then

2923
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:15,119
we bring it back into the into the

2924
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:18,719
devsecops environment

2925
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,639
and then we have a clutch of tools and

2926
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:22,639
techniques that we use so

2927
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:24,639
we we used questioning skills we help

2928
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:26,239
them questioning skills we do a lot of

2929
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:28,159
role play as well if participants are

2930
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:31,119
amenable to that not everybody is

2931
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:32,560
we do quite a lot around dealing with

2932
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,639
difference so what happens when it all

2933
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:37,119
goes wrong how do you find a how do you

2934
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:39,040
find a pathway through

2935
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,199
and then my favorite activity

2936
01:40:41,199 --> 01:40:44,159
negotiating compromise we have this is

2937
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:46,320
an experiential session where we get

2938
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,679
them to do

2939
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:49,600
we call it the scrap heap challenge so

2940
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,040
we give them a security problem that

2941
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:53,440
they have to solve without using normal

2942
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:56,480
tools and technologies for security

2943
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:59,280
um so they do it on you know usually

2944
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,920
on on flip flip chat paper with drawings

2945
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,760
and they present it to everybody else

2946
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,400
and they have to work together to to

2947
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,400
improve the solution that they've come

2948
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,440
up with

2949
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,119
um and so

2950
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:12,880
those are some of the some of the tools

2951
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:14,719
and techniques that we use

2952
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:17,040
um the last thing that we do is around

2953
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,119
changing behavior so both sides will

2954
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:20,719
probably at some point want to change

2955
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:22,639
the behavior of the other side and we

2956
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:24,480
can't make them behaviour change experts

2957
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,480
overnight nor would we want to

2958
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,719
but we can give them some quick tools

2959
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:30,239
and techniques

2960
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:32,400
and so one thing we use is the hug smack

2961
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,960
shove nudge framework from behavior

2962
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:35,920
change

2963
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,520
most people know about nudging now you

2964
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,119
know making it easy to do the right

2965
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:42,639
thing um but what we talk to them about

2966
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:46,239
is the fact that you can also hug

2967
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:48,159
and that i don't mean physical hugging i

2968
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:51,119
mean uh giving nice things back

2969
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:53,040
sometimes it is necessary to smack

2970
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,880
perhaps but how do you smack in a

2971
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,400
constructive way

2972
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,920
and then shoving

2973
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,679
so this is like a speed bump in the road

2974
01:41:59,679 --> 01:42:01,440
just as nudging is making it easy to do

2975
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,920
the right thing shoving is making it is

2976
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:06,800
making it hard to do the wrong thing

2977
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,400
and so we give them these these tools

2978
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,760
and techniques that they can then take

2979
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:12,000
back into the workplace

2980
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,920
um now this sounds all quite

2981
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:16,639
straightforward but when you've got a

2982
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:18,560
bunch of software developers and

2983
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,159
security practitioners in the same room

2984
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:22,639
at the same time for two and a half days

2985
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:25,199
things can really get quite heated um

2986
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:27,199
and a lot of the value of the workshop

2987
01:42:27,199 --> 01:42:28,719
comes from

2988
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,119
their ability to actually be together

2989
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:33,520
over a longer period of time sometimes

2990
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,520
we find it's the first time that they've

2991
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,760
actually had that kind of interaction at

2992
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,600
that level and this is why time comes

2993
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,199
back into it this is why it's so

2994
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:43,280
important

2995
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:44,239
and so

2996
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:46,800
this has for us elicited a whole range

2997
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,520
of new avenues for research

2998
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:50,880
around

2999
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,920
devsecops but also now around things

3000
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:57,040
like mlops

3001
01:42:57,119 --> 01:42:58,320
and i'm just going to leave you with

3002
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,800
this with this cartoon

3003
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,880
and a comment from a security

3004
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,159
practitioner

3005
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:06,320
in one of the early workshops who said

3006
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,400
we play a greater role in interfacing

3007
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,480
between an unsatisfactory mandated

3008
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,800
process and the operational business

3009
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,280
than i realized and this security

3010
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,199
practitioner had

3011
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:19,199
realized that a lot of the processes

3012
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:21,840
security processes that his organization

3013
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,400
was asking him to comply with and to

3014
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,880
implement with the software developers

3015
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,199
were not fit for purpose they were not

3016
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:30,960
allowing the organization to move

3017
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,719
forward in the way that perhaps laura

3018
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:34,560
talked about in her talk

3019
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:35,920
um

3020
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,920
and so he started to realize through the

3021
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,760
course of the workshop that he was

3022
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,080
actually having to negotiate his way

3023
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,080
through and that he had a role to play

3024
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,920
that was actually bigger than just

3025
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:49,520
implementing um security uh security

3026
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:52,800
advice and security processes um

3027
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:55,280
the next step for this research is well

3028
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:57,679
this is still ongoing um and we still

3029
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:00,560
keep tweaking it um but as i said

3030
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,480
we're now looking at it in an mlops

3031
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,159
space so what happens when you put data

3032
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:06,000
scientists into this conversation as

3033
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:06,880
well

3034
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,199
and their ways of working and how do we

3035
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:11,760
how do we manage that so it's a hugely

3036
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:14,000
exciting space and thank you for giving

3037
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,360
me time to come and talk about it

3038
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:22,159
the reason why we were slightly late is

3039
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:23,520
because shanna and i were both saying

3040
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,119
this was an amazing talk

3041
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:28,000
so uh we were typing away furiously and

3042
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,560
uh we had to then jump in

3043
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:33,280
um but yeah i think um it was really

3044
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,520
relevant to have both your talk and

3045
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,000
laura's you know talking about bringing

3046
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,119
people together but then how do you

3047
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:40,960
actually bring them together in you know

3048
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,960
in some of the practical sense so one

3049
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,560
question that's kind of on that that was

3050
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,960
asked by grand master was how do you get

3051
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:50,000
encourage higher managers and execs uh

3052
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,760
to make their teams available for

3053
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,920
exercises how do you get them to make

3054
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,159
time for the dialogue

3055
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:58,800
um so quite often it's

3056
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:01,440
so they're two ways sometimes it's it's

3057
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,960
a distressed thing

3058
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,679
so i've seen devsecops teams where

3059
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:07,679
culture has fallen apart very quickly

3060
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:09,280
and unexpectedly

3061
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:11,440
um and sometimes the organization

3062
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,199
doesn't exactly know what's wrong they

3063
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:14,960
just know something needs to be fixed

3064
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:18,239
quickly um other times it's having an

3065
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:20,800
ally in that organization so it's it's

3066
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,880
building the relationship and sometimes

3067
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,320
it's it's trying to do it from the

3068
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,800
bottom up

3069
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,320
so it's getting somebody within the

3070
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,000
organization who's willing to think

3071
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,560
creatively and and will take forward the

3072
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:35,520
ideas and make the case for us

3073
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,119
i think we're slightly hamstrung by

3074
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:38,560
being academics you know not every

3075
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,320
organization is comfortable with letting

3076
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:44,400
academics um roam around um so you know

3077
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,920
there might be that

3078
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:47,280
there might be other ways of doing it

3079
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:48,480
but those are the two ways that have

3080
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,080
worked for me

3081
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,360
it's funny you mentioned the academics

3082
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,119
thing because obviously i came from dsto

3083
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:54,960
and when i some of my colleagues will

3084
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:58,080
refer to it as the propellerhead uh

3085
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:58,960
place

3086
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:00,880
um because they know that sometimes

3087
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:01,760
there's a difference between the

3088
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,199
theoretical and the practical but

3089
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:05,040
obviously it's really important to to

3090
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:09,199
get that across um another question from

3091
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:10,480
kieran

3092
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,400
have you seen any significant changes in

3093
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,080
this space in the past three years and

3094
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:16,159
there's a note saying by the way lovely

3095
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:17,840
to see you're still working researching

3096
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,400
in this space

3097
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:23,040
um have i seen any changes yes it's far

3098
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:26,560
easier now to get

3099
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,639
so i've got to qualify this i was going

3100
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:30,320
to say it's far easier to get software

3101
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,159
developers and security practitioners in

3102
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:34,080
the same room at the same time i mean

3103
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,760
they are more willing to be in the same

3104
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:37,920
room at the same time

3105
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,840
when we first started i could only get

3106
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,239
the security practitioners in the room

3107
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:44,639
and that was because i didn't know

3108
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:46,560
enough about how software developers

3109
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:49,600
worked so when one's iteration we had

3110
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,760
both we had even numbers of each

3111
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:54,080
community signed up and on the friday

3112
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,520
before we were due to run the workshop

3113
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,440
on the monday at five o'clock i watched

3114
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,199
all the software developers pull out one

3115
01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:00,159
by one

3116
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:01,920
um and they said it's not written into

3117
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,040
our sprint

3118
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,800
we've been told to pull out

3119
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:07,119
um so at that point i realized i needed

3120
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:08,880
to know a hell of a lot more about

3121
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,560
software developers and how to get into

3122
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,639
that process and get it into the sprints

3123
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:13,679
yeah

3124
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:15,920
we're getting there we're getting there

3125
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:17,440
yeah and it's speaking in their language

3126
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,520
and meeting their sort of processes so

3127
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:21,040
it's it's part of that also bringing

3128
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:23,600
everyone together yes um last question

3129
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,920
from me um are there any recommended

3130
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,239
readings on changing behaviors or the

3131
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:29,760
tactics that you were talking about in

3132
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,199
your presentation

3133
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:33,760
um i would say this wouldn't i i have a

3134
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:37,280
couple of papers um that are openly

3135
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,119
available so there's the paper that was

3136
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:41,679
the pilot study for this and i'm happy

3137
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:43,360
to circulate that

3138
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:44,320
um

3139
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,880
there's also a paper that we did on

3140
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:49,040
which is not directly related to this

3141
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,800
but it's about behavior change for

3142
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,400
security and it's called can we sell

3143
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,320
security like so

3144
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,880
um but i'm happy to provide other

3145
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,800

um

3160
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:27,440
i had a bit of a change

3161
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:28,880
i thought i thought i needed a bit of

3162
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,480
change

3163
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:32,480
um i can't pull it off as well as you

3164
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:33,840
though

3165
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,679
mine just looks natural yours looks

3166
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:38,560
natural but my head is too fat

3167
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:39,840
to fit

3168
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,320
the freaking cap

3169
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,080
so weirdly

3170
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:45,760
all of my wigs are way too big for my

3171
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:47,119
head because i have a very it's because

3172
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:50,880
you have a beautifully small head honey

3173
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,719
although i do like your natural hair at

3174
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:54,400
the moment when i saw it on wednesday it

3175
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,320
was very nice

3176
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:57,679
um

3177
01:48:57,679 --> 01:48:58,960
so we've just got a couple of minutes

3178
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:01,760
before nina comes on um

3179
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:03,440
what are you thinking so far are we are

3180
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:05,119
we still regretting running a conference

3181
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:07,600
or are we going

3182
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,119
i'm loving it i'm actually loving not

3183
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:11,280
being on two zooms that's a really nice

3184
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,960
thing i'm actually oh yeah the lack of

3185
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:15,119
the two zooms is very good this time

3186
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:17,280
yeah um we just ordered pizza over here

3187
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:18,639
so we're just waiting for the pizza oh

3188
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:20,400
that's a really good idea well you can

3189
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:23,119
just make pizza

3190
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:25,119
i could

3191
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:27,119
but i wanted and i did have some doggos

3192
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:28,480
but i think the doggos have gone back

3193
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:29,360
through because they don't want to be

3194
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:32,000
here anymore

3195
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:33,199
they um

3196
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:35,040
they were making noise earlier but um

3197
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,880
yes i think they don't want to be here

3198
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:39,440
so um without further ado i'm going to

3199
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,520
bring on our next speaker so she's had

3200
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,360
her warning

3201
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:47,040
welcome naina hello

3202

um nug

3212
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,760

3213
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:21,280
she's not getting to cause that much

3214
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,920
trouble i'm so really excited to have

3215

awesome in itself like you know you

3230
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:53,599

3231
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:56,080
cyber but like i'm pretty excited about

3232

3233
01:50:57,199 --> 01:50:59,040

10-minute talk today about marketing

3236
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:05,280
yourself and improving your

3237
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:07,119
communication in cyber which i've just

3239

thank you

3241
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:17,280
um so thanks ian for the great intro but

3242
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:20,639
really the way i describe myself is that

3243
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:21,920
i am

3244
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:24,800
a cyber security translator so while my

3245
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:27,440
day job is yes i'm a marketing manager

3246
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:30,000
et cetera et cetera but what i really do

3247
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,719
is i take um what a cyber security

3248
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:35,599
vendor or a co-founder or a cto comes up

3249
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:38,560
with and i translate it into a message

3250
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:41,520
or a benefit that an organization

3251
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,760
might want to buy so i wanted to take

3252
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:46,159
some of the things from my world and see

3253
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:48,400
if we can apply it into cyber security

3254
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:51,520
which obviously cyber commons nerd um as

3255
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,000
ian mentioned before

3256
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,440
so i wanted to start with a couple of

3257
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:58,159
statistics this is fairly recent from um

3258
01:51:58,159 --> 01:52:00,000
an article in itu brief a couple weeks

3259
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,599
ago it says 4 in 10 it decision makers

3260
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:05,199
within aipac

3261
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:07,520
don't understand the business impact of

3262
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:09,199
falling victim to a cyber attack so the

3263
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:11,280
employees within the organization

3264
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:14,400
don't understand that and 42 of their

3265
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:16,639
employees could actually successfully

3266
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:18,639
identify a phishing email

3267
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:21,840
and 39 of their employees or they feel

3268
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:24,239
pretty confident would actually report a

3269
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:26,000
suspicious activity

3270
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,159
so clearly we have a long way to go when

3271
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:32,480
it comes to changing um behavior within

3272
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:35,440
within our organizations that we work in

3273
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:36,800
but

3274
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:39,520
cyber security in itself has a couple of

3275
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:42,320
additional challenges when it comes to

3276
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:43,840
communicating

3277
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:45,520
the message that we want to get across

3278
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:47,280
to our greater organizations or the

3279
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:49,920
industries in general if you think about

3280
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,960
it

3281
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:53,280
the only time cyber security comes into

3282
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:56,000
the general awareness is usually with a

3283
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,159
negative connotation um there's been a

3284
01:52:58,159 --> 01:53:00,880
breach there's been a hack um

3285
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:03,199
grandma's lost thousands of dollars in a

3286
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:05,679
scam a ceo has been

3287
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:08,480
fired or conversely

3288
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:10,400
there's a big scary

3289
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,800
dude in a hoodie who's trying to steal

3290
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,840
all my personal data and really just

3291
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:18,400
kills my body when i'm trying to um

3292
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,800
online shop and then this is again

3293
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,320
followed by a very serious looking

3294
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:24,000
person who tells me that i'm not doing

3295
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,400
the right things um to prevent

3296
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,560
these sort of cyber security attacks so

3297
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:30,560
we have a few challenges when we when we

3298
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:31,760
communicate

3299
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:34,159
our message to a greater audience and

3300
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:36,400
the second thing if we've not scared off

3301
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,320
the audience who are interested to begin

3302
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:41,440
with is a lot of the vernacular around

3303
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:44,960
cyber security is comparatively new um

3304
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,800
so it's hard to

3305
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:49,760
truly communicate even some base what we

3306
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:51,599
consider basic concepts in cyber

3307
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:53,920
security like a ransomware or a malware

3308
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,159
or even a breach to an audience who may

3309
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:58,000
or may not be familiar with those

3310
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,119
concepts

3311
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:02,000
so if you are someone who's interested

3312
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:02,800
in

3313
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:04,639
taking you know just wanting to bring

3314
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:06,880
about organizational change within your

3315
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:09,360
industry your organization or the

3316
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:12,080
industry um or really just you know get

3317
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:13,840
a cyber security program launched and

3318
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:16,719
get some nods and smiles across the room

3319
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:18,400
when you're in a meeting and then

3320
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,480
hopefully you'll find some of these tips

3321
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,159
helpful

3322
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:23,760
so the three tips i wanted to talk about

3323
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:27,119
today are know your audience build trust

3324
01:54:27,119 --> 01:54:29,440
and have a clear call to action and how

3325
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:32,000
can we take these things and apply them

3326
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,440
to some

3327
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,280
high stakes

3328
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:37,679
impact making projects within our

3329
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:39,760
organizations and the industry in

3330
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,679
general

3331
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:43,440
the first thing i wanted to talk about

3332
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:46,239
is know your audience now i don't mean

3333
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:49,199
obviously personal data um you know a

3334
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:52,800
full dossier but i mean the who

3335
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,719
when i start a marketing campaign

3336
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:56,880
usually i don't start with the what or

3337
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:59,199
the how or you know what the product is

3338
01:54:59,199 --> 01:55:01,920
i start with who who's buying what i'm

3339
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:03,920
trying to sell who's attending my

3340
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:05,920
webinar what's the size of the

3341
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:07,360
organization that's going to be

3342
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:10,080
interested in my product do i need um

3343
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:11,679
you know case studies and customer

3344
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:13,679
testimonials or is it a smaller shop

3345
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:16,080
where they just need a demo and a quick

3346
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:19,360
payment gateway if we don't take the

3347
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:22,239
time as an industry or even as cyber

3348
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:23,520
security professionals within our

3349
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,760
organization to think about what's

3350
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:28,000
important to our audience we'll never be

3351
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,639
able to influence their decision

3352
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:32,960
um i want to give you guys a real

3353
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,599
example um for an organization that i

3354
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:37,840
used to work with so it was a busy time

3355
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,760
of year i was getting ready to launch a

3356
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:41,520
couple of marketing programs and i got

3357
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:43,360
this email and and you know what they

3358
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:45,599
did they got my name it's got it's up

3359
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:47,840
there um and it's so it's a really clear

3360
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,520
email on what i'm supposed to do i'm

3361
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,760
supposed to take this questionnaire but

3362
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:54,639
there's absolutely no context like i

3363
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:57,360
didn't know what this was about and um i

3364
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:58,800
didn't take this questionnaire and

3365
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:00,800
neither neither did a lot of people on

3366
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:03,199
my team in fact nobody did um i know

3367
01:56:03,199 --> 01:56:06,000
this for a fact and i received several

3368
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,920
of these emails within a couple of weeks

3369
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:09,679
of each other and i didn't take that

3370
01:56:09,679 --> 01:56:11,520
questionnaire even

3371
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:14,639
once the point i'm trying to make is had

3372
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:16,639
whoever was running this program taken

3373
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:18,719
some time to think about how this would

3374
01:56:18,719 --> 01:56:20,800
affect me was it a busy time of year for

3375
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:23,920
me um can i really take 36 questions at

3376
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:26,159
a time or do i need to take some quick

3377
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:27,520
modules

3378
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,199
they probably would have they probably

3379
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:31,760
would have been able to get um

3380
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:33,920
a better response

3381
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:36,480
which brings me to my second point

3382
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:39,040
build trust

3383
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,840
building trust with our audience is is

3384
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:44,880
difficult but and it takes some time and

3385
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:47,440
i want to give you an example um i don't

3386
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:48,400
know if this happens in your

3387
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:50,960
organization but definitely in mine i

3388
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:53,840
only hear from my it team twice and it's

3389
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:56,159
only over email there's usually an

3390
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:58,639
outage something's not working i can't

3391
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:01,199
access my file or they need me to reboot

3392
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:03,760
at the worst possible moment

3393
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,199
that they could possibly need and i

3394
01:57:05,199 --> 01:57:07,199
never ever want to hear from them

3395
01:57:07,199 --> 01:57:08,880
and honestly i'm in a similar boat

3396
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:11,360
myself i'm a marketer i am forced to

3397
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:14,719
send emails or ask people to buy things

3398
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:16,560
that they're really convinced that they

3399
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:19,199
don't want and as an industry we're

3400
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:20,880
sometimes in a similar boat like i

3401
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:22,719
brought up in the beginning people only

3402
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:24,560
hear from us when something bads happen

3403
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:26,080
they only hear from us when we need

3404
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:27,440
something from them

3405
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:29,840
so in marketing we overcome this

3406
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:32,320
challenge of building trust by using

3407
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:34,000
what we call the marketing

3408
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,320
communications mix so currently i'm

3409
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:38,719
building a campaign around the essential

3410
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:41,679
8 for smbs so i could just send them to

3411
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:44,320
the document on the csc.gov website it's

3412
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,000
a great document they could read it we

3413
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,760
could all get on with our day

3414
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:48,719
but

3415
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:50,400
i know it's not going to give me the

3416
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,400
behavior i want i'm not going to be able

3417
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:54,080
to get them to adopt some of those

3418
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:56,639
strategies so i have an ebook

3419
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:58,239
i have an event i have a webinar i have

3420
01:57:58,239 --> 01:58:01,280
a couple of social media graphics um

3421
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:02,960
i've um

3422
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:06,159
assets and infographics and i'm using

3423
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:07,920
multiple touch points and multiple

3424
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:09,520
channels to stay in touch with my

3425
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:11,360
audience now i'm not asking you to do

3426
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:12,800
this i'm not asking you to create like

3427
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,639
an eight touch point campaign to get

3428
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:17,520
your message across but what i am asking

3429
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,040
is to think about

3430
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:20,800
what is a way you could speak to your

3431
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:23,360
audience that's not in the ways that we

3432
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:25,360
necessarily are comfortable ourselves

3433
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:27,199
which is oftentimes just email we send

3434
01:58:27,199 --> 01:58:29,280
an email over and over again

3435
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:31,199
and i'll go back to the example that i

3436
01:58:31,199 --> 01:58:32,880
brought up earlier

3437
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:34,639
so remember the questionnaire that i

3438
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:37,280
didn't take and no one in my team took

3439
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:39,280
a couple of weeks later we had a town

3440
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:40,480
hall meeting

3441
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,239
where our head of i.t

3442
01:58:42,239 --> 01:58:45,040
um introduced the program talked about

3443
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:46,800
how as an organization we were really

3444
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,800
passionate about security and raising

3445
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:51,119
our profile and needed everyone to

3446
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:53,199
participate in the program and take

3447
01:58:53,199 --> 01:58:55,520
steps it would only take five minutes um

3448
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:57,040
this is the vendor they had chosen and

3449
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:59,679
this was why um these were the modules

3450
01:58:59,679 --> 01:59:02,320
etc and then the next day i got that

3451
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:04,480
email again but with this document

3452
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:06,400
attached to it would explain why

3453
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:08,800
security awareness was important uh how

3454
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,880
the training was gonna benefit me and

3455
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:13,520
how if i got it wrong it was not gonna

3456
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:16,800
be my fault it took away the fear the

3457
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:19,199
next day again my line manager talked to

3458
01:59:19,199 --> 01:59:20,239
us that hey it's just going to take a

3459
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:22,000
couple of five minutes go ahead and do

3460
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,320
it before our stand up and you know what

3461
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:26,239
i did take that survey and i know a lot

3462
01:59:26,239 --> 01:59:28,639
of people in my organization did and the

3463
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:31,040
next time rit manager came to the town

3464
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:33,280
hall she shared the results she

3465
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:36,239
mentioned to us um what this showed

3466
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:37,840
on how we stack up against other

3467
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:40,080
organizations and what steps were being

3468
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:43,520
taken to remediate where the gaps were

3469
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:45,440
so the point i'm trying to make is find

3470
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:47,360
ways to stay in contact with your

3471
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:49,360
audience and offer

3472
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:51,840
value

3473
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:54,639
which brings me to my last point a clear

3474
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:56,560
call to action

3475
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:58,480
now i'll be the first one to raise my

3476
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:00,560
hand and say that even as a marketer

3477
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:03,520
this is easier said than done because

3478
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:06,960
this means you have to strip away

3479
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,880
strip away all your messaging and get to

3480
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,199
the hub of what you want your audience

3481
02:00:11,199 --> 02:00:13,840
to do it is easier if you've implemented

3482
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:16,080
the first two steps as in taking time to

3483
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:18,159
get to know your audience and built that

3484
02:00:18,159 --> 02:00:21,040
trust but you really have to have a very

3485
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,960
clear call to action

3486
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:25,840
in the simplest possible terms we all

3487
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:29,280
fall into the comfort of jargon it is a

3488
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:31,040
language that we're comfortable speaking

3489
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:33,760
in and it makes us feel like experts

3490
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:35,599
when we're asking someone to do

3491
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:37,920
something for us however

3492
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:39,199
we all know that it's something we need

3493
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:41,760
to overcome so i want you to even think

3494
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:44,560
beyond jargon and think about how could

3495
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:46,719
you ask in the simplest possible

3496
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:49,679
language that will give you maximum

3497
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:52,159
outcome i'm going to call myself out on

3498
02:00:52,159 --> 02:00:55,040
this even earlier in this presentation i

3499
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:57,920
mentioned in my statistics that 39 of

3500
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:01,520
people won't report a security incident

3501
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:04,000
would they perhaps report something if

3502
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,239
it was more specific rather than a

3503
02:01:06,239 --> 02:01:08,400
security incident how many people

3504
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:11,119
outside our industry are really aware of

3505
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:13,360
what that means let me show you a couple

3506
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:15,520
of other examples

3507
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,040
these are all around cyber security

3508
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:19,599
awareness within our industry so this is

3509
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:21,440
posters that were created for break

3510
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:24,000
rooms and i want you to compare the two

3511
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,840
the one on the right the one that says

3512
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:28,159
think before you download any apps from

3513
02:01:28,159 --> 02:01:30,159
an unapproved site

3514
02:01:30,159 --> 02:01:32,239
they are increasing awareness but is the

3515
02:01:32,239 --> 02:01:35,119
ask clear on what as a user i'm supposed

3516
02:01:35,119 --> 02:01:37,840
to do whereas compare it to the poster

3517
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,280
on the other side this is actually one

3518
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:40,880
of my favorite and the people who put

3519
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:42,639
this together have amazing content out

3520
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:44,480
there it says what is the most important

3521
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:47,199
reason behind not postponing an update

3522
02:01:47,199 --> 02:01:49,280
so it really asks me to engage with the

3523
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:52,239
material but more importantly there is

3524
02:01:52,239 --> 02:01:55,040
an actual action i can take next time

3525
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,800
i'm in the situation where the little

3526
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:59,599
update now button pops up

3527
02:01:59,599 --> 02:02:01,440
let me show you another one

3528
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:03,119
this is actually my favorite very near

3529
02:02:03,119 --> 02:02:05,440
and dear to my heart but it says do your

3530
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:08,560
part be cyber smart

3531
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:10,960
what is my part there is no clear

3532
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:13,280
indication on what action i'm supposed

3533
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:15,280
to take during the entire month of

3534
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:17,520
october where we promote cyber security

3535
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:19,360
awareness

3536
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:22,320
instead if we were to ask for very

3537
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:24,080
specific things this is something i

3538
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:25,760
pulled out of an infographic i couldn't

3539
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:27,920
fit it into the slide but when i see

3540
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:30,480
something that says don't see attached

3541
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:33,440
in emails or stay off public unsecured

3542
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:36,159
wi-fi there is an actual action that i

3543
02:02:36,159 --> 02:02:37,520
could take

3544
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:39,840
so if i could urge you to do only one

3545
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:42,880
thing from this talk that is always have

3546
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:44,960
an explicit ask whether you're asking

3547
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:47,040
for more budget from your senior senior

3548
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:49,599
leadership asking your organization to

3549
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:51,040
take um

3550
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:53,679
take that questionnaire have that big

3551
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:57,599
red button that says do this now don't

3552
02:02:57,599 --> 02:03:00,480
ask for more resources ask for two staff

3553
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:02,800
members don't ask for better security

3554
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:05,840
awareness ask for a definitive action

3555
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:09,360
that your audience can take

3556
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:12,320
so to sum it up three quick tips know

3557
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:14,320
your audience get to know them spend a

3558
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:16,000
little bit of time thinking about what's

3559
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,080
important to them find ways to stay in

3560
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:20,639
touch with them consistently and offer

3561
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:22,800
something that they would find of value

3562
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:26,320
and last but not least have a very clear

3563
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:29,679
simple call to action

3564
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:32,639
and thank you so much

3565
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:34,239
i'm sitting here loving this

3566
02:03:34,239 --> 02:03:36,080
presentation because you're bait you've

3567
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:38,159
taken all the lessons that you've given

3568
02:03:38,159 --> 02:03:40,000
us and you've gone through them as well

3569
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,040
like you've absolutely adopted them i

3570
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:45,119
don't think there's anyone who has seen

3571
02:03:45,119 --> 02:03:46,080
like

3572
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:48,639
asd's marketing in the past or somebody

3573
02:03:48,639 --> 02:03:50,079
else's and gone well what the hell are

3574
02:03:50,079 --> 02:03:51,679
you trying to say

3575
02:03:51,679 --> 02:03:53,920
like what do you want

3576
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:55,920
you want us to do this okay that's great

3577
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:57,280
but like

3578
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:59,679
tell me how to do it um

3579
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:01,440
i may hate the essential eight for

3580
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:03,280
reasons but like being able to provide

3581
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:04,960
to explain to people why the essential

3582
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:07,040
aid is useful rather than just it's a

3583
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:09,440
thing go do it is probably the most

3584
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:12,719
important thing to be able to do

3585
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:13,520

3586
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:15,199

3655
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:44,079
unfortunately hilt is having some issues

3656
02:06:44,079 --> 02:06:45,360
with his internet connection at the

3657
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:46,880
moment he's in

3658
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:49,119
is in queensland right or is in yeah

3659
02:06:49,119 --> 02:06:51,840
he's in queensland um he's got a bit of

3660
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:53,199
flooding issues as well but he's

3661
02:06:53,199 --> 02:06:55,679
recorded his talk so we're gonna be able

3662
02:06:55,679 --> 02:06:58,639
to run his talk for you guys um after

3663
02:06:58,639 --> 02:06:59,840
that we're actually going to go for a

3664
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:01,599
break as well so we'll come back

3665
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:02,800
afterwards and then have a break

3666
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:04,719
unfortunately maria is not available as

3670
02:07:09,199 --> 02:07:13,839
he's doing and can put the video up now

3671

3674
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:24,840
covert communication channels using

3675
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:26,560
laura

3676
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:29,599

online live

3678
02:07:31,119 --> 02:07:32,159
but

3679
02:07:32,159 --> 02:07:34,639
over the past couple of days

3680
02:07:34,639 --> 02:07:36,880
where i am at the moment just in a

3681
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:38,000
country

3682
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,520
area on a farm has been blocked by

3683
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:43,840
flooding so i'm not able to get home

3684
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:45,679
where there's a stable internet

3685
02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:46,960
connection

3686
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:49,679
so i'll be pre-recording this it's

3687
02:07:49,679 --> 02:07:52,960
saturday the 9th of april

3688
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:55,040

3692
02:08:03,119 --> 02:08:05,599
well that's going crazy

3693
02:08:05,599 --> 02:08:09,679

and i'm also a follower of jesus

3697
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
so we're coming up to the farm at the

3698
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,440
moment

3699
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:25,119

3700
02:08:25,119 --> 02:08:26,639
we'll get started

3701
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:28,320
very shortly

3702
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:30,560
today we're going to be doing um

3703
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:32,560

3704
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:35,040

to help us um

3706
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:40,239
to help us demonstrate some things

3707
02:08:40,239 --> 02:08:43,440
so it should be a fun ride

3708
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:46,639
i look forward to um to giving

3709
02:08:46,639 --> 02:08:49,440
these um demonstrations and sharing this

3710
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:51,199
with you

3711
02:08:51,199 --> 02:08:54,799
we just turned in at the property now

3712
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:03,880
we've had quite a lot of rain recently

3713
02:09:05,199 --> 02:09:06,880
and all the

3714
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:09,840
bridges around us are shut

3715
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:11,440
okay

3716
02:09:11,440 --> 02:09:13,679
we're here

3717
02:09:13,679 --> 02:09:17,480
let's go check it out

3718
02:09:19,119 --> 02:09:21,599
okay we have our actors in our little

3719
02:09:21,599 --> 02:09:22,880
play

3720
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:25,360
what's your name

3721
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:28,480
commanding control

3722
02:09:28,639 --> 02:09:33,840
we've got a tcprp packet over here

3723
02:09:34,159 --> 02:09:37,119
and we've got some malware

3724
02:09:37,119 --> 02:09:39,280
three little bits of malware and what do

3725
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:41,679
you have there ellie

3726
02:09:41,679 --> 02:09:43,440
juicy data

3727
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:45,679
nice

3728
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:47,760
it doesn't matter how good our defenses

3729
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:50,239
are at some point the bad guys will get

3730
02:09:50,239 --> 02:09:53,119
into our network

3731
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,360
they'll put the malware

3732
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:57,360
into our machines we don't know whether

3733
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:58,840
it's through a phishing

3734
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:00,400
email

3735
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:03,280
or an exposed idp port

3736
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:05,360
but the malware will be sent into our

3737
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:07,759
network

3738
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:12,159
once it's in there

3739
02:10:12,159 --> 02:10:13,679
the bad guys are going to want to get

3740
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:16,719
their information out

3741
02:10:20,239 --> 02:10:21,040
so

3742
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:25,040
the malware makes outbound connections

3743
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:29,839
to the commander control server

3744
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:33,920
taking your juicy data

3745
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:35,920
out of your network into the bad guys

3746
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:38,920
hands

3747
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:48,920
so

3748
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:02,079
now before the bad guys can smuggle your

3749
02:11:02,079 --> 02:11:04,320
juicy data out of the network what

3750
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:05,679
usually happens

3751
02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:10,119
is that the malware sends beacons

3752
02:11:17,599 --> 02:11:21,440
this malware just uses tcprp

3753
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:23,440
and it sends

3754
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:26,000
period periodic updates to the command

3755
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,280
and control servers

3756
02:11:32,719 --> 02:11:38,000
so we can use a tool then called rita

3757
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,520
what rita does

3758
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:41,840
is rita looks at all the traffic going

3759
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:43,599
out of your network

3760
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:46,639
to detect if the outgoing traffic is

3761
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:50,719
beacon traffic or just normal traffic

3762
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:54,320
but what if

3763
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:58,239
the beacon traffic is not using tcprp

3764
02:11:58,239 --> 02:12:00,880
what if it's using radio frequencies

3765
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:02,239
like laura

3766
02:12:02,239 --> 02:12:04,239
how are we going to detect it

3767
02:12:04,239 --> 02:12:06,239
this is a threat to us and this is what

3768
02:12:06,239 --> 02:12:09,519
we're going to demonstrate now

3769
02:12:14,159 --> 02:12:16,239
okay what i'm going to do now is i'm

3770
02:12:16,239 --> 02:12:18,719
going to put a bit of distance between

3771
02:12:18,719 --> 02:12:20,320
the base station which is here at the

3772
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:21,440
house

3773
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:23,679
and us to give a proper demonstration of

3774
02:12:23,679 --> 02:12:26,079
laura

3775
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:29,280
i want to put about two kilometers

3776
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:32,320
between us and the base station so we're

3777
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:36,400
just gonna hop over to the shed

3778
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:46,799
okay

3779
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:49,310
let's fire this baby up

3780
02:12:49,310 --> 02:13:03,680
[Music]

3781
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:41,330
[Music]

3782
02:13:41,330 --> 02:13:44,380
[Applause]

3783
02:13:48,460 --> 02:14:00,620
[Music]

3784
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:05,560
so

3785
02:14:07,530 --> 02:14:25,880
[Music]

3786
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:31,760
do

3787
02:14:31,760 --> 02:15:55,609
[Music]

3788
02:15:58,400 --> 02:15:59,440
okay

3789
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:01,440
we're now at our remote site as you can

3790
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:03,598
see

3791
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,199
so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna plug

3792
02:16:17,199 --> 02:16:18,560
this into our

3793
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:19,840
computer

3794
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:21,520
and we're going to control we're going

3795
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:23,760
to send it commands and

3796
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:27,400
simulate exfiltration

3797
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:37,120
we've now connected our device to our

3798
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:39,439
simulated victim machine

3799
02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:42,240
let's boot it up

3800
02:16:44,478 --> 02:16:47,359
what it should do is it'll join the base

3801
02:16:47,359 --> 02:16:49,120
station which is about two kilometers

3802
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:51,359
away

3803
02:16:52,718 --> 02:16:55,200
we might have to do it twice sometimes

3804
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:59,120
it only joins the second time

3805
02:16:59,519 --> 02:17:02,318
let's see how it goes

3806
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:13,638
let's try it again

3807
02:17:22,398 --> 02:17:25,679
okay we got it

3808
02:17:26,799 --> 02:17:28,558
there you are it's booted and we've got

3809
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:31,040
a nice comfy cone logo there

3810
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:34,398
now our little implants is listening for

3811
02:17:34,398 --> 02:17:38,080
um radio frequency beacons

3812
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:39,599
what we're gonna do now is we're gonna

3813
02:17:39,599 --> 02:17:42,920
give it a command

3814
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,879
switch over here

3815
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:53,679
we could put any command in here and in

3816
02:17:53,679 --> 02:17:55,519
theory that will be executed on our

3817
02:17:55,519 --> 02:17:56,959
victim machine

3818
02:17:56,959 --> 02:17:59,599
so we'll send this this command to it

3819
02:17:59,599 --> 02:18:01,439
and we should receive it here

3820
02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:02,638
now this is not going through the

3821
02:18:02,638 --> 02:18:04,398
internet it's going

3822
02:18:04,398 --> 02:18:07,120
it's going over radio frequencies

3823
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:08,160
the laura

3824
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:11,679
the laura radio band to our device

3825
02:18:11,679 --> 02:18:14,638
there you are it's received a command

3826
02:18:14,638 --> 02:18:16,638
so this could be this could be anything

3827
02:18:16,638 --> 02:18:19,439
this could be us adding a user account

3828
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:21,120
to the victim machine

3829
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:24,240
it could be us brute forcing a serial or

3830
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:26,080
a wifi password

3831
02:18:26,080 --> 02:18:29,040
or it could be a covert channel

3832
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:30,080
sending

3833
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:32,240
sending the victims data

3834
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:34,160
to us over laura

3835
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:37,040
now because laura is very

3836
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:39,439
very low power it the bandwidth is

3837
02:18:39,439 --> 02:18:41,120
pretty low you wouldn't want to send

3838
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:44,000
over a couple of terabytes you would

3839
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,959
only send very small bits of information

3840
02:18:46,959 --> 02:18:47,920
but

3841
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:50,240
this is not going over rp this is a

3842
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:52,718
covert communication channel

3843
02:18:52,718 --> 02:18:54,478
it would be very difficult to do to

3844
02:18:54,478 --> 02:18:56,318
detect

3845
02:18:56,318 --> 02:18:58,638
all of the tools that we currently have

3846
02:18:58,638 --> 02:19:01,040
would be useless if people are using

3847
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:02,478
laura

3848
02:19:02,478 --> 02:19:03,359
or

3849
02:19:03,359 --> 02:19:05,439
or another radio technology to

3850
02:19:05,439 --> 02:19:09,679
exfiltrate or do command and control

3851
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:19,679
i think that wins the competition for

3852
02:19:19,679 --> 02:19:21,760
the shut up zero

3853
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:23,318
the um most

3854
02:19:23,318 --> 02:19:26,558
expansive uh talk we've ever had

3855
02:19:26,558 --> 02:19:29,920
although closely following um

3856
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:32,920
ben's

3857
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:36,879
ben's um

3858
02:19:36,879 --> 02:19:39,439
uh mountain biking talked last year i

3859
02:19:39,439 --> 02:19:41,200
think i missed a bit was there a bit

3860
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:44,398
involving uh a quad bike that i missed

3861
02:19:44,398 --> 02:19:46,799
while i was eating pizza um that would

3862
02:19:46,799 --> 02:19:48,800
have been uh i'll have to go back and

3863
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:50,319
watch that

3864
02:19:50,319 --> 02:19:52,640
um

3865
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:56,720
i don't know what to say that was uh

3866
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:58,399
yeah an amazing talk

3867
02:19:58,399 --> 02:20:01,120
attacking funds

3868
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:03,760
well i mean that's what

3869
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:05,600
that's um

3870
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:07,439
an interesting application i know

3871
02:20:07,439 --> 02:20:08,880
there's somebody who also said that they

3872
02:20:08,880 --> 02:20:11,359
were talking about um they host one on

3873
02:20:11,359 --> 02:20:13,280
their property as well so it's an

3874
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:14,240
interesting

3875
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:15,680
piece of technology i don't think most

3876
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:17,439
of us really deal with

3877
02:20:17,439 --> 02:20:19,200
um

3878
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:21,920
i have um apparently did we did we

3879
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:24,720
discuss whether karagi chicken comes

3880
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:26,880
under nuggies or candies because my

3881
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:30,319
pizza has has karagi chicken on it so

3882
02:20:30,319 --> 02:20:33,200
nuggets are technically the dark meat of

3883
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:34,160
chicken

3884
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:35,680
okay so

3885
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:38,080
if it's karaji is usually made from

3886
02:20:38,080 --> 02:20:40,880
chicken thigh so no it is not a nugget

3887
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:42,319
so it's a tender

3888
02:20:42,319 --> 02:20:44,960
yes okay so i'm eating chicken candies

3889
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:47,680
on my pizza you are which is

3890
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:50,720
bizarre in itself but okay all right i

3891
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:52,560
mean i'm okay with that

3892
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:54,479
yeah why not

3893
02:20:54,479 --> 02:20:56,800
it's like a chicken burger

3894
02:20:56,800 --> 02:20:59,359
so um the next speaker maria

3895
02:20:59,359 --> 02:21:00,960
unfortunately had to pull out um for

3896
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:02,720
personal reasons we send a lot of love

3897
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:05,040
to her for that um but unfortunately she

3898
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:07,040
couldn't make it this time so what we're

3899
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:08,640
gonna do is we're gonna go straight to a

3900
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:10,800
break um everyone needs a break to go

3901
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:13,520
get a drink whether that be of water or

3902
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:16,479
alcohol or some food um

3903
02:21:16,479 --> 02:21:18,080
please do so

3904
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:20,479
the speaker afterwards will be tracy and

3905
02:21:20,479 --> 02:21:22,720
tracy will be talking about

3906
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:24,240
solving a cyber problem like small

3907
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:25,920
business and i think also she'll be

3908
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:28,080
singing santa music or she should be

3909
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:29,600
singing santa music

3910
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:31,600
because that's what the notes say um if

3911
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:33,359
i've got that wrong then

3912
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:34,880
i'll sing sound music and see what

3913
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:36,160
happens

3914
02:21:36,160 --> 02:21:37,359
um

3915
02:21:37,359 --> 02:21:40,240
yes i don't know uh if that's a good

3916
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:41,840
thing or a bad thing but we will see him

3917
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:43,600
make that happen so

3918
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:43,990
um

02:21:43,990 --> 02:21:45,120
[Music]

3920
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:47,520
everyone go have a break and we will see

3921
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:50,319
you in 35 minutes

3922
02:21:50,319 --> 02:21:52,160
yeah so back at we'll be back on at

3923
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:56,319
about 2 50 yeah 250 2550 yeah

3998
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:21,840

it

4004
02:42:10,550 --> 02:42:13,660
[Music]

4005
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:20,600
so

4006
02:43:26,720 --> 02:43:29,720
do

4007
02:45:11,120 --> 02:45:14,120
do

4008
02:47:02,560 --> 02:47:05,560
do

4009
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:15,560
do

[Music]

4014
02:53:01,760 --> 02:53:04,479
so apparently there's been a bit of um

4015
02:53:04,479 --> 02:53:06,240
an argument about

4016
02:53:06,240 --> 02:53:08,479
uh

4017
02:53:08,479 --> 02:53:10,640
attendees versus monkeys and the kind of

4018
02:53:10,640 --> 02:53:12,880
meat in them and although shanna is not

4019
02:53:12,880 --> 02:53:14,160
back

4020
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:15,920
i'll add her to the stream so when she

4021
02:53:15,920 --> 02:53:17,760
does oh no she is here

4022
02:53:17,760 --> 02:53:19,359
you're you're on you're you're on mute

4023
02:53:19,359 --> 02:53:21,439
shanna

4024
02:53:21,439 --> 02:53:22,560
jamba

4025
02:53:22,560 --> 02:53:25,120
there was a bit of a a bit confusion or

4026
02:53:25,120 --> 02:53:27,120
an argument um i believe your your

4027
02:53:27,120 --> 02:53:28,720
statement was that 10 knees are made of

4028
02:53:28,720 --> 02:53:30,479
thigh meat

4029
02:53:30,479 --> 02:53:32,720
no i said they can be

4030
02:53:32,720 --> 02:53:34,640
i use chicken breast

4031
02:53:34,640 --> 02:53:36,240
yes well that's what the argument was

4032
02:53:36,240 --> 02:53:38,800
apparently it's it's more likely to have

4033
02:53:38,800 --> 02:53:40,880
chicken breasts than thymi and thymi is

4034
02:53:40,880 --> 02:53:44,479
also dark meats not light meat

4035
02:53:45,120 --> 02:53:47,840
don't believe that

4036
02:53:47,840 --> 02:53:48,800
well

4037
02:53:48,800 --> 02:53:50,960
that's that's what they're

4038
02:53:50,960 --> 02:53:52,240
say the saying

4039
02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:54,399
is a specific part of the chicken breast

4040
02:53:54,399 --> 02:53:57,279
is it yes my girlfriend used to work at

4041
02:53:57,279 --> 02:54:01,600
a chicken butcher planets ah

4042
02:54:01,600 --> 02:54:04,240
so the tender is a thing

4043
02:54:04,240 --> 02:54:05,920
yeah because you can buy chicken tenders

4044
02:54:05,920 --> 02:54:08,080
i use um

4045
02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:09,680
chicken thighs sometimes just because

4046
02:54:09,680 --> 02:54:10,880
they are

4047
02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:12,800
less likely to dry out

4048
02:54:12,800 --> 02:54:14,160
that is true i

4049
02:54:14,160 --> 02:54:16,080
my mom cooks certain things with chicken

4050
02:54:16,080 --> 02:54:17,680
thighs because of the fat in the chicken

4051
02:54:17,680 --> 02:54:18,560
thighs

4052
02:54:18,560 --> 02:54:19,920
rather than the chicken when have we

4053
02:54:19,920 --> 02:54:22,000
become a cooking

4054
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,880
thing instead of a cyber security thing

4055
02:54:24,880 --> 02:54:27,600
well i i don't know

4056
02:54:27,600 --> 02:54:29,279
oh you started

4057
02:54:29,279 --> 02:54:30,720
oh what's oh

4058
02:54:30,720 --> 02:54:32,160
that's very cute

4059
02:54:32,160 --> 02:54:34,080
i am i started filming because chicken

4060
02:54:34,080 --> 02:54:36,560
tenders take a long time to cook so oh

4061
02:54:36,560 --> 02:54:38,640
well that's fine started the process

4062
02:54:38,640 --> 02:54:41,600
well i got a video on discord

4063
02:54:41,600 --> 02:54:43,520
oh did you i haven't seen it i will no

4064
02:54:43,520 --> 02:54:45,680
no it's pretty well okay yep it's

4065
02:54:45,680 --> 02:54:48,160
processing okay well how about we get

4066
02:54:48,160 --> 02:54:50,160
started with our next speaker then uh

4067
02:54:50,160 --> 02:54:51,920
while we wait for 10 needs to cook and

4068
02:54:51,920 --> 02:54:54,399
we've had pizza and

4069
02:54:54,399 --> 02:54:55,920
zero and rose have tried to eat the

4070
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:57,120
pizza

4071
02:54:57,120 --> 02:54:58,720
and then now bug it off again they don't

4072
02:54:58,720 --> 02:55:00,000
like the door is open but they don't

4073
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,640
want to spend time in here so um

4074
02:55:02,640 --> 02:55:04,560
our next speaker is tracy how are you

4075
02:55:04,560 --> 02:55:06,080
doing today tracy

4076
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:08,240
hey guys how are you

4077
02:55:08,240 --> 02:55:10,640
fantastic thank you uh tracy do you have

4078
02:55:10,640 --> 02:55:12,640
a particular opinion on nuggies versus

4079
02:55:12,640 --> 02:55:14,479
tenders

4080
02:55:14,479 --> 02:55:17,840
i actually started off with nuggies and

4081
02:55:17,840 --> 02:55:19,359
then now that i've heard about the

4082
02:55:19,359 --> 02:55:22,479
assignment i may have to switch once

4083
02:55:22,479 --> 02:55:24,479
i've had a chance to try then the 10

4084
02:55:24,479 --> 02:55:25,600
years again

4085
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:26,960
of course

4086
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:29,040
firmly on the fence we encourage

4087
02:55:29,040 --> 02:55:30,880
scientific exploration as someone with a

4088
02:55:30,880 --> 02:55:33,439
phd would obviously be very into as well

4089
02:55:33,439 --> 02:55:35,840
so we encourage everyone to go try their

4090
02:55:35,840 --> 02:55:37,600
10 these nuggies and then choose 10 d's

4091
02:55:37,600 --> 02:55:39,439
because they're the correct answer

4092
02:55:39,439 --> 02:55:42,000
um but tracy's going to be talking to us

4093
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,080
today about how do you solve a cyber

4094
02:55:44,080 --> 02:55:46,080
problem like small business i do have to

4095
02:55:46,080 --> 02:55:47,680
ask is there going to be singing of

4096
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:49,279
sound of music in this or was that just

4097
02:55:49,279 --> 02:55:51,760
a reference

4098
02:55:52,319 --> 02:55:53,920
i was going to say it during my thing

4099
02:55:53,920 --> 02:55:55,359
but no there will be no singing i

4100
02:55:55,359 --> 02:55:58,240
usually reserve that

4101
02:55:58,240 --> 02:56:00,399
technique i don't do it normally to

4102
02:56:00,399 --> 02:56:02,800
people i like okay well maybe i'll sing

4103
02:56:02,800 --> 02:56:04,800
later we'll see what happens

4104
02:56:04,800 --> 02:56:06,399
uh but tracy

4105
02:56:06,399 --> 02:56:08,560
um graduated with an engineering degree

4106
02:56:08,560 --> 02:56:10,960
and works in it for a decade and now it

4107
02:56:10,960 --> 02:56:13,040
runs her own small business so um the

4108
02:56:13,040 --> 02:56:14,880
presentation she's going to give today

4109
02:56:14,880 --> 02:56:16,479
is about her lessons and how you can

4110
02:56:16,479 --> 02:56:18,960
apply cyber security to small business

4111
02:56:18,960 --> 02:56:21,040
so i will add your presentation to the

4112
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:23,920
screen and take it away tracy

4113
02:56:23,920 --> 02:56:26,000
all right well thank you ian thank you

4114
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:27,920
shana for having me for giving me a

4115
02:56:27,920 --> 02:56:30,240
soapbox for the next 20 minutes to talk

4116
02:56:30,240 --> 02:56:31,920
about something that's very close to my

4117
02:56:31,920 --> 02:56:34,319
heart now as i was saying before no

4118
02:56:34,319 --> 02:56:36,080
there'll be no singing because i do all

4119
02:56:36,080 --> 02:56:37,600
love you all too much

4120
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:39,600
although i do highly recommend the sound

4121
02:56:39,600 --> 02:56:42,720
of music if you are looking for some

4122
02:56:42,720 --> 02:56:46,319
netflix and chill kind of um material

4123
02:56:46,319 --> 02:56:48,560
so

4124
02:56:49,840 --> 02:56:51,760
um today we'll be looking at small

4125
02:56:51,760 --> 02:56:54,160
business cybersecurity and just like the

4126
02:56:54,160 --> 02:56:56,560
rebel maria in the sound of music show

4127
02:56:56,560 --> 02:56:58,960
it's a complicated problem where the

4128
02:56:58,960 --> 02:57:01,120
solutions still have we haven't still

4129
02:57:01,120 --> 02:57:03,439
got our grasp around the solution yet

4130
02:57:03,439 --> 02:57:05,600
now to focus our discussion today we'll

4131
02:57:05,600 --> 02:57:07,920
focus on australian small businesses

4132
02:57:07,920 --> 02:57:10,240
however in the process we'll also look

4133
02:57:10,240 --> 02:57:12,160
to lessons that we've learned from

4134
02:57:12,160 --> 02:57:13,840
around the world

4135
02:57:13,840 --> 02:57:15,920
we'll take a look at what the stats tell

4136
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:17,840
us about small businesses

4137
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:20,000
in particular the current cyber security

4138
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:21,920
problem from a very non-technical point

4139
02:57:21,920 --> 02:57:23,120
of view

4140
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:24,960
and then we'll explore why this problem

4141
02:57:24,960 --> 02:57:26,880
may be happening in particular what

4142
02:57:26,880 --> 02:57:28,399
makes cyber security a slightly

4143
02:57:28,399 --> 02:57:30,560
different beast for small business when

4144
02:57:30,560 --> 02:57:33,040
compared to a larger businesses

4145
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:35,200
and finally we'll discuss a couple of

4146
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:36,880
things that we believe we can help with

4147
02:57:36,880 --> 02:57:39,600
some of these pain points

4148
02:57:39,600 --> 02:57:41,040
now

4149
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:42,800
a little bit about myself

4150
02:57:42,800 --> 02:57:43,760
um

4151
02:57:43,760 --> 02:57:46,000
nearly as ian said i worked at a large

4152
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:47,439
telco

4153
02:57:47,439 --> 02:57:48,319
but i

4154
02:57:48,319 --> 02:57:50,000
worked on things that we ultimately end

4155
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
up with a lot of our mobile phones today

4156
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:53,600
i actually got the privilege to actually

4157
02:57:53,600 --> 02:57:57,040
make apps and sites run on well what was

4158
02:57:57,040 --> 02:57:59,680
large screens back then um but it's

4159
02:57:59,680 --> 02:58:01,359
probably small fries compared to what we

4160
02:58:01,359 --> 02:58:03,840
have try and fit in our pocket today i

4161
02:58:03,840 --> 02:58:06,640
do miss the fact that we can't fit our

4162
02:58:06,640 --> 02:58:08,479
phones in our pocket anymore

4163
02:58:08,479 --> 02:58:10,720
now through that experience that we've

4164
02:58:10,720 --> 02:58:12,720
learned many hard and sometimes funny

4165
02:58:12,720 --> 02:58:13,840
lessons

4166
02:58:13,840 --> 02:58:16,479
and about releasing new technologies

4167
02:58:16,479 --> 02:58:18,399
into the wild itself

4168
02:58:18,399 --> 02:58:21,040
but after decade in the trenches i left

4169
02:58:21,040 --> 02:58:22,960
to start my own small business

4170
02:58:22,960 --> 02:58:25,520
turning my passion into my day job

4171
02:58:25,520 --> 02:58:28,000
so finally today after so much

4172
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
encouragement and help from the various

4173
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:31,840
cyber security researchers and industry

4174
02:58:31,840 --> 02:58:33,760
people and some of you are here today

4175
02:58:33,760 --> 02:58:35,040
thank you

4176
02:58:35,040 --> 02:58:37,040
i ended up at rmit university

4177
02:58:37,040 --> 02:58:38,880
researching how we can actually help

4178
02:58:38,880 --> 02:58:41,920
with the thorny problem of making cyber

4179
02:58:41,920 --> 02:58:43,359
security

4180
02:58:43,359 --> 02:58:45,279
possible for small businesses

4181
02:58:45,279 --> 02:58:46,960
so today

4182
02:58:46,960 --> 02:58:48,640
you're going to get a mixture of some of

4183
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:50,399
my research as well as my own personal

4184
02:58:50,399 --> 02:58:52,080
experience on small business cyber

4185
02:58:52,080 --> 02:58:53,120
security

4186
02:58:53,120 --> 02:58:54,880
i'll touch on why it is not a simple

4187
02:58:54,880 --> 02:58:57,359
case of throwing resources at it the

4188
02:58:57,359 --> 02:58:59,359
good news is we can actually all help in

4189
02:58:59,359 --> 02:59:01,840
small ways to make the journey easier as

4190
02:59:01,840 --> 02:59:02,640
well

4191
02:59:02,640 --> 02:59:04,960
now if you've been to cybercon last year

4192
02:59:04,960 --> 02:59:06,800
some of this information may ring a bell

4193
02:59:06,800 --> 02:59:09,040
from a talk from one of my research

4194
02:59:09,040 --> 02:59:11,359
papers there as well

4195
02:59:11,359 --> 02:59:12,479
now

4196
02:59:12,479 --> 02:59:14,160
a small business is defined slightly

4197
02:59:14,160 --> 02:59:16,080
differently across the western world

4198
02:59:16,080 --> 02:59:18,240
however in australia small business is

4199
02:59:18,240 --> 02:59:20,240
usually defined as any businesses that

4200
02:59:20,240 --> 02:59:22,399
has 0 to 90 employees

4201
02:59:22,399 --> 02:59:24,640
now you may have noticed that strange

4202
02:59:24,640 --> 02:59:26,880
thing about xero employees

4203
02:59:26,880 --> 02:59:28,720
no they are not business fully run by

4204
02:59:28,720 --> 02:59:31,279
robots we're not there yet but rather

4205
02:59:31,279 --> 02:59:32,880
businesses that only consist of the

4206
02:59:32,880 --> 02:59:35,279
owners or the partners themselves so as

4207
02:59:35,279 --> 02:59:37,600
an example my business will fall into

4208
02:59:37,600 --> 02:59:39,920
that category as most of the time i

4209
02:59:39,920 --> 02:59:43,200
didn't have any employees working for me

4210
02:59:43,200 --> 02:59:45,279
and as at the end of the financial year

4211
02:59:45,279 --> 02:59:47,040
last year there are over 2 million

4212
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:49,040
australian small businesses now the

4213
02:59:49,040 --> 02:59:50,960
majority of this business are ones that

4214
02:59:50,960 --> 02:59:53,600
only consist of the owners

4215
02:59:53,600 --> 02:59:55,680
statistics aside though the role of the

4216
02:59:55,680 --> 02:59:57,520
small business in our lives you probably

4217
02:59:57,520 --> 03:00:00,000
can see through your local cafe

4218
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
your maybe your personal trainer dog

4219
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:03,920
walkers if you've got a dog and many

4220
03:00:03,920 --> 03:00:06,800
more as well now the chances that we all

4221
03:00:06,800 --> 03:00:09,040
know or know of someone that works in a

4222
03:00:09,040 --> 03:00:10,399
small business

4223
03:00:10,399 --> 03:00:12,640
because small business actually provide

4224
03:00:12,640 --> 03:00:14,800
40 of the private sector employment in

4225
03:00:14,800 --> 03:00:16,160
australia

4226
03:00:16,160 --> 03:00:17,279
now

4227
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:20,399
in australia only 14 of all businesses

4228
03:00:20,399 --> 03:00:21,920
are actually related to fields that

4229
03:00:21,920 --> 03:00:24,319
requires a background technology

4230
03:00:24,319 --> 03:00:26,319
then this is important point for us to

4231
03:00:26,319 --> 03:00:28,479
remember as we're going through today

4232
03:00:28,479 --> 03:00:31,920
that most businesses in australia do not

4233
03:00:31,920 --> 03:00:34,319
require any tech savvy in the day-to-day

4234
03:00:34,319 --> 03:00:36,720
business

4235
03:00:36,960 --> 03:00:37,760
so

4236
03:00:37,760 --> 03:00:39,120
the good news

4237
03:00:39,120 --> 03:00:41,439
is small businesses are aware of the

4238
03:00:41,439 --> 03:00:43,279
importance of cyber security

4239
03:00:43,279 --> 03:00:45,439
the australian cyber security center has

4240
03:00:45,439 --> 03:00:48,319
found that 80 of the survey businesses

4241
03:00:48,319 --> 03:00:50,640
in sme group actually rate cyber

4242
03:00:50,640 --> 03:00:52,160
securities as important or very

4243
03:00:52,160 --> 03:00:53,359
important

4244
03:00:53,359 --> 03:00:56,240
now this may seem surprising at first

4245
03:00:56,240 --> 03:00:58,240
but there are actually many personal

4246
03:00:58,240 --> 03:00:59,840
reasons behind someone's decision to

4247
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:01,200
start a small business

4248
03:01:01,200 --> 03:01:02,960
some of the business owners that i

4249
03:01:02,960 --> 03:01:05,200
actually know in my travels started

4250
03:01:05,200 --> 03:01:07,040
their business to balance their

4251
03:01:07,040 --> 03:01:08,960
responsibility as a single parent or

4252
03:01:08,960 --> 03:01:09,920
carer

4253
03:01:09,920 --> 03:01:12,560
a career change or a chance with someone

4254
03:01:12,560 --> 03:01:15,120
whose skills are so specialized it means

4255
03:01:15,120 --> 03:01:16,880
that self-employment was really the only

4256
03:01:16,880 --> 03:01:18,560
option for them

4257
03:01:18,560 --> 03:01:21,200
now despite the various reasons the one

4258
03:01:21,200 --> 03:01:23,279
thing that they all care about is the

4259
03:01:23,279 --> 03:01:25,279
survival of their business

4260
03:01:25,279 --> 03:01:27,359
now the acsc result shows that this

4261
03:01:27,359 --> 03:01:30,080
extends to cyber security as um as well

4262
03:01:30,080 --> 03:01:32,840
knowing that they need to care about it

4263
03:01:32,840 --> 03:01:35,760
however only three of the essential

4264
03:01:35,760 --> 03:01:37,760
eight controls were implemented by more

4265
03:01:37,760 --> 03:01:40,000
than half of the businesses

4266
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,319
now to understand a bit more why there

4267
03:01:42,319 --> 03:01:44,160
may be a gap between the awareness and

4268
03:01:44,160 --> 03:01:45,200
the action

4269
03:01:45,200 --> 03:01:47,439
we're going to take a look at scotland

4270
03:01:47,439 --> 03:01:49,359
now in a study of scottish small and

4271
03:01:49,359 --> 03:01:51,040
medium businesses

4272
03:01:51,040 --> 03:01:52,880
which is slightly larger definition to

4273
03:01:52,880 --> 03:01:55,760
up to 250 employees so technical

4274
03:01:55,760 --> 03:01:57,920
businesses with a few more hands on hand

4275
03:01:57,920 --> 03:02:00,560
today are sorry few more hands on deck

4276
03:02:00,560 --> 03:02:03,520
to help them a very non-technical issue

4277
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:05,279
was highlighted

4278
03:02:05,279 --> 03:02:08,479
in behavioral science this is called an

4279
03:02:08,479 --> 03:02:10,640
intention behavior gap

4280
03:02:10,640 --> 03:02:13,040
where a person has an intention to do

4281
03:02:13,040 --> 03:02:14,000
something

4282
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,080
and know logically they should do it but

4283
03:02:16,080 --> 03:02:18,000
they don't actually action the intention

4284
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:19,200
itself

4285
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:21,120
now you may have experienced an

4286
03:02:21,120 --> 03:02:23,200
intention behavior gap yourself

4287
03:02:23,200 --> 03:02:25,680
when you had full intention to organize

4288
03:02:25,680 --> 03:02:27,840
a long overdue catch up with some

4289
03:02:27,840 --> 03:02:29,200
friends as part of your new year

4290
03:02:29,200 --> 03:02:30,640
resolution

4291
03:02:30,640 --> 03:02:32,479
but come on to the end of the year it

4292
03:02:32,479 --> 03:02:35,600
just never worked out

4293
03:02:35,600 --> 03:02:37,760
now to know how this intention behavior

4294
03:02:37,760 --> 03:02:39,520
gap can happen for cyber security in a

4295
03:02:39,520 --> 03:02:40,720
small business

4296
03:02:40,720 --> 03:02:42,399
let's take a look at one of my typical

4297
03:02:42,399 --> 03:02:45,680
small business days now this is me at

4298
03:02:45,680 --> 03:02:47,760
the start of a typical day

4299
03:02:47,760 --> 03:02:49,359
it could be you know receiving a new

4300
03:02:49,359 --> 03:02:52,479
custom inquiry so yay new cakes

4301
03:02:52,479 --> 03:02:54,800
i'll actually get to do some baking

4302
03:02:54,800 --> 03:02:57,520
then this is me when i look at my to-do

4303
03:02:57,520 --> 03:03:00,560
list or a client goes you know what i

4304
03:03:00,560 --> 03:03:02,880
really want that change on that cake

4305
03:03:02,880 --> 03:03:04,319
tomorrow

4306
03:03:04,319 --> 03:03:06,000
now over the course of the day these two

4307
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,479
states can flip for multiple times

4308
03:03:08,479 --> 03:03:10,880
and usually at night is when i finally

4309
03:03:10,880 --> 03:03:12,160
get a chance to catch up on the

4310
03:03:12,160 --> 03:03:14,479
paperwork and administration things

4311
03:03:14,479 --> 03:03:16,640
which of course i have cyber security

4312
03:03:16,640 --> 03:03:18,720
that my customers actually don't see or

4313
03:03:18,720 --> 03:03:21,760
sometimes care about

4314
03:03:22,880 --> 03:03:25,040
so

4315
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:27,279
to show you how many things a small

4316
03:03:27,279 --> 03:03:29,520
business owner must constantly juggle in

4317
03:03:29,520 --> 03:03:30,640
the air

4318
03:03:30,640 --> 03:03:33,200
i have here a common checklist that many

4319
03:03:33,200 --> 03:03:35,439
new businesses get sent to from the

4320
03:03:35,439 --> 03:03:37,120
australian government

4321
03:03:37,120 --> 03:03:39,680
it captures all the high level owner a

4322
03:03:39,680 --> 03:03:41,439
high level area that the owners should

4323
03:03:41,439 --> 03:03:43,600
know about and actively manage and each

4324
03:03:43,600 --> 03:03:45,120
of these white squares that you see

4325
03:03:45,120 --> 03:03:45,920
there

4326
03:03:45,920 --> 03:03:48,240
is actually represent more many more

4327
03:03:48,240 --> 03:03:51,359
hours of research decision and actions

4328
03:03:51,359 --> 03:03:53,680
now for many of these they're not just

4329
03:03:53,680 --> 03:03:55,040
one time item either you can't just

4330
03:03:55,040 --> 03:03:57,120
stick them off and go yep i'm done

4331
03:03:57,120 --> 03:04:00,319
and most maintained and reviewed to

4332
03:04:00,319 --> 03:04:01,920
actually keep the business running

4333
03:04:01,920 --> 03:04:04,399
itself

4334
03:04:06,160 --> 03:04:09,840
just let it run to the end

4335
03:04:10,319 --> 03:04:12,640
and it just keeps going and going and

4336
03:04:12,640 --> 03:04:15,039
going

4337
03:04:16,880 --> 03:04:19,359
now to say we run off our feet is

4338
03:04:19,359 --> 03:04:20,240
probably a little bit of an

4339
03:04:20,240 --> 03:04:22,080
understatement remember those small

4340
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:23,120
businesses that we were talking about

4341
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:25,120
before that do not have any employees

4342
03:04:25,120 --> 03:04:26,960
it is basically essentially the business

4343
03:04:26,960 --> 03:04:28,479
owner trying to manage all of this

4344
03:04:28,479 --> 03:04:30,000
themselves

4345
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,560
research have actually identified that

4346
03:04:32,560 --> 03:04:34,880
being busy or time constrained is the

4347
03:04:34,880 --> 03:04:37,359
factor to falling victim to phishing

4348
03:04:37,359 --> 03:04:39,920
so we small business owners are already

4349
03:04:39,920 --> 03:04:43,120
at a different disadvantage

4350
03:04:43,120 --> 03:04:44,960
now this is not helped by the fact that

4351
03:04:44,960 --> 03:04:46,560
small businesses have to deal with

4352
03:04:46,560 --> 03:04:48,720
communications for many people some

4353
03:04:48,720 --> 03:04:50,880
sometimes complete strangers

4354
03:04:50,880 --> 03:04:52,880
we do not have the luxury of not picking

4355
03:04:52,880 --> 03:04:54,560
up on an unknown number because they may

4356
03:04:54,560 --> 03:04:56,960
jeopardize the same and this risk is

4357
03:04:56,960 --> 03:04:58,399
further compounded by just the sheer

4358
03:04:58,399 --> 03:04:59,920
number of people we have to deal with on

4359
03:04:59,920 --> 03:05:02,720
a day-to-day basis

4360
03:05:02,720 --> 03:05:04,720
also as a small business owner you must

4361
03:05:04,720 --> 03:05:06,240
make a priority call on where you're

4362
03:05:06,240 --> 03:05:08,240
going to spend your energy on x now

4363
03:05:08,240 --> 03:05:09,600
should i spend it on working on an ad

4364
03:05:09,600 --> 03:05:11,840
campaign that will bring in customers or

4365
03:05:11,840 --> 03:05:14,399
should i try and read and understand

4366
03:05:14,399 --> 03:05:16,399
that security standard that somebody

4367
03:05:16,399 --> 03:05:17,600
sent me

4368
03:05:17,600 --> 03:05:20,319
now this particular one is even trickier

4369
03:05:20,319 --> 03:05:23,040
for the fact that acsc actually found

4370
03:05:23,040 --> 03:05:25,680
that most of the small businesses prefer

4371
03:05:25,680 --> 03:05:28,080
to diy approach when it comes to iot

4372
03:05:28,080 --> 03:05:29,680
security management

4373
03:05:29,680 --> 03:05:30,479
so

4374
03:05:30,479 --> 03:05:33,040
given the small proportion of technical

4375
03:05:33,040 --> 03:05:34,160
industries that we were talking about

4376
03:05:34,160 --> 03:05:36,160
before the 14

4377
03:05:36,160 --> 03:05:39,200
this translates to a lot of novices

4378
03:05:39,200 --> 03:05:40,880
basically just trying to make do with

4379
03:05:40,880 --> 03:05:42,720
security the best they can with what

4380
03:05:42,720 --> 03:05:44,800
they know

4381
03:05:44,800 --> 03:05:46,800
and in addition small businesses are

4382
03:05:46,800 --> 03:05:48,880
notorious for operating on very tight

4383
03:05:48,880 --> 03:05:49,920
margins

4384
03:05:49,920 --> 03:05:53,200
in 2018 the median um turnover

4385
03:05:53,200 --> 03:05:56,240
australian small businesses of 118 000

4386
03:05:56,240 --> 03:05:57,840
australian dollars

4387
03:05:57,840 --> 03:06:00,720
only produce a net income of thirteen

4388
03:06:00,720 --> 03:06:02,080
thousand dollars

4389
03:06:02,080 --> 03:06:03,279
now

4390
03:06:03,279 --> 03:06:05,600
whilst cyber security is not a revenue

4391
03:06:05,600 --> 03:06:08,319
generating spend or cost cutting item

4392
03:06:08,319 --> 03:06:09,840
you'll always be less attractive

4393
03:06:09,840 --> 03:06:11,200
compared to things that can bring in

4394
03:06:11,200 --> 03:06:15,359
customers and bring in revenue

4395
03:06:15,359 --> 03:06:18,399
so given that there are lots of existing

4396
03:06:18,399 --> 03:06:19,920
enterprise cyber security products out

4397
03:06:19,920 --> 03:06:21,040
there

4398
03:06:21,040 --> 03:06:22,640
why don't we just deliver a whole lot of

4399
03:06:22,640 --> 03:06:24,640
free cyber security hardware and

4400
03:06:24,640 --> 03:06:26,880
software to small businesses to solve it

4401
03:06:26,880 --> 03:06:29,120
right well

4402
03:06:29,120 --> 03:06:31,600
the answer is yes and no

4403
03:06:31,600 --> 03:06:33,200
whilst the free product will actually

4404
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:35,680
solve the resource constraint problem

4405
03:06:35,680 --> 03:06:38,000
let's take a look behind the curtain at

4406
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:39,680
the architecture that many small

4407
03:06:39,680 --> 03:06:43,439
businesses have to operate with

4408
03:06:43,439 --> 03:06:45,200
many of us who work in enterprise will

4409
03:06:45,200 --> 03:06:46,720
be familiar with an architecture that

4410
03:06:46,720 --> 03:06:47,840
looks like this

4411
03:06:47,840 --> 03:06:50,399
now whether it be physical or virtual

4412
03:06:50,399 --> 03:06:52,399
the reality is that small business

4413
03:06:52,399 --> 03:06:54,560
especially at the micro and no employee

4414
03:06:54,560 --> 03:06:55,520
level

4415
03:06:55,520 --> 03:06:58,800
actually looks more like this

4416
03:06:58,800 --> 03:07:00,479
this architecture actually was found

4417
03:07:00,479 --> 03:07:02,560
during a case study of uk small business

4418
03:07:02,560 --> 03:07:04,880
it architectures

4419
03:07:04,880 --> 03:07:07,359
and from my own experience even if my

4420
03:07:07,359 --> 03:07:09,279
small business were given a whole lot of

4421
03:07:09,279 --> 03:07:11,920
free security appliances

4422
03:07:11,920 --> 03:07:13,520
i would have trouble trying to find the

4423
03:07:13,520 --> 03:07:15,600
physical or the virtual room to fit them

4424
03:07:15,600 --> 03:07:16,880
all

4425
03:07:16,880 --> 03:07:19,680
now another interesting to note

4426
03:07:19,680 --> 03:07:22,160
about this is that it's a single

4427
03:07:22,160 --> 03:07:24,560
environment architecture there is

4428
03:07:24,560 --> 03:07:28,080
actually no second or safe environment

4429
03:07:28,080 --> 03:07:31,600
to test out any changes or new software

4430
03:07:31,600 --> 03:07:32,399
so

4431
03:07:32,399 --> 03:07:34,479
any changes or update will certainly

4432
03:07:34,479 --> 03:07:36,319
involve impact to the live customer

4433
03:07:36,319 --> 03:07:39,359
phasing systems so that leaves a small

4434
03:07:39,359 --> 03:07:41,600
business owner to weigh up hmm

4435
03:07:41,600 --> 03:07:44,080
is the potential downtime worth it for

4436
03:07:44,080 --> 03:07:46,160
the security update

4437
03:07:46,160 --> 03:07:48,080
or changes that they've been told they

4438
03:07:48,080 --> 03:07:50,640
need to do

4439
03:07:51,520 --> 03:07:52,399
so

4440
03:07:52,399 --> 03:07:54,720
how do we tackle a problem that's got

4441
03:07:54,720 --> 03:07:56,880
more other considerations

4442
03:07:56,880 --> 03:07:59,359
than choosing where to live

4443
03:07:59,359 --> 03:08:01,439
now the good news is that we believe

4444
03:08:01,439 --> 03:08:03,359
that there are small changes that can be

4445
03:08:03,359 --> 03:08:05,920
done to actually improve the situation

4446
03:08:05,920 --> 03:08:08,000
it won't solve at all in one go so we're

4447
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:09,600
not preaching

4448
03:08:09,600 --> 03:08:12,640
a one single solution approach

4449
03:08:12,640 --> 03:08:14,240
we have found

4450
03:08:14,240 --> 03:08:16,399
that research has found that digital

4451
03:08:16,399 --> 03:08:18,560
literacy do actually improve with

4452
03:08:18,560 --> 03:08:21,840
hands-on experience so providing small

4453
03:08:21,840 --> 03:08:23,920
business hands-on experience with cyber

4454
03:08:23,920 --> 03:08:25,760
security will actually help them become

4455
03:08:25,760 --> 03:08:29,200
more self-sufficient over the long term

4456
03:08:29,200 --> 03:08:31,840
so to encourage this hands-on experience

4457
03:08:31,840 --> 03:08:34,080
actually get them to give it a go we

4458
03:08:34,080 --> 03:08:35,760
turn to psychology of protection

4459
03:08:35,760 --> 03:08:37,359
motivation theory

4460
03:08:37,359 --> 03:08:40,160
now pmt describes the factors that helps

4461
03:08:40,160 --> 03:08:43,520
translate that intention of

4462
03:08:43,520 --> 03:08:45,200
protecting their business

4463
03:08:45,200 --> 03:08:47,359
to into action

4464
03:08:47,359 --> 03:08:49,840
of implementing the security control

4465
03:08:49,840 --> 03:08:52,399
and in order for action to happen

4466
03:08:52,399 --> 03:08:54,479
not only do they have to know about and

4467
03:08:54,479 --> 03:08:56,000
believe the threat

4468
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:58,560
a person must believe that they can

4469
03:08:58,560 --> 03:09:00,840
actually deal with the problem

4470
03:09:00,840 --> 03:09:03,040
themselves this belief is called

4471
03:09:03,040 --> 03:09:05,359
self-efficacy

4472
03:09:05,359 --> 03:09:08,240
so for example for us to protect

4473
03:09:08,240 --> 03:09:10,479
against skin cancer in australia

4474
03:09:10,479 --> 03:09:12,319
we are not just taught at school about

4475
03:09:12,319 --> 03:09:14,880
the threat of the sun or the uv rays we

4476
03:09:14,880 --> 03:09:16,399
are actually taught how

4477
03:09:16,399 --> 03:09:19,200
that using commonly available tools like

4478
03:09:19,200 --> 03:09:21,600
hats and sunscreen will actually

4479
03:09:21,600 --> 03:09:26,080
effectively reduce the harm on our skin

4480
03:09:26,080 --> 03:09:27,840
thanks to the great awareness of

4481
03:09:27,840 --> 03:09:30,239
everyone involved in cyber security we

4482
03:09:30,239 --> 03:09:32,640
know through the acsc survey result that

4483
03:09:32,640 --> 03:09:35,200
cyber security's importance is being

4484
03:09:35,200 --> 03:09:36,880
recognized and it is

4485
03:09:36,880 --> 03:09:39,760
at the forefront of people's mind

4486
03:09:39,760 --> 03:09:41,439
however what we are missing at the

4487
03:09:41,439 --> 03:09:44,640
moment is that self-efficacy part

4488
03:09:44,640 --> 03:09:46,640
look to be frank without professional

4489
03:09:46,640 --> 03:09:49,520
help cyber security today for an office

4490
03:09:49,520 --> 03:09:51,760
is not straightforward even if they were

4491
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:53,760
willing to give it a go

4492
03:09:53,760 --> 03:09:56,000
so this is to address this particular

4493
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:57,200
issue

4494
03:09:57,200 --> 03:09:59,439
we need construct tools that can both be

4495
03:09:59,439 --> 03:10:02,080
easily understood and used by small

4496
03:10:02,080 --> 03:10:03,920
businesses

4497
03:10:03,920 --> 03:10:06,560
now one avenue we are looking into is

4498
03:10:06,560 --> 03:10:08,720
basically a relationship between the

4499
03:10:08,720 --> 03:10:11,200
open source and small business community

4500
03:10:11,200 --> 03:10:13,200
the reality is

4501
03:10:13,200 --> 03:10:15,760
being resource constrained i not having

4502
03:10:15,760 --> 03:10:18,080
much money within small business

4503
03:10:18,080 --> 03:10:20,640
that's not going to go away anytime soon

4504
03:10:20,640 --> 03:10:24,000
and to show that in acsc survey almost

4505
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:27,840
50 of the businesses spent less than 500

4506
03:10:27,840 --> 03:10:29,920
australian dollars on cyber security in

4507
03:10:29,920 --> 03:10:33,040
the in the previous year

4508
03:10:33,040 --> 03:10:36,080
so free or almost free products will

4509
03:10:36,080 --> 03:10:38,000
have a role in to play in a small

4510
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:39,600
business security

4511
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:41,200
toolbelt

4512
03:10:41,200 --> 03:10:43,279
at a high level the characteristics that

4513
03:10:43,279 --> 03:10:45,040
we're looking for at the moment are

4514
03:10:45,040 --> 03:10:46,880
projects that are easy to use for the

4515
03:10:46,880 --> 03:10:49,600
non-technical small business workers

4516
03:10:49,600 --> 03:10:51,279
but also taking inspiration from

4517
03:10:51,279 --> 03:10:53,359
singapore's cyber security labeling

4518
03:10:53,359 --> 03:10:55,359
scheme and e-safety commissioner's

4519
03:10:55,359 --> 03:10:57,279
safety by design principles

4520
03:10:57,279 --> 03:10:59,600
we're also looking for characteristics

4521
03:10:59,600 --> 03:11:01,760
like secure default settings as well as

4522
03:11:01,760 --> 03:11:04,239
ongoing security life cycles

4523
03:11:04,239 --> 03:11:06,160
now the opportunity here is for the two

4524
03:11:06,160 --> 03:11:08,479
communities to work together

4525
03:11:08,479 --> 03:11:10,479
in the short term small businesses can

4526
03:11:10,479 --> 03:11:12,399
provide a large pool of active users

4527
03:11:12,399 --> 03:11:14,880
that can test and give real life real

4528
03:11:14,880 --> 03:11:17,040
life real time feedback on the product

4529
03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:18,720
on the project

4530
03:11:18,720 --> 03:11:21,359
trust me with small business owners if

4531
03:11:21,359 --> 03:11:22,640
they find something that's not working

4532
03:11:22,640 --> 03:11:24,479
they will tell you

4533
03:11:24,479 --> 03:11:26,479
now there are also longer term benefits

4534
03:11:26,479 --> 03:11:28,960
or projects that are usable by

4535
03:11:28,960 --> 03:11:31,920
wider business audiences past projects

4536
03:11:31,920 --> 03:11:34,080
such as like mysql

4537
03:11:34,080 --> 03:11:36,080
and various distribution of linux is a

4538
03:11:36,080 --> 03:11:40,239
very good example of this benefit

4539
03:11:40,720 --> 03:11:42,880
at the end of the day we need a set of

4540
03:11:42,880 --> 03:11:44,479
cyber security tools that tailored to

4541
03:11:44,479 --> 03:11:46,399
the needs of small businesses

4542
03:11:46,399 --> 03:11:48,479
so just like the wide availability of

4543
03:11:48,479 --> 03:11:50,720
sunscreen helps us to protect ourselves

4544
03:11:50,720 --> 03:11:52,399
against skin cancer

4545
03:11:52,399 --> 03:11:54,080
long term key to cyber security i

4546
03:11:54,080 --> 03:11:56,080
believe is actually in making it

4547
03:11:56,080 --> 03:11:57,760
accessible and targeted for the small

4548
03:11:57,760 --> 03:11:59,520
business users

4549
03:11:59,520 --> 03:12:01,920
and just like any good it project to

4550
03:12:01,920 --> 03:12:03,920
construct your picture what is needed we

4551
03:12:03,920 --> 03:12:05,279
need to know what the small business

4552
03:12:05,279 --> 03:12:06,800
requirements are

4553
03:12:06,800 --> 03:12:08,720
and by understanding how it's being used

4554
03:12:08,720 --> 03:12:10,640
in a small business we can actually pick

4555
03:12:10,640 --> 03:12:13,040
what's most convenient and effective way

4556
03:12:13,040 --> 03:12:16,399
to deploy cyber security solutions

4557
03:12:16,399 --> 03:12:17,600
one of the things that actually

4558
03:12:17,600 --> 03:12:20,000
surprised me when i started on my phd

4559
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:21,920
was that in australia

4560
03:12:21,920 --> 03:12:24,319
how small businesses use it is actually

4561
03:12:24,319 --> 03:12:25,760
not a topic that's been widely

4562
03:12:25,760 --> 03:12:26,880
researched

4563
03:12:26,880 --> 03:12:29,040
we looked and we looked and we realized

4564
03:12:29,040 --> 03:12:30,840
we actually have to gather that data

4565
03:12:30,840 --> 03:12:32,720
ourselves so

4566
03:12:32,720 --> 03:12:34,319
to fill this gap we are actually

4567
03:12:34,319 --> 03:12:36,160
conducting a survey to better understand

4568
03:12:36,160 --> 03:12:37,920
the i.t setup in australian small

4569
03:12:37,920 --> 03:12:39,200
businesses

4570
03:12:39,200 --> 03:12:41,279
we want to understand

4571
03:12:41,279 --> 03:12:43,760
how much it is being used

4572
03:12:43,760 --> 03:12:47,200
how many of the itr actually been shared

4573
03:12:47,200 --> 03:12:49,600
and how important are they to the

4574
03:12:49,600 --> 03:12:50,720
business

4575
03:12:50,720 --> 03:12:52,960
so if you own or work in a small

4576
03:12:52,960 --> 03:12:55,600
business with an abn or acn and has less

4577
03:12:55,600 --> 03:12:57,200
than 20 employees

4578
03:12:57,200 --> 03:12:59,120
your knowledge can actually help us

4579
03:12:59,120 --> 03:13:01,040
inform the next generation of cyber

4580
03:13:01,040 --> 03:13:03,760
security solutions and policies now it

4581
03:13:03,760 --> 03:13:05,439
doesn't matter whether it's your day job

4582
03:13:05,439 --> 03:13:08,080
or your side hustle we welcome as wide a

4583
03:13:08,080 --> 03:13:09,920
view as possible

4584
03:13:09,920 --> 03:13:11,279
and we will also be deploying this

4585
03:13:11,279 --> 03:13:14,000
survey as well in a subsequent phase to

4586
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:15,600
wider small businesses including

4587
03:13:15,600 --> 03:13:17,279
non-technical businesses

4588
03:13:17,279 --> 03:13:19,040
so any feedback that you guys can give

4589
03:13:19,040 --> 03:13:20,960
us will make that process much more

4590
03:13:20,960 --> 03:13:24,239
efficient and more effective

4591
03:13:24,319 --> 03:13:26,479
so thank you we have highlighted the

4592
03:13:26,479 --> 03:13:28,080
intention we basically discussed the

4593
03:13:28,080 --> 03:13:30,080
intention behavior gap that's present in

4594
03:13:30,080 --> 03:13:32,239
its small business uh small business

4595
03:13:32,239 --> 03:13:34,560
cyber security at the moment

4596
03:13:34,560 --> 03:13:36,560
and we had a brief chat about the two

4597
03:13:36,560 --> 03:13:38,560
ways that we think we can help now if

4598
03:13:38,560 --> 03:13:40,000
you're interested to find more because

4599
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:41,359
obviously we're only going 20 minutes

4600
03:13:41,359 --> 03:13:42,319
here and i'm going to talk about this

4601
03:13:42,319 --> 03:13:44,080
until the cows come home

4602
03:13:44,080 --> 03:13:46,399
um on my google scholar profile there is

4603
03:13:46,399 --> 03:13:48,560
a review article which actually

4604
03:13:48,560 --> 03:13:51,120
summarizes the state of play uh with

4605
03:13:51,120 --> 03:13:53,279
small business we discuss things like

4606
03:13:53,279 --> 03:13:55,920
how policies can help

4607
03:13:55,920 --> 03:13:57,680
how we're missing that

4608
03:13:57,680 --> 03:14:00,080
knowledge gap in there

4609
03:14:00,080 --> 03:14:01,840
or if you have any questions or thoughts

4610
03:14:01,840 --> 03:14:03,359
on the small business cyber security

4611
03:14:03,359 --> 03:14:04,960
feel free to reach out

4612
03:14:04,960 --> 03:14:07,279
on my email that's shown here

4613
03:14:07,279 --> 03:14:10,239
and finally feel free to pass the survey

4614
03:14:10,239 --> 03:14:11,840
on to a small business that you know i

4615
03:14:11,840 --> 03:14:14,160
actually can't wait to hear what a small

4616
03:14:14,160 --> 03:14:17,040
business has to say about their cyber

4617
03:14:17,040 --> 03:14:18,319
security

4618
03:14:18,319 --> 03:14:19,200
so

4619
03:14:19,200 --> 03:14:21,760
thank you

4620
03:14:23,680 --> 03:14:25,760
thanks very much tracy just one question

4621
03:14:25,760 --> 03:14:28,239
i'm going to ask um just on that

4622
03:14:28,239 --> 03:14:29,680
500

4623
03:14:29,680 --> 03:14:32,319
value for um small businesses is there

4624
03:14:32,319 --> 03:14:35,520
any information on what that 500 was

4625
03:14:35,520 --> 03:14:36,960
going towards was it you know your

4626
03:14:36,960 --> 03:14:38,800
traditional av

4627
03:14:38,800 --> 03:14:40,160
are they getting

4628
03:14:40,160 --> 03:14:41,840
caught by vendors who say this is a

4629
03:14:41,840 --> 03:14:43,600
wonderful thing or is there any sort of

4630
03:14:43,600 --> 03:14:45,040
trend towards what they're spending that

4631
03:14:45,040 --> 03:14:46,399
money on

4632
03:14:46,399 --> 03:14:48,560
no so there and this is part of the

4633
03:14:48,560 --> 03:14:50,560
problem of small business cyber security

4634
03:14:50,560 --> 03:14:53,279
is that not many people

4635
03:14:53,279 --> 03:14:55,359
from all sides are paying specific

4636
03:14:55,359 --> 03:14:57,680
attention in small business so what acsc

4637
03:14:57,680 --> 03:14:59,600
did was they basically asked a question

4638
03:14:59,600 --> 03:15:02,080
how much did you spend in brackets like

4639
03:15:02,080 --> 03:15:03,439
less than 500

4640
03:15:03,439 --> 03:15:06,000
500 to you know different brackets and

4641
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:08,880
people just ticked the thing of what

4642
03:15:08,880 --> 03:15:11,439
they spent um so that's part of what

4643
03:15:11,439 --> 03:15:13,120
we'll be interested in in the next phase

4644
03:15:13,120 --> 03:15:15,439
of our project as well to get people to

4645
03:15:15,439 --> 03:15:17,760
tell us what are they spending it on

4646
03:15:17,760 --> 03:15:19,680
whether they want to um

4647
03:15:19,680 --> 03:15:20,960
you know they know what they're spending

4648
03:15:20,960 --> 03:15:23,600
it on so i think what you're alluding to

4649
03:15:23,600 --> 03:15:25,760
in terms of you know being talked to by

4650
03:15:25,760 --> 03:15:28,479
a sales rep is probably something that

4651
03:15:28,479 --> 03:15:31,359
may come up quite a few a few times

4652
03:15:31,359 --> 03:15:35,120
so um yeah so the extra answer is no but

4653
03:15:35,120 --> 03:15:37,120
we probably can take a guess that you

4654
03:15:37,120 --> 03:15:39,840
know most of the consumer stuff consumer

4655
03:15:39,840 --> 03:15:42,000
um

4656
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:44,080
products are the highly favored one

4657
03:15:44,080 --> 03:15:46,080
because as you saw the architecture

4658
03:15:46,080 --> 03:15:48,399
before that it's pretty much our home

4659
03:15:48,399 --> 03:15:51,040
office setup

4660
03:15:51,040 --> 03:15:52,640
yeah that's great um one of the

4661
03:15:52,640 --> 03:15:54,000
questions that was asked in the q a

4662
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:55,840
channel uh what's the thing that most

4663
03:15:55,840 --> 03:15:57,760
annoys you when it comes to way security

4664
03:15:57,760 --> 03:15:59,200
is full stay in the throats of small

4665
03:15:59,200 --> 03:16:00,800
businesses especially when it's

4666
03:16:00,800 --> 03:16:02,560
enterprise level stuff for a business of

4667
03:16:02,560 --> 03:16:04,960
less than 10 people

4668
03:16:04,960 --> 03:16:06,640
sorry so i'm going to have to get you to

4669
03:16:06,640 --> 03:16:08,960
repeat that question only because my

4670
03:16:08,960 --> 03:16:10,880
connection's a bit funny

4671
03:16:10,880 --> 03:16:13,120
so what's the thing that most annoys you

4672
03:16:13,120 --> 03:16:15,359
when it comes to why security is forced

4673
03:16:15,359 --> 03:16:17,520
in the throats of small businesses

4674
03:16:17,520 --> 03:16:19,359
especially when it's enterprise level

4675
03:16:19,359 --> 03:16:21,200
stuff for a business of less than 10

4676
03:16:21,200 --> 03:16:22,800
people

4677
03:16:22,800 --> 03:16:25,040
yeah and people and and i'm really

4678
03:16:25,040 --> 03:16:27,439
focusing my research on

4679
03:16:27,439 --> 03:16:29,040
businesses less than 10 people because

4680
03:16:29,040 --> 03:16:31,279
that actually is often

4681
03:16:31,279 --> 03:16:32,239
the

4682
03:16:32,239 --> 03:16:33,760
exclusion is actually quite funny

4683
03:16:33,760 --> 03:16:34,800
because

4684
03:16:34,800 --> 03:16:36,880
when you when i was doing my when i'm

4685
03:16:36,880 --> 03:16:39,120
doing my research i go usually go

4686
03:16:39,120 --> 03:16:41,200
straight to the page where they say who

4687
03:16:41,200 --> 03:16:43,359
they surveyed and who they talk to and

4688
03:16:43,359 --> 03:16:44,479
all that stuff

4689
03:16:44,479 --> 03:16:46,800
and majority of the materials out there

4690
03:16:46,800 --> 03:16:48,560
whether in the industry government in

4691
03:16:48,560 --> 03:16:51,120
general go we took the small businesses

4692
03:16:51,120 --> 03:16:53,200
but we excluded anybody that's got no

4693
03:16:53,200 --> 03:16:56,720
employees or less than 10 employees so

4694
03:16:56,720 --> 03:16:58,239
what we're basically doing and i have

4695
03:16:58,239 --> 03:17:00,160
covered a little bit in in my survey

4696
03:17:00,160 --> 03:17:01,600
article is that

4697
03:17:01,600 --> 03:17:03,200
we are essentially trying to take the

4698
03:17:03,200 --> 03:17:05,600
cookie cutter from people that are

4699
03:17:05,600 --> 03:17:08,160
in 200 people employ um

4700
03:17:08,160 --> 03:17:10,000
companies and go here you go that will

4701
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:12,960
just work go and make it work and then

4702
03:17:12,960 --> 03:17:14,560
you look at it go

4703
03:17:14,560 --> 03:17:17,760
but hang on i've only got me

4704
03:17:17,760 --> 03:17:19,600
where am i going to

4705
03:17:19,600 --> 03:17:20,880
well what where am i going to put that

4706
03:17:20,880 --> 03:17:23,120
gateway what's the vpn gateway for like

4707
03:17:23,120 --> 03:17:25,200
what would i do with it like where would

4708
03:17:25,200 --> 03:17:27,680
i should i put it over in my kitchen

4709
03:17:27,680 --> 03:17:28,800
pantry

4710
03:17:28,800 --> 03:17:30,160
i actually seriously thought about it at

4711
03:17:30,160 --> 03:17:32,239
one point i'm like okay how where would

4712
03:17:32,239 --> 03:17:35,439
i deploy vpn gaming if i was to buy one

4713
03:17:35,439 --> 03:17:36,399
um

4714
03:17:36,399 --> 03:17:38,800
so it's a much neglected area which is

4715
03:17:38,800 --> 03:17:41,359
why we're making this call out today and

4716
03:17:41,359 --> 03:17:43,760
we just want to understand more of how

4717
03:17:43,760 --> 03:17:45,920
people actually use it so that we're not

4718
03:17:45,920 --> 03:17:47,600
trying to

4719
03:17:47,600 --> 03:17:48,399
um

4720
03:17:48,399 --> 03:17:50,479
how to say uh trying to

4721
03:17:50,479 --> 03:17:52,479
i guess give everybody an suv when

4722
03:17:52,479 --> 03:17:53,600
really

4723
03:17:53,600 --> 03:17:56,479
you know a tiny sedan may have um may

4724
03:17:56,479 --> 03:17:58,800
have suited the needs and that's part of

4725
03:17:58,800 --> 03:18:00,640
the intention behavior gap that they've

4726
03:18:00,640 --> 03:18:03,200
seen as well where um you know being

4727
03:18:03,200 --> 03:18:05,600
given essential eight even i mean we're

4728
03:18:05,600 --> 03:18:07,600
not even talking about the security

4729
03:18:07,600 --> 03:18:10,399
manual which we want them to follow

4730
03:18:10,399 --> 03:18:12,640
given essential aids they just

4731
03:18:12,640 --> 03:18:15,040
you know at a loss what do we do now

4732
03:18:15,040 --> 03:18:16,720
with it you know i love application

4733
03:18:16,720 --> 03:18:19,200
white listing how do i do that i'm not

4734
03:18:19,200 --> 03:18:21,439
sure

4735
03:18:21,520 --> 03:18:23,840
yeah fantastic one last question i guess

4736
03:18:23,840 --> 03:18:26,080
what's your observation in terms of

4737
03:18:26,080 --> 03:18:28,399
cyber security pre-covered and post

4738
03:18:28,399 --> 03:18:31,680
covered so obviously um in terms of smb

4739
03:18:31,680 --> 03:18:33,600
space there's been a lot of changes

4740
03:18:33,600 --> 03:18:35,439
um you know businesses going online

4741
03:18:35,439 --> 03:18:37,279
starting to offer their services online

4742
03:18:37,279 --> 03:18:39,600
rather than in person ha do you think

4743
03:18:39,600 --> 03:18:41,920
things have improved or they've kind of

4744
03:18:41,920 --> 03:18:42,960
started

4745
03:18:42,960 --> 03:18:44,399
implementing those things without taking

4746
03:18:44,399 --> 03:18:46,160
into account cyber security i guess what

4747
03:18:46,160 --> 03:18:47,760
are your thoughts on that

4748
03:18:47,760 --> 03:18:50,399
um that's a great question so

4749
03:18:50,399 --> 03:18:53,840
the data from the pandemic is actually

4750
03:18:53,840 --> 03:18:55,840
just starting to come out now

4751
03:18:55,840 --> 03:18:58,960
um but we don't actually expect the real

4752
03:18:58,960 --> 03:19:00,560
pandemic

4753
03:19:00,560 --> 03:19:03,120
deep in pandemic so release until sort

4754
03:19:03,120 --> 03:19:05,279
of next year because as you know some of

4755
03:19:05,279 --> 03:19:06,399
the government

4756
03:19:06,399 --> 03:19:08,479
you know bodies they don't release

4757
03:19:08,479 --> 03:19:10,720
data every year

4758
03:19:10,720 --> 03:19:14,720
um but we have sort of seen a shift from

4759
03:19:14,720 --> 03:19:15,840
i guess

4760
03:19:15,840 --> 03:19:16,640
the

4761
03:19:16,640 --> 03:19:19,439
do we really need this i.t thing to

4762
03:19:19,439 --> 03:19:20,319
oh

4763
03:19:20,319 --> 03:19:22,720
okay you're telling me to do

4764
03:19:22,720 --> 03:19:25,680
put more money into this it thing um

4765
03:19:25,680 --> 03:19:28,080
so it's it's um there's a shift in

4766
03:19:28,080 --> 03:19:29,680
mentality definitely and that's

4767
03:19:29,680 --> 03:19:31,920
anecdotally because obviously data

4768
03:19:31,920 --> 03:19:33,359
hasn't come out yet

4769
03:19:33,359 --> 03:19:34,560
um but

4770
03:19:34,560 --> 03:19:36,319
it's gone to a case of yes we are using

4771
03:19:36,319 --> 03:19:38,239
i.t

4772
03:19:38,239 --> 03:19:40,000
but we we haven't really got to that

4773

4848
03:22:22,560 --> 03:22:24,640

4849
03:22:24,640 --> 03:22:27,760

03:26:01,760 --> 03:26:03,200
while we've been

4940
03:26:03,200 --> 03:26:06,080
bullshitting this whole time so hi blake

4941
03:26:06,080 --> 03:26:07,359
how are you doing

4942
03:26:07,359 --> 03:26:09,520
yeah going well thanks how are you going

4943
03:26:09,520 --> 03:26:11,680
uh yes we are all alive i think we're

4944
03:26:11,680 --> 03:26:13,279
all still awake although i'm gonna need

4945
03:26:13,279 --> 03:26:16,160
a coffee after this um blake where do

4946
03:26:16,160 --> 03:26:18,160
you sit on the attendees versus nuggies

4947
03:26:18,160 --> 03:26:19,200
debates

4948
03:26:19,200 --> 03:26:20,000
oh

4949
03:26:20,000 --> 03:26:21,120
i mean they're both pretty good i'd

4950
03:26:21,120 --> 03:26:22,880
probably have to say attendees

4951
03:26:22,880 --> 03:26:24,720
good shanna will invite you you'll be

4952
03:26:24,720 --> 03:26:27,520
back you'll be there

4953
03:26:27,520 --> 03:26:29,760
oh see the dogs in the background

4954
03:26:29,760 --> 03:26:31,600
yeah

4955
03:26:31,600 --> 03:26:33,120
i had to steal their toys so they didn't

4956
03:26:33,120 --> 03:26:36,800
just like sit there squeaking them at me

4957
03:26:37,120 --> 03:26:39,600
we would have been okay with that yeah

4958
03:26:39,600 --> 03:26:40,960
fine

4959
03:26:40,960 --> 03:26:42,319
yeah i get asked all the time on

4960
03:26:42,319 --> 03:26:43,840
conference calls do you have a bird i'm

4961
03:26:43,840 --> 03:26:46,000
like no that's my dog and it's squeaky

4962
03:26:46,000 --> 03:26:48,239
toy it's probably lola at that point

4963
03:26:48,239 --> 03:26:49,279
yeah

4964
03:26:49,279 --> 03:26:51,760
um so blake is a senior capability

4965
03:26:51,760 --> 03:26:53,439
developer working on detection

4966
03:26:53,439 --> 03:26:54,880
engineering and scalable defensive

4967
03:26:54,880 --> 03:26:57,040
measures like focuses on developing new

4968
03:26:57,040 --> 03:26:58,479
ways to detect prevent and mitigate

4969
03:26:58,479 --> 03:27:00,000
potential compromises on australian

4970
03:27:00,000 --> 03:27:01,680
networks so blake is going to talk to us

4971
03:27:01,680 --> 03:27:04,160
today about

4972
03:27:04,160 --> 03:27:06,160
preventing iis exploitation through the

4973
03:27:06,160 --> 03:27:07,840
windows kernel which should be great for

4974
03:27:07,840 --> 03:27:09,680
people who know a lot more than i do

4975
03:27:09,680 --> 03:27:12,160
because i don't know that much

4976
03:27:12,160 --> 03:27:12,880
so

4977
03:27:12,880 --> 03:27:14,880
take it away blake

4978
03:27:14,880 --> 03:27:16,880
yeah fantastic thank you very much and

4979
03:27:16,880 --> 03:27:19,279
good afternoon everyone um so yeah today

4980
03:27:19,279 --> 03:27:20,239
i'm going to be talking about some

4981
03:27:20,239 --> 03:27:22,640
research that i did into the windows

4982
03:27:22,640 --> 03:27:23,600
kernel

4983
03:27:23,600 --> 03:27:26,800
uh trying to prevent is exploitation

4984
03:27:26,800 --> 03:27:29,520
and this will also uh present as a bit

4985
03:27:29,520 --> 03:27:33,680
of a introduction to kernel programming

4986
03:27:34,160 --> 03:27:37,279
but to start off who am i uh so as

4987
03:27:37,279 --> 03:27:38,800
mentioned i'm a lead capability

4988
03:27:38,800 --> 03:27:40,160
developer at the australian cyber

4989
03:27:40,160 --> 03:27:41,359
security center

4990
03:27:41,359 --> 03:27:43,840
i've been working closely with the hunt

4991
03:27:43,840 --> 03:27:45,840
and instant response teams

4992
03:27:45,840 --> 03:27:48,640
and primarily i focus on developing the

4993
03:27:48,640 --> 03:27:50,560
latest and greatest detection and

4994
03:27:50,560 --> 03:27:53,359
prevention capabilities to ensure that

4995
03:27:53,359 --> 03:27:56,160
ir irs are able to detect the best

4996
03:27:56,160 --> 03:27:57,840
actors out there

4997
03:27:57,840 --> 03:27:59,920
previously i was a lead in responder as

4998
03:27:59,920 --> 03:28:01,359
well

4999
03:28:01,359 --> 03:28:03,040
while working the front line i realized

5000
03:28:03,040 --> 03:28:04,160
that

5001
03:28:04,160 --> 03:28:07,840
while a lot of what we respond to is say

5002
03:28:07,840 --> 03:28:10,160
different exploits at the os level and

5003
03:28:10,160 --> 03:28:11,600
the fundamentals

5004
03:28:11,600 --> 03:28:14,560
they're inherently the same

5005
03:28:14,560 --> 03:28:16,399
i've recently started blogging about

5006
03:28:16,399 --> 03:28:18,399
some of my hobbyist research and that's

5007
03:28:18,399 --> 03:28:19,600
what i'm going to be talking about today

5008
03:28:19,600 --> 03:28:21,120
as well

5009
03:28:21,120 --> 03:28:22,800
and some of the tools that i've been

5010
03:28:22,800 --> 03:28:25,760
working on

5011
03:28:25,760 --> 03:28:27,279
so a bit of an overview of what we're

5012
03:28:27,279 --> 03:28:29,760
going to be talking about

5013
03:28:29,760 --> 03:28:31,920
um whilst we've all probably heard about

5014
03:28:31,920 --> 03:28:33,359
the windows kernel i think it's probably

5015
03:28:33,359 --> 03:28:34,880
a good idea to do a bit of an overview

5016
03:28:34,880 --> 03:28:36,720
of the basics and some kernel

5017
03:28:36,720 --> 03:28:38,880
programming tips

5018
03:28:38,880 --> 03:28:41,520
we're going to talk a bit about what is

5019
03:28:41,520 --> 03:28:43,680
exploitation looks like as at a

5020
03:28:43,680 --> 03:28:45,439
fundamental os

5021
03:28:45,439 --> 03:28:48,720
level and how we can look to prevent it

5022
03:28:48,720 --> 03:28:50,560
and lastly we'll talk about some ways

5023
03:28:50,560 --> 03:28:52,319
that we can make these protections

5024
03:28:52,319 --> 03:28:55,040
easier to use we've seen with tool sets

5025
03:28:55,040 --> 03:28:57,520
like exploit guard if it's not easy to

5026
03:28:57,520 --> 03:28:58,560
set up

5027
03:28:58,560 --> 03:29:00,960
then it won't be used

5028
03:29:00,960 --> 03:29:03,279
i'm also trying to talk about a lot in

5029
03:29:03,279 --> 03:29:05,040
about a half an hour time period so if

5030
03:29:05,040 --> 03:29:06,800
you're interested in kernel programming

5031
03:29:06,800 --> 03:29:08,720
uh hit me up afterwards i'm always happy

5032
03:29:08,720 --> 03:29:10,319
to discuss further and i'll be in the

5033
03:29:10,319 --> 03:29:12,800
discord

5034
03:29:12,960 --> 03:29:15,600
so what is preventative engineering

5035
03:29:15,600 --> 03:29:18,080
rather than trying to be reactive and

5036
03:29:18,080 --> 03:29:20,800
patch exploits once and ex patch yeah

5037
03:29:20,800 --> 03:29:22,800
patch exploits once they're known i

5038
03:29:22,800 --> 03:29:24,720
focus on the similarities between

5039
03:29:24,720 --> 03:29:27,279
exploits or system abuse and try to find

5040
03:29:27,279 --> 03:29:29,279
ways that we can prevent actors from

5041
03:29:29,279 --> 03:29:31,439
being able to abuse these these kind of

5042
03:29:31,439 --> 03:29:34,479
preventions mean if an exploit is found

5043
03:29:34,479 --> 03:29:35,840
the action will still be blocked

5044
03:29:35,840 --> 03:29:38,319
preventing potential compromise

5045
03:29:38,319 --> 03:29:40,560
you'll find with most exploits that get

5046
03:29:40,560 --> 03:29:42,800
released the software itself might not

5047
03:29:42,800 --> 03:29:44,479
actually matter in the scheme of things

5048
03:29:44,479 --> 03:29:46,560
it's more making the process do

5049
03:29:46,560 --> 03:29:48,880
something that is abnormal to its normal

5050
03:29:48,880 --> 03:29:51,358
behavior

5051
03:29:52,080 --> 03:29:52,960
so

5052
03:29:52,960 --> 03:29:54,960
why the windows kernel often when i'm

5053
03:29:54,960 --> 03:29:56,479
playing around with preventative

5054
03:29:56,479 --> 03:29:58,560
solutions i end up in the windows kernel

5055
03:29:58,560 --> 03:30:00,840
and that comes down to three main

5056
03:30:00,840 --> 03:30:04,479
advantages one we get the so much higher

5057
03:30:04,479 --> 03:30:06,319
privileges and

5058
03:30:06,319 --> 03:30:08,399
if the actor isn't in kernel space as

5059
03:30:08,399 --> 03:30:10,560
well we can generally hide a lot better

5060
03:30:10,560 --> 03:30:12,239
from them and get coverage over their

5061
03:30:12,239 --> 03:30:13,680
actions

5062
03:30:13,680 --> 03:30:15,680
this level of access makes it difficult

5063
03:30:15,680 --> 03:30:18,080
for actors to bypass our controls

5064
03:30:18,080 --> 03:30:19,920
for example with iis

5065
03:30:19,920 --> 03:30:22,000
controls there are a few known bypasses

5066
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:24,160
so your webshot doesn't even get logged

5067
03:30:24,160 --> 03:30:26,000
this is much harder to do with kernel

5068
03:30:26,000 --> 03:30:27,760
space

5069
03:30:27,760 --> 03:30:29,200
we can also make it very difficult for

5070
03:30:29,200 --> 03:30:31,120
actors to disable these security

5071
03:30:31,120 --> 03:30:32,479
controls

5072
03:30:32,479 --> 03:30:34,720
it's not like turning off an av we can

5073
03:30:34,720 --> 03:30:37,040
prevent attempts to kill processors turn

5074
03:30:37,040 --> 03:30:37,920
off

5075
03:30:37,920 --> 03:30:39,760
services or even elevate their own

5076
03:30:39,760 --> 03:30:42,319
privileges

5077
03:30:43,200 --> 03:30:45,439
so what is the windows kernel the kernel

5078
03:30:45,439 --> 03:30:47,920
acts as a layer between user mode which

5079
03:30:47,920 --> 03:30:50,399
the standard user interacts with and the

5080
03:30:50,399 --> 03:30:53,120
computer hardware the kernel can provide

5081
03:30:53,120 --> 03:30:54,800
the highest level of privileges

5082
03:30:54,800 --> 03:30:57,680
bypassing most security controls

5083
03:30:57,680 --> 03:30:59,600
some of the windows api actually

5084
03:30:59,600 --> 03:31:02,399
operates within kernel space so when a

5085
03:31:02,399 --> 03:31:04,080
function requires interaction with

5086
03:31:04,080 --> 03:31:06,560
hardware such as creating a file it will

5087
03:31:06,560 --> 03:31:08,880
need to send a request to kernel space

5088
03:31:08,880 --> 03:31:10,239
to handle that

5089
03:31:10,239 --> 03:31:13,640
i o action

5090
03:31:14,319 --> 03:31:16,080
the standard way for the windows kernel

5091
03:31:16,080 --> 03:31:18,080
is to get into the windows kernel is

5092
03:31:18,080 --> 03:31:20,239
through drivers drivers are executed by

5093
03:31:20,239 --> 03:31:22,720
windows services and with the service

5094
03:31:22,720 --> 03:31:24,840
type providing the level of kernel

5095
03:31:24,840 --> 03:31:27,279
privileges drivers are usually there to

5096
03:31:27,279 --> 03:31:29,439
tell hardware how to function such as

5097
03:31:29,439 --> 03:31:31,279
your keyboard and your mouse

5098
03:31:31,279 --> 03:31:33,279
but there may be some other software use

5099
03:31:33,279 --> 03:31:34,880
cases as well

5100
03:31:34,880 --> 03:31:36,560
c is the officially supported language

5101
03:31:36,560 --> 03:31:38,319
but there's been some work in the last

5102
03:31:38,319 --> 03:31:40,399
few years for other languages such as

5103
03:31:40,399 --> 03:31:42,800
rust

5104
03:31:43,680 --> 03:31:45,200
there are four main types of services

5105
03:31:45,200 --> 03:31:47,439
that are executed within kernel space

5106
03:31:47,439 --> 03:31:49,520
and but only two of them are really

5107
03:31:49,520 --> 03:31:51,520
commonly used and that's the kernel and

5108
03:31:51,520 --> 03:31:52,640
file sys

5109
03:31:52,640 --> 03:31:54,560
the main difference is that filesys

5110
03:31:54,560 --> 03:31:56,239
allows you to register what's called a

5111
03:31:56,239 --> 03:31:58,560
mini filter so we can filter all of the

5112
03:31:58,560 --> 03:32:01,439
input output operations and intercept

5113
03:32:01,439 --> 03:32:03,520
them either before or after a change is

5114
03:32:03,520 --> 03:32:07,439
made but we'll go more into that soon

5115
03:32:07,760 --> 03:32:09,840
it's also worth mentioning that the

5116
03:32:09,840 --> 03:32:12,560
kernel api uh the kernel doesn't really

5117
03:32:12,560 --> 03:32:15,120
have access to the windows api

5118
03:32:15,120 --> 03:32:17,439
we get limited control over what we get

5119
03:32:17,439 --> 03:32:20,160
to do and we do that through the kernel

5120
03:32:20,160 --> 03:32:23,520
api a lot of the functions are not

5121
03:32:23,520 --> 03:32:25,359
available and sometimes they're

5122
03:32:25,359 --> 03:32:27,520
undocumented

5123
03:32:27,520 --> 03:32:29,359
sometimes they're actually so

5124
03:32:29,359 --> 03:32:31,120
undocumented that you might have to go

5125
03:32:31,120 --> 03:32:33,359
and reverse ntos kernel just to find out

5126
03:32:33,359 --> 03:32:36,800
what capability you have access to

5127
03:32:36,800 --> 03:32:38,960
another fun part about a lot of the

5128
03:32:38,960 --> 03:32:41,759
kernel api

5129
03:32:41,920 --> 03:32:43,520
is that these functions aren't located

5130
03:32:43,520 --> 03:32:45,040
within headers

5131
03:32:45,040 --> 03:32:46,880
you'll need to manually declare these

5132
03:32:46,880 --> 03:32:48,399
functions and the structures that is

5133
03:32:48,399 --> 03:32:50,239
required

5134
03:32:50,239 --> 03:32:51,840
as you can see from the image a lot of

5135
03:32:51,840 --> 03:32:53,920
the naming scheme makes sense k for

5136
03:32:53,920 --> 03:32:54,880
kernel

5137
03:32:54,880 --> 03:32:58,720
ob for object se for security and zw for

5138
03:32:58,720 --> 03:33:00,800
native api

5139
03:33:00,800 --> 03:33:03,120
the zw functions are actually ports of a

5140
03:33:03,120 --> 03:33:05,279
few windows api functions

5141
03:33:05,279 --> 03:33:07,279
but less security checks

5142
03:33:07,279 --> 03:33:09,040
for example if you want to call create

5143
03:33:09,040 --> 03:33:11,279
file in user mode the os would check to

5144
03:33:11,279 --> 03:33:13,040
see whether or not you actually have the

5145
03:33:13,040 --> 03:33:15,840
available permissions to create the file

5146
03:33:15,840 --> 03:33:17,600
but when you're in kernel space it just

5147
03:33:17,600 --> 03:33:19,439
does it even if you're creating a file

5148
03:33:19,439 --> 03:33:21,200
that would result in an

5149
03:33:21,200 --> 03:33:23,200
immediate blue screen you have the

5150
03:33:23,200 --> 03:33:25,359
trusted authority and the expectation

5151
03:33:25,359 --> 03:33:28,319
that you know what you're doing

5152
03:33:28,960 --> 03:33:31,120
so how does this relate to forensics

5153
03:33:31,120 --> 03:33:32,399
capability

5154
03:33:32,399 --> 03:33:35,040
the kernel is extremely powerful place

5155
03:33:35,040 --> 03:33:36,399
but there is nowhere near enough

5156
03:33:36,399 --> 03:33:38,640
documentation especially for developers

5157
03:33:38,640 --> 03:33:41,200
looking to get into kernel programming

5158
03:33:41,200 --> 03:33:42,560
this is where i started bringing

5159
03:33:42,560 --> 03:33:44,880
together a suite of proof of concepts to

5160
03:33:44,880 --> 03:33:47,279
showcase different areas that we could

5161
03:33:47,279 --> 03:33:49,600
use the windows kernel to help enhance

5162
03:33:49,600 --> 03:33:51,600
detection and prevention of malicious

5163
03:33:51,600 --> 03:33:53,359
actors

5164
03:33:53,359 --> 03:33:55,359
i call this sweet the kernel forensics

5165
03:33:55,359 --> 03:33:58,640
capability toolkit or kfc for short

5166
03:33:58,640 --> 03:34:00,560
a large amount of av and endpoint

5167
03:34:00,560 --> 03:34:02,479
detection providers utilize the windows

5168
03:34:02,479 --> 03:34:04,000
kernel to get the best coverage over

5169
03:34:04,000 --> 03:34:05,760
what is happening in user mode

5170
03:34:05,760 --> 03:34:08,160
whether it's arbitrarily reading process

5171
03:34:08,160 --> 03:34:10,319
memory or preventing file rights

5172
03:34:10,319 --> 03:34:12,960
some of the best etw providers are also

5173
03:34:12,960 --> 03:34:15,840
restricted to kernel privileges

5174
03:34:15,840 --> 03:34:17,200
i've been looking

5175
03:34:17,200 --> 03:34:19,520
at showcasing some of these core

5176
03:34:19,520 --> 03:34:21,200
features and provide further

5177
03:34:21,200 --> 03:34:22,960
documentation for those looking to get

5178
03:34:22,960 --> 03:34:26,160
into edr development

5179
03:34:27,439 --> 03:34:28,640
you may notice that some of these

5180
03:34:28,640 --> 03:34:30,319
capabilities are super similar to

5181
03:34:30,319 --> 03:34:31,840
exploit card

5182
03:34:31,840 --> 03:34:34,479
introduced in 2017 exploit guide has

5183
03:34:34,479 --> 03:34:36,800
been a huge win for defensive security

5184
03:34:36,800 --> 03:34:39,600
but only really for windows applications

5185
03:34:39,600 --> 03:34:41,600
exploit guide is extremely hard to

5186
03:34:41,600 --> 03:34:43,439
implement for third party and custom

5187
03:34:43,439 --> 03:34:46,640
tool sets often outright breaking tools

5188
03:34:46,640 --> 03:34:49,359
or making them completely unusable

5189
03:34:49,359 --> 03:34:51,120
so in some cases i've made similar

5190
03:34:51,120 --> 03:34:53,600
capability but with more flexibility and

5191
03:34:53,600 --> 03:34:55,279
customizations around how you can

5192
03:34:55,279 --> 03:34:57,840
implement it

5193
03:34:58,239 --> 03:34:59,600
the first proof of concept that i

5194
03:34:59,600 --> 03:35:01,279
released is a tool for conversation

5195
03:35:01,279 --> 03:35:04,080
today it's w3w protect

5196
03:35:04,080 --> 03:35:06,479
a ias driver that monitors and prevents

5197
03:35:06,479 --> 03:35:08,800
potential is exploitation

5198
03:35:08,800 --> 03:35:11,200
i say proof of concept because i do not

5199
03:35:11,200 --> 03:35:12,960
have the spare time to invest into

5200
03:35:12,960 --> 03:35:15,200
maintaining a kernel driver so if a

5201
03:35:15,200 --> 03:35:16,880
company company wants to gobble this up

5202
03:35:16,880 --> 03:35:19,520
and implement it feel free

5203
03:35:19,520 --> 03:35:21,359
during my time as an instant responder

5204
03:35:21,359 --> 03:35:23,600
about 89 of incidents that came through

5205
03:35:23,600 --> 03:35:25,840
were due to web exploitation

5206
03:35:25,840 --> 03:35:27,200
while there are dozens of different

5207
03:35:27,200 --> 03:35:29,680
exploits that were utilized they were

5208
03:35:29,680 --> 03:35:31,680
all resulted in one or more of these

5209
03:35:31,680 --> 03:35:33,200
three outcomes

5210
03:35:33,200 --> 03:35:35,760
process creation whether through command

5211
03:35:35,760 --> 03:35:37,600
prompt or powershell

5212
03:35:37,600 --> 03:35:40,640
file right or creation such as dropping

5213
03:35:40,640 --> 03:35:42,319
a web shell

5214
03:35:42,319 --> 03:35:44,479
and registrywrite to read either

5215
03:35:44,479 --> 03:35:46,399
privileged information or remove

5216
03:35:46,399 --> 03:35:48,800
security settings

5217
03:35:48,800 --> 03:35:51,920
while w3wp process can perform these

5218
03:35:51,920 --> 03:35:54,479
three operations natively exploitation

5219
03:35:54,479 --> 03:35:56,479
usually does uses this in a very

5220
03:35:56,479 --> 03:36:00,399
different way causing abnormalities

5221
03:36:00,640 --> 03:36:03,040
so let's talk about process creation

5222
03:36:03,040 --> 03:36:05,760
this is usually the most common form of

5223
03:36:05,760 --> 03:36:08,720
iis abuse whether through exploits or

5224
03:36:08,720 --> 03:36:10,720
through the use of a web shell

5225
03:36:10,720 --> 03:36:12,239
this allows for an actor to drop a

5226
03:36:12,239 --> 03:36:14,560
second stage elevate their privileges or

5227
03:36:14,560 --> 03:36:16,479
just continue to pivot throughout the

5228
03:36:16,479 --> 03:36:17,439
network

5229
03:36:17,439 --> 03:36:19,040
so how can we detect this in kernel

5230
03:36:19,040 --> 03:36:21,200
space

5231
03:36:21,200 --> 03:36:23,600
the kernel api has process notify

5232
03:36:23,600 --> 03:36:26,080
routines this lets us register a

5233
03:36:26,080 --> 03:36:27,760
function that will be called before a

5234
03:36:27,760 --> 03:36:30,479
process is created or terminated the

5235
03:36:30,479 --> 03:36:32,640
keyword there being before

5236
03:36:32,640 --> 03:36:34,640
this way we can prevent the creation or

5237
03:36:34,640 --> 03:36:37,040
termination of a process

5238
03:36:37,040 --> 03:36:38,560
using functions like this can be

5239
03:36:38,560 --> 03:36:40,560
considered high risk because if we don't

5240
03:36:40,560 --> 03:36:43,200
unload our driver without disabling this

5241
03:36:43,200 --> 03:36:44,960
notify routine we'll end up blue

5242
03:36:44,960 --> 03:36:46,560
screening the machine the next time a

5243
03:36:46,560 --> 03:36:49,439
process is created or terminated

5244
03:36:49,439 --> 03:36:51,359
overall though it's pretty easy to set

5245
03:36:51,359 --> 03:36:53,200
up and unload

5246
03:36:53,200 --> 03:36:54,880
the ex at the end of the function name

5247
03:36:54,880 --> 03:36:57,040
just lets us prevent the creation or

5248
03:36:57,040 --> 03:36:59,520
termination of a process if we just

5249
03:36:59,520 --> 03:37:01,600
wanted to monitor this process creation

5250
03:37:01,600 --> 03:37:03,520
and termination we could just remove the

5251
03:37:03,520 --> 03:37:07,359
ex from the name and be a bit safer

5252
03:37:08,080 --> 03:37:08,800
so

5253
03:37:08,800 --> 03:37:10,239
we've got a function

5254
03:37:10,239 --> 03:37:12,080
that gets called every time a process is

5255
03:37:12,080 --> 03:37:13,920
created or terminated

5256
03:37:13,920 --> 03:37:16,640
one of the arguments provided which is

5257
03:37:16,640 --> 03:37:17,920
the

5258
03:37:17,920 --> 03:37:20,479
with this callback is called creation

5259
03:37:20,479 --> 03:37:22,160
info

5260
03:37:22,160 --> 03:37:24,479
if a process is getting terminated

5261
03:37:24,479 --> 03:37:27,359
creation info is null therefore we don't

5262
03:37:27,359 --> 03:37:29,120
care about process termination we can

5263
03:37:29,120 --> 03:37:30,880
just return from the function

5264
03:37:30,880 --> 03:37:31,600
if

5265
03:37:31,600 --> 03:37:33,680
uh pro

5266
03:37:33,680 --> 03:37:35,439
if create info is

5267
03:37:35,439 --> 03:37:37,359
null

5268
03:37:37,359 --> 03:37:39,600
at point one we can see the lookup

5269
03:37:39,600 --> 03:37:41,920
process by process id to get the

5270
03:37:41,920 --> 03:37:44,640
e-process of the parent process the

5271
03:37:44,640 --> 03:37:46,239
e-process is just a kernel

5272
03:37:46,239 --> 03:37:48,000
representation of a process similar to

5273
03:37:48,000 --> 03:37:50,080
what you would expect with a process

5274
03:37:50,080 --> 03:37:52,800
handle in user mode

5275
03:37:52,800 --> 03:37:54,399
at point 2 we can see that we can just

5276
03:37:54,399 --> 03:37:56,880
get the parent pid from the crate info

5277
03:37:56,880 --> 03:37:58,640
so that way when a new process gets

5278
03:37:58,640 --> 03:38:00,160
created we can see what the parent

5279
03:38:00,160 --> 03:38:01,439
process is

5280
03:38:01,439 --> 03:38:03,120
and then we can just use the locate

5281
03:38:03,120 --> 03:38:05,600
process image name at point free to get

5282
03:38:05,600 --> 03:38:07,760
the name of the parent process

5283
03:38:07,760 --> 03:38:10,319
if the parent process name is not w3wp

5284
03:38:10,319 --> 03:38:12,479
we can exit we're only monitoring for

5285
03:38:12,479 --> 03:38:13,520
the

5286
03:38:13,520 --> 03:38:16,319
uh iis

5287
03:38:16,960 --> 03:38:19,359
some websites required require child

5288
03:38:19,359 --> 03:38:20,880
processes though so we need to be

5289
03:38:20,880 --> 03:38:22,960
accommodating for that we can do a check

5290
03:38:22,960 --> 03:38:25,120
against whether

5291
03:38:25,120 --> 03:38:27,120
we can do a check against either an

5292
03:38:27,120 --> 03:38:30,319
allow or deny list so that we can see if

5293
03:38:30,319 --> 03:38:32,399
specific child processes

5294
03:38:32,399 --> 03:38:33,920
are something that we should make an

5295
03:38:33,920 --> 03:38:35,279
exception for

5296
03:38:35,279 --> 03:38:37,520
or if there are specific programs that

5297
03:38:37,520 --> 03:38:39,600
we just don't want to run we can make a

5298
03:38:39,600 --> 03:38:41,760
rule against them if we find that the

5299
03:38:41,760 --> 03:38:42,880
parent

5300
03:38:42,880 --> 03:38:46,000
name is w3wp and the child name is not

5301
03:38:46,000 --> 03:38:48,239
allowed we can return an access denied

5302
03:38:48,239 --> 03:38:50,000
to user mode preventing the process

5303
03:38:50,000 --> 03:38:53,000
creation

5304
03:38:54,160 --> 03:38:56,800
once we know that this is a process that

5305
03:38:56,800 --> 03:38:58,800
we're interested in we can also capture

5306
03:38:58,800 --> 03:39:00,560
a whole bunch of additional information

5307
03:39:00,560 --> 03:39:02,800
for our incident responders such as

5308
03:39:02,800 --> 03:39:05,600
process name parent process as well as

5309
03:39:05,600 --> 03:39:07,520
the command line

5310
03:39:07,520 --> 03:39:09,359
we can provide additional filtering

5311
03:39:09,359 --> 03:39:11,520
through this as well so if for some

5312
03:39:11,520 --> 03:39:13,520
reason we need to allow

5313
03:39:13,520 --> 03:39:15,120
command prompt to run

5314
03:39:15,120 --> 03:39:18,000
we can provide regexes around what the

5315
03:39:18,000 --> 03:39:19,920
command should look like if it doesn't

5316
03:39:19,920 --> 03:39:23,840
meet that regex we can deny it

5317
03:39:24,880 --> 03:39:26,880
so let's talk about file rights

5318
03:39:26,880 --> 03:39:29,439
w3wp is usually very limited to the

5319
03:39:29,439 --> 03:39:31,760
types of file rights that will make

5320
03:39:31,760 --> 03:39:34,560
limited to either a specific folder a

5321
03:39:34,560 --> 03:39:37,359
naming scheme such as iis or weblogs or

5322
03:39:37,359 --> 03:39:39,359
specific file names

5323
03:39:39,359 --> 03:39:41,920
malicious file creation is most commonly

5324
03:39:41,920 --> 03:39:43,840
used to create web shells which lead

5325
03:39:43,840 --> 03:39:45,600
back into the process creation that we

5326
03:39:45,600 --> 03:39:47,520
just spoke about but there are other

5327
03:39:47,520 --> 03:39:48,960
forms of file creation that we need to

5328
03:39:48,960 --> 03:39:50,479
keep an eye out for such as second

5329
03:39:50,479 --> 03:39:53,680
stages such as cobalt strike

5330
03:39:53,680 --> 03:39:55,680
and what if you wanted to elevate your

5331
03:39:55,680 --> 03:39:57,920
privileges from an application pool

5332
03:39:57,920 --> 03:39:59,840
rotten potato is the most common

5333
03:39:59,840 --> 03:40:02,800
privilege escalation for iis

5334
03:40:02,800 --> 03:40:05,439
and that requires file rights except

5335
03:40:05,439 --> 03:40:06,479
that's

5336
03:40:06,479 --> 03:40:10,000
named pipe file rights

5337
03:40:10,560 --> 03:40:12,479
we spoke briefly earlier about mini

5338
03:40:12,479 --> 03:40:15,120
filters mini filters provide an avenue

5339
03:40:15,120 --> 03:40:17,840
for intercepting i o requests that are

5340
03:40:17,840 --> 03:40:20,640
either before or after they happen

5341
03:40:20,640 --> 03:40:22,640
this allows kernel filters to accept

5342
03:40:22,640 --> 03:40:25,760
deny modify or inspect any potential

5343
03:40:25,760 --> 03:40:28,080
changes before it makes it to the

5344
03:40:28,080 --> 03:40:29,439
hardware

5345
03:40:29,439 --> 03:40:31,199
as you can see on the diagram the

5346
03:40:31,199 --> 03:40:32,479
requested

5347
03:40:32,479 --> 03:40:34,880
at the request enters kernel space it

5348
03:40:34,880 --> 03:40:37,040
goes through the i o manager and into

5349
03:40:37,040 --> 03:40:38,479
the filter manager

5350
03:40:38,479 --> 03:40:40,479
the filter manager will run through all

5351
03:40:40,479 --> 03:40:42,640
of the subscribed filters

5352
03:40:42,640 --> 03:40:45,680
for that particular major function based

5353
03:40:45,680 --> 03:40:47,600
on their altitude

5354
03:40:47,600 --> 03:40:49,600
so what is a major function and what is

5355
03:40:49,600 --> 03:40:52,399
its altitude

5356
03:40:52,479 --> 03:40:54,399
a major function at

5357
03:40:54,399 --> 03:40:57,359
its core is the actions

5358
03:40:57,359 --> 03:40:59,680
a major function are core actions

5359
03:40:59,680 --> 03:41:01,920
a filter can subscribe to

5360
03:41:01,920 --> 03:41:04,560
this can be where the file is created

5361
03:41:04,560 --> 03:41:06,560
read or read into

5362
03:41:06,560 --> 03:41:08,720
we can also look at major functions such

5363
03:41:08,720 --> 03:41:10,960
as named pipes network queries and

5364
03:41:10,960 --> 03:41:13,680
wimey's which is less commonly used but

5365
03:41:13,680 --> 03:41:16,319
very useful for forensics

5366
03:41:16,319 --> 03:41:18,160
there are dozens of major functions for

5367
03:41:18,160 --> 03:41:20,479
each major type of operation between

5368
03:41:20,479 --> 03:41:22,000
user mode and

5369
03:41:22,000 --> 03:41:24,479
hardware

5370
03:41:25,359 --> 03:41:27,600
when we create our filter we provide an

5371
03:41:27,600 --> 03:41:30,000
altitude which represents where we sit

5372
03:41:30,000 --> 03:41:32,160
in the order of operations the higher

5373
03:41:32,160 --> 03:41:34,960
the altitude the earlier we operate

5374
03:41:34,960 --> 03:41:37,680
microsoft has an official list for where

5375
03:41:37,680 --> 03:41:40,160
products should be placed based on their

5376
03:41:40,160 --> 03:41:41,680
altitude but it's worth mentioning the

5377
03:41:41,680 --> 03:41:43,439
potential risks if your

5378
03:41:43,439 --> 03:41:45,840
altitude is out of place

5379
03:41:45,840 --> 03:41:47,680
as we can see in the image if there was

5380
03:41:47,680 --> 03:41:50,080
an encryption filter before an antivirus

5381
03:41:50,080 --> 03:41:51,840
filter that could drastically

5382
03:41:51,840 --> 03:41:54,080
disadvantage the antivirus when trying

5383
03:41:54,080 --> 03:41:56,960
to detect malicious activity

5384
03:41:56,960 --> 03:41:58,720
this isn't exactly relevant for us

5385
03:41:58,720 --> 03:42:00,960
because we don't care about the content

5386
03:42:00,960 --> 03:42:03,120
of the io request but it's still worth

5387
03:42:03,120 --> 03:42:05,520
mentioning

5388
03:42:06,560 --> 03:42:08,720
here we can see the official list of

5389
03:42:08,720 --> 03:42:10,800
microsoft altitudes based on product

5390
03:42:10,800 --> 03:42:11,680
type

5391
03:42:11,680 --> 03:42:13,760
this is particularly relevant in newer

5392
03:42:13,760 --> 03:42:16,000
versions of windows as windows drivers

5393
03:42:16,000 --> 03:42:18,160
need to be signed by microsoft so

5394
03:42:18,160 --> 03:42:19,920
altitudes are going to be placed within

5395
03:42:19,920 --> 03:42:21,920
these regions

5396
03:42:21,920 --> 03:42:24,479
this does not give a this does give a

5397
03:42:24,479 --> 03:42:27,040
clear list for actors if they are able

5398
03:42:27,040 --> 03:42:29,439
to load themselves into kernel space

5399
03:42:29,439 --> 03:42:31,760
we can see here that antivirus filters

5400
03:42:31,760 --> 03:42:35,680
are loaded between 320 000 and 330 000

5401
03:42:35,680 --> 03:42:37,920
if we wanted to disrupt antiviruses in

5402
03:42:37,920 --> 03:42:39,840
kernel mode would just need to be

5403
03:42:39,840 --> 03:42:43,040
located before that

5404
03:42:43,359 --> 03:42:45,520
so how do we create a mini filter

5405
03:42:45,520 --> 03:42:47,760
we need to start by creating an array of

5406
03:42:47,760 --> 03:42:50,000
operation registrations this is

5407
03:42:50,000 --> 03:42:51,600
essentially just a list of major

5408
03:42:51,600 --> 03:42:53,520
functions that we want to register a

5409
03:42:53,520 --> 03:42:55,040
callback for

5410
03:42:55,040 --> 03:42:57,359
each major function we can declare a

5411
03:42:57,359 --> 03:42:59,600
function that gets called before or

5412
03:42:59,600 --> 03:43:01,520
after the operation

5413
03:43:01,520 --> 03:43:03,120
we can see in this image that we only

5414
03:43:03,120 --> 03:43:05,760
register functions for before the

5415
03:43:05,760 --> 03:43:07,040
operation

5416
03:43:07,040 --> 03:43:10,080
and that function is pt pre-op so when

5417
03:43:10,080 --> 03:43:13,600
our create of write is made to a hard

5418
03:43:13,600 --> 03:43:17,760
drive our function's going to get called

5419
03:43:18,800 --> 03:43:20,640
when functions are called they're called

5420
03:43:20,640 --> 03:43:22,720
under the context of the process that's

5421
03:43:22,720 --> 03:43:24,239
making the request

5422
03:43:24,239 --> 03:43:26,239
because of this we can use the query

5423
03:43:26,239 --> 03:43:28,640
information process to get the name of

5424
03:43:28,640 --> 03:43:30,880
the current process and then check if

5425
03:43:30,880 --> 03:43:32,840
that current process is

5426
03:43:32,840 --> 03:43:35,840
w3wp the process image file name

5427
03:43:35,840 --> 03:43:38,479
argument just specifies that the

5428
03:43:38,479 --> 03:43:40,160
information we want to query is the

5429
03:43:40,160 --> 03:43:41,920
filename of the image

5430
03:43:41,920 --> 03:43:44,000
if it is w3wp

5431
03:43:44,000 --> 03:43:46,399
we're able to return an access denied

5432
03:43:46,399 --> 03:43:49,040
preventing the i o operation

5433
03:43:49,040 --> 03:43:51,600
realistically this actual operation

5434
03:43:51,600 --> 03:43:54,479
isn't as simple because we'll need allow

5435
03:43:54,479 --> 03:43:56,880
and deny list based on paths file names

5436
03:43:56,880 --> 03:43:57,920
etc

5437
03:43:57,920 --> 03:44:00,319
so you can control where your is server

5438
03:44:00,319 --> 03:44:03,840
is able to write to

5439
03:44:04,000 --> 03:44:04,880
so

5440
03:44:04,880 --> 03:44:06,640
let's talk about registry this is

5441
03:44:06,640 --> 03:44:08,640
definitely a bit more niche

5442
03:44:08,640 --> 03:44:10,560
out of the call out of the

5443
03:44:10,560 --> 03:44:11,760
free options

5444
03:44:11,760 --> 03:44:13,840
but this is also just for a bit of a

5445
03:44:13,840 --> 03:44:16,399
proof of concept

5446
03:44:16,399 --> 03:44:19,040
but why registry if an actor is able to

5447
03:44:19,040 --> 03:44:21,600
write get right access to the registry

5448
03:44:21,600 --> 03:44:23,279
they're able to lower the security

5449
03:44:23,279 --> 03:44:25,840
controls of a system or get execution

5450
03:44:25,840 --> 03:44:28,239
from persistent mechanisms

5451
03:44:28,239 --> 03:44:30,560
registry also provides us an opportunity

5452
03:44:30,560 --> 03:44:32,960
to monitor our own registry changes

5453
03:44:32,960 --> 03:44:34,239
whether that's

5454
03:44:34,239 --> 03:44:35,680
whether or not the enforce mode gets

5455
03:44:35,680 --> 03:44:38,080
enabled or a new path gets added to the

5456
03:44:38,080 --> 03:44:39,439
allow list

5457
03:44:39,439 --> 03:44:41,680
but we can also provide security to our

5458
03:44:41,680 --> 03:44:43,359
product preventing the actor from

5459
03:44:43,359 --> 03:44:45,279
disabling or modifying the settings for

5460
03:44:45,279 --> 03:44:48,000
their own benefit

5461
03:44:48,640 --> 03:44:50,640
we can begin this by registering a

5462
03:44:50,640 --> 03:44:52,880
registry callback using the config

5463
03:44:52,880 --> 03:44:55,199
manager registry callback

5464
03:44:55,199 --> 03:44:56,479
function

5465
03:44:56,479 --> 03:44:59,520
whether a registry whenever a registry i

5466
03:44:59,520 --> 03:45:02,160
o request is made our function pt reg

5467
03:45:02,160 --> 03:45:04,560
notifier will just get called

5468
03:45:04,560 --> 03:45:06,160
after we do the setup we can also then

5469
03:45:06,160 --> 03:45:09,359
do an update config to load our

5470
03:45:09,359 --> 03:45:12,920
settings for w3wp

5471
03:45:13,120 --> 03:45:15,040
within our callback function we filter

5472
03:45:15,040 --> 03:45:18,479
on two major functions specifically

5473
03:45:18,479 --> 03:45:21,920
preset value key which lets us intercept

5474
03:45:21,920 --> 03:45:24,479
before a change is made this gives us an

5475
03:45:24,479 --> 03:45:27,439
opportunity to check if it's w3wp

5476
03:45:27,439 --> 03:45:29,199
and then let us decide whether or not we

5477
03:45:29,199 --> 03:45:32,080
want to deny the request

5478
03:45:32,080 --> 03:45:33,920
and post

5479
03:45:33,920 --> 03:45:36,239
set value key lets us check to see if

5480
03:45:36,239 --> 03:45:38,399
the modification made was to our

5481
03:45:38,399 --> 03:45:39,359
settings

5482
03:45:39,359 --> 03:45:41,439
so we can update them immediately no

5483
03:45:41,439 --> 03:45:43,680
waiting for a period immediately update

5484
03:45:43,680 --> 03:45:45,199
the settings and start blocking those

5485
03:45:45,199 --> 03:45:47,680
bad guys

5486
03:45:47,680 --> 03:45:50,080
so we've discussed the three main

5487
03:45:50,080 --> 03:45:52,080
functionalities of this program but how

5488
03:45:52,080 --> 03:45:54,080
do we make it easier for our clients to

5489
03:45:54,080 --> 03:45:55,120
install

5490
03:45:55,120 --> 03:45:57,680
usability is key if it's not easy to use

5491
03:45:57,680 --> 03:46:00,560
then what's the point

5492
03:46:00,960 --> 03:46:03,040
taking a note from app locker

5493
03:46:03,040 --> 03:46:05,680
it can be real hard to know your allow

5494
03:46:05,680 --> 03:46:07,520
and deny list from the get go

5495
03:46:07,520 --> 03:46:09,600
so an audit mode was added allowing the

5496
03:46:09,600 --> 03:46:11,600
user to get the events that something

5497
03:46:11,600 --> 03:46:13,120
would have been blocked rather than

5498
03:46:13,120 --> 03:46:14,800
outright blocking it

5499
03:46:14,800 --> 03:46:17,000
this makes it easier to configure

5500
03:46:17,000 --> 03:46:19,439
w3wprotect and reducing the risk of

5501
03:46:19,439 --> 03:46:22,880
taking down a website

5502
03:46:22,880 --> 03:46:25,040
when something is detected we can then

5503
03:46:25,040 --> 03:46:28,160
send an etw event getting

5504
03:46:28,160 --> 03:46:30,800
for both audit and enforced mode

5505
03:46:30,800 --> 03:46:32,720
using a tool like velociraptor you can

5506
03:46:32,720 --> 03:46:35,199
collect etw events from a whole network

5507
03:46:35,199 --> 03:46:37,199
so you can remotely monitor potential

5508
03:46:37,199 --> 03:46:39,439
exploitation attempts

5509
03:46:39,439 --> 03:46:40,560
it doesn't matter if it's a

5510
03:46:40,560 --> 03:46:42,640
seven-year-old telerik vulnerability or

5511
03:46:42,640 --> 03:46:45,120
a zero-day the actions should be blocked

5512
03:46:45,120 --> 03:46:47,840
if configured correctly and then logged

5513
03:46:47,840 --> 03:46:49,520
so your security team can make the

5514
03:46:49,520 --> 03:46:51,520
appropriate actions to patch or mitigate

5515
03:46:51,520 --> 03:46:52,880
potential vulnerabilities in your

5516
03:46:52,880 --> 03:46:55,278
network

5517
03:46:56,160 --> 03:46:57,840
for a bit of a future plan about what i

5518
03:46:57,840 --> 03:47:00,479
plan to do of w3 protect i've also been

5519
03:47:00,479 --> 03:47:02,160
playing around

5520
03:47:02,160 --> 03:47:04,960
with trying to get net modules directly

5521
03:47:04,960 --> 03:47:07,439
as they're loaded into memory

5522
03:47:07,439 --> 03:47:08,720
this looks

5523
03:47:08,720 --> 03:47:11,199
uh this looks into how we can capture

5524
03:47:11,199 --> 03:47:13,359
actors loading.net modules through

5525
03:47:13,359 --> 03:47:15,680
assembly.load

5526
03:47:15,680 --> 03:47:17,520
there's still a bit of work left to do

5527
03:47:17,520 --> 03:47:18,479
but that

5528
03:47:18,479 --> 03:47:19,439
should be

5529
03:47:19,439 --> 03:47:21,840
fairly interesting

5530
03:47:21,840 --> 03:47:23,520
i've also got some other proof of

5531
03:47:23,520 --> 03:47:25,520
concepts to come along with

5532
03:47:25,520 --> 03:47:28,319
kfc in the future

5533
03:47:28,319 --> 03:47:30,160
one of them is protecting our av tools

5534
03:47:30,160 --> 03:47:31,920
hiding them from actors and preventing

5535
03:47:31,920 --> 03:47:34,800
them from being able to get disabled by

5536
03:47:34,800 --> 03:47:37,439
from actors disabling our tools

5537
03:47:37,439 --> 03:47:39,040
i've been playing around with stack

5538
03:47:39,040 --> 03:47:41,680
walking so we can target a specific

5539
03:47:41,680 --> 03:47:43,840
process and go through each individual

5540
03:47:43,840 --> 03:47:44,880
thread

5541
03:47:44,880 --> 03:47:46,960
walking through each of the stack frames

5542
03:47:46,960 --> 03:47:49,680
to get the rip register and then see

5543
03:47:49,680 --> 03:47:52,399
where the instruction pointer points

5544
03:47:52,399 --> 03:47:54,000
if it points to something where there's

5545
03:47:54,000 --> 03:47:55,920
not meant to be a module loaded that

5546
03:47:55,920 --> 03:47:58,840
could be evidence of reflective dll

5547
03:47:58,840 --> 03:48:00,960
injection i've also been playing around

5548
03:48:00,960 --> 03:48:02,800
with lateral movement restrictions for

5549
03:48:02,800 --> 03:48:06,399
example rdp smb ssh shouldn't be leaving

5550
03:48:06,399 --> 03:48:08,640
a web server those types of connections

5551
03:48:08,640 --> 03:48:10,239
should only really be coming into a web

5552
03:48:10,239 --> 03:48:12,319
server so how can we apply some low

5553
03:48:12,319 --> 03:48:14,080
level restrictions that an actor

5554
03:48:14,080 --> 03:48:15,840
wouldn't be able to disable

5555
03:48:15,840 --> 03:48:17,760
so even if they got onto the machine

5556
03:48:17,760 --> 03:48:19,120
they wouldn't be able to pivot into the

5557
03:48:19,120 --> 03:48:21,520
network

5558
03:48:23,040 --> 03:48:26,319
and as a bit of a wrap up

5559
03:48:26,319 --> 03:48:28,080
preventative engineering is definitely

5560
03:48:28,080 --> 03:48:29,439
worth the investment

5561
03:48:29,439 --> 03:48:32,160
reactive is quick but resource intensive

5562
03:48:32,160 --> 03:48:34,160
and why react a hundred times when you

5563
03:48:34,160 --> 03:48:37,040
could try and prevent it once

5564
03:48:37,040 --> 03:48:39,600
exploits while different share the same

5565
03:48:39,600 --> 03:48:41,359
fundamental changes to the operating

5566
03:48:41,359 --> 03:48:43,600
system underlying problems can be

5567
03:48:43,600 --> 03:48:45,680
identified rather than the specific

5568
03:48:45,680 --> 03:48:47,600
software

5569
03:48:47,600 --> 03:48:49,520
and you don't always need complex

5570
03:48:49,520 --> 03:48:50,800
solutions

5571
03:48:50,800 --> 03:48:53,439
w3w protect isn't complicated it

5572
03:48:53,439 --> 03:48:55,359
identifies three areas that could be

5573
03:48:55,359 --> 03:48:57,920
better secured for ias

5574
03:48:57,920 --> 03:48:59,600
and the windows kernel isn't as scary as

5575
03:48:59,600 --> 03:49:02,080
it seems yes it's dangerous you're gonna

5576
03:49:02,080 --> 03:49:03,600
blue screen your box a lot while you're

5577
03:49:03,600 --> 03:49:06,080
developing but it's also really powerful

5578
03:49:06,080 --> 03:49:10,760
for preventing actors on our networks

5579
03:49:10,960 --> 03:49:13,120
uh so thank you everyone for listening

5580
03:49:13,120 --> 03:49:15,120
uh to my talk here are some of my

5581
03:49:15,120 --> 03:49:16,640
socials again in case you have any

5582
03:49:16,640 --> 03:49:18,800
questions and uh interested in kernel

5583
03:49:18,800 --> 03:49:21,278
programming

5584
03:49:22,560 --> 03:49:24,479
i've dropped your follow

5585
03:49:24,479 --> 03:49:26,000
for sure

5586
03:49:26,000 --> 03:49:27,199
i uh

5587
03:49:27,199 --> 03:49:29,439
yeah i i think that we can have some

5588
03:49:29,439 --> 03:49:31,680
discussions going forward in the future

5589
03:49:31,680 --> 03:49:33,920
that was super super interesting

5590
03:49:33,920 --> 03:49:37,640
i'm into it very much

5591
03:49:38,239 --> 03:49:39,520
you're on me

5592
03:49:39,520 --> 03:49:41,600
oh there's a bingo one for you there's a

5593
03:49:41,600 --> 03:49:43,120
bingo card i think there's a lot of

5594
03:49:43,120 --> 03:49:45,120
conversation on the uh the discord

5595
03:49:45,120 --> 03:49:46,800
channel about microsoft's kernel

5596
03:49:46,800 --> 03:49:48,080
documentation

5597
03:49:48,080 --> 03:49:50,720
i.e how well documented it is i don't

5598
03:49:50,720 --> 03:49:52,479
know if you want to comment on that at

5599
03:49:52,479 --> 03:49:54,800
all oh i mean it's great some of them

5600
03:49:54,800 --> 03:49:57,920
haven't been updated since like 2003

5601
03:49:57,920 --> 03:49:59,680
and um

5602
03:49:59,680 --> 03:50:02,560
like yeah it's fantastic if you really

5603
03:50:02,560 --> 03:50:04,800
want to get into kernel programming i

5604
03:50:04,800 --> 03:50:06,479
found the best way to get up-to-date

5605
03:50:06,479 --> 03:50:09,520
information is from game hacking forums

5606
03:50:09,520 --> 03:50:11,680
so i'm not saying i can make you apex

5607
03:50:11,680 --> 03:50:12,560
hacks

5608
03:50:12,560 --> 03:50:14,399
but

5609
03:50:14,399 --> 03:50:15,520
i mean it's funny because one of the

5610
03:50:15,520 --> 03:50:17,199
other comments i think it was pingu down

5611
03:50:17,199 --> 03:50:19,120
under said the other best place to get

5612
03:50:19,120 --> 03:50:21,680
them is from the apt gangs themselves

5613
03:50:21,680 --> 03:50:23,120
because they're the ones who understand

5614
03:50:23,120 --> 03:50:24,399
how the kernels put together and

5615
03:50:24,399 --> 03:50:26,479
therefore how to break into it oh

5616
03:50:26,479 --> 03:50:27,680
they've probably got the source code

5617
03:50:27,680 --> 03:50:28,880
right

5618
03:50:28,880 --> 03:50:30,640
yes

5619
03:50:30,640 --> 03:50:32,720
um one question for hardly codeman and i

5620
03:50:32,720 --> 03:50:34,399
apologize i probably won't understand

5621
03:50:34,399 --> 03:50:36,319
this is powershell run as an

5622
03:50:36,319 --> 03:50:38,319
administrator able to prove a concept

5623
03:50:38,319 --> 03:50:40,080
for these issues or do the proof of

5624
03:50:40,080 --> 03:50:41,920
concepts need to be done in c

5625
03:50:41,920 --> 03:50:44,960
c c plus plus

5626
03:50:44,960 --> 03:50:46,160
so

5627
03:50:46,160 --> 03:50:48,239
the

5628
03:50:48,239 --> 03:50:50,720
it's really dodgy kind of the support

5629
03:50:50,720 --> 03:50:53,120
for um the kernel

5630
03:50:53,120 --> 03:50:54,640
uh libraries

5631
03:50:54,640 --> 03:50:57,520
um currently microsoft only provides

5632
03:50:57,520 --> 03:51:00,399
official support for visual studio 2019

5633
03:51:00,399 --> 03:51:02,399
so not even their most latest version of

5634
03:51:02,399 --> 03:51:03,840
visual studio

5635
03:51:03,840 --> 03:51:05,199
and

5636
03:51:05,199 --> 03:51:06,960
so

5637
03:51:06,960 --> 03:51:07,840
you

5638
03:51:07,840 --> 03:51:10,160
would if you were going to do some test

5639
03:51:10,160 --> 03:51:11,600
kernel development you would need to set

5640
03:51:11,600 --> 03:51:13,279
up your machine in a particular way

5641
03:51:13,279 --> 03:51:15,760
where you can load unsight drop drivers

5642
03:51:15,760 --> 03:51:18,319
but with administrative

5643
03:51:18,319 --> 03:51:21,760
credentials you can download it

5644
03:51:22,960 --> 03:51:25,199
fantastic apparently there is one edl

5645
03:51:25,199 --> 03:51:28,239
vendor that keeps alerting on the w3wp

5646
03:51:28,239 --> 03:51:29,439
process

5647
03:51:29,439 --> 03:51:30,880
i'm not quite sure who that is but

5648
03:51:30,880 --> 03:51:32,800
that's probably not a good thing to be

5649
03:51:32,800 --> 03:51:35,119
doing

5650
03:51:35,840 --> 03:51:37,359
but the last comment i'll make and it's

5651
03:51:37,359 --> 03:51:39,680
not a question but more comment um

5652
03:51:39,680 --> 03:51:41,359
there was a perfectly good whiteboard

5653
03:51:41,359 --> 03:51:43,439
right there i was hoping i'd see

5654
03:51:43,439 --> 03:51:45,520
exciting diagrams be drawn and

5655
03:51:45,520 --> 03:51:47,040
apparently you've been disappointing in

5656
03:51:47,040 --> 03:51:49,279
that respect

5657
03:51:49,279 --> 03:51:51,920
i'll draw a little stick figure for you

5658
03:51:51,920 --> 03:51:55,359
okay i'm a big fan of um whiteboards so

5659
03:51:55,359 --> 03:51:56,399
absolutely

5660
03:51:56,399 --> 03:51:58,399
well i'm currently showing this on my

5661
03:51:58,399 --> 03:52:00,640
giant whiteboard tv now so i i

5662
03:52:00,640 --> 03:52:03,359
completely understand but um look even

5663
03:52:03,359 --> 03:52:05,199
though i understand understood very

5664
03:52:05,199 --> 03:52:06,880
little of it i won't pretend i did it

5665
03:52:06,880 --> 03:52:09,120
was a great talk and i think a lot of

5666
03:52:09,120 --> 03:52:10,479
people understood a bit more about the

5667
03:52:10,479 --> 03:52:12,720
windows kernel through all that as well

5668
03:52:12,720 --> 03:52:15,199
fantastic entertainment for hosting this

5669
03:52:15,199 --> 03:52:17,120
and detection as well yes

5670
03:52:17,120 --> 03:52:18,720
yeah you know that's where that's where

5671
03:52:18,720 --> 03:52:20,720
my passions passions

5672
03:52:20,720 --> 03:52:22,800
lie in that detection and response and

5673
03:52:22,800 --> 03:52:24,800
pulling things apart for forensics you

5674
03:52:24,800 --> 03:52:26,319
know with um

5675
03:52:26,319 --> 03:52:28,800
finding artifacts it's one of the things

5676
03:52:28,800 --> 03:52:30,720
that's pretty cool is that we're still

5677
03:52:30,720 --> 03:52:32,960
finding artifacts within windows

5678
03:52:32,960 --> 03:52:35,760
that we can use for investigations and

5679
03:52:35,760 --> 03:52:38,160
part of that is because most of the

5680
03:52:38,160 --> 03:52:40,560
artifacts are undocumented so someone

5681
03:52:40,560 --> 03:52:41,920
stumbles across something and then all

5682
03:52:41,920 --> 03:52:43,600
of a sudden like wow

5683
03:52:43,600 --> 03:52:44,880
look what we've got here and they pull

5684
03:52:44,880 --> 03:52:46,399
it apart and

5685
03:52:46,399 --> 03:52:48,160
document it for

5686
03:52:48,160 --> 03:52:50,000
everybody else and they were never

5687
03:52:50,000 --> 03:52:51,760
intended for that purpose either which

5688
03:52:51,760 --> 03:52:52,840
is the funny

5689
03:52:52,840 --> 03:52:54,479
part

5690
03:52:54,479 --> 03:52:56,399
all right thank you very much

5691
03:52:56,399 --> 03:52:58,160
thanks very much

5692
03:52:58,160 --> 03:52:59,920
uh before we move on to andrew who's

5693
03:52:59,920 --> 03:53:01,840
just sitting there just a comment from

5694
03:53:01,840 --> 03:53:04,560
the the discord how can comfy con run

5695
03:53:04,560 --> 03:53:06,640
this whole comp without sponsorship or

5696
03:53:06,640 --> 03:53:08,880
vendors i think i've discovered the

5697
03:53:08,880 --> 03:53:11,439
answer big chicken they're running a

5698
03:53:11,439 --> 03:53:13,760
psyop campaign with comfy con as a front

5699
03:53:13,760 --> 03:53:16,479
to subtly move consumers from potatoes

5700
03:53:16,479 --> 03:53:18,960
to chickens how far does this chicken

5701
03:53:18,960 --> 03:53:20,160
hole go

5702
03:53:20,160 --> 03:53:23,520
um do we have any comment on that one uh

5703
03:53:23,520 --> 03:53:24,319
guys

5704
03:53:24,319 --> 03:53:27,439
i i'm gonna deny the mood from potatoes

5705
03:53:27,439 --> 03:53:30,080
though i'm i'm all for potatoes with my

5706
03:53:30,080 --> 03:53:32,080
fried chicken and

5707
03:53:32,080 --> 03:53:33,359
i think i tweeted about it when the last

5708
03:53:33,359 --> 03:53:34,640
time i made fried chicken i actually

5709
03:53:34,640 --> 03:53:35,439
made

5710
03:53:35,439 --> 03:53:37,920
fried potato chips what are we calling

5711
03:53:37,920 --> 03:53:39,520
them fries chips

5712
03:53:39,520 --> 03:53:41,120
and they were really good

5713
03:53:41,120 --> 03:53:43,120
double fried potato

5714
03:53:43,120 --> 03:53:45,040
for them yeah yeah

5715
03:53:45,040 --> 03:53:47,359
uh alex says that the word chicken hull

5716
03:53:47,359 --> 03:53:49,520
should never be it's uttered ever again

5717
03:53:49,520 --> 03:53:50,640
i'll just

5718
03:53:50,640 --> 03:53:52,399
i'll i'll agree with that one please

5719
03:53:52,399 --> 03:53:55,199
don't ever use those words ever

5720
03:53:55,199 --> 03:53:56,560
um

5721
03:53:56,560 --> 03:53:57,680
but

5722
03:53:57,680 --> 03:53:58,720
yeah no

5723
03:53:58,720 --> 03:54:00,560
it's not big chicken we just

5724
03:54:00,560 --> 03:54:02,960
we we're sad people who take a joke that

5725
03:54:02,960 --> 03:54:04,640
was funny like two years ago and keep

5726
03:54:04,640 --> 03:54:06,239
going with it pretty much

5727
03:54:06,239 --> 03:54:08,160
um there's no other

5728
03:54:08,160 --> 03:54:09,600
real reason

5729
03:54:09,600 --> 03:54:12,800
um but now i'm going to introduce andrew

5730
03:54:12,800 --> 03:54:14,720
uh so i'll just add him to the screen

5731
03:54:14,720 --> 03:54:17,199
andrew how are you doing today

5732
03:54:17,199 --> 03:54:19,359
i'm not doing too bad

5733
03:54:19,359 --> 03:54:20,720
is it nice and sunny with you you're in

5734
03:54:20,720 --> 03:54:22,239
adelaide too right so it must be nice

5735
03:54:22,239 --> 03:54:23,439
and sunny

5736
03:54:23,439 --> 03:54:25,680
it actually is there's um mostly blue

5737
03:54:25,680 --> 03:54:28,880
sky with a cloud out the window there so

5738
03:54:28,880 --> 03:54:30,880
that's fantastic um i have to ask

5739
03:54:30,880 --> 03:54:32,319
everyone i'm sorry do you have a

5740
03:54:32,319 --> 03:54:34,399
particular viewpoint on chicken tenders

5741
03:54:34,399 --> 03:54:36,160
versus nuggies

5742
03:54:36,160 --> 03:54:38,160
uh i'd prefer to probably have a good

5743
03:54:38,160 --> 03:54:40,560
curry for dinner instead to be honest oh

5744
03:54:40,560 --> 03:54:42,160
that's fair well you could do the

5745
03:54:42,160 --> 03:54:47,319
karachi right karaji they they

5746
03:54:49,840 --> 03:54:51,600
all right so andrew is an experienced

5747
03:54:51,600 --> 03:54:53,120
entrepreneurial software engineer and

5748
03:54:53,120 --> 03:54:54,720
security professional who spent his

5749
03:54:54,720 --> 03:54:57,439
teenage years hacking on a commodore 64

5750
03:54:57,439 --> 03:54:59,359
ignore them and forging his career

5751
03:54:59,359 --> 03:55:00,720
developing high performance signal

5752
03:55:00,720 --> 03:55:03,040
processing code uh he's always managed

5753
03:55:03,040 --> 03:55:04,399
to practice the reverse engineering and

5754
03:55:04,399 --> 03:55:06,479
embedded skills through sas and other

5755
03:55:06,479 --> 03:55:08,560
development activities but today he's

5756
03:55:08,560 --> 03:55:10,160
going to be talking about something

5757
03:55:10,160 --> 03:55:12,399
that's all dear to everyone's heart um

5758
03:55:12,399 --> 03:55:14,319
you know we all we all haven't

5759
03:55:14,319 --> 03:55:16,160
implemented don't we guys we all have

5760
03:55:16,160 --> 03:55:19,520
dmarc implemented yes we do it takes

5761
03:55:19,520 --> 03:55:20,640
three years for the australian

5762
03:55:20,640 --> 03:55:22,239
parliament to implement denmark but

5763
03:55:22,239 --> 03:55:24,560
let's not talk about it um

5764
03:55:24,560 --> 03:55:28,319
andrew feel free to take it away

5765
03:55:28,319 --> 03:55:30,560
i'm good to go i'm just seeing it oh

5766
03:55:30,560 --> 03:55:31,920
there we go awesome

5767
03:55:31,920 --> 03:55:34,319
there's my slides right

5768
03:55:34,319 --> 03:55:36,800
well thanks for coming everyone um today

5769
03:55:36,800 --> 03:55:38,720
i'm going to share a story about some

5770
03:55:38,720 --> 03:55:40,800
events that i may or may not have had to

5771
03:55:40,800 --> 03:55:42,479
deal with covering

5772
03:55:42,479 --> 03:55:44,640
some introductory aspects of well small

5773
03:55:44,640 --> 03:55:46,399
business incident response and modern

5774
03:55:46,399 --> 03:55:47,840
email security

5775
03:55:47,840 --> 03:55:49,600
i'm hoping this will be of use to others

5776
03:55:49,600 --> 03:55:50,880
who may not have encountered this

5777
03:55:50,880 --> 03:55:52,560
scenario before

5778
03:55:52,560 --> 03:55:54,479
and cyber security is so broad no one's

5779
03:55:54,479 --> 03:55:55,520
going to be across everything so

5780
03:55:55,520 --> 03:55:57,120
everything you do at some point going to

5781
03:55:57,120 --> 03:55:58,239
be a new

5782
03:55:58,239 --> 03:55:59,520
and especially if you're always trying

5783
03:55:59,520 --> 03:56:01,279
to learn so

5784
03:56:01,279 --> 03:56:03,520
a bit of background i think of myself

5785
03:56:03,520 --> 03:56:05,120
mostly as a hacker and a maker and an

5786
03:56:05,120 --> 03:56:07,279
engineer i've had a good career in

5787
03:56:07,279 --> 03:56:08,720
software development

5788
03:56:08,720 --> 03:56:10,399
but i was always interested in security

5789
03:56:10,399 --> 03:56:12,000
and made a bit of a hobby out of it

5790
03:56:12,000 --> 03:56:14,160
occasionally i was lucky enough to

5791
03:56:14,160 --> 03:56:16,160
go to linux conf and present on topics

5792
03:56:16,160 --> 03:56:18,479
like reverse engineering there

5793
03:56:18,479 --> 03:56:19,920
in my time i've done a lot of computer

5794
03:56:19,920 --> 03:56:22,000
network and embedded coding but as i

5795
03:56:22,000 --> 03:56:24,000
went on in my career for some reason

5796
03:56:24,000 --> 03:56:25,680
where i was working i found myself the

5797
03:56:25,680 --> 03:56:27,760
go-to person for

5798
03:56:27,760 --> 03:56:29,359
secure software development things

5799
03:56:29,359 --> 03:56:31,279
because no one else really seemed to

5800
03:56:31,279 --> 03:56:33,199
care about it which was interesting and

5801
03:56:33,199 --> 03:56:35,279
i mostly taught myself

5802
03:56:35,279 --> 03:56:36,960
so because of that i got more interested

5803
03:56:36,960 --> 03:56:38,720
in it professionally

5804
03:56:38,720 --> 03:56:41,520
eventually i decided i would rather

5805
03:56:41,520 --> 03:56:43,760
not spend my days developing code that

5806
03:56:43,760 --> 03:56:45,520
was never going to leave an air gap or

5807
03:56:45,520 --> 03:56:46,399
never

5808
03:56:46,399 --> 03:56:48,479
see the public so i decided to pivot

5809
03:56:48,479 --> 03:56:50,319
more to cyber security in a way from

5810
03:56:50,319 --> 03:56:51,439
software

5811
03:56:51,439 --> 03:56:53,359
but to me it's all part of the same big

5812
03:56:53,359 --> 03:56:56,319
technology mess anyway really

5813
03:56:56,319 --> 03:56:58,399
so um

5814
03:56:58,399 --> 03:57:00,160
as well as my job i'm sometimes called

5815
03:57:00,160 --> 03:57:01,920
on to help other small community groups

5816
03:57:01,920 --> 03:57:04,319
who might have i.t issues that may or

5817
03:57:04,319 --> 03:57:06,640
may not have inspired today

5818
03:57:06,640 --> 03:57:08,319
and today is a story about some crash

5819
03:57:08,319 --> 03:57:10,880
learning i had to do once

5820
03:57:10,880 --> 03:57:12,560
and a bit of a disclaimer i don't claim

5821
03:57:12,560 --> 03:57:14,080
to be an expert in all the low-level

5822
03:57:14,080 --> 03:57:15,600
detail of what i'm going to talk about

5823
03:57:15,600 --> 03:57:16,800
today but

5824
03:57:16,800 --> 03:57:18,640
so it's pitched at manager or beginner

5825
03:57:18,640 --> 03:57:20,720
level so there you go

5826
03:57:20,720 --> 03:57:22,960
so once upon a time i was helping a

5827
03:57:22,960 --> 03:57:25,199
small organization uplift their cyber

5828
03:57:25,199 --> 03:57:27,600
security a time came when i was forward

5829
03:57:27,600 --> 03:57:29,120
it was vicious email from one of the

5830
03:57:29,120 --> 03:57:30,560
frontline staff

5831
03:57:30,560 --> 03:57:32,239
so they would get all the sales emails

5832
03:57:32,239 --> 03:57:34,640
and that kind of stuff and this was a

5833
03:57:34,640 --> 03:57:36,160
good thing because it meant that

5834
03:57:36,160 --> 03:57:38,160
previous cyber security awareness

5835
03:57:38,160 --> 03:57:39,920
presentations i've done

5836
03:57:39,920 --> 03:57:42,720
were probably having some effect

5837
03:57:42,720 --> 03:57:44,319
so i was busy with priorities at the

5838
03:57:44,319 --> 03:57:46,800
time so i kind of ignored it and said

5839
03:57:46,800 --> 03:57:48,640
look it looks like a scam just market a

5840
03:57:48,640 --> 03:57:50,479
spam and move on

5841
03:57:50,479 --> 03:57:52,319
and as it turns out that's when the

5842
03:57:52,319 --> 03:57:54,160
internal narrator says and he thought

5843
03:57:54,160 --> 03:57:56,720
that was it

5844
03:57:57,520 --> 03:57:59,520
then a few days later i got another very

5845
03:57:59,520 --> 03:58:01,279
similar email forwarded from the same

5846
03:58:01,279 --> 03:58:03,680
person from the same sender

5847
03:58:03,680 --> 03:58:05,760
and i thought spammers don't usually do

5848
03:58:05,760 --> 03:58:07,279
this so

5849
03:58:07,279 --> 03:58:09,040
i figured i'd better do a bit more

5850
03:58:09,040 --> 03:58:10,560
checking and i found myself having to

5851
03:58:10,560 --> 03:58:14,080
research this thing called dmarc

5852
03:58:15,680 --> 03:58:17,439
so i'd vaguely remembered something

5853
03:58:17,439 --> 03:58:18,960
about dmarc and parliament house had

5854
03:58:18,960 --> 03:58:21,600
been in the media at some stage but this

5855
03:58:21,600 --> 03:58:23,359
organization had their email hosted with

5856
03:58:23,359 --> 03:58:25,520
a paid plan with a one of the la world's

5857
03:58:25,520 --> 03:58:27,920
largest cloud service providers so

5858
03:58:27,920 --> 03:58:29,680
surely that should be secured but you

5859
03:58:29,680 --> 03:58:32,560
know maybe that was famous last words

5860
03:58:32,560 --> 03:58:34,560
so i thought i'd better do this properly

5861
03:58:34,560 --> 03:58:37,359
so i inactivated the incident response

5862
03:58:37,359 --> 03:58:38,479
plan

5863
03:58:38,479 --> 03:58:40,479
except smalling small organizations

5864
03:58:40,479 --> 03:58:42,640
might not have an incident response plan

5865
03:58:42,640 --> 03:58:44,080
in this case at least there was a bunch

5866
03:58:44,080 --> 03:58:45,840
of bullet points in the wiki about

5867
03:58:45,840 --> 03:58:46,960
getting help

5868
03:58:46,960 --> 03:58:49,279
and what to do if something goes wrong

5869
03:58:49,279 --> 03:58:52,000
so compared to some or many small places

5870
03:58:52,000 --> 03:58:53,359
that's good

5871
03:58:53,359 --> 03:58:54,720
so over the next while i took the

5872
03:58:54,720 --> 03:58:56,319
opportunity to spend time capturing

5873
03:58:56,319 --> 03:58:57,920
lessons learned and expanding it as it

5874
03:58:57,920 --> 03:58:59,680
went along i mean i was still learning

5875
03:58:59,680 --> 03:59:02,000
about this stuff myself at this point

5876
03:59:02,000 --> 03:59:03,600
in my previous part of my career when i

5877
03:59:03,600 --> 03:59:04,800
was a software engineer incident

5878
03:59:04,800 --> 03:59:08,319
response was someone else's problem so

5879
03:59:08,319 --> 03:59:10,000
anyway i was here to assist with i.t

5880
03:59:10,000 --> 03:59:13,359
security so i organized the meeting with

5881
03:59:13,359 --> 03:59:15,840
a couple of the key members of the team

5882
03:59:15,840 --> 03:59:17,199
that meeting was going to be tomorrow so

5883
03:59:17,199 --> 03:59:18,720
then i had to

5884
03:59:18,720 --> 03:59:20,880
hit the internet and understand better

5885
03:59:20,880 --> 03:59:23,759
what was actually happening

5886
03:59:25,520 --> 03:59:27,600
so i'll leave the big list of googling i

5887
03:59:27,600 --> 03:59:28,800
did about

5888
03:59:28,800 --> 03:59:30,880
dmacc and big bounties as an exercise to

5889
03:59:30,880 --> 03:59:32,399
the reader but when i went back to

5890
03:59:32,399 --> 03:59:33,920
prepare for these slides i found the

5891
03:59:33,920 --> 03:59:36,319
most useful information was provided by

5892
03:59:36,319 --> 03:59:38,720
some blog articles by sophos

5893
03:59:38,720 --> 03:59:41,439
they're an anti-virus vendor

5894
03:59:41,439 --> 03:59:43,279
the article that i've linked there is

5895
03:59:43,279 --> 03:59:44,479
particularly interesting because they

5896
03:59:44,479 --> 03:59:46,239
had examples of messages that were

5897
03:59:46,239 --> 03:59:48,399
nearly word for word identical to the

5898
03:59:48,399 --> 03:59:51,600
one that we were sent in this case

5899
03:59:51,600 --> 03:59:53,279
so i did a bit more reading and it

5900
03:59:53,279 --> 03:59:55,359
turned out big bounty turned out to be

5901
03:59:55,359 --> 03:59:57,600
finding vulnerabilities

5902
03:59:57,600 --> 03:59:59,120
that are common to very many

5903
03:59:59,120 --> 04:00:01,920
organizations and very trivial to fix

5904
04:00:01,920 --> 04:00:03,840
and trivial to find because all you need

5905
04:00:03,840 --> 04:00:06,160
to do is type the domain name into any

5906
04:00:06,160 --> 04:00:08,479
number of tools on the web and you can

5907
04:00:08,479 --> 04:00:10,160
discover whether they have this dmarc

5908
04:00:10,160 --> 04:00:13,119
turned on properly

5909
04:00:14,319 --> 04:00:15,359
so

5910
04:00:15,359 --> 04:00:16,960
with the day to go to the next team

5911
04:00:16,960 --> 04:00:18,479
meeting i pushed on and worked out how

5912
04:00:18,479 --> 04:00:19,840
to fix it

5913
04:00:19,840 --> 04:00:21,359
as it turned out it was quite

5914
04:00:21,359 --> 04:00:22,479
straightforward

5915
04:00:22,479 --> 04:00:24,080
first you turn on something called spf

5916
04:00:24,080 --> 04:00:25,920
and you make sure it's working then you

5917
04:00:25,920 --> 04:00:27,359
turn on something called dkim and you

5918
04:00:27,359 --> 04:00:28,560
make sure that's working and then

5919
04:00:28,560 --> 04:00:29,840
finally you turn on this thing called

5920
04:00:29,840 --> 04:00:32,960
dmarc and you make sure that's working

5921
04:00:32,960 --> 04:00:34,640
isn't the world's supposed to be that

5922
04:00:34,640 --> 04:00:36,479
simple really

5923
04:00:36,479 --> 04:00:38,319
as it turned out google workspace even

5924
04:00:38,319 --> 04:00:40,239
had guided steps for configuring i wish

5925
04:00:40,239 --> 04:00:42,000
i'd taken a screenshot but i'm not going

5926
04:00:42,000 --> 04:00:45,120
to go back and turn it off

5927
04:00:45,920 --> 04:00:47,600
so

5928
04:00:47,600 --> 04:00:49,359
we had our meeting and the next step

5929
04:00:49,359 --> 04:00:51,439
apart from fixing it

5930
04:00:51,439 --> 04:00:52,640
the next step

5931
04:00:52,640 --> 04:00:54,160
apart from

5932
04:00:54,160 --> 04:00:55,439
working out whether the problem was

5933
04:00:55,439 --> 04:00:57,199
fixed was what do we do about the

5934
04:00:57,199 --> 04:00:59,600
helpful report do we need to do anything

5935
04:00:59,600 --> 04:01:01,279
else

5936
04:01:01,279 --> 04:01:03,359
i had in fact just prior to the meeting

5937
04:01:03,359 --> 04:01:04,479
contacted

5938
04:01:04,479 --> 04:01:06,479
a cyber security industry body imposed

5939
04:01:06,479 --> 04:01:08,000
in this question and while they were

5940
04:01:08,000 --> 04:01:09,760
very helpful in keeping things in

5941
04:01:09,760 --> 04:01:11,680
perspective for me i don't think they're

5942
04:01:11,680 --> 04:01:13,040
really gropped that this was a form

5943
04:01:13,040 --> 04:01:15,279
email requiring no school because they

5944
04:01:15,279 --> 04:01:16,880
suggested we should actually thank them

5945
04:01:16,880 --> 04:01:18,479
in the spirit of encouraging community

5946
04:01:18,479 --> 04:01:20,800
collaboration

5947
04:01:20,800 --> 04:01:22,960
but as part of this investigation

5948
04:01:22,960 --> 04:01:24,880
we read another sophos article where the

5949
04:01:24,880 --> 04:01:26,560
consensus was there was actually a

5950
04:01:26,560 --> 04:01:28,479
degree of moral hazard involved

5951
04:01:28,479 --> 04:01:30,080
encouraging the behavior may actually be

5952
04:01:30,080 --> 04:01:32,880
detrimental to the wider community

5953
04:01:32,880 --> 04:01:34,399
i mean we don't want everyone just

5954
04:01:34,399 --> 04:01:35,840
getting flooded all the time with

5955
04:01:35,840 --> 04:01:37,760
trivial vulnerabilities that are not

5956
04:01:37,760 --> 04:01:40,000
really vulnerable and

5957
04:01:40,000 --> 04:01:41,920
they're not really being

5958
04:01:41,920 --> 04:01:43,920
earned i suppose

5959
04:01:43,920 --> 04:01:44,960
i guess everyone will have different

5960
04:01:44,960 --> 04:01:47,120
opinions on this but we decided to make

5961
04:01:47,120 --> 04:01:48,080
a call

5962
04:01:48,080 --> 04:01:49,520
we thought perhaps you could have

5963
04:01:49,520 --> 04:01:52,080
thanked them on our in our website but

5964
04:01:52,080 --> 04:01:53,359
we couldn't even work out of their real

5965
04:01:53,359 --> 04:01:55,520
real person so you can't reward a shadow

5966
04:01:55,520 --> 04:01:57,359
with public thanks

5967
04:01:57,359 --> 04:01:59,279
so in the end we decided to instruct all

5968
04:01:59,279 --> 04:02:01,120
staff not to respond any more email to

5969
04:02:01,120 --> 04:02:02,800
this person or to any similar emails in

5970
04:02:02,800 --> 04:02:05,198
the future

5971
04:02:06,640 --> 04:02:08,640
at this point i think it's a good time

5972
04:02:08,640 --> 04:02:10,239
to go through what the actual problem

5973
04:02:10,239 --> 04:02:12,239
was in a bit more detail

5974
04:02:12,239 --> 04:02:14,640
so what happens

5975
04:02:14,640 --> 04:02:16,560
someone typed their domain name into a

5976
04:02:16,560 --> 04:02:18,359
website in this case it was

5977
04:02:18,359 --> 04:02:20,319
mxtoolbox.com we think

5978
04:02:20,319 --> 04:02:22,479
and they sent us an email hoping for a

5979
04:02:22,479 --> 04:02:23,600
reward

5980
04:02:23,600 --> 04:02:25,199
they basically copied and pasted it from

5981
04:02:25,199 --> 04:02:27,600
the internet as far as we can tell

5982
04:02:27,600 --> 04:02:29,120
they're probably encouraged by articles

5983
04:02:29,120 --> 04:02:30,880
like this one and this is where i work

5984
04:02:30,880 --> 04:02:34,080
out whether i can oops

5985
04:02:35,199 --> 04:02:36,720
and i had it up on the web browser next

5986
04:02:36,720 --> 04:02:38,720
to it but let's just keep moving

5987
04:02:38,720 --> 04:02:40,080
but basically there's an article on

5988
04:02:40,080 --> 04:02:41,439
medium there where there's this guy

5989
04:02:41,439 --> 04:02:42,640
basically

5990
04:02:42,640 --> 04:02:43,920
going through all the steps that someone

5991
04:02:43,920 --> 04:02:45,680
needs to do to go looking for companies

5992
04:02:45,680 --> 04:02:47,760
type the name in send them an email and

5993
04:02:47,760 --> 04:02:51,040
see if you can get a reward out of them

5994
04:02:53,520 --> 04:02:54,840
so what happens when you go to

5995
04:02:54,840 --> 04:02:56,960
mxtoolbox.com or you can type in the

5996
04:02:56,960 --> 04:02:58,560
domain name and it will tell you some

5997
04:02:58,560 --> 04:03:00,479
information as to whether this dmarc is

5998
04:03:00,479 --> 04:03:02,560
actually working or not

5999
04:03:02,560 --> 04:03:04,319
and at this point in time before i fixed

6000
04:03:04,319 --> 04:03:06,239
it for this organization

6001
04:03:06,239 --> 04:03:07,760
you can see there's all red exclamation

6002
04:03:07,760 --> 04:03:09,359
marks

6003
04:03:09,359 --> 04:03:10,720
and various statements about records not

6004
04:03:10,720 --> 04:03:12,239
being found related

6005
04:03:12,239 --> 04:03:13,600
so i guess that tells you there's some

6006
04:03:13,600 --> 04:03:16,160
kind of problem

6007
04:03:16,800 --> 04:03:18,720
is it a real problem

6008
04:03:18,720 --> 04:03:19,600
so

6009
04:03:19,600 --> 04:03:21,120
the vulnerability that they're actually

6010
04:03:21,120 --> 04:03:22,319
saying is

6011
04:03:22,319 --> 04:03:24,399
someone can abuse your email to send

6012
04:03:24,399 --> 04:03:26,000
someone else an email that looks like it

6013
04:03:26,000 --> 04:03:27,520
comes from you when they look at the

6014
04:03:27,520 --> 04:03:28,720
front field

6015
04:03:28,720 --> 04:03:30,000
and of course

6016
04:03:30,000 --> 04:03:31,199
if you're sending it to someone that's

6017
04:03:31,199 --> 04:03:32,880
not sophisticated enough to check they

6018
04:03:32,880 --> 04:03:34,720
can do targeted phishing they can use

6019
04:03:34,720 --> 04:03:35,920
that to get them to send them bank

6020
04:03:35,920 --> 04:03:37,520
details or anything

6021
04:03:37,520 --> 04:03:38,960
so there's definitely a vulnerability

6022
04:03:38,960 --> 04:03:41,599
that exists

6023
04:03:42,399 --> 04:03:44,239
so working backwards a bit here what is

6024
04:03:44,239 --> 04:03:45,520
dmarc

6025
04:03:45,520 --> 04:03:47,439
domain based message authentication

6026
04:03:47,439 --> 04:03:48,880
reporting and performance so that's a

6027
04:03:48,880 --> 04:03:50,319
bit of a mouthful

6028
04:03:50,319 --> 04:03:52,080
all the detail is on wikipedia like all

6029
04:03:52,080 --> 04:03:53,359
these things but

6030
04:03:53,359 --> 04:03:55,040
it turns out if you have something else

6031
04:03:55,040 --> 04:03:56,800
called the spf dkim

6032
04:03:56,800 --> 04:03:59,439
a recipient can use dmarc to look you up

6033
04:03:59,439 --> 04:04:00,960
when you send them an email at the

6034
04:04:00,960 --> 04:04:02,080
server

6035
04:04:02,080 --> 04:04:04,399
and they can check if it's failing or

6036
04:04:04,399 --> 04:04:07,040
look suspicious due to spf or dkim

6037
04:04:07,040 --> 04:04:09,680
they can go back to your

6038
04:04:09,680 --> 04:04:11,760
your own server's settings in dns and

6039
04:04:11,760 --> 04:04:13,279
decide whether you want it to be

6040
04:04:13,279 --> 04:04:16,160
rejected or quarantined from their path

6041
04:04:16,160 --> 04:04:18,000
now i've got a little tongue tied on

6042
04:04:18,000 --> 04:04:19,600
that but basically it's saying it's a

6043
04:04:19,600 --> 04:04:21,120
mechanism where they can check that you

6044
04:04:21,120 --> 04:04:24,479
genuinely did send you

6045
04:04:26,160 --> 04:04:27,680
but in this day and age surely we

6046
04:04:27,680 --> 04:04:30,479
shouldn't be able to speed fema i mean

6047
04:04:30,479 --> 04:04:32,800
well smtp which is the email protocol is

6048
04:04:32,800 --> 04:04:35,120
nearly as old as the internet

6049
04:04:35,120 --> 04:04:36,800
and it was designed to work at a time

6050
04:04:36,800 --> 04:04:38,080
when things were simple and everything

6051
04:04:38,080 --> 04:04:40,880
worked in text

6052
04:04:41,199 --> 04:04:42,960
you can use telnet or any client that

6053
04:04:42,960 --> 04:04:45,760
can talk tcp to talk to an email server

6054
04:04:45,760 --> 04:04:47,760
these days it's wrapped in tls but that

6055
04:04:47,760 --> 04:04:49,920
just encrypts the traffic to the server

6056
04:04:49,920 --> 04:04:51,520
it doesn't actually do anything about

6057
04:04:51,520 --> 04:04:54,720
what goes through the encrypted channel

6058
04:04:54,720 --> 04:04:56,560
and this is just a little video i made

6059
04:04:56,560 --> 04:04:59,359
earlier just to demonstrate um

6060
04:04:59,359 --> 04:05:00,800
so i just had a computer set up running

6061
04:05:00,800 --> 04:05:02,720
linux with the default mail server

6062
04:05:02,720 --> 04:05:04,720
installed and

6063
04:05:04,720 --> 04:05:06,720
i can send it any old rubbish and in

6064
04:05:06,720 --> 04:05:08,319
theory if the destination that it wants

6065
04:05:08,319 --> 04:05:10,800
to go to actually exists it can

6066
04:05:10,800 --> 04:05:12,160
get there

6067
04:05:12,160 --> 04:05:14,080
so here it's like i can pretend i'm

6068
04:05:14,080 --> 04:05:16,479
roland even though i'm not and i can

6069
04:05:16,479 --> 04:05:18,800
send an email to andrew and andrew if he

6070
04:05:18,800 --> 04:05:20,080
just looks at the from

6071
04:05:20,080 --> 04:05:23,359
will think oh that's from roland

6072
04:05:24,080 --> 04:05:27,600
oh you get the general idea anyway

6073
04:05:29,680 --> 04:05:32,960
i should have made this a bit faster

6074
04:05:35,680 --> 04:05:37,199
yeah

6075
04:05:37,199 --> 04:05:38,399
so

6076
04:05:38,399 --> 04:05:39,920
uh these days of course you should be

6077
04:05:39,920 --> 04:05:41,760
using ssh in situations where you used

6078
04:05:41,760 --> 04:05:43,520
to use telnet

6079
04:05:43,520 --> 04:05:45,439
um but email of course is a significant

6080
04:05:45,439 --> 04:05:47,040
part of the internet still it's just the

6081
04:05:47,040 --> 04:05:48,319
rest of the internet's grown a lot more

6082
04:05:48,319 --> 04:05:49,920
so a lot of work has gone into making

6083
04:05:49,920 --> 04:05:52,560
you not more secure

6084
04:05:52,560 --> 04:05:55,199
so now we know what we know

6085
04:05:55,199 --> 04:05:57,359
it turned out that this organisation

6086
04:05:57,359 --> 04:06:00,080
didn't have any of dkim spf or diemer

6087
04:06:00,080 --> 04:06:01,359
turned on

6088
04:06:01,359 --> 04:06:03,600
this can happen easily

6089
04:06:03,600 --> 04:06:04,560
google

6090
04:06:04,560 --> 04:06:06,319
has good wizards but if your email set

6091
04:06:06,319 --> 04:06:07,680
up a number of years ago they might have

6092
04:06:07,680 --> 04:06:09,120
missed the wizard or perhaps it was set

6093
04:06:09,120 --> 04:06:11,359
up by a contractor or non-tech person

6094
04:06:11,359 --> 04:06:12,720
we're not necessarily experts in the

6095
04:06:12,720 --> 04:06:15,840
low-level security stuff

6096
04:06:16,319 --> 04:06:17,279
so

6097
04:06:17,279 --> 04:06:19,600
before we have dmarc we need spf what is

6098
04:06:19,600 --> 04:06:22,319
spf it's sender policy framework

6099
04:06:22,319 --> 04:06:24,080
that checks for spoofing of the sending

6100
04:06:24,080 --> 04:06:25,120
server

6101
04:06:25,120 --> 04:06:26,479
note that this is different in that it

6102
04:06:26,479 --> 04:06:27,920
does not actually check the email

6103
04:06:27,920 --> 04:06:30,319
addresses just the server but that's a

6104
04:06:30,319 --> 04:06:31,840
good start and it's a necessary

6105
04:06:31,840 --> 04:06:35,040
precondition for demo

6106
04:06:37,279 --> 04:06:39,600
if you need to secure a system when you

6107
04:06:39,600 --> 04:06:41,120
set up a new email system the first

6108
04:06:41,120 --> 04:06:42,800
thing you need to do is add this spf

6109
04:06:42,800 --> 04:06:44,880
record to your dns

6110
04:06:44,880 --> 04:06:46,319
now the example i'm showing on the

6111
04:06:46,319 --> 04:06:48,880
screen basically says

6112
04:06:48,880 --> 04:06:51,520
unless a server unless an email is

6113
04:06:51,520 --> 04:06:52,840
coming from

6114
04:06:52,840 --> 04:06:54,800
3.3.3.3 or

6115
04:06:54,800 --> 04:06:56,399
from any of the addresses that google

6116
04:06:56,399 --> 04:06:58,000
says are okay

6117
04:06:58,000 --> 04:07:00,000
then that server is not genuine and the

6118
04:07:00,000 --> 04:07:01,760
other end should treat it as suspicious

6119
04:07:01,760 --> 04:07:04,160
and either reject it or quarantine it or

6120
04:07:04,160 --> 04:07:08,039
take whatever action they require

6121
04:07:10,800 --> 04:07:12,399
and you can test this yourself once

6122
04:07:12,399 --> 04:07:13,920
you've set it up using the d command on

6123
04:07:13,920 --> 04:07:16,160
linux

6124
04:07:16,160 --> 04:07:18,160
so i've used fast mail as an example

6125
04:07:18,160 --> 04:07:19,279
there because

6126
04:07:19,279 --> 04:07:21,040
some email providers as i work out with

6127
04:07:21,040 --> 04:07:23,120
fast mail when i signed up to it you

6128
04:07:23,120 --> 04:07:24,720
don't have to do any of this yourself

6129
04:07:24,720 --> 04:07:26,640
stuff yourself it's all done so i wasn't

6130
04:07:26,640 --> 04:07:28,640
quite sure why

6131
04:07:28,640 --> 04:07:30,560
gmail needed it done and it wasn't done

6132
04:07:30,560 --> 04:07:32,080
by default but

6133
04:07:32,080 --> 04:07:34,080
i'm not an expert in a lot of that

6134
04:07:34,080 --> 04:07:37,840
business software either

6135
04:07:38,960 --> 04:07:40,880
of course a big system like gmail has

6136
04:07:40,880 --> 04:07:43,439
many ip addresses so these spf records

6137
04:07:43,439 --> 04:07:45,439
cascade so if we go back to the previous

6138
04:07:45,439 --> 04:07:48,080
one you can see

6139
04:07:48,080 --> 04:07:49,600
in fast mail's example it uses

6140
04:07:49,600 --> 04:07:51,920
fpf.messagingengine.com

6141
04:07:51,920 --> 04:07:53,040
and

6142
04:07:53,040 --> 04:07:55,439
for google it uses spf.google.com so you

6143
04:07:55,439 --> 04:07:56,880
can actually dig

6144
04:07:56,880 --> 04:07:58,960
those as well and find out

6145
04:07:58,960 --> 04:08:01,199
all the valid email addresses so at the

6146
04:08:01,199 --> 04:08:03,120
other end eventually if you send email

6147
04:08:03,120 --> 04:08:04,720
via fast mail if it doesn't come from

6148
04:08:04,720 --> 04:08:06,479
one of these ips then other servers on

6149
04:08:06,479 --> 04:08:09,920
the internet are supposed to reject it

6150
04:08:10,800 --> 04:08:12,239
and of course there was another part

6151
04:08:12,239 --> 04:08:14,399
there called dkin which is domain keys

6152
04:08:14,399 --> 04:08:16,080
identified email

6153
04:08:16,080 --> 04:08:18,080
basically this uses cryptography to

6154
04:08:18,080 --> 04:08:19,760
provide a degree of confidence that the

6155
04:08:19,760 --> 04:08:21,600
sender is intimate

6156
04:08:21,600 --> 04:08:23,120
to make dkin work you also have to

6157
04:08:23,120 --> 04:08:24,720
update the dns

6158
04:08:24,720 --> 04:08:27,199
so basically it cryptographically signs

6159
04:08:27,199 --> 04:08:29,040
parts of the header to make sure they

6160
04:08:29,040 --> 04:08:31,040
haven't been tampered with along the way

6161
04:08:31,040 --> 04:08:33,199
and it also means then that

6162
04:08:33,199 --> 04:08:34,880
you can't spoof

6163
04:08:34,880 --> 04:08:37,040
if you can get past spf because you

6164
04:08:37,040 --> 04:08:38,560
don't have the private key of the sender

6165
04:08:38,560 --> 04:08:40,880
to be able to sign it

6166
04:08:40,880 --> 04:08:42,720
and what you actually do is you have a

6167
04:08:42,720 --> 04:08:44,319
public key that gets published in dns

6168
04:08:44,319 --> 04:08:46,080
and so the receivers can then get that

6169
04:08:46,080 --> 04:08:47,279
and then use that to check your

6170
04:08:47,279 --> 04:08:49,760
signature

6171
04:08:50,239 --> 04:08:51,680
this is a little bit more complicated

6172
04:08:51,680 --> 04:08:53,520
though because you need to find the

6173
04:08:53,520 --> 04:08:55,920
right part of your um

6174
04:08:55,920 --> 04:08:58,159
the right part of your email provider

6175
04:08:58,159 --> 04:09:01,520
settings to find out where the key is

6176
04:09:01,520 --> 04:09:03,040
and i think this slide's coming out of

6177
04:09:03,040 --> 04:09:05,199
order but google as i mentioned before

6178
04:09:05,199 --> 04:09:07,120
has a really good

6179
04:09:07,120 --> 04:09:08,880
good wizard in there now that helps you

6180
04:09:08,880 --> 04:09:11,759
settle this stuff up

6181
04:09:11,920 --> 04:09:14,000
so i do manage to get a screenshot out

6182
04:09:14,000 --> 04:09:16,239
of the google workspace version of this

6183
04:09:16,239 --> 04:09:17,120
so

6184
04:09:17,120 --> 04:09:19,040
you can go into the dkim area and you

6185
04:09:19,040 --> 04:09:20,560
can generate a record with the public

6186
04:09:20,560 --> 04:09:22,399
key that you can then publish to your

6187
04:09:22,399 --> 04:09:25,600
dns to make dkin work properly

6188
04:09:25,600 --> 04:09:27,520
i've got no idea how to do this with

6189
04:09:27,520 --> 04:09:29,600
your self-hosting groomer

6190
04:09:29,600 --> 04:09:31,199
i would assume microsoft and all the

6191
04:09:31,199 --> 04:09:33,040
rest of them have similar screens to

6192
04:09:33,040 --> 04:09:36,080
this in their settings

6193
04:09:37,439 --> 04:09:40,960
so we have the preconditions we have spf

6194
04:09:40,960 --> 04:09:42,960
and we have d him so we can finally fix

6195
04:09:42,960 --> 04:09:44,000
d mark

6196
04:09:44,000 --> 04:09:45,840
which again is another change to your

6197
04:09:45,840 --> 04:09:48,159
dns settings

6198
04:09:48,159 --> 04:09:49,439
as part of setting this up you have to

6199
04:09:49,439 --> 04:09:50,880
think about a couple of things because

6200
04:09:50,880 --> 04:09:53,520
it works in two parts there's

6201
04:09:53,520 --> 04:09:55,680
email that claims to come from your

6202
04:09:55,680 --> 04:09:57,680
domain and then it can also separately

6203
04:09:57,680 --> 04:10:00,000
manage emails that come from sub-domain

6204
04:10:00,000 --> 04:10:01,600
of your domain

6205
04:10:01,600 --> 04:10:04,399
because you can set it up so that

6206
04:10:04,399 --> 04:10:05,199
if

6207
04:10:05,199 --> 04:10:07,120
the way the dmarc actually works is the

6208
04:10:07,120 --> 04:10:09,040
recipient of your email can check if

6209
04:10:09,040 --> 04:10:12,319
this email passes spf or fails it or if

6210
04:10:12,319 --> 04:10:15,199
it passes or fails dkim what do i do

6211
04:10:15,199 --> 04:10:16,000
and if

6212
04:10:16,000 --> 04:10:18,640
it fails spf and or dkim you can decide

6213
04:10:18,640 --> 04:10:20,479
that the other end should reject your

6214
04:10:20,479 --> 04:10:22,880
messages or just quarantine them

6215
04:10:22,880 --> 04:10:24,800
the reason for quarantining is obviously

6216
04:10:24,800 --> 04:10:28,159
debugging or when you set it up

6217
04:10:28,319 --> 04:10:30,399
you can also give it an email address to

6218
04:10:30,399 --> 04:10:32,080
the other systems will actually let you

6219
04:10:32,080 --> 04:10:35,520
know that this is happening

6220
04:10:36,399 --> 04:10:38,560
so i've got an example here of using dig

6221
04:10:38,560 --> 04:10:42,080
to check at dmarc record

6222
04:10:42,960 --> 04:10:43,760
so

6223
04:10:43,760 --> 04:10:47,120
hopefully the next slide yeah so

6224
04:10:47,120 --> 04:10:48,479
basically what it's saying if you have

6225
04:10:48,479 --> 04:10:50,159
this text record

6226
04:10:50,159 --> 04:10:52,080
server that's receiving email from you

6227
04:10:52,080 --> 04:10:53,600
can look this up

6228
04:10:53,600 --> 04:10:55,520
and basically saying p equals reject

6229
04:10:55,520 --> 04:10:57,439
means

6230
04:10:57,439 --> 04:10:59,439
if they get an email that claims to come

6231
04:10:59,439 --> 04:11:00,399
from you

6232
04:11:00,399 --> 04:11:03,279
that failed the spf test or the dkim

6233
04:11:03,279 --> 04:11:06,560
test then it will reject it with a 500

6234
04:11:06,560 --> 04:11:08,159
or whatever the error code is back to

6235
04:11:08,159 --> 04:11:09,920
the spoofing server that's trying to

6236
04:11:09,920 --> 04:11:11,520
send an email to them claiming to be

6237
04:11:11,520 --> 04:11:12,800
from you

6238
04:11:12,800 --> 04:11:14,399
the sp means

6239
04:11:14,399 --> 04:11:16,399
if an email arrives on the subdomain you

6240
04:11:16,399 --> 04:11:18,239
want it quarantined

6241
04:11:18,239 --> 04:11:19,600
and i'll go into the better reason for

6242
04:11:19,600 --> 04:11:22,080
that in a minute the pct one means

6243
04:11:22,080 --> 04:11:24,239
quarantine 100 of all failed records

6244
04:11:24,239 --> 04:11:26,159
when you're quarantined

6245
04:11:26,159 --> 04:11:27,680
and the last one is an email address

6246
04:11:27,680 --> 04:11:30,880
that you can get reports sent to

6247
04:11:31,680 --> 04:11:33,439
so the deal with the sub domain is if

6248
04:11:33,439 --> 04:11:35,439
you are hosting your own on-premise

6249
04:11:35,439 --> 04:11:37,279
server say you've got a ci system that

6250
04:11:37,279 --> 04:11:40,560
you want to send email to just yourself

6251
04:11:40,560 --> 04:11:42,399
that's going to look like it's coming

6252
04:11:42,399 --> 04:11:44,040
from

6253
04:11:44,040 --> 04:11:46,239
ci.yourdomain.com and as a general you

6254
04:11:46,239 --> 04:11:48,399
one you don't want that going out onto

6255
04:11:48,399 --> 04:11:50,479
the internet

6256
04:11:50,479 --> 04:11:52,000
and two

6257
04:11:52,000 --> 04:11:54,000
systems like google workspace get an

6258
04:11:54,000 --> 04:11:56,560
email from that their own mechanisms for

6259
04:11:56,560 --> 04:11:58,399
checking whether suspicious are going to

6260
04:11:58,399 --> 04:12:01,840
get flagged because it's not coming

6261
04:12:01,840 --> 04:12:04,159
from one of your spf recognized systems

6262
04:12:04,159 --> 04:12:05,120
perhaps

6263
04:12:05,120 --> 04:12:07,199
so what you want to do is

6264
04:12:07,199 --> 04:12:10,640
default those ones to being quarantined

6265
04:12:10,640 --> 04:12:14,080
and that way you won't lose them

6266
04:12:15,600 --> 04:12:17,439
and like i said i'm not a deep expert on

6267
04:12:17,439 --> 04:12:19,520
any of this all those dns records i've

6268
04:12:19,520 --> 04:12:21,439
showed you have some quite complex and

6269
04:12:21,439 --> 04:12:23,600
custom syntax for each of them

6270
04:12:23,600 --> 04:12:25,199
and all i've really covered today is

6271
04:12:25,199 --> 04:12:26,960
fairly strict simple scenarios where

6272
04:12:26,960 --> 04:12:29,439
you're saying reject everything bad

6273
04:12:29,439 --> 04:12:31,120
and there's only one or two ip addresses

6274
04:12:31,120 --> 04:12:32,720
if you're a large company with lots of

6275
04:12:32,720 --> 04:12:34,960
servers and lots of edge cases probably

6276
04:12:34,960 --> 04:12:37,919
it's quite different

6277
04:12:40,159 --> 04:12:41,760
but this is what we're looking for after

6278
04:12:41,760 --> 04:12:43,760
having all the settings set up you come

6279
04:12:43,760 --> 04:12:45,439
back and you type your domain name into

6280
04:12:45,439 --> 04:12:46,800
one of those sites

6281
04:12:46,800 --> 04:12:48,479
and it all comes up green

6282
04:12:48,479 --> 04:12:50,080
and what that means is the next time one

6283
04:12:50,080 --> 04:12:51,840
of these

6284
04:12:51,840 --> 04:12:53,439
friendly helpers comes along and types

6285
04:12:53,439 --> 04:12:55,359
your domain name into one of those sites

6286
04:12:55,359 --> 04:12:56,960
it's also going to come up all green for

6287
04:12:56,960 --> 04:12:59,040
them and they won't send you any more of

6288
04:12:59,040 --> 04:13:02,479
those annoying emails

6289
04:13:06,159 --> 04:13:07,840
as part of this process i just did a bit

6290
04:13:07,840 --> 04:13:09,680
more research

6291
04:13:09,680 --> 04:13:11,120
personally if i was to find a

6292
04:13:11,120 --> 04:13:12,720
vulnerability somewhere and i wanted a

6293
04:13:12,720 --> 04:13:14,960
bit of fame or fortune i'd want to be

6294
04:13:14,960 --> 04:13:16,080
found

6295
04:13:16,080 --> 04:13:18,720
the emails that came in we couldn't find

6296
04:13:18,720 --> 04:13:20,560
the email referenced anywhere they

6297
04:13:20,560 --> 04:13:23,279
didn't mention github or anything else

6298
04:13:23,279 --> 04:13:26,000
i checked the ip address and it resolved

6299
04:13:26,000 --> 04:13:28,720
to a non-major foreign country

6300
04:13:28,720 --> 04:13:31,040
uh looked like an isp belonging looked

6301
04:13:31,040 --> 04:13:32,560
like it belonged to an isp with a

6302
04:13:32,560 --> 04:13:33,840
pattern of supporting non-friendly

6303
04:13:33,840 --> 04:13:35,359
actors when we checked it on a few

6304
04:13:35,359 --> 04:13:38,159
public databases

6305
04:13:38,159 --> 04:13:40,479
so just as a bit of

6306
04:13:40,479 --> 04:13:42,479
extra security control i mean probably

6307
04:13:42,479 --> 04:13:43,920
doesn't make a lot of difference but we

6308
04:13:43,920 --> 04:13:45,520
added that

6309
04:13:45,520 --> 04:13:49,520
that isps asn to their cloud flare so

6310
04:13:49,520 --> 04:13:51,040
if this person was going to come back

6311
04:13:51,040 --> 04:13:52,319
and look for this company to see if they

6312
04:13:52,319 --> 04:13:53,600
were ever going to sponsor emails they

6313
04:13:53,600 --> 04:13:56,960
wouldn't even find the website anymore

6314
04:14:01,680 --> 04:14:04,960
so there's a few lessons learned

6315
04:14:05,120 --> 04:14:06,560
whenever you're helping an organization

6316
04:14:06,560 --> 04:14:08,159
especially if you're just starting there

6317
04:14:08,159 --> 04:14:10,880
or regularly order all the security

6318
04:14:10,880 --> 04:14:12,159
settings again because you don't

6319
04:14:12,159 --> 04:14:13,920
necessarily know

6320
04:14:13,920 --> 04:14:15,199
whether they were set up right in the

6321
04:14:15,199 --> 04:14:17,680
first place

6322
04:14:17,680 --> 04:14:20,000
especially for all your cloud systems

6323
04:14:20,000 --> 04:14:21,840
and the online help and and the wizards

6324
04:14:21,840 --> 04:14:23,120
are always getting better in google and

6325
04:14:23,120 --> 04:14:25,279
microsoft and everything else so

6326
04:14:25,279 --> 04:14:26,720
it's always worth going back time to

6327
04:14:26,720 --> 04:14:28,399
time to see if they've improved things

6328
04:14:28,399 --> 04:14:29,920
um

6329
04:14:29,920 --> 04:14:32,319
and having some sort of plan

6330
04:14:32,319 --> 04:14:34,080
i guess your typical small organization

6331
04:14:34,080 --> 04:14:36,159
that doesn't have any i.t staff might

6332
04:14:36,159 --> 04:14:38,800
not even realize they need a plan but

6333
04:14:38,800 --> 04:14:42,000
i think he's still going to help them

6334
04:14:42,880 --> 04:14:44,800
and i guess if you get a bug report this

6335
04:14:44,800 --> 04:14:46,000
is the only one i've ever had to deal

6336
04:14:46,000 --> 04:14:49,199
with of any sort so far

6337
04:14:49,199 --> 04:14:51,040
i guess it should be reasonably apparent

6338
04:14:51,040 --> 04:14:53,279
whether it's a genuine good faith report

6339
04:14:53,279 --> 04:14:55,120
of some kind so

6340
04:14:55,120 --> 04:14:56,560
like in my case i went out to the

6341
04:14:56,560 --> 04:14:58,640
internet and googled it

6342
04:14:58,640 --> 04:15:00,159
found the advice like on the saphos

6343
04:15:00,159 --> 04:15:02,720
blogs and followed that

6344
04:15:02,720 --> 04:15:03,760
you know

6345
04:15:03,760 --> 04:15:06,479
a more organized organization

6346
04:15:06,479 --> 04:15:08,000
presumably you can come up with

6347
04:15:08,000 --> 04:15:11,279
something a bit more sophisticated

6348
04:15:13,520 --> 04:15:16,319
oh and i forgot the dmarc reports so

6349
04:15:16,319 --> 04:15:17,680
that email address you added to the

6350
04:15:17,680 --> 04:15:19,120
dmarc dns

6351
04:15:19,120 --> 04:15:20,800
means you'll start getting emails with

6352
04:15:20,800 --> 04:15:23,439
these wonderful xml attachments

6353
04:15:23,439 --> 04:15:25,199
in this organization's case they mostly

6354
04:15:25,199 --> 04:15:26,960
came from google as that was their email

6355
04:15:26,960 --> 04:15:28,720
provider but others on the internet that

6356
04:15:28,720 --> 04:15:30,159
have received mail from you will also

6357
04:15:30,159 --> 04:15:31,520
send them

6358
04:15:31,520 --> 04:15:33,600
a typical small small organization

6359
04:15:33,600 --> 04:15:35,520
probably doesn't care

6360
04:15:35,520 --> 04:15:37,199
a larger more organized one might want

6361
04:15:37,199 --> 04:15:39,279
to track how well dmacc working just to

6362
04:15:39,279 --> 04:15:40,960
get some statistics

6363
04:15:40,960 --> 04:15:42,800
any any company above a certain size

6364
04:15:42,800 --> 04:15:44,399
will almost certainly

6365
04:15:44,399 --> 04:15:46,159
want to outsource some of this

6366
04:15:46,159 --> 04:15:47,840
processing to a commercial management

6367
04:15:47,840 --> 04:15:49,040
service and i don't have any

6368
04:15:49,040 --> 04:15:50,479
recommendations there because i haven't

6369
04:15:50,479 --> 04:15:52,800
needed to deal with that either

6370
04:15:52,800 --> 04:15:55,039
but

6371
04:15:56,000 --> 04:15:57,920
you get this and it's probably you know

6372
04:15:57,920 --> 04:16:00,560
20 30 kilobytes every day if you've got

6373
04:16:00,560 --> 04:16:02,399
any reasonable volume of email it starts

6374
04:16:02,399 --> 04:16:05,198
to get a bit annoying

6375
04:16:06,640 --> 04:16:08,000
it's useful though because it can help

6376
04:16:08,000 --> 04:16:09,600
you debug when you're still setting up

6377
04:16:09,600 --> 04:16:10,880
and you've forgotten about some

6378
04:16:10,880 --> 04:16:12,399
on-premise server that needs to send

6379
04:16:12,399 --> 04:16:14,880
messages or maybe you've got another sub

6380
04:16:14,880 --> 04:16:16,960
domain that you need to work

6381
04:16:16,960 --> 04:16:19,680
so basically for every ip address that

6382
04:16:19,680 --> 04:16:22,080
the receivers have got from you

6383
04:16:22,080 --> 04:16:24,399
it keeps track of whether the emails

6384
04:16:24,399 --> 04:16:26,960
coming from that ip passed or failed spf

6385
04:16:26,960 --> 04:16:28,560
and dkim and whether they were rejected

6386
04:16:28,560 --> 04:16:30,960
or quarantined and so on

6387
04:16:30,960 --> 04:16:32,880
so that's kind of useful um the example

6388
04:16:32,880 --> 04:16:33,680
i've

6389
04:16:33,680 --> 04:16:36,640
put up on the screen is a report where

6390
04:16:36,640 --> 04:16:38,239
another internet provider on the

6391
04:16:38,239 --> 04:16:40,239
internet got an email that looked like

6392
04:16:40,239 --> 04:16:41,680
it was from you but was from that ip

6393
04:16:41,680 --> 04:16:43,520
address which was not you therefore it

6394
04:16:43,520 --> 04:16:47,920
failed spf and d him and was rejected

6395
04:16:52,399 --> 04:16:53,840
of course i'm a software engineer and a

6396
04:16:53,840 --> 04:16:55,359
hacker so i decided to write a google

6397
04:16:55,359 --> 04:16:57,199
apps script instead

6398
04:16:57,199 --> 04:17:00,159
so what was happening is all these d

6399
04:17:00,159 --> 04:17:02,720
all these dmarc messages they were all

6400
04:17:02,720 --> 04:17:03,680
coming

6401
04:17:03,680 --> 04:17:05,600
into a special email address in this

6402
04:17:05,600 --> 04:17:07,680
group's google workspace so it was quite

6403
04:17:07,680 --> 04:17:08,800
easy to

6404
04:17:08,800 --> 04:17:10,800
to write a rule to file them all out of

6405
04:17:10,800 --> 04:17:12,880
the email into a folder

6406
04:17:12,880 --> 04:17:15,279
and then once a day run a script that

6407
04:17:15,279 --> 04:17:17,040
would go through them all extract out

6408
04:17:17,040 --> 04:17:18,560
the xml

6409
04:17:18,560 --> 04:17:21,040
and then copy it all to a google sheet

6410
04:17:21,040 --> 04:17:22,720
when i say just i mean you know it was a

6411
04:17:22,720 --> 04:17:25,439
couple of days worth of effort but um

6412
04:17:25,439 --> 04:17:27,040
it let me come back later and have a

6413
04:17:27,040 --> 04:17:28,960
look and look at their stats and you can

6414
04:17:28,960 --> 04:17:31,199
sort of get an idea there

6415
04:17:31,199 --> 04:17:32,479
you can see

6416
04:17:32,479 --> 04:17:34,319
the green is where

6417
04:17:34,319 --> 04:17:37,840
emails were not rejected

6418
04:17:37,840 --> 04:17:39,680
they're coming either from google or

6419
04:17:39,680 --> 04:17:42,720
from their own on house server and all

6420
04:17:42,720 --> 04:17:44,479
the other addresses and accounts are

6421
04:17:44,479 --> 04:17:45,359
from

6422
04:17:45,359 --> 04:17:47,199
ip addresses that are not ours nothing

6423
04:17:47,199 --> 04:17:48,960
to do with us but attempted to send an

6424
04:17:48,960 --> 04:17:50,159
email to another provider of the

6425
04:17:50,159 --> 04:17:52,399
internet claim to come from us

6426
04:17:52,399 --> 04:17:54,479
so it gives you an idea there that we've

6427
04:17:54,479 --> 04:17:56,000
had

6428
04:17:56,000 --> 04:17:58,720
since dmarc was blocking stuff perhaps

6429
04:17:58,720 --> 04:18:00,880
almost one percent of email to this

6430
04:18:00,880 --> 04:18:02,000
place

6431
04:18:02,000 --> 04:18:04,080
of email sorry

6432
04:18:04,080 --> 04:18:06,399
almost one percent of email arriving at

6433
04:18:06,399 --> 04:18:07,439
other servers on the internet that

6434
04:18:07,439 --> 04:18:08,880
claimed to be from us was actually not

6435
04:18:08,880 --> 04:18:10,239
from us so

6436
04:18:10,239 --> 04:18:12,000
if dmacc wasn't there you wonder how

6437
04:18:12,000 --> 04:18:13,359
high that number would have been and how

6438
04:18:13,359 --> 04:18:15,199
much vulnerability that organization

6439
04:18:15,199 --> 04:18:16,960
might have been in

6440
04:18:16,960 --> 04:18:20,000
uh at the moment that code's just buried

6441
04:18:20,000 --> 04:18:21,920
away i might consider redacting it and

6442
04:18:21,920 --> 04:18:23,439
publishing on github if enough people

6443
04:18:23,439 --> 04:18:25,199
ask for it but it's really

6444
04:18:25,199 --> 04:18:27,040
something i had together fit for purpose

6445
04:18:27,040 --> 04:18:28,399
for this so

6446
04:18:28,399 --> 04:18:29,680
it's pretty messy

6447
04:18:29,680 --> 04:18:33,319
it gets the job done

6448
04:18:34,880 --> 04:18:37,199
anyway so

6449
04:18:37,199 --> 04:18:40,399
they live happily ever after let's hope

6450
04:18:40,399 --> 04:18:41,760
this stuff can impact large

6451
04:18:41,760 --> 04:18:44,000
organizations and small organizations i

6452
04:18:44,000 --> 04:18:45,359
mean australian parliament house was

6453
04:18:45,359 --> 04:18:47,600
dealing with dmacc and i think it

6454
04:18:47,600 --> 04:18:50,239
apparently took a year just to um get it

6455
04:18:50,239 --> 04:18:51,840
rolled out to all the different parts of

6456
04:18:51,840 --> 04:18:55,120
it if i read the article correctly

6457
04:18:55,120 --> 04:18:55,920
so

6458
04:18:55,920 --> 04:18:57,040
if this happens to your small

6459
04:18:57,040 --> 04:18:58,800
organization just fix it and move on

6460
04:18:58,800 --> 04:19:01,198
because

6461
04:19:01,680 --> 04:19:02,800
these

6462
04:19:02,800 --> 04:19:04,560
helpers on the internet are basically

6463
04:19:04,560 --> 04:19:06,080
just another form of spam that works

6464
04:19:06,080 --> 04:19:07,600
differently except they have the ability

6465
04:19:07,600 --> 04:19:09,520
to potentially

6466
04:19:09,520 --> 04:19:10,960
go to somewhere on the dark web or

6467
04:19:10,960 --> 04:19:13,359
wherever and say hey look this company

6468
04:19:13,359 --> 04:19:16,239
has an open dmarc and open spf and you

6469
04:19:16,239 --> 04:19:18,880
can spoof them

6470
04:19:19,520 --> 04:19:20,960
security is a journey you can't fill

6471
04:19:20,960 --> 04:19:22,319
every hole just do what you can and work

6472
04:19:22,319 --> 04:19:24,880
down from the biggest risks

6473
04:19:24,880 --> 04:19:27,520
and i guess that's the end of the

6474
04:19:27,520 --> 04:19:30,319
presentation and questions so i need to

6475
04:19:30,319 --> 04:19:31,920
look at the

6476
04:19:31,920 --> 04:19:34,479
q and a

6477
04:19:35,760 --> 04:19:38,080
oh i can't hear you

6478
04:19:38,080 --> 04:19:39,120
oh

6479
04:19:39,120 --> 04:19:40,960
keep forgetting time press the button if

6480
04:19:40,960 --> 04:19:42,399
anyone has any questions please put them

6481
04:19:42,399 --> 04:19:45,199
in qra and a by the way for the person

6482
04:19:45,199 --> 04:19:47,439
who says that does comfy con rocks have

6483
04:19:47,439 --> 04:19:49,439
an d mark record no we don't know we're

6484
04:19:49,439 --> 04:19:52,159
not paying money out for it

6485
04:19:52,159 --> 04:19:54,239
frankly i don't care

6486
04:19:54,239 --> 04:19:56,840
um do whatever you want

6487
04:19:56,840 --> 04:19:59,359
um but look i think it was pretty

6488
04:19:59,359 --> 04:20:01,040
interesting as you pointed out

6489
04:20:01,040 --> 04:20:03,680
it's security is hard like if it took

6490
04:20:03,680 --> 04:20:06,479
parliament house a year to bloody do it

6491
04:20:06,479 --> 04:20:08,800
and it's not on by default like security

6492
04:20:08,800 --> 04:20:10,960
is difficult for people to get right and

6493
04:20:10,960 --> 04:20:12,640
it's also difficult to

6494
04:20:12,640 --> 04:20:13,680
to know whether you should be

6495
04:20:13,680 --> 04:20:15,279
implementing something or not i guess it

6496
04:20:15,279 --> 04:20:17,120
wasn't until you guys got that email

6497
04:20:17,120 --> 04:20:18,560
from

6498
04:20:18,560 --> 04:20:21,040
a security expert ie person who typed

6499
04:20:21,040 --> 04:20:22,399
something in on

6500
04:20:22,399 --> 04:20:24,880
mx toolbox before knowing that you could

6501
04:20:24,880 --> 04:20:26,800
do something better right so

6502
04:20:26,800 --> 04:20:28,319
it's um

6503
04:20:28,319 --> 04:20:30,560
yeah

6504
04:20:30,560 --> 04:20:33,600
pretty interesting journey

6505
04:20:34,640 --> 04:20:36,560
so there is a question on this slack i

6506
04:20:36,560 --> 04:20:38,479
mean on the yep discord how does this

6507
04:20:38,479 --> 04:20:41,680
work do i do you read them

6508
04:20:41,680 --> 04:20:44,479
uh yep so why is email still a thing

6509
04:20:44,479 --> 04:20:46,159
what can we do to make email not a thing

6510
04:20:46,159 --> 04:20:48,640
anymore

6511
04:20:49,120 --> 04:20:51,040
personally i think email still has a

6512
04:20:51,040 --> 04:20:52,840
purpose

6513
04:20:52,840 --> 04:20:54,560
because

6514
04:20:54,560 --> 04:20:56,800
it's asynchronous and you can put in

6515
04:20:56,800 --> 04:20:59,600
large content so really it's just

6516
04:20:59,600 --> 04:21:02,159
fixing it to make it work properly

6517
04:21:02,159 --> 04:21:03,600
but that's just my opinion i'm sure we

6518
04:21:03,600 --> 04:21:05,520
could argue about that all day

6519
04:21:05,520 --> 04:21:06,640
yeah there's a couple of people saying

6520
04:21:06,640 --> 04:21:08,800
do we move to google hangouts or link or

6521
04:21:08,800 --> 04:21:10,319
google wave

6522
04:21:10,319 --> 04:21:12,000
i think there's been plenty of well wave

6523
04:21:12,000 --> 04:21:14,239
was definitely a um attempt to get rid

6524
04:21:14,239 --> 04:21:16,319
of email as it traditionally was known

6525
04:21:16,319 --> 04:21:17,760
and moved to something else right and

6526
04:21:17,760 --> 04:21:18,960
kind of

6527
04:21:18,960 --> 04:21:21,040
died of death

6528
04:21:21,040 --> 04:21:22,800
um if anyone has any other questions

6529
04:21:22,800 --> 04:21:24,800
please feel free to add them but shanna

6530
04:21:24,800 --> 04:21:27,680
what about you you got anything to ask

6531
04:21:27,680 --> 04:21:29,359
i don't um

6532
04:21:29,359 --> 04:21:31,680
have been on the receiving end of one of

6533
04:21:31,680 --> 04:21:33,600
those bug bounty requests as well it's

6534
04:21:33,600 --> 04:21:34,880
pretty funny

6535
04:21:34,880 --> 04:21:38,560
yeah same thing

6536
04:21:38,640 --> 04:21:40,239
yeah it wasn't funny when i said i

6537
04:21:40,239 --> 04:21:42,000
didn't i was

6538
04:21:42,000 --> 04:21:42,800
it

6539
04:21:42,800 --> 04:21:44,960
when it first happened my sort of

6540
04:21:44,960 --> 04:21:47,600
heart went up oh what's this

6541
04:21:47,600 --> 04:21:50,800
yeah me too right when you get that

6542
04:21:54,800 --> 04:21:56,399
and that's part of the point of today

6543
04:21:56,399 --> 04:21:57,920
like there's gonna be new stuff that

6544
04:21:57,920 --> 04:21:59,680
happens to everybody in this game so

6545
04:21:59,680 --> 04:22:00,720
just

6546
04:22:00,720 --> 04:22:02,560
try and take it in this stride

6547
04:22:02,560 --> 04:22:05,199
yeah fantastic it looks like we don't

6548
04:22:05,199 --> 04:22:06,720
have any other questions for you but um

6549
04:22:06,720 --> 04:22:08,239
andrew you'll be around in the discord

6550
04:22:08,239 --> 04:22:10,319
if people do want to ask um the other

6551
04:22:10,319 --> 04:22:12,640
one is um we will actually be having a

6552
04:22:12,640 --> 04:22:14,159
full talk from

6553
04:22:14,159 --> 04:22:17,439
uh alexi tomorrow on big bounties in

6554
04:22:17,439 --> 04:22:18,560
general

6555
04:22:18,560 --> 04:22:20,720
so not just dmacc ones but also

6556
04:22:20,720 --> 04:22:22,640
basically every kind of big banter you

6557
04:22:22,640 --> 04:22:24,239
can think of people just wanting money

6558
04:22:24,239 --> 04:22:26,640
just for the sake of it so i encourage

6559
04:22:26,640 --> 04:22:28,080
everyone to take a look at that as well

6560
04:22:28,080 --> 04:22:29,920
but thank you very much andrew for your

6561
04:22:29,920 --> 04:22:31,600
presentation

6562
04:22:31,600 --> 04:22:33,120
thank you very much

6563
04:22:33,120 --> 04:22:35,760
no worries

6564
04:22:36,000 --> 04:22:38,960
all right go do the worm

6565
04:22:38,960 --> 04:22:41,279
i can't i can't how am i gonna get out

6566
04:22:41,279 --> 04:22:43,840
there i've got my green screen no it the

6567
04:22:43,840 --> 04:22:46,319
ground is way too wet and there was a

6568
04:22:46,319 --> 04:22:48,239
competition and nobody entered and so

6569
04:22:48,239 --> 04:22:49,279
that that

6570
04:22:49,279 --> 04:22:51,279
that's long gone now

6571
04:22:51,279 --> 04:22:52,960
long gone well how about we ask the

6572
04:22:52,960 --> 04:22:54,800
audience so audience this is the

6573
04:22:54,800 --> 04:22:55,840
couch

6574
04:22:55,840 --> 04:22:57,760
this is the conundrum we have we have 20

6575
04:22:57,760 --> 04:23:00,640
minutes to go until cam's presentation

6576
04:23:00,640 --> 04:23:02,640
uh as shanna has told me we want to be

6577
04:23:02,640 --> 04:23:04,880
like a proper bus service i want to make

6578
04:23:04,880 --> 04:23:06,960
sure the bus does not leave early what

6579
04:23:06,960 --> 04:23:08,720
do you guys want annoying

6580
04:23:08,720 --> 04:23:10,479
what do you guys want us to do for 20

6581
04:23:10,479 --> 04:23:11,520
minutes

6582
04:23:11,520 --> 04:23:12,800
do you want

6583
04:23:12,800 --> 04:23:14,479
fur babies do you want

6584
04:23:14,479 --> 04:23:17,040
me and shana talking i don't know

6585
04:23:17,040 --> 04:23:19,120
like we're not gonna take a break

6586
04:23:19,120 --> 04:23:20,640
no we won't take a break but i guess

6587
04:23:20,640 --> 04:23:22,319

making comments

6674
04:26:33,520 --> 04:26:35,439
i was wondering if it was mine but they

6675
04:26:35,439 --> 04:26:38,399
were too high-pitched to be mine

6676
04:26:38,399 --> 04:26:39,760
that was super cute

6677

we are getting comfy i saw this photo

6679
04:26:43,760 --> 04:26:45,840
and i thought it was a hand

6680
04:26:45,840 --> 04:26:47,439
so that like they've bitten off and

6681
04:26:47,439 --> 04:26:49,680
eaten an arm

6682
04:26:49,680 --> 04:26:52,319
i was a little concerned

6683
04:26:52,319 --> 04:26:55,120
like because it looks like a hand

6684
04:26:55,120 --> 04:26:56,960
and i just was like i don't know what's

6685
04:26:56,960 --> 04:26:59,279

6686

threatened towel yeah yeah yeah that

6754
04:29:29,680 --> 04:29:31,760
would be great to do

6755
04:29:31,760 --> 04:29:34,239
apparently um ross anderson security

6756
04:29:34,239 --> 04:29:36,960
engineering is a good one

6757
04:29:36,960 --> 04:29:38,720
uh

6758
04:29:38,720 --> 04:29:40,399
adam showstack yeah that's the one that

6759
04:29:40,399 --> 04:29:43,119
i'm thinking of

6760
04:29:43,359 --> 04:29:47,840
um for a like a it's a non-fiction one

6761
04:29:47,840 --> 04:29:49,760
there is a book called the hacker and

6762
04:29:49,760 --> 04:29:51,439
the state

6763
04:29:51,439 --> 04:29:53,760
that's pretty cool too

6764
04:29:53,760 --> 04:29:57,600
um it goes across some of the

6765
04:29:57,600 --> 04:30:01,199
big breaches things like stuxnet so

6766
04:30:01,199 --> 04:30:03,760
how and what like the behind the scenes

6767
04:30:03,760 --> 04:30:05,600
of stuxnet which is really really

6768
04:30:05,600 --> 04:30:07,920
interesting like what stuxnet was meant

6769
04:30:07,920 --> 04:30:10,960
to do and how it got identified and it

6770
04:30:10,960 --> 04:30:14,000
really was a product of its own failure

6771
04:30:14,000 --> 04:30:16,239
um which is super interesting and the

6772
04:30:16,239 --> 04:30:18,319
other really cool book on that's you

6773
04:30:18,319 --> 04:30:20,560
know a non-fiction is

6774
04:30:20,560 --> 04:30:22,880
um the cult of the dead cow so if you're

6775
04:30:22,880 --> 04:30:24,960
interested in oh yeah yeah yeah

6776
04:30:24,960 --> 04:30:27,840
the hacker background hacker culture you

6777
04:30:27,840 --> 04:30:29,680
know pre-def con

6778
04:30:29,680 --> 04:30:32,319
um sort of early 80s starting around

6779
04:30:32,319 --> 04:30:34,080
about the early 80s when the cult of the

6780
04:30:34,080 --> 04:30:35,279
dead cow

6781
04:30:35,279 --> 04:30:37,520
was you know on bulletin boards and and

6782
04:30:37,520 --> 04:30:40,239
sharing text files around um things like

6783
04:30:40,239 --> 04:30:42,800
the anarchist cookbook um that's also a

6784
04:30:42,800 --> 04:30:45,439
really really good book as well

6785
04:30:45,439 --> 04:30:47,439
uh brian says carver file system

6786
04:30:47,439 --> 04:30:49,760
forensics auto memory forensics and the

6787
04:30:49,760 --> 04:30:51,760
system internal books

6788
04:30:51,760 --> 04:30:54,399
yeah memory forensics is great

6789
04:30:54,399 --> 04:30:57,359
and dan says sand worm by andy greenberg

6790
04:30:57,359 --> 04:30:59,040
uh i'll admit i've never read any of

6791
04:30:59,040 --> 04:31:00,640
those but then again i don't do anything

6792
04:31:00,640 --> 04:31:03,680
technical anymore so

6793
04:31:05,120 --> 04:31:07,040
art of software security assessment by

6794
04:31:07,040 --> 04:31:09,040
markdown well there's there's a there's

6795
04:31:09,040 --> 04:31:11,840
a name

6796
04:31:12,720 --> 04:31:15,600
definitely recommend men that one

6797
04:31:15,600 --> 04:31:16,260
um

6798
04:31:16,260 --> 04:31:18,000
[Music]

6799
04:31:18,000 --> 04:31:19,920
or

6800
04:31:19,920 --> 04:31:21,600
yeah

6801
04:31:21,600 --> 04:31:24,159
i i did the audio book for cult of the

6802
04:31:24,159 --> 04:31:25,439
dead cow

6803
04:31:25,439 --> 04:31:27,199
it was it was a good way to listen to it

6804
04:31:27,199 --> 04:31:29,439
i think

6805
04:31:29,439 --> 04:31:31,120
yeah i can only

6806
04:31:31,120 --> 04:31:32,399
go to sleep with

6807
04:31:32,399 --> 04:31:34,239
um

6808
04:31:34,239 --> 04:31:36,000
with uh

6809
04:31:36,000 --> 04:31:38,479
with audiobooks now um

6810
04:31:38,479 --> 04:31:39,760
me too

6811
04:31:39,760 --> 04:31:41,760
i reckon that can be maybe our next

6812
04:31:41,760 --> 04:31:43,120
topic because

6813
04:31:43,120 --> 04:31:45,199
we do get a lot of good feedback and we

6814
04:31:45,199 --> 04:31:47,279
don't have so many this time i think

6815
04:31:47,279 --> 04:31:49,040
maybe the first comfy con

6816
04:31:49,040 --> 04:31:50,960
you know everyone was sort of

6817
04:31:50,960 --> 04:31:52,319
trying to figure out what we're going to

6818
04:31:52,319 --> 04:31:54,399
do and we had you know garth do the

6819
04:31:54,399 --> 04:31:55,840
meditation

6820
04:31:55,840 --> 04:31:58,640
um we had a little bit more

6821
04:31:58,640 --> 04:32:00,640
talks around

6822
04:32:00,640 --> 04:32:02,800
what it means to be in cyber security

6823
04:32:02,800 --> 04:32:03,760
and

6824
04:32:03,760 --> 04:32:05,600
mental health we don't have too many

6825
04:32:05,600 --> 04:32:08,479
this time but i i'm a big i need

6826
04:32:08,479 --> 04:32:10,319
something like an audio book or

6827
04:32:10,319 --> 04:32:12,800
headspace to go to sleep at night um you

6828
04:32:12,800 --> 04:32:14,720
know silence is probably my big enemy

6829
04:32:14,720 --> 04:32:17,040
for my brain um

6830
04:32:17,040 --> 04:32:18,800
and also i talked about recently on a

6831
04:32:18,800 --> 04:32:20,399
podcast getting out and you know horses

6832
04:32:20,399 --> 04:32:22,000
and dogs and stuff so

6833
04:32:22,000 --> 04:32:24,239
um super important that i know that

6834
04:32:24,239 --> 04:32:25,680
we're taking up everybody's time on a

6835
04:32:25,680 --> 04:32:29,120
weekend with the cyber conference um

6836
04:32:29,120 --> 04:32:30,239
and

6837
04:32:30,239 --> 04:32:32,640
but it is really important just to spend

6838
04:32:32,640 --> 04:32:34,399
that time doing other things and even if

6839
04:32:34,399 --> 04:32:36,000
that is reading books or listening to

6840
04:32:36,000 --> 04:32:37,920
books or going for a walk

6841
04:32:37,920 --> 04:32:39,760
it is super important for everybody's

6842
04:32:39,760 --> 04:32:41,359
mental health particularly in the last

6843
04:32:41,359 --> 04:32:42,720
couple of years and

6844
04:32:42,720 --> 04:32:44,080
it doesn't look like

6845
04:32:44,080 --> 04:32:45,600
the world is going to change for the

6846
04:32:45,600 --> 04:32:46,399
better

6847
04:32:46,399 --> 04:32:48,000
anytime soon with everything that's

6848
04:32:48,000 --> 04:32:50,560
going on um and

6849
04:32:50,560 --> 04:32:52,159
i think to you know that message that

6850
04:32:52,159 --> 04:32:54,239
you got this morning ian i think we're

6851
04:32:54,239 --> 04:32:55,840
very privileged to be able to run this

6852
04:32:55,840 --> 04:32:57,920
conference over the weekend and

6853
04:32:57,920 --> 04:32:59,840
everybody who's able to attend and who's

6854
04:32:59,840 --> 04:33:01,359
able to watch

6855
04:33:01,359 --> 04:33:04,400
um there are the replays on youtube i

6856
04:33:04,400 --> 04:33:07,199
think we're in a really lucky place so

6857
04:33:07,199 --> 04:33:10,400
um just a small moment of gratitude for

6858
04:33:10,400 --> 04:33:12,240
where we are and and the little

6859
04:33:12,240 --> 04:33:14,958
community that we have in australia

6860
04:33:14,958 --> 04:33:18,239
um absolutely

6861
04:33:20,160 --> 04:33:22,160
um i was going to say something what was

6862
04:33:22,160 --> 04:33:24,000
it no i've thrown you off you've

6863
04:33:24,000 --> 04:33:26,240
completely thrown me off no no i'm sorry

6864
04:33:26,240 --> 04:33:28,080
i'm sorry i like just to bring me down

6865
04:33:28,080 --> 04:33:30,639
no no no no just you know have a little

6866
04:33:30,639 --> 04:33:34,080
bit about um just the gratitude of of uh

6867
04:33:34,080 --> 04:33:35,840
you know how especially the company

6868
04:33:35,840 --> 04:33:37,520
community over the last couple of years

6869
04:33:37,520 --> 04:33:40,000
has brought a lot of people together and

6870
04:33:40,000 --> 04:33:41,520
it's you know been a little bit of a

6871
04:33:41,520 --> 04:33:44,400
safe haven for everyone so you know i

6872
04:33:44,400 --> 04:33:46,561
think in a lot of ways we normalize

6873
04:33:46,561 --> 04:33:48,240
talking about our struggles and our

6874
04:33:48,240 --> 04:33:49,759
vulnerabilities

6875
04:33:49,759 --> 04:33:51,199
over the last couple of years together

6876
04:33:51,199 --> 04:33:53,599
and that's been really really like

6877
04:33:53,599 --> 04:33:54,719
um

6878
04:33:54,719 --> 04:33:56,799
a way for myself and a lot of people to

6879
04:33:56,799 --> 04:33:59,359
get through and realize that you're not

6880
04:33:59,359 --> 04:34:00,561
broken

6881
04:34:00,561 --> 04:34:02,799
it is really hard

6882
04:34:02,799 --> 04:34:05,359
so absolutely well what we are saying is

6883
04:34:05,359 --> 04:34:07,278
also if you need to step away just bug

6884
04:34:07,278 --> 04:34:08,958
her off and don't watch us today like

6885
04:34:08,958 --> 04:34:11,039
we're okay with that as well like

6886
04:34:11,039 --> 04:34:13,199
go do your own thing um not watch this

6887
04:34:13,199 --> 04:34:14,958
later but if you want to stay feel free

6888
04:34:14,958 --> 04:34:16,400
to stay

6889
04:34:16,400 --> 04:34:18,240
and the next talk is probably very

6890
04:34:18,240 --> 04:34:20,561
related to um

6891
04:34:20,561 --> 04:34:22,879
what canary just posted about april

6892
04:34:22,879 --> 04:34:24,719
fool's day rfcs

6893
04:34:24,719 --> 04:34:27,599
so if you don't realize we

6894
04:34:27,599 --> 04:34:29,520
so we didn't announce

6895
04:34:29,520 --> 04:34:31,520
canary's talk

6896
04:34:31,520 --> 04:34:33,438
because we were asked not to for a

6897
04:34:33,438 --> 04:34:35,199
reason and then we forgot to announce it

6898
04:34:35,199 --> 04:34:37,520
so i feel very sorry but i'll just add

6899
04:34:37,520 --> 04:34:40,561
her in hey cam how are you doing

6900
04:34:40,561 --> 04:34:43,118
because we're super busy

6901
04:34:43,118 --> 04:34:44,320
um

6902
04:34:44,320 --> 04:34:46,400
good so um

6903
04:34:46,400 --> 04:34:47,840
as i've asked everyone else today and

6904
04:34:47,840 --> 04:34:49,118
i'm gonna i'm horrible for this

6905
04:34:49,118 --> 04:34:52,799
attendees versus nuggies cam

6906
04:34:52,958 --> 04:34:54,320
it would actually have to be a question

6907
04:34:54,320 --> 04:34:56,240
of what source goes with it

6908
04:34:56,240 --> 04:34:57,840
oh that's fair

6909
04:34:57,840 --> 04:35:00,080

04:35:00,080 --> 04:35:01,199

and sour sauce is like the epitome of

6919
04:35:16,958 --> 04:35:18,240
sweet and sour

6920
04:35:18,240 --> 04:35:19,359

6921
04:35:19,359 --> 04:35:21,278
but with nuggets right like you've got

6922
04:35:21,278 --> 04:35:22,400
to have the sweet and sour with it no

6923
04:35:22,400 --> 04:35:24,400

6932
04:35:42,320 --> 04:35:44,400
deconstructs systems in his bedtime

6933
04:35:44,400 --> 04:35:46,080
spent over 10 years enjoying the view

6934
04:35:46,080 --> 04:35:47,599
from ladders cherry pickers and building

6935
04:35:47,599 --> 04:35:49,599
rooftops engineering designing and

6936

deploying sensors vision taking places

6937
04:35:51,278 --> 04:35:52,719
they weren't meant to go so very similar

6938
04:35:52,719 --> 04:35:55,118
to the laura talker layer um making the

6939

technology across dfir investigations

discovery and compliance for clayton utz

6942

so uh

6948
04:36:15,039 --> 04:36:17,199
as you can see uh i've used the

6949
04:36:17,199 --> 04:36:19,438
ubiquitous um

6950
04:36:19,438 --> 04:36:21,520
program called notepad to help me uh

6951
04:36:21,520 --> 04:36:23,438
craft today's presentation

6952
04:36:23,438 --> 04:36:26,320
so today is just a bit of a heart

6953
04:36:26,320 --> 04:36:29,118
light-hearted look at the origins of

6954
04:36:29,118 --> 04:36:32,480
some of the murmuring stories and myths

6955
04:36:32,480 --> 04:36:34,480
you may encounter as you traverse your

6956
04:36:34,480 --> 04:36:36,639
way across the internet

6957
04:36:36,639 --> 04:36:39,199
whether you know it or not

6958
04:36:39,199 --> 04:36:41,039
have you ever wondered how to set up

6959
04:36:41,039 --> 04:36:43,919
your own dhcp server using pegs

6960
04:36:43,919 --> 04:36:45,438
what all this talk about pigeons is

6961
04:36:45,438 --> 04:36:46,719
about

6962
04:36:46,719 --> 04:36:49,759
or why teapots and https seem to be a

6963
04:36:49,759 --> 04:36:51,840
thing

6964
04:36:51,840 --> 04:36:53,599
in the spirit of april

6965
04:36:53,599 --> 04:36:56,000
let me take you on a brief glimpse into

6966
04:36:56,000 --> 04:36:58,320
the world of homing pigeons pegs and

6967
04:36:58,320 --> 04:36:59,599
teapots

6968
04:36:59,599 --> 04:37:01,278
a beginner's guide to satirical

6969
04:37:01,278 --> 04:37:05,039
standards the april fool's rfcs

6970
04:37:05,039 --> 04:37:07,840
but before we do begin i do need to

6971
04:37:07,840 --> 04:37:09,359
provide some disclaimers about the

6972
04:37:09,359 --> 04:37:13,879
status of this particular presentation

6973
04:37:16,480 --> 04:37:18,561
this presentation provides information

6974
04:37:18,561 --> 04:37:20,799
for the internet community it does not

6975
04:37:20,799 --> 04:37:23,840
specify an internet standard of any kind

6976
04:37:23,840 --> 04:37:26,080
this talk is inspired by requests for

6977
04:37:26,080 --> 04:37:30,080
comments or rfcs the documents terms and

6978
04:37:30,080 --> 04:37:32,000
archives that form both the history and

6979
04:37:32,000 --> 04:37:35,118
the glue of the internet we see today

6980
04:37:35,118 --> 04:37:37,759
the views presented herein are my own as

6981
04:37:37,759 --> 04:37:39,278
a member of the public

6982
04:37:39,278 --> 04:37:40,639
they don't represent the views or

6983
04:37:40,639 --> 04:37:42,561
endorsement of my employer nor any

6984
04:37:42,561 --> 04:37:44,480
person or organization affiliated with

6985
04:37:44,480 --> 04:37:47,520
rfcs or april 1st

6986
04:37:47,520 --> 04:37:49,438
no pigeons were harmed in the making of

6987
04:37:49,438 --> 04:37:52,480
this presentation however much tea and

6988
04:37:52,480 --> 04:37:56,520
the red coffee was consumed

6989
04:37:58,719 --> 04:38:01,199
so who am i

6990
04:38:01,199 --> 04:38:03,039
my name is cam la

6991
04:38:03,039 --> 04:38:05,520
and i'm a tinkerer at heart

6992
04:38:05,520 --> 04:38:07,278
who happens to enjoy building and

6993
04:38:07,278 --> 04:38:10,160
breaking all kinds of systems

6994
04:38:10,160 --> 04:38:12,320
as an engineer i have spent many years

6995
04:38:12,320 --> 04:38:14,000
dangling off the side of buildings

6996
04:38:14,000 --> 04:38:15,840
enjoying the delights of ceiling spaces

6997
04:38:15,840 --> 04:38:17,520
at one in the morning

6998
04:38:17,520 --> 04:38:20,080
and overlooking the edge of mining pits

6999
04:38:20,080 --> 04:38:21,759
or to bring back data from places that

7000
04:38:21,759 --> 04:38:24,000
have no business having electricity let

7001
04:38:24,000 --> 04:38:26,320
alone iot

7002
04:38:26,320 --> 04:38:27,039
so

7003
04:38:27,039 --> 04:38:28,958
very much so my current work sees me as

7004
04:38:28,958 --> 04:38:30,480
a senior consultant at one of

7005
04:38:30,480 --> 04:38:32,320
australia's top tier law firms working

7006
04:38:32,320 --> 04:38:35,039
in the forensic technology team

7007
04:38:35,039 --> 04:38:35,840
so

7008
04:38:35,840 --> 04:38:38,480
dfir investigations automation

7009
04:38:38,480 --> 04:38:40,320
i deconstruct systems

7010
04:38:40,320 --> 04:38:42,160
including people to figure out the truth

7011
04:38:42,160 --> 04:38:44,400
from the noise

7012
04:38:44,400 --> 04:38:46,719
outside of this i volunteer with the uts

7013
04:38:46,719 --> 04:38:48,799
cyber security society as a member of

7014
04:38:48,799 --> 04:38:50,639
the advisory board

7015
04:38:50,639 --> 04:38:52,240
helping to bridge the gap between the

7016
04:38:52,240 --> 04:38:54,000
university experience

7017
04:38:54,000 --> 04:38:56,080
and industry for those emerging from

7018
04:38:56,080 --> 04:38:57,599
their studies to begin their cyber

7019
04:38:57,599 --> 04:38:59,520
security journey

7020
04:38:59,520 --> 04:39:03,359
tea is my beverage of choice

7021
04:39:04,958 --> 04:39:05,680
so

7022
04:39:05,680 --> 04:39:07,840
now that that's out of the way let's

7023
04:39:07,840 --> 04:39:09,759
begin with a bit of a story about

7024
04:39:09,759 --> 04:39:10,879
pigeons

7025
04:39:10,879 --> 04:39:14,561
cars and the australian internet

7026
04:39:17,599 --> 04:39:20,160
this story begins like many do with a

7027
04:39:20,160 --> 04:39:21,919
statement

7028
04:39:21,919 --> 04:39:23,680
this particular statement happened to be

7029
04:39:23,680 --> 04:39:26,000
made by kevin rudd then prime minister

7030
04:39:26,000 --> 04:39:29,520
of australia in october of 2009 on the

7031
04:39:29,520 --> 04:39:31,278
topic of nbn's

7032
04:39:31,278 --> 04:39:34,320
and this is how it goes

7033
04:39:34,320 --> 04:39:36,799
if the liberals had had their way

7034
04:39:36,799 --> 04:39:38,480
australians would be left using carrier

7035
04:39:38,480 --> 04:39:40,400
pigeons for the future rather than

7036
04:39:40,400 --> 04:39:42,560
accessing a competitive broadband

7037
04:39:42,560 --> 04:39:44,958
network

7038
04:39:45,120 --> 04:39:47,840
in the spirit of good australian

7039
04:39:47,840 --> 04:39:50,878
the team behind abc's hungry beast a

7040
04:39:50,878 --> 04:39:52,798
local news and current affairs program

7041
04:39:52,798 --> 04:39:54,798
of the time went about fact checking

7042
04:39:54,798 --> 04:39:55,840
this

7043
04:39:55,840 --> 04:39:58,160
in what they dubbed the great australian

7044
04:39:58,160 --> 04:40:00,958
internet challenge

7045
04:40:01,520 --> 04:40:04,080
so what was the challenge

7046
04:40:04,080 --> 04:40:06,080
who could transfer 700 megabytes the

7047
04:40:06,080 --> 04:40:08,718
fastest between point a

7048
04:40:08,718 --> 04:40:11,600
taranara a town in rural new south wales

7049
04:40:11,600 --> 04:40:14,718
to prospect in western sydney 132

7050
04:40:14,718 --> 04:40:16,798
kilometers away

7051
04:40:16,798 --> 04:40:19,680
keep in mind this is back in 2009 when

7052
04:40:19,680 --> 04:40:22,000
nbn was a budding idea

7053
04:40:22,000 --> 04:40:24,240
fiber to the home didn't exist

7054
04:40:24,240 --> 04:40:26,000
and a lot of the techs were measuring

7055
04:40:26,000 --> 04:40:27,760
their internet speed in kilometers from

7056
04:40:27,760 --> 04:40:30,798
the exchange

7057
04:40:30,798 --> 04:40:33,520
and the challenges

7058
04:40:34,160 --> 04:40:35,440
the internet

7059
04:40:35,440 --> 04:40:39,040
using an adsl connection

7060
04:40:39,040 --> 04:40:42,798
the car in this case a v8 ford falcon

7061
04:40:42,798 --> 04:40:46,480
and margaret the racing pigeon

7062
04:40:47,120 --> 04:40:49,600
uh this picture is representative of the

7063
04:40:49,600 --> 04:40:51,920
path taken by margaret from point a to

7064
04:40:51,920 --> 04:40:54,160
point b

7065
04:40:54,160 --> 04:40:55,920
so the burning question is who actually

7066
04:40:55,920 --> 04:40:58,920
won

7067
04:40:59,040 --> 04:41:02,080
naturally it was margaret the pigeon

7068
04:41:02,080 --> 04:41:03,600
margaret came in

7069
04:41:03,600 --> 04:41:05,920
first place with a resounding lead one

7070
04:41:05,920 --> 04:41:08,000
hour ahead of the next competitor the

7071
04:41:08,000 --> 04:41:10,638
ford falcon

7072
04:41:11,360 --> 04:41:13,840
the internet scored the wooden spoon

7073
04:41:13,840 --> 04:41:15,760
and the dnf

7074
04:41:15,760 --> 04:41:18,080
did not finish after disconnecting twice

7075
04:41:18,080 --> 04:41:19,360
during the challenge and never

7076
04:41:19,360 --> 04:41:21,920
recovering

7077
04:41:22,798 --> 04:41:24,958
so

7078
04:41:25,520 --> 04:41:27,600
what does this actually have to do with

7079
04:41:27,600 --> 04:41:30,320
this talk in rfcs

7080
04:41:30,320 --> 04:41:32,480
this can be considered a rudimentary

7081
04:41:32,480 --> 04:41:34,958
application or implementation of various

7082
04:41:34,958 --> 04:41:37,280
protocols described in the avn carrier

7083
04:41:37,280 --> 04:41:40,160
series of the rfc standards

7084
04:41:40,160 --> 04:41:42,400
these standards include the standard for

7085
04:41:42,400 --> 04:41:45,120
transmission of ip datagrams on avn

7086
04:41:45,120 --> 04:41:46,878
carriers

7087
04:41:46,878 --> 04:41:49,040
ip over avian carriers with quality of

7088
04:41:49,040 --> 04:41:50,798
service

7089
04:41:50,798 --> 04:41:55,798
and an adaption allowing for ipv6

7090
04:41:58,160 --> 04:42:00,878
so what does this all mean

7091
04:42:00,878 --> 04:42:03,680
these and many more rfcs all share a

7092
04:42:03,680 --> 04:42:05,200
common theme

7093
04:42:05,200 --> 04:42:08,240
a touch of humor in the spirit of april

7094
04:42:08,240 --> 04:42:10,718
so i hereby present to you the april 1

7095
04:42:10,718 --> 04:42:13,360
rfcs

7096
04:42:13,360 --> 04:42:14,798
but

7097
04:42:14,798 --> 04:42:17,200
the question now is what is an rfc in

7098
04:42:17,200 --> 04:42:19,760
the first place

7099
04:42:20,958 --> 04:42:24,400
rfcs are known as requests for comments

7100
04:42:24,400 --> 04:42:26,958
they are an archival record of standards

7101
04:42:26,958 --> 04:42:28,638
or best practice used in computer

7102
04:42:28,638 --> 04:42:31,120
networking and the internet

7103
04:42:31,120 --> 04:42:34,240
they are maintained by the rfc editor

7104
04:42:34,240 --> 04:42:35,520
and their goal is to document and

7105
04:42:35,520 --> 04:42:39,120
preserve that information for the future

7106
04:42:39,120 --> 04:42:40,400
tcp

7107
04:42:40,400 --> 04:42:41,680
udp

7108
04:42:41,680 --> 04:42:45,120
cryptographic algorithms like rsa

7109
04:42:45,120 --> 04:42:46,560
these are some of the examples of

7110
04:42:46,560 --> 04:42:48,160
protocols you may encounter in your

7111
04:42:48,160 --> 04:42:49,280
day-to-day

7112
04:42:49,280 --> 04:42:52,878
which are defined in rsc documents

7113
04:42:52,878 --> 04:42:54,400
for each of the major computing

7114
04:42:54,400 --> 04:42:56,560
protocols protocols and frameworks we

7115
04:42:56,560 --> 04:42:57,600
know

7116
04:42:57,600 --> 04:42:59,920
there is likely an rfc that exists to

7117
04:42:59,920 --> 04:43:04,798
define or extend the underlying standard

7118
04:43:04,798 --> 04:43:07,520
rfcs are old or even older than linux

7119
04:43:07,520 --> 04:43:09,360
time itself

7120
04:43:09,360 --> 04:43:11,200
its origins come from the time of

7121
04:43:11,200 --> 04:43:12,638
arpanet

7122
04:43:12,638 --> 04:43:14,400
the precursor and foundation to the

7123
04:43:14,400 --> 04:43:16,958
internet we know today

7124
04:43:16,958 --> 04:43:18,400
the first rfc

7125
04:43:18,400 --> 04:43:20,560
host software was published on 7th of

7126
04:43:20,560 --> 04:43:24,320
april 1969 by steve crocker

7127
04:43:24,320 --> 04:43:27,200
now in the year 2022

7128
04:43:27,200 --> 04:43:29,680
50 years later

7129
04:43:29,680 --> 04:43:32,878
over 9000 rfcs have been published

7130
04:43:32,878 --> 04:43:35,520
giving us a fossil record over time that

7131
04:43:35,520 --> 04:43:37,920
we can continue to create develop and

7132
04:43:37,920 --> 04:43:39,280
push the boundaries of internet

7133
04:43:39,280 --> 04:43:41,520
technology

7134
04:43:41,520 --> 04:43:43,760
the first rfcs were handwritten or typed

7135
04:43:43,760 --> 04:43:46,638
using word processes of the day

7136
04:43:46,638 --> 04:43:48,798
this forms the inspiration for the ascii

7137
04:43:48,798 --> 04:43:50,480
art and the career font you see in this

7138
04:43:50,480 --> 04:43:53,040
presentation

7139
04:43:55,120 --> 04:43:57,360
but rfcs are not just made up of

7140
04:43:57,360 --> 04:43:59,120
standards or frameworks

7141
04:43:59,120 --> 04:44:00,400
the best

7142
04:44:00,400 --> 04:44:02,480
best practice guides experimental

7143
04:44:02,480 --> 04:44:03,680
protocols

7144
04:44:03,680 --> 04:44:06,240
informational material all form a part

7145
04:44:06,240 --> 04:44:09,280
of the archive that are the rfcs

7146
04:44:09,280 --> 04:44:12,638
while early on rfcs are were in fact

7147
04:44:12,638 --> 04:44:14,878
requests for comments on ideas and

7148
04:44:14,878 --> 04:44:16,400
proposals

7149
04:44:16,400 --> 04:44:19,920
the rfcs of today are documents that

7150
04:44:19,920 --> 04:44:22,638
preserve standards and best practices so

7151
04:44:22,638 --> 04:44:24,480
going through formal review processes

7152
04:44:24,480 --> 04:44:26,798
before being published in posterity for

7153
04:44:26,798 --> 04:44:29,360
all eternity

7154
04:44:29,360 --> 04:44:32,000
however rfcs are not all about formal

7155
04:44:32,000 --> 04:44:34,320
standards and protocols

7156
04:44:34,320 --> 04:44:36,798
between the rfcs that describe how tcp

7157
04:44:36,798 --> 04:44:38,160
works

7158
04:44:38,160 --> 04:44:39,840
you you can find topics including

7159
04:44:39,840 --> 04:44:40,798
history

7160
04:44:40,798 --> 04:44:43,360
literature and art

7161
04:44:43,360 --> 04:44:45,840
those interested in linguistics may be

7162
04:44:45,840 --> 04:44:47,760
interested to read the works

7163
04:44:47,760 --> 04:44:51,359
including entomology or foo

7164
04:44:51,440 --> 04:44:53,200
or those who want to learn a bit more

7165
04:44:53,200 --> 04:44:54,718
about the history can actually go and

7166
04:44:54,718 --> 04:44:58,320
read 50 years of rfcs

7167
04:44:58,718 --> 04:45:00,798
there are many great gems that can

7168
04:45:00,798 --> 04:45:02,638
provide a wealth of entertainment and

7169
04:45:02,638 --> 04:45:04,878
knowledge

7170
04:45:04,878 --> 04:45:06,560
these special records

7171
04:45:06,560 --> 04:45:08,878
especially the ones published on april 1

7172
04:45:08,878 --> 04:45:12,958
are known as the april 1st rfcs

7173
04:45:12,958 --> 04:45:13,760
so

7174
04:45:13,760 --> 04:45:16,958
they're a humorous look into the world

7175
04:45:16,958 --> 04:45:18,560
that can sometimes take itself too

7176
04:45:18,560 --> 04:45:21,120
seriously

7177
04:45:22,958 --> 04:45:26,000
what are april 1 rfcs

7178
04:45:26,000 --> 04:45:27,760
so they are special documents that

7179
04:45:27,760 --> 04:45:30,718
celebrate the clever humorous or topical

7180
04:45:30,718 --> 04:45:32,958
writings in associating with computer

7181
04:45:32,958 --> 04:45:35,840
networking and the internet

7182
04:45:35,840 --> 04:45:38,878
while there are other older rfcs lauded

7183
04:45:38,878 --> 04:45:41,520
for their humor and fun

7184
04:45:41,520 --> 04:45:44,000
the very first rfc

7185
04:45:44,000 --> 04:45:46,160
or april 1st rfc

7186
04:45:46,160 --> 04:45:49,680
is considered rfc 748

7187
04:45:49,680 --> 04:45:52,560
telnet randomly lost option first

7188
04:45:52,560 --> 04:45:53,760
published

7189
04:45:53,760 --> 04:45:56,638
in 1978

7190
04:45:56,638 --> 04:45:59,600
now there are over 50 rfcs all with the

7191
04:45:59,600 --> 04:46:01,520
characteristic

7192
04:46:01,520 --> 04:46:03,920
april 1 publishing date

7193
04:46:03,920 --> 04:46:06,638
however the rfc editor does have this to

7194
04:46:06,638 --> 04:46:10,718
say about rfcs published on this date

7195
04:46:15,280 --> 04:46:18,798
note that in past years the rfc editor

7196
04:46:18,798 --> 04:46:20,320
has sometimes published serious

7197
04:46:20,320 --> 04:46:22,958
documents with april 1 dates

7198
04:46:22,958 --> 04:46:25,040
readers who cannot distinguish satire by

7199
04:46:25,040 --> 04:46:26,320
reading the text

7200
04:46:26,320 --> 04:46:29,600
may have a future in marketing

7201
04:46:29,840 --> 04:46:31,040
here are some

7202
04:46:31,040 --> 04:46:33,440
non-exhaustive highlights

7203
04:46:33,440 --> 04:46:36,559
that i've picked up along the way

7204
04:46:37,280 --> 04:46:38,798
so

7205
04:46:38,798 --> 04:46:41,680
coming in 2022

7206
04:46:41,680 --> 04:46:44,638
the april 1st rfc includes things such

7207
04:46:44,638 --> 04:46:48,160
as software defects considered harmful

7208
04:46:48,160 --> 04:46:48,958
while

7209
04:46:48,958 --> 04:46:51,120
much of the ascii art sourced for

7210
04:46:51,120 --> 04:46:52,798
today's presentation can be directly

7211
04:46:52,798 --> 04:46:56,400
referenced from rfcs including

7212
04:46:56,400 --> 04:46:58,878
rfc 8150

7213
04:46:58,878 --> 04:47:02,160
the art of ascii or and true accurate

7214
04:47:02,160 --> 04:47:04,080
representation of the menagerie of

7215
04:47:04,080 --> 04:47:06,718
things fabulous wonderful

7216
04:47:06,718 --> 04:47:10,400
in new form of character

7217
04:47:10,480 --> 04:47:12,240
some rfcs provide their value in

7218
04:47:12,240 --> 04:47:13,840
cleverness and humor

7219
04:47:13,840 --> 04:47:15,520
while others also provide interesting

7220
04:47:15,520 --> 04:47:18,560
and practical applications as well

7221
04:47:18,560 --> 04:47:23,280
including rfc 2322 management of ip by

7222
04:47:23,280 --> 04:47:26,000
peg dhcp

7223
04:47:26,000 --> 04:47:27,760
this was born from the problem of

7224
04:47:27,760 --> 04:47:29,840
dynamically assigning ip addresses at

7225
04:47:29,840 --> 04:47:32,560
hacking events

7226
04:47:35,520 --> 04:47:36,638
occasionally

7227
04:47:36,638 --> 04:47:38,080
in the backspaces of your favorite

7228
04:47:38,080 --> 04:47:39,760
social media platform

7229
04:47:39,760 --> 04:47:41,760
or in whispered comments past a gaggle

7230
04:47:41,760 --> 04:47:42,798
of texts

7231
04:47:42,798 --> 04:47:45,120
you may occasionally hear about teapots

7232
04:47:45,120 --> 04:47:49,280
and http spoken in the same breath

7233
04:47:51,200 --> 04:47:53,440
the origin of this comes from an rfc

7234
04:47:53,440 --> 04:47:56,798
published on april 1 1998

7235
04:47:56,798 --> 04:48:00,560
known as rfc 2324 hypertext coffee pot

7236
04:48:00,560 --> 04:48:02,400
control protocol

7237
04:48:02,400 --> 04:48:06,080
or htc pcp for short

7238
04:48:06,080 --> 04:48:09,600
it's described by its author as this

7239
04:48:09,600 --> 04:48:12,718
this has a serious purpose it identifies

7240
04:48:12,718 --> 04:48:15,520
many of the ways in which http

7241
04:48:15,520 --> 04:48:19,280
has been extended inappropriately

7242
04:48:19,280 --> 04:48:23,360
the actual document describes htc pcp

7243
04:48:23,360 --> 04:48:25,760
a protocol for controlling monitoring

7244
04:48:25,760 --> 04:48:29,199
and diagnosing coffee pots

7245
04:48:31,200 --> 04:48:35,120
http 418 is a recur a return code

7246
04:48:35,120 --> 04:48:38,320
defined within this protocol

7247
04:48:38,320 --> 04:48:40,878
this is an extract from the actual

7248
04:48:40,878 --> 04:48:43,440
rfc itself which says any attempt to

7249
04:48:43,440 --> 04:48:45,920
brew coffee with a teapot should result

7250
04:48:45,920 --> 04:48:49,840
in the error code 418 i'm a teapot

7251
04:48:49,840 --> 04:48:52,160
the resulting entity may be short and

7252
04:48:52,160 --> 04:48:54,400
stout

7253
04:48:54,400 --> 04:48:58,000
this one statement published in 1998 has

7254
04:48:58,000 --> 04:48:59,840
spawned a life of its own

7255
04:48:59,840 --> 04:49:02,000
and is sprinkled in easter eggs found

7256
04:49:02,000 --> 04:49:03,600
throughout various website and code

7257
04:49:03,600 --> 04:49:05,760
libraries

7258
04:49:05,760 --> 04:49:09,559
here are some interesting examples

7259
04:49:09,920 --> 04:49:12,320
give google.com forward slash teapot a

7260
04:49:12,320 --> 04:49:15,360
try next time you have a chance

7261
04:49:15,360 --> 04:49:17,760
you can see that in the python http

7262
04:49:17,760 --> 04:49:19,440
library it has

7263
04:49:19,440 --> 04:49:22,160
just recently incorporated

7264
04:49:22,160 --> 04:49:25,360
status code 418 i'm a teapot in version

7265
04:49:25,360 --> 04:49:27,920
3.9

7266
04:49:27,920 --> 04:49:29,600
there have also been times when folks

7267
04:49:29,600 --> 04:49:31,360
have tried to remove

7268
04:49:31,360 --> 04:49:34,798
418 from various libraries

7269
04:49:34,798 --> 04:49:37,920
however twitter movements like

7270
04:49:37,920 --> 04:49:40,320
say 418 have pushed back and cemented

7271
04:49:40,320 --> 04:49:41,920
this particular status code for

7272
04:49:41,920 --> 04:49:43,440
generations to

7273
04:49:43,440 --> 04:49:45,760
enjoy

7274
04:49:47,840 --> 04:49:49,440
the original coffee pop protocol

7275
04:49:49,440 --> 04:49:51,280
unfortunately doesn't offer good support

7276
04:49:51,280 --> 04:49:53,440
for tea based appliances

7277
04:49:53,440 --> 04:49:56,718
support was extended on april 1 2014

7278
04:49:56,718 --> 04:50:00,560
in rfc 7168 the hypertext coffee pot

7279
04:50:00,560 --> 04:50:04,240
control protocol for t efflux appliances

7280
04:50:04,240 --> 04:50:05,120
or

7281
04:50:05,120 --> 04:50:07,520
htc pcp

7282
04:50:07,520 --> 04:50:09,680
t

7283
04:50:17,040 --> 04:50:19,840
in closing out

7284
04:50:19,840 --> 04:50:21,200
did you know that you can actually

7285
04:50:21,200 --> 04:50:25,040
submit your own april 1 rfc

7286
04:50:25,520 --> 04:50:27,760
there is no formal review process anyone

7287
04:50:27,760 --> 04:50:29,360
can submit

7288
04:50:29,360 --> 04:50:31,040
the main create criteria is to actually

7289
04:50:31,040 --> 04:50:33,440
get considered is making sure you submit

7290
04:50:33,440 --> 04:50:35,840
at least two weeks prior to april one to

7291
04:50:35,840 --> 04:50:38,160
be considered for that year

7292
04:50:38,160 --> 04:50:41,120
and below is this recommended criteria

7293
04:50:41,120 --> 04:50:44,160
on how on what you should have to make a

7294
04:50:44,160 --> 04:50:45,200
good

7295
04:50:45,200 --> 04:50:47,280
april first rfc

7296
04:50:47,280 --> 04:50:50,080
so one they must relate to the internet

7297
04:50:50,080 --> 04:50:52,080
like all drafts

7298
04:50:52,080 --> 04:50:53,200
two

7299
04:50:53,200 --> 04:50:54,878
their readers should reach the end of

7300
04:50:54,878 --> 04:50:57,200
the end of page two before realizing

7301
04:50:57,200 --> 04:50:59,440
it's an april first rfc

7302
04:50:59,440 --> 04:51:00,798
and three

7303
04:51:00,798 --> 04:51:03,920
they should actually be funny

7304
04:51:06,240 --> 04:51:08,480
thank you for listening to my talk i

7305
04:51:08,480 --> 04:51:11,200
hope you've enjoyed learnt a few things

7306
04:51:11,200 --> 04:51:12,878
about the myths and stories that live

7307
04:51:12,878 --> 04:51:15,360
among the internet today

7308
04:51:15,360 --> 04:51:17,680
thank you

7309
04:51:21,440 --> 04:51:24,878
what's your favorite rfc cam

7310
04:51:24,878 --> 04:51:26,840
what's your favorite of the april first

7311
04:51:26,840 --> 04:51:30,400
rfcs i will always go for tea because

7312
04:51:30,400 --> 04:51:32,240
that just happens to be one of my

7313
04:51:32,240 --> 04:51:34,480
favorite things i

7314
04:51:34,480 --> 04:51:36,798
there are also a few uh

7315
04:51:36,798 --> 04:51:38,798
tea related brewing

7316
04:51:38,798 --> 04:51:41,280
iso

7317
04:51:41,760 --> 04:51:42,718
iso

7318
04:51:42,718 --> 04:51:44,958
standards as well that uh that are

7319
04:51:44,958 --> 04:51:46,400
definitely an interesting reach so if

7320
04:51:46,400 --> 04:51:48,080
you do want to know how to appropriately

7321
04:51:48,080 --> 04:51:52,080
uh bruti you can certainly look that up

7322
04:51:52,560 --> 04:51:54,638
yeah that's fantastic it was um actually

7323
04:51:54,638 --> 04:51:56,480
quite relevant recently because when the

7324
04:51:56,480 --> 04:51:57,520
russian

7325
04:51:57,520 --> 04:51:59,120
state decided to disconnect their

7326
04:51:59,120 --> 04:52:00,958
internet from everyone else all of their

7327
04:52:00,958 --> 04:52:03,680
servers started responding with http 418

7328
04:52:03,680 --> 04:52:04,798
codes

7329
04:52:04,798 --> 04:52:06,160
so um

7330
04:52:06,160 --> 04:52:07,600
someone in the russian military

7331
04:52:07,600 --> 04:52:11,480
definitely has a sense of humor

7332
04:52:11,840 --> 04:52:15,280
so a t a t related question for you cam

7333
04:52:15,280 --> 04:52:16,718
you may or may not know the answer to

7334
04:52:16,718 --> 04:52:19,440
this but i don't remember where i heard

7335
04:52:19,440 --> 04:52:21,120
it but i heard it somewhere that

7336
04:52:21,120 --> 04:52:22,878
apparently

7337
04:52:22,878 --> 04:52:24,480
you could distinguish

7338
04:52:24,480 --> 04:52:25,440
um

7339
04:52:25,440 --> 04:52:28,240
the kgb spies

7340
04:52:28,240 --> 04:52:29,360
in

7341
04:52:29,360 --> 04:52:31,440
you know way back when

7342
04:52:31,440 --> 04:52:32,638
because

7343
04:52:32,638 --> 04:52:34,160
in england

7344
04:52:34,160 --> 04:52:36,080
they put the water in

7345
04:52:36,080 --> 04:52:37,760
then the milk

7346
04:52:37,760 --> 04:52:39,280
but

7347
04:52:39,280 --> 04:52:40,320
in

7348
04:52:40,320 --> 04:52:43,040
europe they put the milk in

7349
04:52:43,040 --> 04:52:44,400
then the water

7350
04:52:44,400 --> 04:52:46,080
and apparently that was how they could

7351
04:52:46,080 --> 04:52:48,240
determine that someone wasn't english do

7352
04:52:48,240 --> 04:52:51,040
you know if that's a true or false

7353
04:52:51,040 --> 04:52:53,840
i think that might be worthy of another

7354
04:52:53,840 --> 04:52:56,480
presentation at some stage to uh to

7355
04:52:56,480 --> 04:52:58,878
confirm this idea i'll tell you what you

7356
04:52:58,878 --> 04:53:00,480
come back next time you can do an entire

7357
04:53:00,480 --> 04:53:02,560
presentation on just t how about that

7358
04:53:02,560 --> 04:53:04,878
yeah

7359
04:53:06,360 --> 04:53:09,040
identifying malicious actors

7360
04:53:09,040 --> 04:53:12,000
by their tea habits

7361
04:53:12,000 --> 04:53:13,200
yes

7362
04:53:13,200 --> 04:53:16,320
um there is one question hang on uh

7363
04:53:16,320 --> 04:53:18,320
question for you how did you craft the

7364
04:53:18,320 --> 04:53:20,400
ascii slides it brought back so much

7365
04:53:20,400 --> 04:53:23,280
nostalgia was it entirely hand driven or

7366
04:53:23,280 --> 04:53:25,920
was it copy pasting from things

7367
04:53:25,920 --> 04:53:29,280
a bit of a mix of both so

7368
04:53:29,280 --> 04:53:31,600
a lot of the

7369
04:53:31,600 --> 04:53:35,040
references are actually in rfc documents

7370
04:53:35,040 --> 04:53:36,080
so

7371
04:53:36,080 --> 04:53:38,798
the one that i quoted the art of ascii

7372
04:53:38,798 --> 04:53:42,080
actually has a really good set of

7373
04:53:42,080 --> 04:53:44,480
good ascii art to really reference and

7374
04:53:44,480 --> 04:53:46,798
take inspiration from

7375
04:53:46,798 --> 04:53:48,718
i did actually handcraft a few things

7376
04:53:48,718 --> 04:53:50,320
including the teapot

7377
04:53:50,320 --> 04:53:52,160
uh unfortunately there are no good

7378
04:53:52,160 --> 04:53:55,040
teapots inside the rfcs that i was able

7379
04:53:55,040 --> 04:53:56,160
to find

7380
04:53:56,160 --> 04:53:56,958
so

7381
04:53:56,958 --> 04:54:00,717
that was very much a hand drawn

7382
04:54:00,958 --> 04:54:03,120
no wise look thanks very much for the

7383
04:54:03,120 --> 04:54:04,638
presentation cam and as i said come back

7384
04:54:04,638 --> 04:54:07,360
next time and give a presentation on t

7385
04:54:07,360 --> 04:54:08,878
absolutely

7386
04:54:08,878 --> 04:54:10,638
no worries

7387
04:54:10,638 --> 04:54:14,560

7388
04:54:14,560 --> 04:54:16,638

7389
04:54:16,638 --> 04:54:18,080

04:55:47,680 --> 04:55:50,958
opportunity to talk about my why

7435
04:55:50,958 --> 04:55:53,360
how fraud and identity theft led me into

7436
04:55:53,360 --> 04:55:57,280
cyber defense and operation

7437
04:56:02,000 --> 04:56:04,160
have you ever wondered why you do the

7438
04:56:04,160 --> 04:56:06,320
things you do

7439
04:56:06,320 --> 04:56:09,600
why do you wake up in the morning

7440
04:56:09,600 --> 04:56:11,600
why do you go to work why do you go to

7441
04:56:11,600 --> 04:56:13,280
school

7442
04:56:13,280 --> 04:56:15,760
what is your driving force

7443
04:56:15,760 --> 04:56:17,520
is it the money

7444
04:56:17,520 --> 04:56:19,360
is it for family

7445
04:56:19,360 --> 04:56:21,840
or to have a good life

7446
04:56:21,840 --> 04:56:24,878
in my talk today i will share two most

7447
04:56:24,878 --> 04:56:27,680
significant experience in my life that

7448
04:56:27,680 --> 04:56:31,440
made me rethink my career choice

7449
04:56:31,440 --> 04:56:33,920
one was over kawaga who allegedly pulled

7450
04:56:33,920 --> 04:56:36,320
a significant financial fraud which

7451
04:56:36,320 --> 04:56:39,040
motivated me to relocate australia and

7452
04:56:39,040 --> 04:56:41,840
study cyber security

7453
04:56:41,840 --> 04:56:43,200
the second one

7454
04:56:43,200 --> 04:56:46,080
is an identity theft attempt that deep

7455
04:56:46,080 --> 04:56:48,240
rooted my hunger to work in cyber

7456
04:56:48,240 --> 04:56:51,840
security defense and operation

7457
04:56:52,000 --> 04:56:53,760
by sharing my why

7458
04:56:53,760 --> 04:56:56,160
i hope to encourage everyone to find

7459
04:56:56,160 --> 04:56:59,120
their why and work towards what inspires

7460
04:56:59,120 --> 04:57:01,280
you

7461
04:57:01,360 --> 04:57:03,360

7462
04:57:03,360 --> 04:57:07,680

7463
04:57:09,440 --> 04:57:12,320
unfortunately i can't juggle discord and

7464
04:57:12,320 --> 04:57:13,520

7465
04:57:13,520 --> 04:57:15,120

about kenya and why i have brought it up

7505
04:58:56,400 --> 04:59:00,638
well this is because i was born in kenya

04:59:00,638 --> 04:59:03,440
born into a family of seven after three

7507

beautiful sister who follows

7509
04:59:08,840 --> 04:59:11,920
me i had to fight for what i wanted

7510
04:59:11,920 --> 04:59:14,638
which made me tough and resilient to

7511
04:59:14,638 --> 04:59:17,440
life struggles

7512
04:59:17,920 --> 04:59:20,320
my parents were both teachers

7513
04:59:20,320 --> 04:59:22,400
they were disciplinarians and valued

7514
04:59:22,400 --> 04:59:23,760
education

7515
04:59:23,760 --> 04:59:26,080
they implanted my appetite for knowledge

7516
04:59:26,080 --> 04:59:28,480
and desire to learn new things

7517
04:59:28,480 --> 04:59:30,638
with a little salary that got from

7518
04:59:30,638 --> 04:59:32,638
teaching back in the day they ensured

7519
04:59:32,638 --> 04:59:35,280
all of us went to school at least up to

7520
04:59:35,280 --> 04:59:37,840
the university level and i thank them

7521
04:59:37,840 --> 04:59:40,798
for their dedication

7522
04:59:42,480 --> 04:59:44,480
studying i.t

7523
04:59:44,480 --> 04:59:46,240
after my high school

7524
04:59:46,240 --> 04:59:48,878
in 2002

7525
04:59:48,878 --> 04:59:50,638
i didn't know which career to follow but

7526
04:59:50,638 --> 04:59:54,718
i knew i needed to learn about computers

7527
04:59:54,718 --> 04:59:57,040
our second one late brother

7528
04:59:57,040 --> 04:59:59,120
may he continue resting in peace

7529
04:59:59,120 --> 05:00:01,760
encouraged me to pursue it because he

7530
05:00:01,760 --> 05:00:04,878
believed i would succeed in the industry

7531
05:00:04,878 --> 05:00:07,440
he helped me enroll in a bachelor's of

7532
05:00:07,440 --> 05:00:09,920
science in information technology at a

7533

local university in kenya

7534
05:00:12,560 --> 05:00:14,718
and this is where my love for it

7535
05:00:14,718 --> 05:00:17,280
developed

7536
05:00:17,360 --> 05:00:19,760
well i studied for three years

7537
05:00:19,760 --> 05:00:20,680

2006 i completed and graduated with two

7539
05:00:24,400 --> 05:00:25,840
degrees

7540
05:00:25,840 --> 05:00:27,280

the bscit degree

7542
05:00:29,760 --> 05:00:31,600
and the second one

7543
05:00:31,600 --> 05:00:34,560
i became a mother to this beautiful girl

7544
05:00:34,560 --> 05:00:38,400
who's no longer little anymore

7545

i joined the bank in 2007. kindly do not

7547
05:00:45,840 --> 05:00:48,160
laugh at the picture that you see there

as a data cleaner staff and application

7549
05:00:51,920 --> 05:00:54,240

7550
05:00:54,240 --> 05:00:56,480
my first full-time job

7551
05:00:56,480 --> 05:00:58,798
and it made better than most

7552
05:00:58,798 --> 05:01:02,160
odd jobs that i did after my campus

7553
05:01:02,160 --> 05:01:04,160
but most importantly

7554
05:01:04,160 --> 05:01:06,798
i was ba i was working at a bank and i

7555
05:01:06,798 --> 05:01:09,120

7557

7586
05:02:15,840 --> 05:02:18,320
including uganda rwanda

7587
05:02:18,320 --> 05:02:20,718
tanzania and sudan i am not sure whether

7588
05:02:20,718 --> 05:02:23,280
you've heard of all these countries

7589
05:02:23,280 --> 05:02:26,240
we provided support during goal life

7590
05:02:26,240 --> 05:02:29,680
system go live and post go live

7591
05:02:29,680 --> 05:02:32,160
we trained the new their staff in the

7592
05:02:32,160 --> 05:02:34,718
branches

7593
05:02:35,840 --> 05:02:39,440
and resolved any issues that they had

7594
05:02:39,440 --> 05:02:42,000
we were put up in the best hotels

7595
05:02:42,000 --> 05:02:44,560
on full board

7596
05:02:44,560 --> 05:02:47,280
transport to and from work was provided

7597
05:02:47,280 --> 05:02:49,600
and the part dm was awesome

7598
05:02:49,600 --> 05:02:51,920
we were living the life

7599
05:02:51,920 --> 05:02:54,560
and got used to that life

7600
05:02:54,560 --> 05:02:57,360
it was beautiful and fun

7601
05:02:57,360 --> 05:03:00,160
life was good

7602
05:03:03,200 --> 05:03:05,760
unfortunately as

7603
05:03:05,760 --> 05:03:08,240
everything has to come to an end the

7604
05:03:08,240 --> 05:03:11,520
project ended in may 2010

7605
05:03:11,520 --> 05:03:14,400
all data migrated into the new system

7606
05:03:14,400 --> 05:03:16,638
teething issues resolved

7607
05:03:16,638 --> 05:03:19,600
and the system was stable

7608
05:03:19,600 --> 05:03:21,680
a drastic decision was made by the

7609
05:03:21,680 --> 05:03:24,000
management in 2010

7610
05:03:24,000 --> 05:03:26,080
june 2010

7611
05:03:26,080 --> 05:03:29,440
90 of the 70 support assistants were

7612
05:03:29,440 --> 05:03:33,360
deployed to the branches in kenya

7613
05:03:33,360 --> 05:03:35,600
the same branch is revisited working

7614
05:03:35,600 --> 05:03:38,240
with the same people we trained

7615
05:03:38,240 --> 05:03:40,718
this felt like a demotion

7616
05:03:40,718 --> 05:03:44,080
there was no more training

7617
05:03:44,638 --> 05:03:46,160
no more traveling and living in

7618
05:03:46,160 --> 05:03:50,000
five-star hotels and no more party ever

7619
05:03:50,000 --> 05:03:55,280
we were broke demoralized and devastated

7620
05:03:55,840 --> 05:03:56,958
well

7621
05:03:56,958 --> 05:03:58,958
in june

7622
05:03:58,958 --> 05:04:02,000
2010 john my colleague who was among

7623
05:04:02,000 --> 05:04:04,080
the ones transferred to the branches of

7624
05:04:04,080 --> 05:04:07,920
bank teller just hiding its name

7625
05:04:08,320 --> 05:04:10,000
he was one of the trainers of the core

7626
05:04:10,000 --> 05:04:12,160
banking system

7627
05:04:12,160 --> 05:04:14,320
he was i want to go person

7628
05:04:14,320 --> 05:04:16,240
anytime he got stuck because he knew the

7629
05:04:16,240 --> 05:04:19,440
system in and out

7630
05:04:19,440 --> 05:04:22,320
he was smart and nice

7631
05:04:22,320 --> 05:04:26,320
but quiet and stealthy

7632
05:04:28,160 --> 05:04:29,440
yes we all

7633
05:04:29,440 --> 05:04:31,120
moved to the branches in the different

7634
05:04:31,120 --> 05:04:33,760
roles and the most surprising things we

7635
05:04:33,760 --> 05:04:37,040
still had power user accounts

7636
05:04:37,040 --> 05:04:38,718
gained from them from working from the

7637
05:04:38,718 --> 05:04:42,718
project and the generic admin accounts

7638
05:04:42,718 --> 05:04:46,240
password had not been changed

7639
05:04:46,240 --> 05:04:48,320
it is believed that john locked into the

7640
05:04:48,320 --> 05:04:50,480
itsm system

7641
05:04:50,480 --> 05:04:52,480
with his credentials and noted the

7642
05:04:52,480 --> 05:04:55,040
password of a request of a password

7643
05:04:55,040 --> 05:04:56,638
request from

7644
05:04:56,638 --> 05:04:58,798
one of the core banking

7645
05:04:58,798 --> 05:05:01,680
super user accounts

7646
05:05:01,680 --> 05:05:03,600
guess what he did with the super user

7647
05:05:03,600 --> 05:05:06,239
credentials

7648
05:05:07,280 --> 05:05:08,240
well

7649
05:05:08,240 --> 05:05:11,440
he had the keys to the kingdom

7650
05:05:11,440 --> 05:05:13,200
what would you do with a super user

7651
05:05:13,200 --> 05:05:17,280
account that no one knew about

7652
05:05:17,280 --> 05:05:20,320
no one was tracking

7653
05:05:24,160 --> 05:05:26,240
with a super user account you can be

7654
05:05:26,240 --> 05:05:28,638
anyone you want wanted the bank so he

7655
05:05:28,638 --> 05:05:31,760
created his own super user account

7656
05:05:31,760 --> 05:05:34,000
and then created two fictitious bank

7657
05:05:34,000 --> 05:05:35,840
branches

7658
05:05:35,840 --> 05:05:37,760
transferred money from the vault to the

7659
05:05:37,760 --> 05:05:38,878
bank

7660
05:05:38,878 --> 05:05:41,520
to the branches vaults

7661
05:05:41,520 --> 05:05:45,360
he then transferred money from the bank

7662
05:05:46,240 --> 05:05:50,638
to erroneous accounts that he created

7663
05:05:50,638 --> 05:05:52,000
what was

7664
05:05:52,000 --> 05:05:54,320
that over 90 million kenya shillings

7665
05:05:54,320 --> 05:05:56,400
were transferred to fictitious

7666
05:05:56,400 --> 05:05:58,560
customers account

7667
05:05:58,560 --> 05:06:01,040
there were successful withdrawals but a

7668
05:06:01,040 --> 05:06:03,440
big portion of it was recovered

7669
05:06:03,440 --> 05:06:06,160
not sure how

7670
05:06:06,718 --> 05:06:08,080
well

7671
05:06:08,080 --> 05:06:11,760
john was somehow discovered arrested

7672
05:06:11,760 --> 05:06:14,000
questioned and then released on a two

7673
05:06:14,000 --> 05:06:16,160
million bond

7674
05:06:16,160 --> 05:06:17,600
kenya shillings

7675
05:06:17,600 --> 05:06:20,717
which he had anyway

7676
05:06:21,120 --> 05:06:23,200
there were so many theories as to why he

7677
05:06:23,200 --> 05:06:25,840
was caught one being he logged into the

7678
05:06:25,840 --> 05:06:28,480
same one station he used

7679
05:06:28,480 --> 05:06:30,638
during his fraudulent activities with

7680
05:06:30,638 --> 05:06:32,718
his standard account

7681
05:06:32,718 --> 05:06:35,040
the other one being

7682
05:06:35,040 --> 05:06:37,200
a colleague he worked with

7683
05:06:37,200 --> 05:06:39,120
just

7684
05:06:39,120 --> 05:06:41,360
defraud to default the bank sold him out

7685
05:06:41,360 --> 05:06:44,400
after a disagreement

7686
05:06:44,560 --> 05:06:46,638
unfortunately john was fired after he

7687
05:06:46,638 --> 05:06:49,040
was arrested

7688
05:06:49,040 --> 05:06:51,120
the case is still in court

7689
05:06:51,120 --> 05:06:53,360
among other fraud cases john is

7690
05:06:53,360 --> 05:06:57,120
supposedly involved in

7691
05:06:57,920 --> 05:06:59,920
well this made me

7692
05:06:59,920 --> 05:07:00,878
ask

7693
05:07:00,878 --> 05:07:03,520
what i wanted to ask so many questions

7694
05:07:03,520 --> 05:07:04,840
i need to ask

7695
05:07:04,840 --> 05:07:09,200
john what drove him to default the bank

7696
05:07:09,200 --> 05:07:13,040
were the allegations true or false

7697
05:07:13,040 --> 05:07:15,200
did he feel unappreciated since he was

7698
05:07:15,200 --> 05:07:18,080
demoted from being a trainer of trainer

7699
05:07:18,080 --> 05:07:20,560
to being a bank teller

7700
05:07:20,560 --> 05:07:22,958
was it because his monthly salary was

7701
05:07:22,958 --> 05:07:25,360
less than what we were used to when

7702
05:07:25,360 --> 05:07:28,080
traveling and living the good life

7703
05:07:28,080 --> 05:07:30,958
was it greed

7704
05:07:32,958 --> 05:07:35,120
how was he able to identify to hide his

7705
05:07:35,120 --> 05:07:37,680
identity

7706
05:07:37,840 --> 05:07:40,160
bearing in mind the two fictitious

7707
05:07:40,160 --> 05:07:43,040
branches he opened had no real managers

7708
05:07:43,040 --> 05:07:45,120
and staffs to go through the report

7709
05:07:45,120 --> 05:07:49,040
clever don't you think

7710
05:07:49,040 --> 05:07:51,200
did he use a generic admin

7711
05:07:51,200 --> 05:07:53,600
account and password while performing

7712
05:07:53,600 --> 05:07:55,600
his activities

7713
05:07:55,600 --> 05:07:58,798
did he use max proofing

7714
05:07:58,798 --> 05:08:01,360
were there any logs that could track his

7715
05:08:01,360 --> 05:08:03,840
activities

7716
05:08:04,400 --> 05:08:06,320
was he removed from the administrator

7717
05:08:06,320 --> 05:08:09,280
group and account

7718
05:08:11,600 --> 05:08:13,600
these were questions that i still don't

7719
05:08:13,600 --> 05:08:16,480
have answer to

7720
05:08:16,480 --> 05:08:19,120
and this is a point where i had a

7721
05:08:19,120 --> 05:08:21,760
massive realization that i was going to

7722
05:08:21,760 --> 05:08:25,039
do cyber security

7723
05:08:27,120 --> 05:08:29,040
i wanted to be that person who would

7724
05:08:29,040 --> 05:08:32,560
protect the banks money assets

7725
05:08:32,560 --> 05:08:36,000
information and resources

7726
05:08:36,000 --> 05:08:38,400
to monitor detect and identify

7727
05:08:38,400 --> 05:08:40,958
suspicious activity

7728
05:08:40,958 --> 05:08:44,560
prevent fraud from internal employees

7729
05:08:44,560 --> 05:08:45,680
well

7730
05:08:45,680 --> 05:08:47,840
this triggered my appetite to dive into

7731
05:08:47,840 --> 05:08:49,920
cyber security

7732
05:08:49,920 --> 05:08:53,359
i was hungry to learn

7733
05:08:55,680 --> 05:08:57,200
five years later

7734
05:08:57,200 --> 05:08:59,600
my big brother encouraged me to pursue a

7735
05:08:59,600 --> 05:09:00,718
master's

7736
05:09:00,718 --> 05:09:04,958
or phd in i.t or australia

7737
05:09:04,958 --> 05:09:07,040
i applied and got accepted to study a

7738
05:09:07,040 --> 05:09:10,160
masters of cyber security at ecu

7739
05:09:10,160 --> 05:09:13,840
my prayers were answered

7740
05:09:14,160 --> 05:09:17,200
and in february 2016

7741
05:09:17,200 --> 05:09:19,760
i left my family and daughter

7742
05:09:19,760 --> 05:09:21,520
behind and came to australia to follow

7743
05:09:21,520 --> 05:09:24,680
my dreams

7744
05:09:26,240 --> 05:09:29,120
that was one big experience in my life

7745
05:09:29,120 --> 05:09:31,360
that motivated me to move to australia

7746
05:09:31,360 --> 05:09:32,958
and study

7747
05:09:32,958 --> 05:09:35,600
cyber security and of course get a

7748
05:09:35,600 --> 05:09:39,877
better life for me and my daughter

7749
05:09:41,680 --> 05:09:43,760
and on to my second why

7750
05:09:43,760 --> 05:09:46,958
the identity theft

7751
05:09:47,920 --> 05:09:50,878
in november 2017 after completing my

7752
05:09:50,878 --> 05:09:52,718
coursework

7753
05:09:52,718 --> 05:09:55,200
now my husband and i

7754
05:09:55,200 --> 05:09:58,000
my now my husband brian and i decided to

7755
05:09:58,000 --> 05:10:01,440
go on a holiday to nairobi kenya

7756
05:10:01,440 --> 05:10:03,200
we were looking to save

7757
05:10:03,200 --> 05:10:05,920
some cash on our flight so our family

7758
05:10:05,920 --> 05:10:09,200
friend called jane refiners too

7759
05:10:09,200 --> 05:10:11,840
a guy called eric

7760
05:10:11,840 --> 05:10:14,000
being a trusted family friend we decided

7761
05:10:14,000 --> 05:10:16,400
to book tickets with eric

7762
05:10:16,400 --> 05:10:19,120
eric asked for our passport bio pages

7763
05:10:19,120 --> 05:10:23,480
which we reluctantly provided

7764
05:10:23,840 --> 05:10:26,160
well at the time

7765
05:10:26,160 --> 05:10:28,560
i returned to get front path to kenya

7766
05:10:28,560 --> 05:10:30,638
posted three thousand

7767
05:10:30,638 --> 05:10:33,120
three thousand dollars

7768
05:10:33,120 --> 05:10:35,120
but eric gautas

7769
05:10:35,120 --> 05:10:38,878
the return ticket at 3 000 both of us

7770
05:10:38,878 --> 05:10:40,160
what are safe

7771
05:10:40,160 --> 05:10:42,160
right

7772
05:10:42,160 --> 05:10:43,600
well

7773
05:10:43,600 --> 05:10:46,320
we traveled to nairobi

7774
05:10:46,320 --> 05:10:47,920
and we're happy to meet our families

7775
05:10:47,920 --> 05:10:52,160
after almost two years being a part

7776
05:10:55,600 --> 05:10:59,520
on when on 10th january 2018

7777
05:10:59,520 --> 05:11:02,638
still on holiday and enjoying ourselves

7778
05:11:02,638 --> 05:11:05,200
a travel agent from australia

7779
05:11:05,200 --> 05:11:08,400
sent a text sends text messages to mike

7780
05:11:08,400 --> 05:11:10,718
mike is a business partner to my husband

7781
05:11:10,718 --> 05:11:13,200
brian

7782
05:11:15,040 --> 05:11:17,280
the agent was trying to get a hold of

7783
05:11:17,280 --> 05:11:20,320
brian about frontline cards

7784
05:11:20,320 --> 05:11:24,000
that were used to purchase our tickets

7785
05:11:24,000 --> 05:11:26,320
this did not worry us as we knew we

7786
05:11:26,320 --> 05:11:28,080
didn't use our tickets

7787
05:11:28,080 --> 05:11:30,400
to pay for the flights we used eric

7788
05:11:30,400 --> 05:11:32,400
remember

7789
05:11:32,400 --> 05:11:35,920
so we dismissed the texts

7790
05:11:37,360 --> 05:11:40,080
the next day

7791
05:11:40,080 --> 05:11:42,798
11th january 2018

7792
05:11:42,798 --> 05:11:44,878
brian got an email from the same travel

7793
05:11:44,878 --> 05:11:48,080
agent about the use of american express

7794
05:11:48,080 --> 05:11:50,958
cards to pay for tickets in africa

7795
05:11:50,958 --> 05:11:52,798
i will read

7796
05:11:52,798 --> 05:11:55,760
hello brian i'm sorry to bother you as i

7797
05:11:55,760 --> 05:11:57,760
received fraudland credit cards for

7798
05:11:57,760 --> 05:12:00,958
payments of other tickets to africa i

7799
05:12:00,958 --> 05:12:03,600
need to confirm your credit card

7800
05:12:03,600 --> 05:12:05,680
american express has advised me that the

7801
05:12:05,680 --> 05:12:06,958
credit card on the attached

7802
05:12:06,958 --> 05:12:10,080
authorization form is no longer valid

7803
05:12:10,080 --> 05:12:12,080
could you please

7804
05:12:12,080 --> 05:12:14,080
advise the new credit card number if you

7805
05:12:14,080 --> 05:12:16,480
cancel the card

7806
05:12:16,480 --> 05:12:19,280
now this got our attention

7807
05:12:19,280 --> 05:12:21,520
it got us worried

7808
05:12:21,520 --> 05:12:23,360
why did she where did she even get

7809
05:12:23,360 --> 05:12:28,120
brian's email address we wondered

7810
05:12:29,040 --> 05:12:31,040
we decided to take our flight status

7811
05:12:31,040 --> 05:12:32,560
back to australia

7812
05:12:32,560 --> 05:12:35,120
to our disbelief our flights to path had

7813
05:12:35,120 --> 05:12:37,680
been cancelled by whom

7814
05:12:37,680 --> 05:12:40,000
was it the travel agent

7815
05:12:40,000 --> 05:12:42,560
we didn't know

7816
05:12:42,560 --> 05:12:44,958
now panicking and worried we decided to

7817
05:12:44,958 --> 05:12:46,560
contact eric who had booked our

7818
05:12:46,560 --> 05:12:49,200
discounted tickets we told him about the

7819
05:12:49,200 --> 05:12:51,920
travel agent allegations but he assured

7820
05:12:51,920 --> 05:12:54,878
us that there was nothing to worry about

7821
05:12:54,878 --> 05:12:57,600
he looked he rebooked our tickets and we

7822
05:12:57,600 --> 05:12:59,920
confirmed the flights

7823
05:12:59,920 --> 05:13:02,160
we continued enjoying our holiday bikes

7824
05:13:02,160 --> 05:13:04,160
i couldn't check the feeling that there

7825
05:13:04,160 --> 05:13:07,798
was something wrong

7826
05:13:10,240 --> 05:13:12,480
on 25th january we boarded our flights

7827
05:13:12,480 --> 05:13:15,280
back to path and landed on the 26th of

7828
05:13:15,280 --> 05:13:18,320
january 2018.

7829
05:13:18,320 --> 05:13:20,240
there were no issues experienced during

7830
05:13:20,240 --> 05:13:23,040
our flights we passed the passport check

7831
05:13:23,040 --> 05:13:26,320
but were flagged for additional checks

7832
05:13:26,320 --> 05:13:29,520
at the custom immigration area

7833
05:13:29,520 --> 05:13:31,520
we were directed to the site and advised

7834
05:13:31,520 --> 05:13:34,160
to sit and wait

7835
05:13:34,160 --> 05:13:36,638
a custom officer then came and asked for

7836
05:13:36,638 --> 05:13:40,240
a passport he asked us questions as is

7837
05:13:40,240 --> 05:13:43,600
normal to confirm our identities

7838
05:13:43,600 --> 05:13:45,520
where are we from

7839
05:13:45,520 --> 05:13:48,320
our reason for travel our occupation

7840
05:13:48,320 --> 05:13:50,480
visas

7841
05:13:50,480 --> 05:13:52,480
they went through our bags and asked us

7842
05:13:52,480 --> 05:13:54,400
to unlock our phones

7843
05:13:54,400 --> 05:13:58,638
not sure this was right but we complied

7844
05:13:58,638 --> 05:14:01,120
we had questions on our minds

7845
05:14:01,120 --> 05:14:02,878
what had we done

7846
05:14:02,878 --> 05:14:06,240
was it about the frontline cards

7847
05:14:06,240 --> 05:14:08,080
this didn't feel normal

7848
05:14:08,080 --> 05:14:10,958
but we waited

7849
05:14:10,958 --> 05:14:14,000
three hours later

7850
05:14:14,000 --> 05:14:16,400
two customer officers came back home

7851
05:14:16,400 --> 05:14:18,638
came back one holding two pieces of

7852
05:14:18,638 --> 05:14:19,760
paper

7853
05:14:19,760 --> 05:14:22,240
they told us a man and a woman

7854
05:14:22,240 --> 05:14:23,920
had attempted to enter australia with

7855
05:14:23,920 --> 05:14:26,080
our identities

7856
05:14:26,080 --> 05:14:27,280
shocked that

7857
05:14:27,280 --> 05:14:29,440
people could actually do this

7858
05:14:29,440 --> 05:14:32,638
we listened to their officers

7859
05:14:32,638 --> 05:14:34,718
and wanted to ask so many questions but

7860
05:14:34,718 --> 05:14:36,878
they advised us that the case was still

7861
05:14:36,878 --> 05:14:39,920
under investigations

7862
05:14:39,920 --> 05:14:41,600
they compared our passports with the

7863
05:14:41,600 --> 05:14:42,798
fake ones

7864
05:14:42,798 --> 05:14:44,400
and they could clearly tell the

7865
05:14:44,400 --> 05:14:45,760
difference

7866
05:14:45,760 --> 05:14:46,718
so the

7867
05:14:46,718 --> 05:14:50,080
two fake passports had wrong

7868
05:14:50,080 --> 05:14:52,560
passport numbers

7869
05:14:52,560 --> 05:14:54,000
wrong

7870
05:14:54,000 --> 05:14:56,080
date of birth

7871
05:14:56,080 --> 05:14:58,480
the issue and expiry dates were

7872
05:14:58,480 --> 05:15:00,160
different

7873
05:15:00,160 --> 05:15:01,760
and of course the images on the

7874
05:15:01,760 --> 05:15:04,638
passports were different

7875
05:15:04,638 --> 05:15:07,360
being a student at the time it got me

7876
05:15:07,360 --> 05:15:08,400
worried

7877
05:15:08,400 --> 05:15:10,080
and scared that they would deport me

7878
05:15:10,080 --> 05:15:13,440
back to kenya

7879
05:15:15,520 --> 05:15:18,000
then they verified our identities and

7880
05:15:18,000 --> 05:15:20,000
allowed us to go home

7881
05:15:20,000 --> 05:15:22,400
they'd advise us to change our email

7882
05:15:22,400 --> 05:15:23,680
passwords

7883
05:15:23,680 --> 05:15:25,760
internet banking password

7884
05:15:25,760 --> 05:15:28,798
pins and application passwords

7885
05:15:28,798 --> 05:15:30,958
what a relief

7886
05:15:30,958 --> 05:15:35,280
we felt like we are acting a movie

7887
05:15:38,480 --> 05:15:40,958
three months later

7888
05:15:40,958 --> 05:15:44,000
thinking we were out of trouble

7889
05:15:44,000 --> 05:15:46,160
my husband brian was sued by the same

7890
05:15:46,160 --> 05:15:47,600
travel agent

7891
05:15:47,600 --> 05:15:48,958
who reached out

7892
05:15:48,958 --> 05:15:51,760
while we were on holiday

7893
05:15:51,760 --> 05:15:53,840
the claim was that brian purchased two

7894
05:15:53,840 --> 05:15:55,760
air tickets

7895
05:15:55,760 --> 05:15:58,240
from canyon to path using fraudulent

7896
05:15:58,240 --> 05:16:01,440
american express cards and using fraud

7897
05:16:01,440 --> 05:16:04,000
passport as identification

7898
05:16:04,000 --> 05:16:06,680
they demanded to be paid 6

7899
05:16:06,680 --> 05:16:10,400
540 and 74 cents

7900
05:16:10,400 --> 05:16:12,798
amount equivalent to the air tickets and

7901
05:16:12,798 --> 05:16:15,440
countries

7902
05:16:16,718 --> 05:16:18,638
here are some of the faultless cards

7903
05:16:18,638 --> 05:16:20,320
under brand's name that were used for

7904
05:16:20,320 --> 05:16:23,520
the spurious activity

7905
05:16:23,680 --> 05:16:26,718
brian had never had any american express

7906
05:16:26,718 --> 05:16:30,400
or standard chartered cards

7907
05:16:30,480 --> 05:16:32,798
we went to court twice and presented our

7908
05:16:32,798 --> 05:16:35,040
case and we actually told the magistrate

7909
05:16:35,040 --> 05:16:36,320
of how we

7910
05:16:36,320 --> 05:16:38,480
we got the tickets

7911
05:16:38,480 --> 05:16:41,040
they might verified and confirmed our

7912
05:16:41,040 --> 05:16:42,638
identities

7913
05:16:42,638 --> 05:16:44,480
he clearly noted the difference in the

7914
05:16:44,480 --> 05:16:48,718
passports provided by the travel agent

7915
05:16:49,440 --> 05:16:52,560
and on 23rd october 2018

7916
05:16:52,560 --> 05:16:56,080
the case was dismissed

7917
05:16:57,600 --> 05:16:59,360
it was dismissed on the basis that the

7918
05:16:59,360 --> 05:17:03,520
travel agent did not do a proper kyc

7919
05:17:03,520 --> 05:17:06,000
lack of due diligence and the fact that

7920
05:17:06,000 --> 05:17:09,200
we had paid a substantial amount of

7921
05:17:09,200 --> 05:17:12,160
money for the tickets

7922
05:17:12,320 --> 05:17:15,280
all along i wondered how this happened

7923
05:17:15,280 --> 05:17:18,717
why who did it

7924
05:17:19,360 --> 05:17:21,520
i just completed a masters of cyber

7925
05:17:21,520 --> 05:17:22,638
security

7926
05:17:22,638 --> 05:17:24,958
identity theft should not have happened

7927
05:17:24,958 --> 05:17:27,440
to me or us

7928
05:17:27,440 --> 05:17:30,080
i thought i was vigilant enough

7929
05:17:30,080 --> 05:17:33,040
guess i was not

7930
05:17:33,120 --> 05:17:35,520
well we had our suspicions on who it

7931
05:17:35,520 --> 05:17:38,878
could have who could have done this but

7932
05:17:38,878 --> 05:17:40,718
we didn't want to dwell on it the case

7933
05:17:40,718 --> 05:17:42,958
was dismissed and that was all that

7934
05:17:42,958 --> 05:17:45,440
mattered

7935
05:17:46,000 --> 05:17:48,560
this can happen to anyone

7936
05:17:48,560 --> 05:17:49,600
remember

7937
05:17:49,600 --> 05:17:52,000
chip is expensive

7938
05:17:52,000 --> 05:17:54,798
use the proper channels to get to what

7939
05:17:54,798 --> 05:17:55,760
you want

7940
05:17:55,760 --> 05:17:57,840
no shortcuts

7941
05:17:57,840 --> 05:18:01,200
we learned our lesson

7942
05:18:03,040 --> 05:18:05,920
and this was the identity theft attempt

7943
05:18:05,920 --> 05:18:07,520
experience that

7944
05:18:07,520 --> 05:18:10,798
only fueled my hunger for cyber security

7945
05:18:10,798 --> 05:18:14,400
to hunt and detect the bad guys

7946
05:18:14,400 --> 05:18:18,080
well i marked my security career path

7947
05:18:18,080 --> 05:18:20,638
and all i could think of is how to catch

7948
05:18:20,638 --> 05:18:23,360
the bad guys

7949
05:18:24,560 --> 05:18:26,080
currently

7950
05:18:26,080 --> 05:18:28,320
i now work as a principal cyber

7951
05:18:28,320 --> 05:18:30,480
operations at bhp

7952
05:18:30,480 --> 05:18:35,040
catching the bad guys i monitor

7953
05:18:35,680 --> 05:18:38,560
detect identify suspicious activities in

7954
05:18:38,560 --> 05:18:41,760
the environment and manage incidents

7955
05:18:41,760 --> 05:18:44,000
a job i

7956
05:18:44,000 --> 05:18:45,520
enjoy doing

7957
05:18:45,520 --> 05:18:48,160
no day is the same and i learn new

7958
05:18:48,160 --> 05:18:50,798
things every day

7959
05:18:50,798 --> 05:18:53,840
i am passionate about cyber security and

7960
05:18:53,840 --> 05:18:56,320
still have a huge appetite for cyber

7961
05:18:56,320 --> 05:18:57,920
security

7962
05:18:57,920 --> 05:19:02,638
dreams are indeed valid don't you think

7963
05:19:05,200 --> 05:19:08,080
what's your why

7964
05:19:12,798 --> 05:19:14,718
i've shared two most significant

7965
05:19:14,718 --> 05:19:17,600
experience since in my life that has

7966
05:19:17,600 --> 05:19:20,480
made me rethink about my career choice

7967
05:19:20,480 --> 05:19:22,080
the first one was a co-worker who

7968
05:19:22,080 --> 05:19:24,400
allegedly pulled off i spent a

7969
05:19:24,400 --> 05:19:27,040
significant financial fraud

7970
05:19:27,040 --> 05:19:29,920
which planted cyber security

7971
05:19:29,920 --> 05:19:32,718
and the second one was an identity theft

7972
05:19:32,718 --> 05:19:35,840
attempt that confirmed my hunger to work

7973
05:19:35,840 --> 05:19:40,160
in cyber security defense and operation

7974
05:19:41,280 --> 05:19:43,200
by sharing my why

7975
05:19:43,200 --> 05:19:45,120
i hope to encourage everyone to find

7976
05:19:45,120 --> 05:19:46,878
their why

7977
05:19:46,878 --> 05:19:50,878
and work towards what inspires you

7978
05:19:51,440 --> 05:19:52,718
i will leave you with a quote from

7979
05:19:52,718 --> 05:19:53,920
michael

7980
05:19:53,920 --> 05:19:56,160
when you know your why you'll know your

7981
05:19:56,160 --> 05:19:57,280
way

7982
05:19:57,280 --> 05:19:58,958
and remember

7983
05:19:58,958 --> 05:20:00,718
it's not too late to start all over

7984
05:20:00,718 --> 05:20:03,280
again to change careers and follow your

7985
05:20:03,280 --> 05:20:04,160
dream

7986
05:20:04,160 --> 05:20:06,560
thank you

7987
05:20:06,560 --> 05:20:08,320
[Music]

7988
05:20:08,320 --> 05:20:11,600
that was a fantastic talk angela um i

7989
05:20:11,600 --> 05:20:13,200
think shana you've probably got a lot to

7990
05:20:13,200 --> 05:20:14,958
relate to that sort of experience based

7991
05:20:14,958 --> 05:20:17,680
on your um career path as well

7992
05:20:17,680 --> 05:20:18,718
i do

7993
05:20:18,718 --> 05:20:20,000
i um

7994
05:20:20,000 --> 05:20:21,680
i've done some investigations actually

7995
05:20:21,680 --> 05:20:24,240
into travel agencies or call centers

7996
05:20:24,240 --> 05:20:25,040
that

7997
05:20:25,040 --> 05:20:26,160
um

7998
05:20:26,160 --> 05:20:29,040
handle the calls incoming for travel

7999
05:20:29,040 --> 05:20:30,240
agencies

8000
05:20:30,240 --> 05:20:32,718
yeah and it when you're asking about the

8001
05:20:32,718 --> 05:20:34,480
you know why would they do that i mean

8002
05:20:34,480 --> 05:20:36,798
obviously everybody is different but it

8003
05:20:36,798 --> 05:20:38,400
was one of those things where we're in

8004
05:20:38,400 --> 05:20:40,160
investigating

8005
05:20:40,160 --> 05:20:42,718
you know who did it within the

8006
05:20:42,718 --> 05:20:44,400
organization

8007
05:20:44,400 --> 05:20:46,480
and

8008
05:20:46,480 --> 05:20:48,718
yeah the the money that they were making

8009
05:20:48,718 --> 05:20:50,718
by selling one credit card was more than

8010
05:20:50,718 --> 05:20:53,920
they were making in an entire month um

8011
05:20:53,920 --> 05:20:56,160
they were google searching for things

8012
05:20:56,160 --> 05:20:59,360
like a new mobile phone or a playstation

8013
05:20:59,360 --> 05:21:01,280
you know things that we take for granted

8014
05:21:01,280 --> 05:21:02,878
in australia

8015
05:21:02,878 --> 05:21:04,958
that was that was why they were doing it

8016
05:21:04,958 --> 05:21:06,638
obviously that doesn't make it right or

8017
05:21:06,638 --> 05:21:08,638
anything like that but um yeah it was a

8018
05:21:08,638 --> 05:21:10,240
little bit confronting to see that but

8019
05:21:10,240 --> 05:21:12,878
yes this is um i'm very sorry that you

8020
05:21:12,878 --> 05:21:14,400
had to go through that and two

8021
05:21:14,400 --> 05:21:16,718
experiences as well is

8022
05:21:16,718 --> 05:21:18,558
is um very traumatizing it must have

8023
05:21:18,558 --> 05:21:20,000
been horrible coming back into the

8024
05:21:20,000 --> 05:21:22,480
country and being pulled aside and not

8025
05:21:22,480 --> 05:21:23,600
knowing what's going on that's

8026
05:21:23,600 --> 05:21:25,280
terrifying

8027
05:21:25,280 --> 05:21:27,280
yeah it was hard and the

8028
05:21:27,280 --> 05:21:29,440
the biggest fear i had is being sent

8029
05:21:29,440 --> 05:21:30,798
back home

8030
05:21:30,798 --> 05:21:32,558
for something i actually did to do

8031
05:21:32,558 --> 05:21:34,400
knowing australia

8032
05:21:34,400 --> 05:21:36,160
laws you know

8033
05:21:36,160 --> 05:21:37,680
yeah so

8034
05:21:37,680 --> 05:21:40,878
well i'm glad you stayed

8035
05:21:40,958 --> 05:21:43,200
yeah you're good to present here are

8036
05:21:43,200 --> 05:21:45,120
there any questions ian i haven't been

8037
05:21:45,120 --> 05:21:46,400
watching the q a i don't think there's

8038
05:21:46,400 --> 05:21:48,160
any questions i think everyone is really

8039
05:21:48,160 --> 05:21:49,040
just

8040
05:21:49,040 --> 05:21:51,440
in shock about the story but also seeing

8041
05:21:51,440 --> 05:21:53,200
how important it is i do know there was

8042
05:21:53,200 --> 05:21:55,040
one person who um

8043
05:21:55,040 --> 05:21:57,520
says uh i recognize you from summer it's

8044
05:21:57,520 --> 05:21:58,878
extremely pleasing to see you in

8045
05:21:58,878 --> 05:22:01,760
security team loki is

8046
05:22:01,760 --> 05:22:03,120
super thrilled to see you've made your

8047
05:22:03,120 --> 05:22:04,558
move so obviously there's people out

8048
05:22:04,558 --> 05:22:06,400
there who are very happy to see that

8049
05:22:06,400 --> 05:22:08,080
you've moved into security as well and

8050
05:22:08,080 --> 05:22:09,360
you've obviously made that journey as

8051
05:22:09,360 --> 05:22:12,160
well so um i think it's only

8052
05:22:12,160 --> 05:22:13,840
you know it's amazing how the different

8053
05:22:13,840 --> 05:22:15,440
stories of people going in it we've got

8054
05:22:15,440 --> 05:22:17,680
about four stories this year and yours

8055
05:22:17,680 --> 05:22:19,920
is just not this year um this conference

8056
05:22:19,920 --> 05:22:22,080
yours is one of them and it's an amazing

8057
05:22:22,080 --> 05:22:24,558
way to see how people moved into it and

8058
05:22:24,558 --> 05:22:26,320
i love the way you frame it as

8059
05:22:26,320 --> 05:22:28,958
your why right um it's not necessarily

8060
05:22:28,958 --> 05:22:30,400
about the money it's not necessarily

8061
05:22:30,400 --> 05:22:32,480
about um the fame it could be the

8062
05:22:32,480 --> 05:22:34,878
problems that you're dealing with or um

8063
05:22:34,878 --> 05:22:36,160
a sense of

8064
05:22:36,160 --> 05:22:38,558
um duty if you're in the military or

8065
05:22:38,558 --> 05:22:40,240
something like that like those kind of

8066
05:22:40,240 --> 05:22:42,240
things that drive you more than anything

8067
05:22:42,240 --> 05:22:45,120
else

8068
05:22:45,120 --> 05:22:46,320

8141
05:25:13,680 --> 05:25:16,000
join for the

8142
05:25:16,000 --> 05:25:18,240
join for the ethics stay for the money

8143
05:25:18,240 --> 05:25:20,080
maybe i mean

8144
05:25:20,080 --> 05:25:21,360
money is a part of it right we can't

8145
05:25:21,360 --> 05:25:23,120
deny that money isn't a part of it but i

8146
05:25:23,120 --> 05:25:25,840

8151

06:04:12,958 --> 06:04:14,798
um i have been joined on the couch by

8280
06:04:14,798 --> 06:04:17,840
rose this time

8281
06:04:18,718 --> 06:04:20,638
as with zero zero is now annoyed because

8282
06:04:20,638 --> 06:04:22,400
he's not getting any attention but rose

8283
06:04:22,400 --> 06:04:24,000
is

8284
06:04:24,000 --> 06:04:25,760

06:04:31,280 --> 06:04:32,558
anything about wine

8289
06:04:32,558 --> 06:04:35,920
it is a blend of grenache

8290
06:04:35,920 --> 06:04:39,200
shiraz and malbec

8291
06:04:39,200 --> 06:04:40,958

06:04:40,958 --> 06:04:42,798
enough of one kind

8293
06:04:42,798 --> 06:04:44,000
so they thought they would throw them

8294
06:04:44,000 --> 06:04:45,040
all together

8295
06:04:45,040 --> 06:04:46,400
pretty much that's usually how they get

8296
06:04:46,400 --> 06:04:48,320
there but yeah no it's a it's a thing

8297
06:04:48,320 --> 06:04:50,240

8342
06:06:26,000 --> 06:06:27,360
i do hear he was going to put in your

8343
06:06:27,360 --> 06:06:28,878
performance review that because you did

8344
06:06:28,878 --> 06:06:31,040
comfy con you'd have to do a shot

8345
06:06:31,040 --> 06:06:33,120
so um that was something we were

8346
06:06:33,120 --> 06:06:34,320
discussing but we're not going to make

8347

8350
06:06:40,160 --> 06:06:41,120
uh

8351
06:06:41,120 --> 06:06:44,240
i will go nuggies but only because i

8352
06:06:44,240 --> 06:06:46,400
have children and convincing them to eat

8353
06:06:46,400 --> 06:06:48,638
tenders is a lot harder

8354
06:06:48,638 --> 06:06:51,638
for

8355
06:06:52,080 --> 06:06:53,600
that's a good one i mean you can't get

8356
06:06:53,600 --> 06:06:55,120
tenders in the shape of dinosaurs

8357
06:06:55,120 --> 06:06:56,638
whereas you can get nuggies in the shape

8358
06:06:56,638 --> 06:06:59,520
of dinosaurs yeah in 1.2 kilo packs yeah

8363
06:07:11,120 --> 06:07:13,440

8364
06:07:13,440 --> 06:07:15,360

06:09:19,600 --> 06:09:21,600
and why did i take a step from senior to

8429
06:09:21,600 --> 06:09:22,798
junior

8430
06:09:22,798 --> 06:09:24,718
so to cover those i have a story for you

8431
06:09:24,718 --> 06:09:25,840
which is a little bit of a longer

8432
06:09:25,840 --> 06:09:28,320
introduction so i apologize

8433
06:09:28,320 --> 06:09:30,400
um so as i said i was working for a

8434
06:09:30,400 --> 06:09:32,718
niche msp in melbourne who who

8435
06:09:32,718 --> 06:09:34,798
specializes in mac and cross-platform

8436
06:09:34,798 --> 06:09:37,360
environments um in small and medium

8437
06:09:37,360 --> 06:09:40,160
businesses it is expected when you're

8438
06:09:40,160 --> 06:09:42,400
working with these businesses that you

8439
06:09:42,400 --> 06:09:43,120
are

8440
06:09:43,120 --> 06:09:44,558
the consultant

8441
06:09:44,558 --> 06:09:46,878
for everything to do with a computer so

8442
06:09:46,878 --> 06:09:49,600
i was well versed in all aspects of it

8443
06:09:49,600 --> 06:09:51,440
and you can become a one-stop shop for

8444
06:09:51,440 --> 06:09:52,958
everything um

8445
06:09:52,958 --> 06:09:55,120
it was varied and it was challenging

8446
06:09:55,120 --> 06:09:57,600
but over time i developed an interest in

8447
06:09:57,600 --> 06:09:59,840
security specifically

8448
06:09:59,840 --> 06:10:01,520
how it works how our clients were

8449
06:10:01,520 --> 06:10:03,440
vulnerable and what we could do to

8450
06:10:03,440 --> 06:10:05,280
protect them

8451
06:10:05,280 --> 06:10:07,280
while some of my clients were open about

8452
06:10:07,280 --> 06:10:09,360
their budgets and priorities and

8453
06:10:09,360 --> 06:10:11,280
a lot of the time we're met with

8454
06:10:11,280 --> 06:10:13,840
uh it's not really the time for that as

8455
06:10:13,840 --> 06:10:15,600
as tracy's talk went through which was

8456
06:10:15,600 --> 06:10:18,798
fantastic um all too often i was met

8457
06:10:18,798 --> 06:10:21,920
with a variation of one of these three

8458
06:10:21,920 --> 06:10:24,320
it was either we're too small to be

8459
06:10:24,320 --> 06:10:25,280
hacked

8460
06:10:25,280 --> 06:10:27,360
which is not true of course but they

8461
06:10:27,360 --> 06:10:28,638
believe that

8462
06:10:28,638 --> 06:10:31,200
macs don't get viruses which is

8463
06:10:31,200 --> 06:10:33,200
not quite true and especially not true

8464
06:10:33,200 --> 06:10:35,600
if you run windows on them

8465
06:10:35,600 --> 06:10:37,520
and if we get hacked i'll just close up

8466
06:10:37,520 --> 06:10:39,120
shop and retire which

8467
06:10:39,120 --> 06:10:41,840
i don't really have an answer for um so

8468
06:10:41,840 --> 06:10:44,480
i was totally shocked and blown away

8469
06:10:44,480 --> 06:10:46,840
over my years of how

8470
06:10:46,840 --> 06:10:51,600
um how people sort of disregarded their

8471
06:10:51,600 --> 06:10:54,240
uh their security in their systems for

8472
06:10:54,240 --> 06:10:55,920
for a small business

8473
06:10:55,920 --> 06:10:58,480
so i had to deal naturally then with a

8474
06:10:58,480 --> 06:10:59,920
whole bunch of different security

8475
06:10:59,920 --> 06:11:01,520
related incidents

8476
06:11:01,520 --> 06:11:04,000
climate clients getting ransomware some

8477
06:11:04,000 --> 06:11:06,080
had backups some didn't

8478
06:11:06,080 --> 06:11:08,080
other clients with internal sabotage and

8479
06:11:08,080 --> 06:11:11,200
embezzling um i dealt with phishing mail

8480
06:11:11,200 --> 06:11:12,878
server compromises i dealt with

8481
06:11:12,878 --> 06:11:14,400
everything

8482
06:11:14,400 --> 06:11:17,360
each time i would fix the task uh oh

8483
06:11:17,360 --> 06:11:18,958
sorry i'd do the task and i'd fix the

8484
06:11:18,958 --> 06:11:20,080
issue

8485
06:11:20,080 --> 06:11:21,440
but the clients were never really

8486
06:11:21,440 --> 06:11:23,840
interested in fixing the root problem

8487
06:11:23,840 --> 06:11:26,798
just getting back to work which again

8488
06:11:26,798 --> 06:11:28,558
is kind of natural

8489
06:11:28,558 --> 06:11:31,600
so i brought this up with my manager and

8490
06:11:31,600 --> 06:11:34,240
i said that i can't really sell security

8491
06:11:34,240 --> 06:11:36,638
solutions because i don't understand

8492
06:11:36,638 --> 06:11:38,798
security enough to sell it i can't

8493
06:11:38,798 --> 06:11:40,638
convince myself that i need to sell

8494
06:11:40,638 --> 06:11:43,680
these things so why can't i convince no

8495
06:11:43,680 --> 06:11:45,520
wonder i can't convince them

8496
06:11:45,520 --> 06:11:47,600
um he shot me down basically he said

8497
06:11:47,600 --> 06:11:49,760
we're a small team uh we all have a role

8498
06:11:49,760 --> 06:11:51,520
to play he knows about security if

8499
06:11:51,520 --> 06:11:53,120
somebody's having security troubles we

8500
06:11:53,120 --> 06:11:55,280
should be talk referring them to him

8501
06:11:55,280 --> 06:11:56,878
there wasn't a lot of reason for me to

8502
06:11:56,878 --> 06:11:59,600
do it this is quite common in the

8503
06:11:59,600 --> 06:12:02,400
sysadmin sort of industry especially for

8504
06:12:02,400 --> 06:12:04,080
niche msps

8505
06:12:04,080 --> 06:12:07,040
and such and consequently uh it meant

8506
06:12:07,040 --> 06:12:08,798
that i didn't get the training that i

8507
06:12:08,798 --> 06:12:10,718
was looking for so duplicate me somewhat

8508
06:12:10,718 --> 06:12:13,520
though he did enroll me in a vendor set

8509
06:12:13,520 --> 06:12:15,840
cert which if anyone has ever done any

8510
06:12:15,840 --> 06:12:18,080
of those knows just how pointless they

8511
06:12:18,080 --> 06:12:19,200
are

8512
06:12:19,200 --> 06:12:21,200
um so i gave up on asking him for

8513
06:12:21,200 --> 06:12:22,400
training and i went back to my

8514
06:12:22,400 --> 06:12:25,200
day-to-day work

8515
06:12:25,520 --> 06:12:28,080
i was frustrated by it but after a few

8516
06:12:28,080 --> 06:12:30,558
years in fact quite a few years so in

8517
06:12:30,558 --> 06:12:32,400
2019

8518
06:12:32,400 --> 06:12:35,440
i was in the delivery room with my wife

8519
06:12:35,440 --> 06:12:37,520
we were waiting for my second child to

8520
06:12:37,520 --> 06:12:38,878
make an appearance

8521
06:12:38,878 --> 06:12:40,958
it was a long one there was time for

8522
06:12:40,958 --> 06:12:43,520
this so i was venting to my wife about

8523
06:12:43,520 --> 06:12:45,360
my frustrations

8524
06:12:45,360 --> 06:12:47,280
and she told me what else supportive

8525
06:12:47,280 --> 06:12:49,040
partners and family members do in this

8526
06:12:49,040 --> 06:12:51,120
kind of situation she said get off your

8527
06:12:51,120 --> 06:12:53,600
ass and go do something about it

8528
06:12:53,600 --> 06:12:54,558
um

8529
06:12:54,558 --> 06:12:57,360
i explained that moving into a new role

8530
06:12:57,360 --> 06:12:59,680
like that um would may not have to

8531
06:12:59,680 --> 06:13:01,440
change companies and therefore likely

8532
06:13:01,440 --> 06:13:04,160
stepped down in seniority and she said

8533
06:13:04,160 --> 06:13:06,080
so what i don't care

8534
06:13:06,080 --> 06:13:06,878
so

8535
06:13:06,878 --> 06:13:08,878
there's no arguing there

8536
06:13:08,878 --> 06:13:09,920
um

8537
06:13:09,920 --> 06:13:12,558
i spent my paternity leave

8538
06:13:12,558 --> 06:13:13,600
uh

8539
06:13:13,600 --> 06:13:15,600
aside from helping my wife in every

8540
06:13:15,600 --> 06:13:17,840
possible way and dealing with my

8541
06:13:17,840 --> 06:13:20,320
four-year-old child um

8542
06:13:20,320 --> 06:13:22,080
i spent some time looking into cyber

8543
06:13:22,080 --> 06:13:24,320
security roles and what they do and what

8544
06:13:24,320 --> 06:13:26,160
they're for and which one would suit me

8545
06:13:26,160 --> 06:13:28,798
and realize i know nothing about

8546
06:13:28,798 --> 06:13:31,120
security so i'd been in the industry for

8547
06:13:31,120 --> 06:13:33,360
seven it industry for seven years now

8548
06:13:33,360 --> 06:13:35,360
and i knew nothing so from stock

8549
06:13:35,360 --> 06:13:37,760
analytics to threat modeling grc pen

8550
06:13:37,760 --> 06:13:38,878
testing

8551
06:13:38,878 --> 06:13:41,040
no idea what i wanted to do

8552
06:13:41,040 --> 06:13:42,958
so i bought one of those generic get

8553
06:13:42,958 --> 06:13:44,798
into cyber security courses from an

8554
06:13:44,798 --> 06:13:46,718
education provider you'll know the ones

8555
06:13:46,718 --> 06:13:48,878
they send you messages all the time i

8556
06:13:48,878 --> 06:13:50,718
did that right

8557
06:13:50,718 --> 06:13:51,520
um

8558
06:13:51,520 --> 06:13:53,520
it costs an arm and a leg i think sam's

8559
06:13:53,520 --> 06:13:55,040
kind of money

8560
06:13:55,040 --> 06:13:56,878
um and they claimed that they'd get me

8561
06:13:56,878 --> 06:13:59,120
the certifications required to get the

8562
06:13:59,120 --> 06:14:01,760
role i wanted which is great except i

8563
06:14:01,760 --> 06:14:04,160
didn't know what i wanted to do so i

8564
06:14:04,160 --> 06:14:06,558
paid the money out of my own pocket and

8565
06:14:06,558 --> 06:14:08,160
i committed to it

8566
06:14:08,160 --> 06:14:11,040
and every day i'd put in hours of study

8567
06:14:11,040 --> 06:14:13,120
so i was around full-time work newborn

8568
06:14:13,120 --> 06:14:16,160
child four-year-old a casual side job

8569
06:14:16,160 --> 06:14:18,240
i had no social life for a very long

8570
06:14:18,240 --> 06:14:19,280
time

8571
06:14:19,280 --> 06:14:21,040
uh but i had an advantage that many

8572
06:14:21,040 --> 06:14:23,040
students don't i could apply all the

8573
06:14:23,040 --> 06:14:24,798
knowledge that i learned

8574
06:14:24,798 --> 06:14:26,878
while i was studying to the real world

8575
06:14:26,878 --> 06:14:28,160
in real time

8576
06:14:28,160 --> 06:14:28,878
so

8577
06:14:28,878 --> 06:14:30,558
i can confirm that learning this stuff

8578
06:14:30,558 --> 06:14:32,798
did significantly improve my ability to

8579
06:14:32,798 --> 06:14:34,718
talk to clients about security and

8580
06:14:34,718 --> 06:14:37,760
resulted in dramatic increases in sales

8581
06:14:37,760 --> 06:14:40,798
and uptakes of security solutions uh for

8582
06:14:40,798 --> 06:14:42,558
our little business

8583
06:14:42,558 --> 06:14:44,958
um eventually i found a passion for pen

8584
06:14:44,958 --> 06:14:46,958
testing um

8585
06:14:46,958 --> 06:14:48,558
possibly because it was so different

8586
06:14:48,558 --> 06:14:50,080
from what i was doing

8587
06:14:50,080 --> 06:14:52,080
so i completed the course over the

8588
06:14:52,080 --> 06:14:54,798
course of about two years uh which for

8589
06:14:54,798 --> 06:14:57,440
pentester meant i had to complete ch

8590
06:14:57,440 --> 06:15:00,798
don't judge me i didn't know um and i'd

8591
06:15:00,798 --> 06:15:02,480
already paid for it so i was going to do

8592
06:15:02,480 --> 06:15:03,600
it anyway

8593
06:15:03,600 --> 06:15:04,480
um

8594
06:15:04,480 --> 06:15:06,798
all luck was about yeah about two years

8595
06:15:06,798 --> 06:15:10,160
of study from zero to ceh

8596
06:15:10,160 --> 06:15:12,000
at this point i made the decision to

8597
06:15:12,000 --> 06:15:14,638
start looking into the field and getting

8598
06:15:14,638 --> 06:15:15,600
a job

8599
06:15:15,600 --> 06:15:17,520
i'd spent just about every other day

8600
06:15:17,520 --> 06:15:20,558
looking through linkedin indeed seek

8601
06:15:20,558 --> 06:15:22,320
or developing skills on hack the box and

8602
06:15:22,320 --> 06:15:23,680
try hack me i tried to mix it up a

8603
06:15:23,680 --> 06:15:25,440
little bit

8604
06:15:25,440 --> 06:15:26,958
but every listing i found was for a

8605
06:15:26,958 --> 06:15:28,718
senior pen tester five years of

8606
06:15:28,718 --> 06:15:31,200
experience must have oscp must have

8607
06:15:31,200 --> 06:15:32,240
crest

8608
06:15:32,240 --> 06:15:33,920
i didn't have five years of experience i

8609
06:15:33,920 --> 06:15:35,920
didn't have oscp and i wasn't prepared

8610
06:15:35,920 --> 06:15:37,680
to drop another two thousand dollars on

8611
06:15:37,680 --> 06:15:39,280
a certification that might get me an

8612
06:15:39,280 --> 06:15:40,558
interview

8613
06:15:40,558 --> 06:15:43,440
so despite having years of it experience

8614
06:15:43,440 --> 06:15:44,638
under my belt

8615
06:15:44,638 --> 06:15:46,480
the title of technical manager at this

8616
06:15:46,480 --> 06:15:48,080
point um

8617
06:15:48,080 --> 06:15:50,080
it still took over 50 applications

8618
06:15:50,080 --> 06:15:52,240
before i got my first interview there's

8619
06:15:52,240 --> 06:15:54,240
another 20 before i got a job offer

8620
06:15:54,240 --> 06:15:55,840
which i had to refuse because it would

8621
06:15:55,840 --> 06:15:57,760
invent that i had to change

8622
06:15:57,760 --> 06:16:00,878
relocate my family to another state

8623
06:16:00,878 --> 06:16:02,958
and another 30 again before i got my

8624
06:16:02,958 --> 06:16:05,200
dream job so all in all about nine

8625
06:16:05,200 --> 06:16:08,400
months of job hunting uh and about two

8626
06:16:08,400 --> 06:16:12,400
and a half years from the start

8627
06:16:12,558 --> 06:16:16,160
so i say all of that to say that it's

8628
06:16:16,160 --> 06:16:18,798
not a quick journey for anybody mine is

8629
06:16:18,798 --> 06:16:20,878
different to everybody's of course but

8630
06:16:20,878 --> 06:16:22,958
you may find similarities in yours and i

8631
06:16:22,958 --> 06:16:25,920
hope that you find your way if that's

8632
06:16:25,920 --> 06:16:29,280
what you're looking for um

8633
06:16:29,280 --> 06:16:31,520
once i got there

8634
06:16:31,520 --> 06:16:33,120
uh

8635
06:16:33,120 --> 06:16:36,240
i found that there was quite a lot of uh

8636
06:16:36,240 --> 06:16:38,638
difference between what i expected the

8637
06:16:38,638 --> 06:16:40,080
job to be

8638
06:16:40,080 --> 06:16:42,320
and what it actually was not in a bad

8639
06:16:42,320 --> 06:16:44,718
way just different

8640
06:16:44,718 --> 06:16:46,400
there's a lot of gaps in the training

8641
06:16:46,400 --> 06:16:47,760
that's provided

8642
06:16:47,760 --> 06:16:50,480
and even the training i've done since

8643
06:16:50,480 --> 06:16:54,000
um has not really covered these sort of

8644
06:16:54,000 --> 06:16:55,840
topics so i wanted to go over a couple

8645
06:16:55,840 --> 06:16:58,718
of things about pen testing

8646
06:16:58,718 --> 06:17:00,798
um that you'll learn in the first few

8647
06:17:00,798 --> 06:17:01,920
months

8648
06:17:01,920 --> 06:17:04,718
that is nice to know ahead of time

8649
06:17:04,718 --> 06:17:07,760
um and some of these you might debate

8650
06:17:07,760 --> 06:17:09,600
and that's okay but

8651
06:17:09,600 --> 06:17:10,958
this is um

8652
06:17:10,958 --> 06:17:13,760
these are the few things that i've found

8653
06:17:13,760 --> 06:17:17,040
so the first is testing uh expectations

8654
06:17:17,040 --> 06:17:20,080
so the the courses and online training

8655
06:17:20,080 --> 06:17:22,798
such as hack the box try acme uh shows

8656
06:17:22,798 --> 06:17:24,480
like mr robot stuff like that they

8657
06:17:24,480 --> 06:17:27,200
romanticize hacking they give students

8658
06:17:27,200 --> 06:17:28,558
the impression that they're gonna spend

8659
06:17:28,558 --> 06:17:30,558
all their time hacking away getting

8660
06:17:30,558 --> 06:17:32,480
shells root privileges

8661
06:17:32,480 --> 06:17:33,280
uh

8662
06:17:33,280 --> 06:17:34,638
they're gonna get them everywhere left

8663
06:17:34,638 --> 06:17:36,000
right center because they're some kind

8664
06:17:36,000 --> 06:17:37,600
of hacking god

8665
06:17:37,600 --> 06:17:38,558
um

8666
06:17:38,558 --> 06:17:41,440
training providers encourage students or

8667
06:17:41,440 --> 06:17:43,440
some training providers encourage

8668
06:17:43,440 --> 06:17:44,798
students to believe that they're in it

8669
06:17:44,798 --> 06:17:47,200
for themselves that that asking for help

8670
06:17:47,200 --> 06:17:50,878
is weak and if you do it you suck

8671
06:17:50,878 --> 06:17:52,718
the reality of the situation is very

8672
06:17:52,718 --> 06:17:54,320
very different

8673
06:17:54,320 --> 06:17:57,040
and i really hope you don't fall into

8674
06:17:57,040 --> 06:17:58,400
that trap

8675
06:17:58,400 --> 06:18:01,520
it took me a while to adjust

8676
06:18:01,520 --> 06:18:04,240
and it was much better once i did so

8677
06:18:04,240 --> 06:18:06,160
a couple of starting on the first sort

8678
06:18:06,160 --> 06:18:07,840
of points

8679
06:18:07,840 --> 06:18:12,080
firstly because the majority of testing

8680
06:18:12,080 --> 06:18:14,320
i have performed since i started the job

8681
06:18:14,320 --> 06:18:15,280
has been

8682
06:18:15,280 --> 06:18:17,520
external and web application rather than

8683
06:18:17,520 --> 06:18:19,680
internals and it seems to be

8684
06:18:19,680 --> 06:18:22,878
the trend nowadays um there's a lot more

8685
06:18:22,878 --> 06:18:26,000
tests for external and web app

8686
06:18:26,000 --> 06:18:28,400
so going on site plugging into the

8687
06:18:28,400 --> 06:18:30,558
network poisoning connections dropping

8688
06:18:30,558 --> 06:18:33,120
kernel exploits and getting domain admin

8689
06:18:33,120 --> 06:18:35,440
is not your everyday

8690
06:18:35,440 --> 06:18:37,280
in fact you every day is more likely

8691
06:18:37,280 --> 06:18:39,520
running message scans and manipulating

8692
06:18:39,520 --> 06:18:41,680
requests in burp suite

8693
06:18:41,680 --> 06:18:45,520
from probably from your home um

8694
06:18:45,520 --> 06:18:47,360
while it's possible to gain shells

8695
06:18:47,360 --> 06:18:49,280
through externals and web apps and i

8696
06:18:49,280 --> 06:18:52,160
have done it it's not common at all

8697
06:18:52,160 --> 06:18:53,760
uh pen testing

8698
06:18:53,760 --> 06:18:55,360
is a requirement of the development

8699
06:18:55,360 --> 06:18:58,400
process and compliance nowadays and it's

8700
06:18:58,400 --> 06:18:59,920
likely that the applications that you're

8701
06:18:59,920 --> 06:19:01,760
testing have been tested before so a lot

8702
06:19:01,760 --> 06:19:03,440
of the low-hanging fruit's already been

8703
06:19:03,440 --> 06:19:05,760
picked

8704
06:19:06,080 --> 06:19:07,840
so for example if you have a client that

8705
06:19:07,840 --> 06:19:09,920
has their external environment tested

8706
06:19:09,920 --> 06:19:11,680
every year for complaints they don't

8707
06:19:11,680 --> 06:19:13,280
have any services

8708
06:19:13,280 --> 06:19:14,798
so you scan their

8709
06:19:14,798 --> 06:19:17,360
in scope specifically in scope ip

8710
06:19:17,360 --> 06:19:19,920
addresses you do your osin you find no

8711
06:19:19,920 --> 06:19:22,320
open ports no working credentials no way

8712
06:19:22,320 --> 06:19:23,920
to get in within the confines of the

8713
06:19:23,920 --> 06:19:25,840
scope you now have to produce a report

8714
06:19:25,840 --> 06:19:27,600
with no findings and it's not because

8715
06:19:27,600 --> 06:19:29,440
you're bad at your job it's just because

8716
06:19:29,440 --> 06:19:31,840
there's nothing much to find anymore

8717
06:19:31,840 --> 06:19:34,080
and that takes some time to get used to

8718
06:19:34,080 --> 06:19:36,400
it doesn't help the imposter syndrome

8719
06:19:36,400 --> 06:19:39,280
but luckily for me and hopefully for you

8720
06:19:39,280 --> 06:19:41,840
you have a team to help you and verify

8721
06:19:41,840 --> 06:19:44,080
your tests and and confirm that you've

8722
06:19:44,080 --> 06:19:45,920
done everything that you can

8723
06:19:45,920 --> 06:19:48,160
and then you can contact the client

8724
06:19:48,160 --> 06:19:50,558
and talk to them about it and then

8725
06:19:50,558 --> 06:19:51,920
move on to the next test which is

8726
06:19:51,920 --> 06:19:55,360
something that i want to talk about next

8727
06:19:55,360 --> 06:19:56,878
um

8728
06:19:56,878 --> 06:19:58,798
so the next thing is interpersonal

8729
06:19:58,798 --> 06:20:00,958
skills or soft skills and i like calling

8730
06:20:00,958 --> 06:20:03,680
them soft skills but personal skills

8731
06:20:03,680 --> 06:20:05,840
while hacking appeals to everyone there

8732
06:20:05,840 --> 06:20:08,240
is certainly a stereotype of antisocial

8733
06:20:08,240 --> 06:20:10,000
basement dwellers that you need to kind

8734
06:20:10,000 --> 06:20:11,520
of contend with

8735
06:20:11,520 --> 06:20:13,360
um and therefore in comes your

8736
06:20:13,360 --> 06:20:14,878
interpersonal skills

8737
06:20:14,878 --> 06:20:16,160
um

8738
06:20:16,160 --> 06:20:18,240
from discussions with my peers and and

8739
06:20:18,240 --> 06:20:20,400
people in the industry it seems that

8740
06:20:20,400 --> 06:20:22,958
personal skills are more and more often

8741
06:20:22,958 --> 06:20:25,200
the things that break people when they

8742
06:20:25,200 --> 06:20:26,718
enter the industry

8743
06:20:26,718 --> 06:20:28,638
um the industry is heavily

8744
06:20:28,638 --> 06:20:31,040
reputation-based you're not offering a

8745
06:20:31,040 --> 06:20:32,718
unique widget

8746
06:20:32,718 --> 06:20:35,600
or something that only we can sell you

8747
06:20:35,600 --> 06:20:37,680
you're selling a service that's offered

8748
06:20:37,680 --> 06:20:39,680
by many others including really big

8749
06:20:39,680 --> 06:20:40,718
players

8750
06:20:40,718 --> 06:20:42,878
um so you need to offer the client

8751
06:20:42,878 --> 06:20:44,718
something that only you or your team can

8752
06:20:44,718 --> 06:20:45,840
offer

8753
06:20:45,840 --> 06:20:47,680
and for for me

8754
06:20:47,680 --> 06:20:49,840
uh this was transferable skills from my

8755
06:20:49,840 --> 06:20:52,320
old job being a niche msp so that's

8756
06:20:52,320 --> 06:20:53,920
talking to clients and getting to know

8757
06:20:53,920 --> 06:20:55,520
what they want to achieve from their

8758
06:20:55,520 --> 06:20:56,878
test

8759
06:20:56,878 --> 06:20:58,718
are they pushing for change in the

8760
06:20:58,718 --> 06:21:01,280
organization is it for compliance

8761
06:21:01,280 --> 06:21:03,600
uh what are their expectations from the

8762
06:21:03,600 --> 06:21:06,080
test and what data specifically what

8763
06:21:06,080 --> 06:21:07,600
data if compromised would have the

8764
06:21:07,600 --> 06:21:10,240
largest impact on the business

8765
06:21:10,240 --> 06:21:12,718
these questions are all questions we can

8766
06:21:12,718 --> 06:21:14,320
ask as a pen tester that a malicious

8767
06:21:14,320 --> 06:21:15,760
hacker cannot

8768
06:21:15,760 --> 06:21:17,120
it's important to understand that we

8769
06:21:17,120 --> 06:21:18,638
have a limited time during our

8770
06:21:18,638 --> 06:21:20,160
engagement to provide an accurate

8771
06:21:20,160 --> 06:21:22,160
assessment accurately gauging the

8772
06:21:22,160 --> 06:21:23,760
client's requirements

8773
06:21:23,760 --> 06:21:25,760
can help to improve efficiency and most

8774
06:21:25,760 --> 06:21:28,240
importantly help to provide valuable

8775
06:21:28,240 --> 06:21:29,840
feedback to the client

8776
06:21:29,840 --> 06:21:31,440
sometimes there's a discrepancy between

8777
06:21:31,440 --> 06:21:33,280
us and the club and the clients as to

8778
06:21:33,280 --> 06:21:35,920
what is a critical impact vulnerability

8779
06:21:35,920 --> 06:21:38,718
and these conversations can help us uh

8780
06:21:38,718 --> 06:21:40,320
to bridge that gap

8781
06:21:40,320 --> 06:21:43,280
so while getting domain admins great

8782
06:21:43,280 --> 06:21:44,878
there can be more impactful things for

8783
06:21:44,878 --> 06:21:46,478
the business than that so the test of a

8784
06:21:46,478 --> 06:21:47,920
good pen tester is not whether or not

8785
06:21:47,920 --> 06:21:50,638
you can get a da on their environment

8786
06:21:50,638 --> 06:21:51,440
and

8787
06:21:51,440 --> 06:21:52,878
if you're on an internal there's a

8788
06:21:52,878 --> 06:21:56,000
really good chance that you can um but

8789
06:21:56,000 --> 06:21:57,840
what else can you do like can you see

8790
06:21:57,840 --> 06:22:00,638
their cameras uh can you modify any

8791
06:22:00,638 --> 06:22:02,798
footage can you open doors

8792
06:22:02,798 --> 06:22:04,718
can you read financial data from a low

8793
06:22:04,718 --> 06:22:06,638
privileged account can you bypass access

8794
06:22:06,638 --> 06:22:09,120
controls can you get onto their what

8795
06:22:09,120 --> 06:22:12,000
their wi-fi sorry excuse me and is that

8796
06:22:12,000 --> 06:22:13,680
private information or private

8797
06:22:13,680 --> 06:22:15,920
information that their clients exposed

8798
06:22:15,920 --> 06:22:16,958
um

8799
06:22:16,958 --> 06:22:18,718
all these things can be more impactful

8800
06:22:18,718 --> 06:22:20,638
to the business than getting domain

8801
06:22:20,638 --> 06:22:22,718
admin and in the right context

8802
06:22:22,718 --> 06:22:24,878
um sorry

8803
06:22:24,878 --> 06:22:26,160
they can be more impactful to the

8804
06:22:26,160 --> 06:22:28,320
business than getting domain admin in

8805
06:22:28,320 --> 06:22:30,478
the right context but more importantly

8806
06:22:30,478 --> 06:22:32,000
these things are better understood by

8807
06:22:32,000 --> 06:22:34,000
the executives than

8808
06:22:34,000 --> 06:22:35,360
getting domain admin they don't

8809
06:22:35,360 --> 06:22:36,878
understand necessarily the difference

8810
06:22:36,878 --> 06:22:39,840
between a local user and a domain user

8811
06:22:39,840 --> 06:22:42,718
or a domain admin so

8812
06:22:42,718 --> 06:22:44,320
talking about these things actually

8813
06:22:44,320 --> 06:22:46,080
causes impact to the business than

8814
06:22:46,080 --> 06:22:47,680
things that they care about

8815
06:22:47,680 --> 06:22:49,760
getting access to cameras or pii in a

8816
06:22:49,760 --> 06:22:51,840
school or a hospital or a bank is far

8817
06:22:51,840 --> 06:22:53,920
bigger problem than necessarily than

8818
06:22:53,920 --> 06:22:56,478
getting the main ad though

8819
06:22:56,478 --> 06:22:59,360
the two are really this can be the same

8820
06:22:59,360 --> 06:23:00,478
um

8821
06:23:00,478 --> 06:23:02,638
showing the impact is important

8822
06:23:02,638 --> 06:23:04,558
and i can assure you

8823
06:23:04,558 --> 06:23:05,520
um

8824
06:23:05,520 --> 06:23:08,000
that they will find those findings far

8825
06:23:08,000 --> 06:23:10,160
more interesting so spending the time to

8826
06:23:10,160 --> 06:23:11,520
find out what's actually important to

8827
06:23:11,520 --> 06:23:13,520
the client prioritizing your test to

8828
06:23:13,520 --> 06:23:16,000
find those things

8829
06:23:16,000 --> 06:23:16,958
can

8830
06:23:16,958 --> 06:23:18,478
to find the things that have the largest

8831
06:23:18,478 --> 06:23:21,120
impact is valuable and more efficient

8832
06:23:21,120 --> 06:23:22,638
for you

8833
06:23:22,638 --> 06:23:24,558
and i can assure you no matter what

8834
06:23:24,558 --> 06:23:25,680
people say

8835
06:23:25,680 --> 06:23:27,760
no one wants to read a 200-page report

8836
06:23:27,760 --> 06:23:29,680
on every single low-impact phone you can

8837
06:23:29,680 --> 06:23:31,120
find

8838
06:23:31,120 --> 06:23:35,200
you just don't so speaking of reports

8839
06:23:35,280 --> 06:23:37,360
reports

8840
06:23:37,360 --> 06:23:39,040
you will spend so much time doing

8841
06:23:39,040 --> 06:23:41,840
reports um every company approaches

8842
06:23:41,840 --> 06:23:44,878
report writing differently uh and we all

8843
06:23:44,878 --> 06:23:46,638
do what we can to provide as much value

8844
06:23:46,638 --> 06:23:48,478
to the client as possible but in saying

8845
06:23:48,478 --> 06:23:49,520
that

8846
06:23:49,520 --> 06:23:51,200
the way we do reports differs from

8847
06:23:51,200 --> 06:23:53,680
workplace to workplace and that's okay

8848
06:23:53,680 --> 06:23:55,120
but here's the things i've learned to

8849
06:23:55,120 --> 06:23:56,558
take into consideration when writing

8850
06:23:56,558 --> 06:23:57,760
report and these are all things that i

8851
06:23:57,760 --> 06:24:00,240
didn't know ahead of time

8852
06:24:00,240 --> 06:24:04,080
um so firstly when you write your report

8853
06:24:04,080 --> 06:24:07,280
reports now get broken up um my managing

8854
06:24:07,280 --> 06:24:08,638
director was talking about this the

8855
06:24:08,638 --> 06:24:10,400
other day um

8856
06:24:10,400 --> 06:24:12,160
reports are now more frequently getting

8857
06:24:12,160 --> 06:24:14,240
broken up into smaller sections and

8858
06:24:14,240 --> 06:24:16,240
distributed to more people

8859
06:24:16,240 --> 06:24:18,160
so the non-technical sections of your

8860
06:24:18,160 --> 06:24:21,520
report need to be non-technical

8861
06:24:21,520 --> 06:24:22,798
so

8862
06:24:22,798 --> 06:24:23,760
um

8863
06:24:23,760 --> 06:24:25,200
the person reading the report doesn't

8864
06:24:25,200 --> 06:24:26,478
necessarily know the difference between

8865
06:24:26,478 --> 06:24:28,240
a local user and domain administrator

8866
06:24:28,240 --> 06:24:29,920
privileges right they don't understand

8867
06:24:29,920 --> 06:24:32,400
the jargon so keep it simple

8868
06:24:32,400 --> 06:24:35,040
spend some time practicing

8869
06:24:35,040 --> 06:24:35,920
um

8870
06:24:35,920 --> 06:24:38,718
translating technical jargon into

8871
06:24:38,718 --> 06:24:41,040
plain english um

8872
06:24:41,040 --> 06:24:43,600
your clients will love you for it

8873
06:24:43,600 --> 06:24:46,160
uh and it will make life a lot easier

8874
06:24:46,160 --> 06:24:48,320
uh leave the technical jargon for attack

8875
06:24:48,320 --> 06:24:50,478
walkthroughs and vulnerability write-ups

8876
06:24:50,478 --> 06:24:52,638
um the second thing is and it's going

8877
06:24:52,638 --> 06:24:53,680
back

8878
06:24:53,680 --> 06:24:55,680
on a previous topic slightly

8879
06:24:55,680 --> 06:24:56,638
um

8880
06:24:56,638 --> 06:24:59,360
use a risk matrix where you can because

8881
06:24:59,360 --> 06:25:00,320
just

8882
06:25:00,320 --> 06:25:02,160
because of nessus scan says something is

8883
06:25:02,160 --> 06:25:04,160
critical doesn't mean it is

8884
06:25:04,160 --> 06:25:05,200
um

8885
06:25:05,200 --> 06:25:08,400
so using context to evaluate the

8886
06:25:08,400 --> 06:25:12,400
severity of a vulnerability and um

8887
06:25:12,400 --> 06:25:14,798
so taking into account the

8888
06:25:14,798 --> 06:25:17,760
likelihood of impact given the place

8889
06:25:17,760 --> 06:25:19,520
the placement of the device in the

8890
06:25:19,520 --> 06:25:21,040
network and also

8891
06:25:21,040 --> 06:25:22,400
um

8892
06:25:22,400 --> 06:25:23,600
the

8893
06:25:23,600 --> 06:25:24,798
amount of information that can be

8894
06:25:24,798 --> 06:25:26,558
extracted

8895
06:25:26,558 --> 06:25:28,160
and what kind of information could be

8896
06:25:28,160 --> 06:25:31,200
extracted can all impact the severity so

8897
06:25:31,200 --> 06:25:33,120
just because it's a critical volume on a

8898
06:25:33,120 --> 06:25:35,760
system it might be a system that is

8899
06:25:35,760 --> 06:25:37,680
decommissioned and has no information on

8900
06:25:37,680 --> 06:25:39,840
it and therefore it is not critical

8901
06:25:39,840 --> 06:25:41,120
anymore

8902
06:25:41,120 --> 06:25:43,040
um you'll find in your debrief session

8903
06:25:43,040 --> 06:25:46,000
that clients will question critical and

8904
06:25:46,000 --> 06:25:47,520
high risk vulnerabilities which is

8905
06:25:47,520 --> 06:25:49,360
perfectly understandable so if you want

8906
06:25:49,360 --> 06:25:50,958
something to be critical or high risk in

8907
06:25:50,958 --> 06:25:54,160
your report you have to justify it

8908
06:25:54,160 --> 06:25:56,638
which brings me to the next point

8909
06:25:56,638 --> 06:25:58,718
and this may be unique to our workplace

8910
06:25:58,718 --> 06:26:00,558
so feel free to to take what you will

8911
06:26:00,558 --> 06:26:03,440
from it uh but we firmly believe no one

8912
06:26:03,440 --> 06:26:05,440
wants to read 200 page reports of every

8913
06:26:05,440 --> 06:26:07,680
single thing you can find um

8914
06:26:07,680 --> 06:26:09,440
reports should be

8915
06:26:09,440 --> 06:26:11,440
actionable and concise

8916
06:26:11,440 --> 06:26:13,520
uh they outline the place of weakness

8917
06:26:13,520 --> 06:26:15,280
that a business can

8918
06:26:15,280 --> 06:26:17,600
uh can address in a reasonable period of

8919
06:26:17,600 --> 06:26:18,558
time

8920
06:26:18,558 --> 06:26:20,240
during our discussions with the client

8921
06:26:20,240 --> 06:26:22,240
um we determine the level of detail they

8922
06:26:22,240 --> 06:26:23,600
want us to go into

8923
06:26:23,600 --> 06:26:25,120
we also determine if they plan to get

8924
06:26:25,120 --> 06:26:26,878
tests regularly

8925
06:26:26,878 --> 06:26:28,558
we explain that we purposely don't

8926
06:26:28,558 --> 06:26:30,558
report on every little vong because

8927
06:26:30,558 --> 06:26:32,798
information overload often results in

8928
06:26:32,798 --> 06:26:34,718
nothing getting fixed

8929
06:26:34,718 --> 06:26:37,760
so instead we focus on the highest

8930
06:26:37,760 --> 06:26:39,760
impact vulnerabilities

8931
06:26:39,760 --> 06:26:41,600
to that business

8932
06:26:41,600 --> 06:26:43,760
um and anything that's got quick and

8933
06:26:43,760 --> 06:26:46,240
easy wins to fix up so instead of 200

8934
06:26:46,240 --> 06:26:48,320
page reports hours are about 50 to 70

8935
06:26:48,320 --> 06:26:50,000
that have more

8936
06:26:50,000 --> 06:26:52,000
useful information and the feedback from

8937
06:26:52,000 --> 06:26:54,400
clients has been phenomenal

8938
06:26:54,400 --> 06:26:55,280
um

8939
06:26:55,280 --> 06:26:57,040
so

8940
06:26:57,040 --> 06:27:00,080
the last little point on this is that

8941
06:27:00,080 --> 06:27:02,240
just remember that as a pen tester your

8942
06:27:02,240 --> 06:27:05,360
role in the business in the in this task

8943
06:27:05,360 --> 06:27:07,120
is not to name and shame people for

8944
06:27:07,120 --> 06:27:08,558
making core configurations and not

8945
06:27:08,558 --> 06:27:12,080
pouching security is super hard

8946
06:27:12,080 --> 06:27:14,798
so while we're there to be impartial and

8947
06:27:14,798 --> 06:27:16,798
provide feedback on the environment as

8948
06:27:16,798 --> 06:27:18,478
it stands at the time of testing

8949
06:27:18,478 --> 06:27:19,680
feedback should be delivered with

8950
06:27:19,680 --> 06:27:21,520
empathy

8951
06:27:21,520 --> 06:27:23,600
developers and cs admins get really

8952
06:27:23,600 --> 06:27:25,760
defensive and feel personally attacked

8953
06:27:25,760 --> 06:27:27,120
when a vulnerability is found in their

8954
06:27:27,120 --> 06:27:29,200
systems and i can tell you this

8955
06:27:29,200 --> 06:27:32,320
from being on both sides of the equation

8956
06:27:32,320 --> 06:27:33,120
um

8957
06:27:33,120 --> 06:27:35,360
so right when you're writing your report

8958
06:27:35,360 --> 06:27:37,360
and you're debriefing keep it in mind

8959
06:27:37,360 --> 06:27:39,680
and curb your languages to not lay the

8960
06:27:39,680 --> 06:27:42,160
blame on anyone security is hard and

8961
06:27:42,160 --> 06:27:43,680
it's especially hard for people where

8962
06:27:43,680 --> 06:27:46,320
it's not their main role

8963
06:27:46,320 --> 06:27:48,320
um

8964
06:27:48,320 --> 06:27:51,360
i've got one more slide for you um which

8965
06:27:51,360 --> 06:27:52,638
is

8966
06:27:52,638 --> 06:27:55,200
the things i wish i did before becoming

8967
06:27:55,200 --> 06:27:56,798
a pen tester so this is for the people

8968
06:27:56,798 --> 06:27:59,600
who are looking to get into the industry

8969
06:27:59,600 --> 06:28:02,638
um things that i

8970
06:28:02,638 --> 06:28:04,798
found um

8971
06:28:04,798 --> 06:28:06,478
would have helped me had i done them

8972
06:28:06,478 --> 06:28:07,520
earlier

8973
06:28:07,520 --> 06:28:09,680
uh so there's a thousand blog posts on

8974
06:28:09,680 --> 06:28:11,760
the internet uh describing how to be a

8975
06:28:11,760 --> 06:28:12,878
pen tester

8976
06:28:12,878 --> 06:28:15,040
uh they're all valid they're all helpful

8977
06:28:15,040 --> 06:28:17,040
uh in some way but none of them will

8978
06:28:17,040 --> 06:28:18,958
give you a bulletproof way to get it get

8979
06:28:18,958 --> 06:28:20,558
into the industry and that's probably

8980
06:28:20,558 --> 06:28:22,478
the same for every other

8981
06:28:22,478 --> 06:28:23,440
um

8982
06:28:23,440 --> 06:28:25,200
role you can think of

8983
06:28:25,200 --> 06:28:26,558
i'm not going to tell you how to be a

8984
06:28:26,558 --> 06:28:29,520
pen tester because it doesn't help you

8985
06:28:29,520 --> 06:28:30,798
that is something you need to work out

8986
06:28:30,798 --> 06:28:32,160
for yourself but there are some things

8987
06:28:32,160 --> 06:28:33,840
that i wish i did before i started

8988
06:28:33,840 --> 06:28:35,360
applying for jobs

8989
06:28:35,360 --> 06:28:37,120
um

8990
06:28:37,120 --> 06:28:38,240
so

8991
06:28:38,240 --> 06:28:40,160
one is cts now everybody every pen

8992
06:28:40,160 --> 06:28:42,240
tester does cts right

8993
06:28:42,240 --> 06:28:44,840
this is fly that's bugging me apologize

8994
06:28:44,840 --> 06:28:48,160
um every pentester or every hacker every

8995
06:28:48,160 --> 06:28:51,200
wannabe hacker does cts right

8996
06:28:51,200 --> 06:28:53,280
but what you can do

8997
06:28:53,280 --> 06:28:54,958
it's common recommendation that you do a

8998
06:28:54,958 --> 06:28:56,798
write-up so if you do your ctf do a

8999
06:28:56,798 --> 06:28:59,360
write-up and then put a link to that on

9000
06:28:59,360 --> 06:29:01,920
your resume which is a great idea

9001
06:29:01,920 --> 06:29:04,718
i would take it one step further

9002
06:29:04,718 --> 06:29:06,718
um when you're doing a ctf you take your

9003
06:29:06,718 --> 06:29:08,558
screenshots you do your write-up but

9004
06:29:08,558 --> 06:29:11,680
then also spend some time

9005
06:29:11,680 --> 06:29:14,958
researching the vulnerability itself and

9006
06:29:14,958 --> 06:29:17,120
write a full pen test report you don't

9007
06:29:17,120 --> 06:29:19,680
have to do one for every ctf you do

9008
06:29:19,680 --> 06:29:21,600
but if you can produce

9009
06:29:21,600 --> 06:29:24,958
three five real full pen test reports on

9010
06:29:24,958 --> 06:29:27,280
a cts that you've done

9011
06:29:27,280 --> 06:29:31,280
you'll you'll have uh

9012
06:29:31,280 --> 06:29:33,280
the ability to show your potential

9013
06:29:33,280 --> 06:29:35,360
employer not only that you know what

9014
06:29:35,360 --> 06:29:36,958
buttons to press

9015
06:29:36,958 --> 06:29:38,798
but also

9016
06:29:38,798 --> 06:29:40,958
how your technical writing comes out and

9017
06:29:40,958 --> 06:29:43,360
how you communicate with your clients

9018
06:29:43,360 --> 06:29:46,400
which is a huge huge benefit that

9019
06:29:46,400 --> 06:29:47,840
nobody's doing

9020
06:29:47,840 --> 06:29:50,958
right so take that put it in your pocket

9021
06:29:50,958 --> 06:29:52,958
spend some time to really

9022
06:29:52,958 --> 06:29:54,400
write a pen test report there's a

9023
06:29:54,400 --> 06:29:56,878
thousand

9024
06:29:57,120 --> 06:29:58,958
templates on the internet find one that

9025
06:29:58,958 --> 06:30:00,320
suits you

9026
06:30:00,320 --> 06:30:01,760
um

9027
06:30:01,760 --> 06:30:03,680
the second one that i've got

9028
06:30:03,680 --> 06:30:06,000
and i had a handicap because i i started

9029
06:30:06,000 --> 06:30:07,680
looking for a job while covert was

9030
06:30:07,680 --> 06:30:08,958
around

9031
06:30:08,958 --> 06:30:11,680
but it is to use things like comfy con

9032
06:30:11,680 --> 06:30:14,558
to use things like uh the the other cons

9033
06:30:14,558 --> 06:30:17,920
that are around use discord use slack uh

9034
06:30:17,920 --> 06:30:21,200
and get involved in the communities um

9035
06:30:21,200 --> 06:30:23,920
i miss this as a very important lesson

9036
06:30:23,920 --> 06:30:26,638
early on but the community is huge as i

9037
06:30:26,638 --> 06:30:29,040
talked about earlier it's a very

9038
06:30:29,040 --> 06:30:31,520
heavily reputation based industry and

9039
06:30:31,520 --> 06:30:33,840
there's a lot of jobs that don't get on

9040
06:30:33,840 --> 06:30:35,680
to seek and indeed and all that sort of

9041
06:30:35,680 --> 06:30:38,080
stuff because they get handed out within

9042
06:30:38,080 --> 06:30:40,000
slack and discord groups and stuff like

9043
06:30:40,000 --> 06:30:41,520
that so

9044
06:30:41,520 --> 06:30:43,280
if you're serious about getting into

9045
06:30:43,280 --> 06:30:46,958
infosec go get involved in the community

9046
06:30:46,958 --> 06:30:48,478
you'll find there's a lot more

9047
06:30:48,478 --> 06:30:50,638
opportunities there and then spend some

9048
06:30:50,638 --> 06:30:51,520
time

9049
06:30:51,520 --> 06:30:53,440
helping people and show that you you're

9050
06:30:53,440 --> 06:30:55,920
comfortable at what you do

9051
06:30:55,920 --> 06:30:57,520
um

9052
06:30:57,520 --> 06:31:00,160
advertising on linkedin and your cv

9053
06:31:00,160 --> 06:31:01,440
that you develop and practice your

9054
06:31:01,440 --> 06:31:03,520
skills on training platforms is good

9055
06:31:03,520 --> 06:31:06,320
probably don't put the top

9056
06:31:06,320 --> 06:31:08,160
because just about everyone who's even

9057
06:31:08,160 --> 06:31:10,080
slightly serious at try hat me isn't the

9058
06:31:10,080 --> 06:31:11,360
top 1

9059
06:31:11,360 --> 06:31:12,718
um but

9060
06:31:12,718 --> 06:31:15,120
in your linkedin bio put the things that

9061
06:31:15,120 --> 06:31:17,680
you liked doing i like active directory

9062
06:31:17,680 --> 06:31:20,478
testing or i liked web app testing or

9063
06:31:20,478 --> 06:31:22,558
really enjoyed this particular box and

9064
06:31:22,558 --> 06:31:24,400
here's a write-up i did on it

9065
06:31:24,400 --> 06:31:27,360
but be specific um

9066
06:31:27,360 --> 06:31:29,040
practicing more

9067
06:31:29,040 --> 06:31:31,120
of your web applications as well as i

9068
06:31:31,120 --> 06:31:32,878
said the majority of the testing that i

9069
06:31:32,878 --> 06:31:36,638
do nowadays is external and web apps um

9070
06:31:36,638 --> 06:31:39,040
so get used to them uh practice them

9071
06:31:39,040 --> 06:31:39,840
more

9072
06:31:39,840 --> 06:31:41,120
uh though

9073
06:31:41,120 --> 06:31:43,680
getting root on just about everything

9074
06:31:43,680 --> 06:31:46,558
bri running kernel exploits is fun um

9075
06:31:46,558 --> 06:31:47,760
you're gonna spend the majority of your

9076
06:31:47,760 --> 06:31:49,600
time with pentester doing things like

9077
06:31:49,600 --> 06:31:52,080
web apps and such so have a look at

9078
06:31:52,080 --> 06:31:54,240
port zwigger's web security academy look

9079
06:31:54,240 --> 06:31:57,360
at oh wasp juice juice shop look at damn

9080
06:31:57,360 --> 06:32:00,558
vulnerable web apps and practice learn i

9081
06:32:00,558 --> 06:32:02,400
i'm learning them late because i didn't

9082
06:32:02,400 --> 06:32:03,840
realize this late

9083
06:32:03,840 --> 06:32:06,478
until later and it's uh

9084
06:32:06,478 --> 06:32:07,920
it's making things a little bit more

9085
06:32:07,920 --> 06:32:09,040
difficult

9086
06:32:09,040 --> 06:32:10,478
um

9087
06:32:10,478 --> 06:32:12,160
and the very last thing that i've got

9088
06:32:12,160 --> 06:32:14,400
for you is certifications

9089
06:32:14,400 --> 06:32:16,718
um there's a squarion of them there's

9090
06:32:16,718 --> 06:32:18,160
some really well known ones there are

9091
06:32:18,160 --> 06:32:19,920
some less known ones

9092
06:32:19,920 --> 06:32:21,520
um

9093
06:32:21,520 --> 06:32:23,120
none of them will get you a job none of

9094
06:32:23,120 --> 06:32:25,040
them will guarantee you a job but they

9095
06:32:25,040 --> 06:32:27,600
do show commitment has been taken

9096
06:32:27,600 --> 06:32:29,680
or commitment and effort has been taken

9097
06:32:29,680 --> 06:32:31,520
and certainly some are looked at more

9098
06:32:31,520 --> 06:32:33,760
favorably than others but do the ones

9099
06:32:33,760 --> 06:32:35,760
that are right for you

9100
06:32:35,760 --> 06:32:38,798
um a quick recommendation on on my part

9101
06:32:38,798 --> 06:32:41,440
um i recommend that if you're looking to

9102
06:32:41,440 --> 06:32:43,360
get into the industry and you're looking

9103
06:32:43,360 --> 06:32:45,680
to learn some real uh practical skills

9104
06:32:45,680 --> 06:32:48,478
look at tcm's um

9105
06:32:48,478 --> 06:32:51,680
uh sorry yeah tcm securities pnpt

9106
06:32:51,680 --> 06:32:54,320
uh it is a really good exam and and of

9107
06:32:54,320 --> 06:32:58,000
course it's i've done pnpt and oscp and

9108
06:32:58,000 --> 06:33:00,478
i can highly recommend pmpt as an exam

9109
06:33:00,478 --> 06:33:02,558
worth having a look at uh take that as

9110
06:33:02,558 --> 06:33:04,718
you will but it's certainly worth it

9111
06:33:04,718 --> 06:33:05,840
um

9112
06:33:05,840 --> 06:33:07,680
and i'll be putting up a blog post in

9113
06:33:07,680 --> 06:33:09,920
the next week or two uh hopefully that

9114
06:33:09,920 --> 06:33:11,440
will go through

9115
06:33:11,440 --> 06:33:13,520
all of that in more detail i want to

9116
06:33:13,520 --> 06:33:16,320
spend some time actually uh

9117
06:33:16,320 --> 06:33:18,320
talking about what skills and

9118
06:33:18,320 --> 06:33:20,478
certifications i've actually

9119
06:33:20,478 --> 06:33:22,718
done that are worth doing

9120
06:33:22,718 --> 06:33:24,718
so when as soon as i get that i'll put

9121
06:33:24,718 --> 06:33:26,478
it up in the discord

9122
06:33:26,478 --> 06:33:27,520
but

9123
06:33:27,520 --> 06:33:30,160
other than that

9124
06:33:30,160 --> 06:33:33,520
that's all i have for you so i hope you

9125
06:33:33,520 --> 06:33:34,798
learned something from that and i hope

9126
06:33:34,798 --> 06:33:37,120
that it gave you all some hope if you're

9127
06:33:37,120 --> 06:33:38,798
trying to get into the industry it's

9128
06:33:38,798 --> 06:33:39,680
hard

9129
06:33:39,680 --> 06:33:43,440
to get in um but you can do it

9130
06:33:43,440 --> 06:33:45,360
and people get in your way just ignore

9131
06:33:45,360 --> 06:33:47,120
them and steamroll over them and do it

9132

yeah

9147
06:34:22,958 --> 06:34:24,798
but the thing was nobody noticed until

9148
06:34:24,798 --> 06:34:27,200
the last few minutes yep that was the

9149
06:34:27,200 --> 06:34:30,080
thing we noticed but like the audience

9150
06:34:30,080 --> 06:34:31,680
were like this is awesome this is great

9151
06:34:31,680 --> 06:34:33,120
and like then somebody said wait a

9152
06:34:33,120 --> 06:34:36,718

9155
06:34:40,080 --> 06:34:42,080
really interesting um i know shannon's

9156
06:34:42,080 --> 06:34:43,280
got a couple of questions but if i'm

9157
06:34:43,280 --> 06:34:45,440
gonna be cheeky i'm gonna ask one first

9158
06:34:45,440 --> 06:34:46,478
how do you

9159
06:34:46,478 --> 06:34:48,878
mentally deal with the whole

9160
06:34:48,878 --> 06:34:51,040
going from being a senior to a junior

9161
06:34:51,040 --> 06:34:53,920
again so i know a lot of people are like

9162
06:34:53,920 --> 06:34:56,400
trying to get into cyber but they also

9163
06:34:56,400 --> 06:34:58,160
there's some people who understand that

9164
06:34:58,160 --> 06:34:59,920
you can't just move into a senior cyber

9165
06:34:59,920 --> 06:35:01,440
role straight away there are some people

9166
06:35:01,440 --> 06:35:02,798
who

9167
06:35:02,798 --> 06:35:05,360
are okay with gomets being a junior role

9168
06:35:05,360 --> 06:35:06,798
but how do you go

9169
06:35:06,798 --> 06:35:08,558
how did you go through that experience i

9170
06:35:08,558 --> 06:35:10,400
guess

9171
06:35:10,400 --> 06:35:11,680
i

9172
06:35:11,680 --> 06:35:14,080
made the decision

9173
06:35:14,080 --> 06:35:16,000
based on

9174
06:35:16,000 --> 06:35:18,478
whether or not i was going to enjoy what

9175
06:35:18,478 --> 06:35:20,080
i was going to be doing

9176
06:35:20,080 --> 06:35:20,878
so

9177
06:35:20,878 --> 06:35:24,558
i decided that cis admins and

9178
06:35:24,558 --> 06:35:26,240
what i was doing as a as a network

9179
06:35:26,240 --> 06:35:27,280
engineer

9180
06:35:27,280 --> 06:35:28,878
or even at this point i was i was

9181
06:35:28,878 --> 06:35:30,840
leading the team

9182
06:35:30,840 --> 06:35:34,320
um the amount of

9183
06:35:34,320 --> 06:35:36,080
stress it was putting on me the amount

9184
06:35:36,080 --> 06:35:37,920
of like mental health issues i had to

9185
06:35:37,920 --> 06:35:41,440
deal with while i was i was in there um

9186
06:35:41,440 --> 06:35:42,320
was

9187
06:35:42,320 --> 06:35:43,920
kicking my ass

9188
06:35:43,920 --> 06:35:44,958
um

9189
06:35:44,958 --> 06:35:48,638
and i decided that i wanted to go and

9190
06:35:48,638 --> 06:35:50,160
um

9191
06:35:50,160 --> 06:35:52,478
and and do something different knowing

9192
06:35:52,478 --> 06:35:54,320
full well that

9193
06:35:54,320 --> 06:35:55,520
uh

9194
06:35:55,520 --> 06:35:57,920
that's gonna take a pay cut but a lot of

9195
06:35:57,920 --> 06:36:00,080
people have taken pay cuts and such by

9196
06:36:00,080 --> 06:36:00,958
by

9197
06:36:00,958 --> 06:36:02,958
changing to a job that's less stressful

9198
06:36:02,958 --> 06:36:04,718
and that's fine but i wanted to do

9199
06:36:04,718 --> 06:36:05,920
something where i would get some real

9200
06:36:05,920 --> 06:36:07,600
fulfillment out of it where i'll be

9201
06:36:07,600 --> 06:36:10,320
learning every day i found as a sysadmin

9202
06:36:10,320 --> 06:36:13,120
that i had topped out what i could do in

9203
06:36:13,120 --> 06:36:15,200
that particular workplace i wasn't

9204
06:36:15,200 --> 06:36:16,638
learning anymore

9205
06:36:16,638 --> 06:36:17,520
um

9206
06:36:17,520 --> 06:36:18,878
and i was

9207
06:36:18,878 --> 06:36:21,360
bored frankly

9208
06:36:21,360 --> 06:36:23,440
i'd rather be paid less and interested

9209
06:36:23,440 --> 06:36:25,440
than

9210
06:36:25,440 --> 06:36:28,400
doing a job that's boring

9211
06:36:28,400 --> 06:36:30,878
yeah that totally makes sense um

9212
06:36:30,878 --> 06:36:32,320
i would rather have an interesting

9213
06:36:32,320 --> 06:36:33,840
problem to solve and get some money for

9214
06:36:33,840 --> 06:36:35,120
something that's not that interesting

9215
06:36:35,120 --> 06:36:36,718
i'm the same

9216
06:36:36,718 --> 06:36:38,320
yeah um shannon do you want to ask one

9217
06:36:38,320 --> 06:36:40,840

what that was do you think that report

9235
06:37:17,360 --> 06:37:19,440
yeah writing reports and has given you a

9236
06:37:19,440 --> 06:37:21,600
leg up when it comes to report rating

9237
06:37:21,600 --> 06:37:23,920
and the second question is

9238
06:37:23,920 --> 06:37:25,680
you mentioned a little bit but what ctfs

9239
06:37:25,680 --> 06:37:27,120

i

9244
06:37:35,120 --> 06:37:36,558
came from a role that had very little

9245
06:37:36,558 --> 06:37:38,718
reporting actually involved so it was

9246
06:37:38,718 --> 06:37:40,080
pretty much

9247
06:37:40,080 --> 06:37:41,520
sell a project

9248
06:37:41,520 --> 06:37:42,798
through the project

9249
06:37:42,798 --> 06:37:44,638
walk away from the project and if it was

9250
06:37:44,638 --> 06:37:47,120
in fire cool guys don't look at flank

9251
06:37:47,120 --> 06:37:48,638
right um

9252
06:37:48,638 --> 06:37:49,760
so

9253
06:37:49,760 --> 06:37:51,840
there was not a lot going on there in

9254
06:37:51,840 --> 06:37:54,478
terms of report writing so coming into a

9255
06:37:54,478 --> 06:37:56,638
cis into a role where i had to write a

9256
06:37:56,638 --> 06:37:58,000
lot of reports

9257
06:37:58,000 --> 06:38:00,320
and read a lot of reports um

9258
06:38:00,320 --> 06:38:03,200
it was good to have a system that made

9259
06:38:03,200 --> 06:38:04,080
sense

9260
06:38:04,080 --> 06:38:07,280
um i did have to learn on the fly um

9261
06:38:07,280 --> 06:38:08,718
which is not particularly hard but i had

9262
06:38:08,718 --> 06:38:10,718
to learn how to write in markdown and

9263
06:38:10,718 --> 06:38:12,160
then how to

9264
06:38:12,160 --> 06:38:13,280
um

9265
06:38:13,280 --> 06:38:16,080
you know manipulate some some of the

9266
06:38:16,080 --> 06:38:18,000
variables and such that report ranger

9267
06:38:18,000 --> 06:38:19,360
uses but

9268
06:38:19,360 --> 06:38:21,120
it's a really good tool

9269
06:38:21,120 --> 06:38:23,280
and it did make the process really easy

9270
06:38:23,280 --> 06:38:24,638
um

9271
06:38:24,638 --> 06:38:26,558
and i had the benefit of the guy who

9272
06:38:26,558 --> 06:38:28,878
wrote it being one of my bosses so when

9273
06:38:28,878 --> 06:38:32,958
there's a problem hey matt fix

9274
06:38:32,958 --> 06:38:35,840
which was which was handy um

9275
06:38:35,840 --> 06:38:37,280
learning markdown

9276
06:38:37,280 --> 06:38:40,000
as opposed to learning reporting is a

9277
06:38:40,000 --> 06:38:42,000
very nice trade-off

9278
06:38:42,000 --> 06:38:44,240
yeah so all i

9279
06:38:44,240 --> 06:38:47,680
i had to learn uh very quickly how to do

9280
06:38:47,680 --> 06:38:48,718
things

9281
06:38:48,718 --> 06:38:50,798
um so like like the courses that i did

9282
06:38:50,798 --> 06:38:52,638
beforehand beforehand they would go

9283
06:38:52,638 --> 06:38:53,600
through oh you have to write a

9284
06:38:53,600 --> 06:38:55,680
vulnerability write up you have to do an

9285
06:38:55,680 --> 06:38:57,600
executive summary after a conclusion you

9286
06:38:57,600 --> 06:38:59,680
have to do a report uh like a main

9287
06:38:59,680 --> 06:39:01,440
report body and all these bits and

9288
06:39:01,440 --> 06:39:02,400
pieces but

9289
06:39:02,400 --> 06:39:03,200
um

9290
06:39:03,200 --> 06:39:04,878
the way that report ranger was put

9291
06:39:04,878 --> 06:39:07,840
together um it's all sectioned out and

9292
06:39:07,840 --> 06:39:11,680
then the the application um pulls it all

9293
06:39:11,680 --> 06:39:14,160
and puts it together in a pdf for you

9294
06:39:14,160 --> 06:39:16,400
so i could keep track of what i needed

9295
06:39:16,400 --> 06:39:19,680
to do in a drag and drop kind of manner

9296
06:39:19,680 --> 06:39:21,360
uh without using

9297
06:39:21,360 --> 06:39:23,360
um

9298
06:39:23,360 --> 06:39:26,080
a weird gui or anything like that so

9299
06:39:26,080 --> 06:39:29,360
uh one of our our team members he's a

9300
06:39:29,360 --> 06:39:32,080
vim freak and writes everything in

9301
06:39:32,080 --> 06:39:35,440
vietnamese it's just insanely fast um

9302
06:39:35,440 --> 06:39:38,478
and you can because you it's markdown so

9303
06:39:38,478 --> 06:39:40,240
you can do whatever you want

9304
06:39:40,240 --> 06:39:42,958
i i use uh virtual studio code

9305
06:39:42,958 --> 06:39:44,400
personally

9306
06:39:44,400 --> 06:39:46,638
yeah me too with fun

9307
06:39:46,638 --> 06:39:49,120
and markdown preview

9308
06:39:49,120 --> 06:39:51,120
anyway we probably do have to end it at

9309
06:39:51,120 --> 06:39:54,400
that don't worry we um actually sorry

9310

carabeta and yes i am a former high

9398
06:42:54,558 --> 06:42:56,080
school teacher and i guess that's where

9399
06:42:56,080 --> 06:42:59,040
today's journey starts um so i became a

9400
06:42:59,040 --> 06:43:01,760
teacher in around like 2006 and i taught

9401
06:43:01,760 --> 06:43:04,000
media studies in english for about 12

9402
06:43:04,000 --> 06:43:04,878
years

9403
06:43:04,878 --> 06:43:07,280
um most notably my last major role

9404
06:43:07,280 --> 06:43:09,200
teaching was over in dubai teaching at

9405
06:43:09,200 --> 06:43:11,600
international school and it was actually

9406
06:43:11,600 --> 06:43:12,718
over there

9407
06:43:12,718 --> 06:43:14,558
that i started

9408
06:43:14,558 --> 06:43:17,200
looking into the world of cyber a bit i

9409
06:43:17,200 --> 06:43:19,520
saw firsthand what was going on in terms

9410
06:43:19,520 --> 06:43:21,760
of cyber attacks and and the human

9411
06:43:21,760 --> 06:43:24,558
aspect the human side of it now um just

9412
06:43:24,558 --> 06:43:26,320
a bit of background about myself outside

9413
06:43:26,320 --> 06:43:28,478
of teaching i haven't got a technical

9414
06:43:28,478 --> 06:43:30,400
background at all

9415
06:43:30,400 --> 06:43:32,558
my my degree goes back to public

9416
06:43:32,558 --> 06:43:34,798
relations communications and i've got a

9417
06:43:34,798 --> 06:43:37,200
diploma in education and i'm very much a

9418
06:43:37,200 --> 06:43:38,638
humanities guy

9419
06:43:38,638 --> 06:43:40,160
but

9420
06:43:40,160 --> 06:43:42,000
what really interested me in cyber

9421
06:43:42,000 --> 06:43:45,440
security was the psychology about it and

9422
06:43:45,440 --> 06:43:46,958
how people were actually falling for

9423
06:43:46,958 --> 06:43:48,478
attacks it was a social engineering side

9424
06:43:48,478 --> 06:43:50,718
of it that really got me kind of looking

9425
06:43:50,718 --> 06:43:52,638
into it as an industry

9426
06:43:52,638 --> 06:43:53,600
um

9427
06:43:53,600 --> 06:43:54,878
when it was until i came back to

9428
06:43:54,878 --> 06:43:57,120
australia that uh someone who is a very

9429
06:43:57,120 --> 06:43:59,360
strong mentor in my life actually spoke

9430
06:43:59,360 --> 06:44:01,200
to me about the possibility of getting

9431
06:44:01,200 --> 06:44:03,040
into cyber security my first thought to

9432
06:44:03,040 --> 06:44:04,320
that was

9433
06:44:04,320 --> 06:44:05,840
what the why why would i want to

9434
06:44:05,840 --> 06:44:07,360
get into cyber security i've got no

9435
06:44:07,360 --> 06:44:08,798
technical knowledge whatsoever i don't

9436
06:44:08,798 --> 06:44:11,120
understand any programming languages

9437
06:44:11,120 --> 06:44:12,400
and there was

9438
06:44:12,400 --> 06:44:14,160
right there was the first misconception

9439
06:44:14,160 --> 06:44:15,680
that i talked to a lot of people about

9440
06:44:15,680 --> 06:44:19,280
today is that you don't necessarily need

9441
06:44:19,280 --> 06:44:22,400
that technical uh knowledge that strong

9442
06:44:22,400 --> 06:44:24,080
technical knowledge to get into cyber

9443
06:44:24,080 --> 06:44:26,400
security we have a lot of roles in cyber

9444
06:44:26,400 --> 06:44:27,440
that are

9445
06:44:27,440 --> 06:44:29,680
non-technical yes we have a lot of

9446
06:44:29,680 --> 06:44:32,000
talented people working in a various

9447
06:44:32,000 --> 06:44:34,638
range of highly technical specialized

9448
06:44:34,638 --> 06:44:35,600
roles

9449
06:44:35,600 --> 06:44:36,478
but

9450
06:44:36,478 --> 06:44:37,920
these days when you talk about cyber

9451
06:44:37,920 --> 06:44:39,760
security it's really important to note

9452
06:44:39,760 --> 06:44:42,320
that there are kind of two sides to it

9453
06:44:42,320 --> 06:44:44,558
and the reason being is that cyber

9454
06:44:44,558 --> 06:44:46,080
security as we all know we've spoken

9455
06:44:46,080 --> 06:44:48,240
about it for it's a human problem

9456
06:44:48,240 --> 06:44:50,718
you've got humans on one end who are

9457
06:44:50,718 --> 06:44:53,440
orchestrating the attacks and

9458
06:44:53,440 --> 06:44:54,718
are taking advantage of the

9459
06:44:54,718 --> 06:44:56,718
vulnerabilities and you've got humans on

9460
06:44:56,718 --> 06:44:59,280
the other side who are defending

9461
06:44:59,280 --> 06:45:01,200
against these vulnerabilities who are

9462
06:45:01,200 --> 06:45:02,958
defending against these attacks who are

9463
06:45:02,958 --> 06:45:04,878
trying their hardest to prevent them as

9464
06:45:04,878 --> 06:45:06,878
well so

9465
06:45:06,878 --> 06:45:08,478
when i was spoken to about the

9466
06:45:08,478 --> 06:45:11,360
possibility of getting cyber security

9467
06:45:11,360 --> 06:45:14,638
what really tickled my fancy was looking

9468
06:45:14,638 --> 06:45:17,600
into cyber security awareness training

9469
06:45:17,600 --> 06:45:19,520
as an educator at the time

9470
06:45:19,520 --> 06:45:22,478
i was really really keen on looking into

9471
06:45:22,478 --> 06:45:25,040
how i could then take those skills as

9472
06:45:25,040 --> 06:45:27,120
being a high school teacher and actually

9473
06:45:27,120 --> 06:45:29,600
educate other adults

9474
06:45:29,600 --> 06:45:32,240
about cyber security in their workplace

9475
06:45:32,240 --> 06:45:34,240
and what really started to intrigue me

9476
06:45:34,240 --> 06:45:36,638
was help people within my circles will

9477
06:45:36,638 --> 06:45:38,638
start to talk about the

9478
06:45:38,638 --> 06:45:40,878
the parallels between the occupational

9479
06:45:40,878 --> 06:45:44,160
health and safety culture at workplaces

9480
06:45:44,160 --> 06:45:46,558
and cyber security and that's something

9481
06:45:46,558 --> 06:45:48,558
i've really banged on hard about for the

9482
06:45:48,558 --> 06:45:50,320
last three years and i've only been in

9483
06:45:50,320 --> 06:45:53,280
cyber for three years now my first role

9484
06:45:53,280 --> 06:45:55,680
was at water corporation wa doing the

9485
06:45:55,680 --> 06:45:57,920
cyber security awareness training

9486
06:45:57,920 --> 06:45:59,440
i've worked at the wa os cyber

9487
06:45:59,440 --> 06:46:01,440
innovation hub in terms of trying to

9488
06:46:01,440 --> 06:46:02,478
help grow

9489
06:46:02,478 --> 06:46:04,400
the industry and now i'm working with

9490
06:46:04,400 --> 06:46:06,558
the wa state government

9491
06:46:06,558 --> 06:46:09,680
as a project manager in cyber security

9492
06:46:09,680 --> 06:46:10,718
and

9493
06:46:10,718 --> 06:46:12,958
while it is really really important to

9494
06:46:12,958 --> 06:46:15,440
have a if you're in the non-technical

9495
06:46:15,440 --> 06:46:17,600
side anyway it's important to have

9496
06:46:17,600 --> 06:46:19,360
some kind of technical knowledge or

9497
06:46:19,360 --> 06:46:22,080
understanding of how cyber security

9498
06:46:22,080 --> 06:46:24,320
actually works

9499
06:46:24,320 --> 06:46:25,840
it's also really important if you're in

9500
06:46:25,840 --> 06:46:28,718
the non-technical side as well to ask

9501
06:46:28,718 --> 06:46:30,878
questions and this is where we come to

9502
06:46:30,878 --> 06:46:33,680
today's topic it's a give and take

9503
06:46:33,680 --> 06:46:35,040
relationship

9504
06:46:35,040 --> 06:46:37,200
when it comes to newcomers into the

9505
06:46:37,200 --> 06:46:39,360
cyber security industry now i'm holding

9506
06:46:39,360 --> 06:46:41,200
a coffee right now and it's not just

9507
06:46:41,200 --> 06:46:43,440
because i love my espresso at what is 4

9508
06:46:43,440 --> 06:46:45,600
45 in the afternoon over here on per in

9509
06:46:45,600 --> 06:46:47,920
perth but it's also because

9510
06:46:47,920 --> 06:46:49,600
this was

9511
06:46:49,600 --> 06:46:51,680
when i started my first job this was my

9512
06:46:51,680 --> 06:46:52,798
shield

9513
06:46:52,798 --> 06:46:54,798
this was my guard

9514
06:46:54,798 --> 06:46:57,360
when i would walk into meetings with my

9515
06:46:57,360 --> 06:46:59,680
team who are all highly specialized

9516
06:46:59,680 --> 06:47:01,280
technically focused cyber security

9517
06:47:01,280 --> 06:47:02,558
professionals

9518
06:47:02,558 --> 06:47:04,160
when the question came to me i would

9519
06:47:04,160 --> 06:47:06,558
make sure that coffee cup was in my hand

9520
06:47:06,558 --> 06:47:07,280
and

9521
06:47:07,280 --> 06:47:12,280
on my lips because it gave me

9522
06:47:12,878 --> 06:47:15,440
those few seconds extra to actually

9523
06:47:15,440 --> 06:47:17,360
formulate a response

9524
06:47:17,360 --> 06:47:20,478
because i was nervous as walking

9525
06:47:20,478 --> 06:47:21,920
into those meetings

9526
06:47:21,920 --> 06:47:23,520
and thinking

9527
06:47:23,520 --> 06:47:25,360
okay i have no idea what these people

9528
06:47:25,360 --> 06:47:27,120
are talking about sometimes

9529
06:47:27,120 --> 06:47:28,558
and that's when it started occurring to

9530
06:47:28,558 --> 06:47:30,320
me that maybe i should actually do some

9531
06:47:30,320 --> 06:47:33,280
 research and actually start

9532
06:47:33,280 --> 06:47:35,120
looking more into

9533
06:47:35,120 --> 06:47:36,878
what we're actually you know what we're

9534
06:47:36,878 --> 06:47:39,920
actually talking about and this is where

9535
06:47:39,920 --> 06:47:42,400
this the the main kind of

9536
06:47:42,400 --> 06:47:44,320
theme of today's talk if you want to

9537
06:47:44,320 --> 06:47:46,958
call that comes into play and that's

9538
06:47:46,958 --> 06:47:50,320
when we start talking about acronyms

9539
06:47:50,320 --> 06:47:52,878
in cyber security yes acronyms exist in

9540
06:47:52,878 --> 06:47:54,798
every industry they're all around us i

9541
06:47:54,798 --> 06:47:56,240
work in state government they

9542
06:47:56,240 --> 06:47:58,478
love a good acronym over there i worked

9543
06:47:58,478 --> 06:48:00,000
in education teachers love a good

9544
06:48:00,000 --> 06:48:01,200
acronym

9545
06:48:01,200 --> 06:48:03,680
but i've never experienced acronym

9546
06:48:03,680 --> 06:48:05,120
fatigue

9547
06:48:05,120 --> 06:48:06,958
like in cyber security

9548
06:48:06,958 --> 06:48:08,638
they are handing them out they are

9549
06:48:08,638 --> 06:48:11,200
throwing them out like candy at a fifth

9550
06:48:11,200 --> 06:48:13,920
 birthday party and it is crazy

9551
06:48:13,920 --> 06:48:15,760
when you've got non-technical people in

9552
06:48:15,760 --> 06:48:17,600
a meeting or in an audience

9553
06:48:17,600 --> 06:48:18,478
who

9554
06:48:18,478 --> 06:48:20,000
don't understand

9555
06:48:20,000 --> 06:48:21,920
the basic concepts of cyber security let

9556
06:48:21,920 --> 06:48:24,320
alone what all these acronyms actually

9557
06:48:24,320 --> 06:48:26,718
mean when i first heard the term sock

9558
06:48:26,718 --> 06:48:28,478
and forgive my ignorance a lot of people

9559
06:48:28,478 --> 06:48:30,320
laugh at me when i tell the story when i

9560
06:48:30,320 --> 06:48:31,920
first heard the word sock i looked down

9561
06:48:31,920 --> 06:48:33,280
at my feet

9562
06:48:33,280 --> 06:48:35,120
i'm like what are you talking about i've

9563
06:48:35,120 --> 06:48:36,718
got two of them

9564
06:48:36,718 --> 06:48:37,840
but

9565
06:48:37,840 --> 06:48:40,240
it was really really just surprising to

9566
06:48:40,240 --> 06:48:43,040
me how someone as myself and other

9567
06:48:43,040 --> 06:48:45,840
people in a meeting or in an audience

9568
06:48:45,840 --> 06:48:47,600
were being spoken to and have all these

9569
06:48:47,600 --> 06:48:49,200
acronyms and these terminologies and

9570
06:48:49,200 --> 06:48:51,760
this jargon thrown at us

9571
06:48:51,760 --> 06:48:53,280
when we didn't actually understand it

9572
06:48:53,280 --> 06:48:56,400
all now there's no one person that is an

9573
06:48:56,400 --> 06:48:58,478
expert on everything cyber that person

9574
06:48:58,478 --> 06:49:00,958
doesn't exist okay i'm just going to say

9575
06:49:00,958 --> 06:49:02,240
that right now

9576
06:49:02,240 --> 06:49:03,840
but

9577
06:49:03,840 --> 06:49:06,718
if i'm being very very honest here even

9578
06:49:06,718 --> 06:49:08,400
the most technically a dead person if

9579
06:49:08,400 --> 06:49:10,638
they were to have every acronym cyber

9580
06:49:10,638 --> 06:49:12,000
thrown at them under the sun they

9581
06:49:12,000 --> 06:49:14,718
probably would miss out on a few of them

9582
06:49:14,718 --> 06:49:16,080
now

9583
06:49:16,080 --> 06:49:17,360
here's where

9584
06:49:17,360 --> 06:49:19,680
the responsibility lies with the

9585
06:49:19,680 --> 06:49:22,878
technical experts in the industry

9586
06:49:22,878 --> 06:49:25,120
they really need

9587
06:49:25,120 --> 06:49:27,840
to start becoming more aware

9588
06:49:27,840 --> 06:49:30,160
of the audiences they are speaking to so

9589
06:49:30,160 --> 06:49:33,120
if they're in a team meeting and they

9590
06:49:33,120 --> 06:49:35,200
are in a meeting with another department

9591
06:49:35,200 --> 06:49:37,280
where people are not as technically

9592
06:49:37,280 --> 06:49:38,958
adept or coming from a completely

9593
06:49:38,958 --> 06:49:41,280
different set of skills who have no

9594
06:49:41,280 --> 06:49:42,798
technical sound knowledge in cyber

9595
06:49:42,798 --> 06:49:45,360
security or i.t for that matter

9596
06:49:45,360 --> 06:49:48,320
then they really should take into mind

9597
06:49:48,320 --> 06:49:50,000
the acronyms that they're using the

9598
06:49:50,000 --> 06:49:51,840
language that they're using and be able

9599
06:49:51,840 --> 06:49:53,680
to think how can i translate this or how

9600
06:49:53,680 --> 06:49:55,040
can i actually

9601
06:49:55,040 --> 06:49:57,600
think to myself don't just say the

9602
06:49:57,600 --> 06:50:01,920
letters actually spell out what it means

9603
06:50:01,920 --> 06:50:04,558
for that audience it's okay if it's a

9604
06:50:04,558 --> 06:50:06,958
highly technical team all in closed

9605
06:50:06,958 --> 06:50:07,920
doors

9606
06:50:07,920 --> 06:50:10,320
throwing the acronyms at each other

9607
06:50:10,320 --> 06:50:12,638
that's totally fine and i'm not saying

9608
06:50:12,638 --> 06:50:15,120
here to people in the industry stop

9609
06:50:15,120 --> 06:50:17,600
using acronyms absolutely no way if they

9610
06:50:17,600 --> 06:50:19,280
save me 0.5 of a second in a

9611
06:50:19,280 --> 06:50:20,878
conversation that's great

9612
06:50:20,878 --> 06:50:23,360
but what i am saying is be mindful of

9613
06:50:23,360 --> 06:50:25,760
the audience that you are speaking to

9614
06:50:25,760 --> 06:50:28,478
i've been at conferences that weren't

9615
06:50:28,478 --> 06:50:29,360
so

9616
06:50:29,360 --> 06:50:34,000
heavily heavily technically um i guess

9617
06:50:34,000 --> 06:50:35,600
they weren't for much of a technical

9618
06:50:35,600 --> 06:50:37,280
audience they were probably for a very

9619
06:50:37,280 --> 06:50:39,680
broad general audience so you have your

9620
06:50:39,680 --> 06:50:41,840
non-technical you have your technical

9621
06:50:41,840 --> 06:50:43,120
and then you got people from outside

9622
06:50:43,120 --> 06:50:45,200
cyber and i left some of those

9623
06:50:45,200 --> 06:50:47,920
presentations over the years thinking i

9624
06:50:47,920 --> 06:50:49,280
didn't really understand a lot of that

9625
06:50:49,280 --> 06:50:50,718
because there was a lot of jargon thrown

9626
06:50:50,718 --> 06:50:52,000
in there

9627
06:50:52,000 --> 06:50:53,520
i've been in meetings where the jargon

9628
06:50:53,520 --> 06:50:55,680
has been thrown out

9629
06:50:55,680 --> 06:50:58,000
and this is another problem is that when

9630
06:50:58,000 --> 06:51:00,240
you are communicating

9631
06:51:00,240 --> 06:51:01,840
cyber

9632
06:51:01,840 --> 06:51:02,798
to

9633
06:51:02,798 --> 06:51:04,558
an executive

9634
06:51:04,558 --> 06:51:07,200
to the i guess there are say the thought

9635
06:51:07,200 --> 06:51:09,680
leaders in industry

9636
06:51:09,680 --> 06:51:12,558
if you can't communicate in a simple way

9637
06:51:12,558 --> 06:51:14,400
to those people

9638
06:51:14,400 --> 06:51:16,000
then you're not able

9639
06:51:16,000 --> 06:51:18,878
to communicate what the risk is and why

9640
06:51:18,878 --> 06:51:20,638
what you're pitching for whether it's

9641
06:51:20,638 --> 06:51:23,040
more funding or a

9642
06:51:23,040 --> 06:51:25,120
particular project

9643
06:51:25,120 --> 06:51:26,638
you're not going to be able to win them

9644
06:51:26,638 --> 06:51:28,558
over if you they can't understand what

9645
06:51:28,558 --> 06:51:30,240
you're speaking about it's as simple and

9646
06:51:30,240 --> 06:51:31,920
plain as that and now this is general

9647
06:51:31,920 --> 06:51:33,200
knowledge a lot of people understand

9648
06:51:33,200 --> 06:51:35,120
this but it still happens

9649
06:51:35,120 --> 06:51:36,400
we still have people that can't

9650
06:51:36,400 --> 06:51:39,120
communicate cyber and this is why

9651
06:51:39,120 --> 06:51:41,520
when we talk about diversity

9652
06:51:41,520 --> 06:51:42,958
and inclusion

9653
06:51:42,958 --> 06:51:44,718
in our industry

9654
06:51:44,718 --> 06:51:46,958
we don't just mean gender diversity

9655
06:51:46,958 --> 06:51:49,200
which is extremely important we don't

9656
06:51:49,200 --> 06:51:51,600
just mean cultural diversity which is

9657
06:51:51,600 --> 06:51:54,080
extremely important we don't just mean

9658
06:51:54,080 --> 06:51:55,600
diversity of people with various

9659
06:51:55,600 --> 06:51:58,400
abilities which is very very important

9660
06:51:58,400 --> 06:52:00,400
we're talking about diversity and

9661
06:52:00,400 --> 06:52:02,798
inclusion of people with a range of

9662
06:52:02,798 --> 06:52:06,558
skills and backgrounds and careers all

9663
06:52:06,558 --> 06:52:08,798
coming together to work in this very

9664
06:52:08,798 --> 06:52:10,558
vibrant industry because it is very

9665
06:52:10,558 --> 06:52:11,760
vibrant

9666
06:52:11,760 --> 06:52:15,120
it's not a one-size-fits-all

9667
06:52:15,120 --> 06:52:16,718
there are so many different roles in

9668
06:52:16,718 --> 06:52:18,878
cyber security

9669
06:52:18,878 --> 06:52:19,680
and

9670
06:52:19,680 --> 06:52:22,160
as someone who is not even an expert in

9671
06:52:22,160 --> 06:52:23,920
this particular subject matter and i

9672
06:52:23,920 --> 06:52:25,040
don't claim to be a subject matter

9673
06:52:25,040 --> 06:52:27,600
expert on anything but what i am doing

9674
06:52:27,600 --> 06:52:29,360
today is i'm really talking about my

9675
06:52:29,360 --> 06:52:31,840
experiences and conversations i've had

9676
06:52:31,840 --> 06:52:34,080
with a numerous other people within the

9677
06:52:34,080 --> 06:52:37,200
industry who think that it's it's time

9678
06:52:37,200 --> 06:52:39,600
for the industry to stop throwing out

9679
06:52:39,600 --> 06:52:42,320
the acronyms all the time

9680
06:52:42,320 --> 06:52:45,680
but again this is about give and take

9681
06:52:45,680 --> 06:52:48,160
what the industry needs to do is exactly

9682
06:52:48,160 --> 06:52:51,920
that start simplifying cyber more for

9683
06:52:51,920 --> 06:52:53,840
all the people in the industry and

9684
06:52:53,840 --> 06:52:56,160
outside the industry as well

9685
06:52:56,160 --> 06:52:58,160
but at the same time

9686
06:52:58,160 --> 06:53:01,200
newcomers and people in korea transition

9687
06:53:01,200 --> 06:53:03,360
even graduates from other areas coming

9688
06:53:03,360 --> 06:53:06,000
into cyber security

9689
06:53:06,000 --> 06:53:06,958
they

9690
06:53:06,958 --> 06:53:08,558
need to do they have their own

9691
06:53:08,558 --> 06:53:12,000
responsibility in actually i dare i say

9692
06:53:12,000 --> 06:53:13,600
like an anti-vaxxer doing their own

9693
06:53:13,600 --> 06:53:14,958
research

9694
06:53:14,958 --> 06:53:17,680
so what they really need to do is if an

9695
06:53:17,680 --> 06:53:19,920
acronym is thrown at them put their hand

9696
06:53:19,920 --> 06:53:21,040
up

9697
06:53:21,040 --> 06:53:24,638
don't be scared to just nod your head

9698
06:53:24,638 --> 06:53:26,400
and just say yeah i understand exactly

9699
06:53:26,400 --> 06:53:27,680
what you mean and walk away from the

9700
06:53:27,680 --> 06:53:30,240
meeting thinking i have no

9701
06:53:30,240 --> 06:53:31,840
idea what that person was saying just

9702
06:53:31,840 --> 06:53:32,878
that

9703
06:53:32,878 --> 06:53:34,240
because that's not going to help you at

9704
06:53:34,240 --> 06:53:36,320
all i made the biggest mistake when i

9705
06:53:36,320 --> 06:53:38,400
started in my first job in cyber

9706
06:53:38,400 --> 06:53:41,120
security of being too afraid

9707
06:53:41,120 --> 06:53:42,558
to ask

9708
06:53:42,558 --> 06:53:45,120
so what's a stop because thinking well

9709
06:53:45,120 --> 06:53:46,240
these people are just going to laugh at

9710
06:53:46,240 --> 06:53:47,760
me and you're a bit of a fraud and

9711
06:53:47,760 --> 06:53:50,160
they're you know dare i say the the

9712
06:53:50,160 --> 06:53:51,680
impostor syndrome which i've spoken

9713
06:53:51,680 --> 06:53:53,120
about at length before and i've had

9714
06:53:53,120 --> 06:53:54,878
published articles about

9715
06:53:54,878 --> 06:53:55,680
um

9716
06:53:55,680 --> 06:53:57,680
will come into play

9717
06:53:57,680 --> 06:53:59,120
but we've got to get over all of that

9718
06:53:59,120 --> 06:54:01,440
we've got to actually step up

9719
06:54:01,440 --> 06:54:04,320
those of us in the non-technical space

9720
06:54:04,320 --> 06:54:07,040
and actually say sorry can you please

9721
06:54:07,040 --> 06:54:08,798
explain what you just meant

9722
06:54:08,798 --> 06:54:10,718
that's something that i've started to do

9723
06:54:10,718 --> 06:54:12,718
a lot more in my career and i'm probably

9724
06:54:12,718 --> 06:54:15,040
doing it more than i need to

9725
06:54:15,040 --> 06:54:16,160
but for me

9726
06:54:16,160 --> 06:54:18,160
it's something that's important

9727
06:54:18,160 --> 06:54:19,760
because i've got a really important job

9728
06:54:19,760 --> 06:54:22,240
that if i can't actually understand the

9729
06:54:22,240 --> 06:54:24,478
processes and

9730
06:54:24,478 --> 06:54:26,638
the project itself that needs to

9731
06:54:26,638 --> 06:54:29,520
actually be undertaken and why it needs

9732
06:54:29,520 --> 06:54:31,680
to be undertaken then it just doesn't

9733
06:54:31,680 --> 06:54:33,360
happen

9734
06:54:33,360 --> 06:54:35,920
so with that being said

9735
06:54:35,920 --> 06:54:37,760
there's a responsibility

9736
06:54:37,760 --> 06:54:39,520
from the non-technical side and the

9737
06:54:39,520 --> 06:54:41,440
technical side

9738
06:54:41,440 --> 06:54:42,798
now i'm not just saying there are only

9739
06:54:42,798 --> 06:54:44,558
two sides to cyber there are people who

9740
06:54:44,558 --> 06:54:47,440
are very very well adept

9741
06:54:47,440 --> 06:54:48,160
at

9742
06:54:48,160 --> 06:54:50,558
their technical role

9743
06:54:50,558 --> 06:54:53,040
and also being able to communicate

9744
06:54:53,040 --> 06:54:55,280
fluently and articulately about cyber

9745
06:54:55,280 --> 06:54:57,680
security to various audiences there are

9746
06:54:57,680 --> 06:55:00,080
people that are amazingly exceptional at

9747
06:55:00,080 --> 06:55:01,840
being able to do that who are able to

9748
06:55:01,840 --> 06:55:03,520
think outside the box who are able to

9749
06:55:03,520 --> 06:55:06,000
use critical thinking skills who have

9750
06:55:06,000 --> 06:55:07,520
exemplary

9751
06:55:07,520 --> 06:55:10,478
leadership skills in cyber security and

9752
06:55:10,478 --> 06:55:13,280
still are an absolute whiz when it comes

9753
06:55:13,280 --> 06:55:16,160
to the technical side

9754
06:55:16,160 --> 06:55:17,600
there are lots of people like that that

9755
06:55:17,600 --> 06:55:19,520
i've met which is fantastic they might

9756
06:55:19,520 --> 06:55:21,120
call them unicorns but they're

9757
06:55:21,120 --> 06:55:22,878
definitely out there

9758
06:55:22,878 --> 06:55:24,400
so i'm not saying there's only two sides

9759
06:55:24,400 --> 06:55:26,878
to side by and the other responsibility

9760
06:55:26,878 --> 06:55:28,558
as well and i've probably committed it a

9761
06:55:28,558 --> 06:55:30,000
couple of times already in this

9762
06:55:30,000 --> 06:55:31,760
presentation

9763
06:55:31,760 --> 06:55:35,040
don't come out saying i'm a non-techie

9764
06:55:35,040 --> 06:55:37,040
because what you're also doing then is

9765
06:55:37,040 --> 06:55:38,798
you're just saying there are two sides

9766
06:55:38,798 --> 06:55:40,718
to cyber and that's it and there's a

9767
06:55:40,718 --> 06:55:43,760
it's black and it's white

9768
06:55:43,760 --> 06:55:45,280
there's not just two sides of cyber

9769
06:55:45,280 --> 06:55:46,798
there are so many different sides to

9770
06:55:46,798 --> 06:55:48,558
cyber because there's so many different

9771
06:55:48,558 --> 06:55:51,840
non-technical skills that come into play

9772
06:55:51,840 --> 06:55:53,520
there's people who come from legal

9773
06:55:53,520 --> 06:55:56,040
backgrounds education backgrounds

9774
06:55:56,040 --> 06:55:58,478
psychologists there are people from the

9775
06:55:58,478 --> 06:56:00,558
creative arts industries working in

9776
06:56:00,558 --> 06:56:02,958
cyber security

9777
06:56:02,958 --> 06:56:04,478
but there are also people who are very

9778
06:56:04,478 --> 06:56:06,638
technically adept who are actually

9779
06:56:06,638 --> 06:56:09,920
decently skilled in those areas as well

9780
06:56:09,920 --> 06:56:11,520
and it's really important to know that

9781
06:56:11,520 --> 06:56:14,160
as humans and as adults we are all

9782
06:56:14,160 --> 06:56:15,840
lifelong learners and there's nothing

9783
06:56:15,840 --> 06:56:18,798
stopping us from picking up a grad cert

9784
06:56:18,798 --> 06:56:20,638
for doing your masters in cyber at some

9785
06:56:20,638 --> 06:56:21,760
point

9786
06:56:21,760 --> 06:56:23,920
for doing any other certification at

9787
06:56:23,920 --> 06:56:25,520
some point

9788
06:56:25,520 --> 06:56:27,040
because that and that's great because

9789
06:56:27,040 --> 06:56:28,478
that just shows that you are committed

9790
06:56:28,478 --> 06:56:29,920
to this industry

9791
06:56:29,920 --> 06:56:31,920
and that you are committed to your own

9792
06:56:31,920 --> 06:56:33,760
personal growth and development in this

9793
06:56:33,760 --> 06:56:34,958
industry

9794
06:56:34,958 --> 06:56:37,440
as well

9795
06:56:37,440 --> 06:56:39,280
so

9796
06:56:39,280 --> 06:56:41,840
without any um without going on too much

9797
06:56:41,840 --> 06:56:44,080
more about it and out ranting about all

9798
06:56:44,080 --> 06:56:45,360
of that

9799
06:56:45,360 --> 06:56:47,520
i'd really like people to walk away from

9800
06:56:47,520 --> 06:56:50,240
today's presentation understanding

9801
06:56:50,240 --> 06:56:52,400
that it's really important that there's

9802
06:56:52,400 --> 06:56:53,080
an

9803
06:56:53,080 --> 06:56:55,040
inclusivity

9804
06:56:55,040 --> 06:56:56,798
when we talk about

9805
06:56:56,798 --> 06:56:59,200
people who are new to the industry and

9806
06:56:59,200 --> 06:57:01,280
that needs to be fostered at every

9807
06:57:01,280 --> 06:57:03,920
organization at every level

9808
06:57:03,920 --> 06:57:05,600
we need to be able

9809
06:57:05,600 --> 06:57:08,558
to speak simply and clearly about cyber

9810
06:57:08,558 --> 06:57:10,080
to people who are coming from the

9811
06:57:10,080 --> 06:57:12,878
outside of the industry such as myself

9812
06:57:12,878 --> 06:57:13,760
and

9813
06:57:13,760 --> 06:57:15,360
even though i've been in industry three

9814
06:57:15,360 --> 06:57:16,400
years

9815
06:57:16,400 --> 06:57:19,360
i'm still relatively very very new

9816
06:57:19,360 --> 06:57:21,040
and i don't claim to ever be an expert

9817
06:57:21,040 --> 06:57:22,878
and i've had people

9818
06:57:22,878 --> 06:57:25,200
introduce me at conferences in the past

9819
06:57:25,200 --> 06:57:27,440
and other events as a cyber security

9820
06:57:27,440 --> 06:57:29,440
expert and i've had to actually correct

9821
06:57:29,440 --> 06:57:32,400
them and call them out on that

9822
06:57:32,400 --> 06:57:34,400
because i'm not

9823
06:57:34,400 --> 06:57:35,440
and

9824
06:57:35,440 --> 06:57:37,520
if i'm going to be a little bit bold

9825
06:57:37,520 --> 06:57:39,600
here and also say

9826
06:57:39,600 --> 06:57:41,920
there are very few cyber security

9827
06:57:41,920 --> 06:57:44,958
experts like pure experts out there no

9828
06:57:44,958 --> 06:57:47,040
one knows everything

9829
06:57:47,040 --> 06:57:49,200
about cyber security

9830
06:57:49,200 --> 06:57:51,440
it's much broader

9831
06:57:51,440 --> 06:57:53,360
than what people think

9832
06:57:53,360 --> 06:57:55,680
it's so broad that it is actually

9833
06:57:55,680 --> 06:57:57,600
everyone's responsibility not just in

9834
06:57:57,600 --> 06:57:59,040
cyber security and this is where the

9835
06:57:59,040 --> 06:58:01,840
communication becomes really important

9836
06:58:01,840 --> 06:58:03,680
and this is going back to the ohs

9837
06:58:03,680 --> 06:58:05,520
approach and the cultural approach that

9838
06:58:05,520 --> 06:58:08,000
i think cyber security should be

9839
06:58:08,000 --> 06:58:11,040
looked at in every organization

9840
06:58:11,040 --> 06:58:12,558
imagine if you're

9841
06:58:12,558 --> 06:58:14,478
driving in front of a school your kid's

9842
06:58:14,478 --> 06:58:17,440
school and you see the white van

9843
06:58:17,440 --> 06:58:19,760
and you decide not to report it

9844
06:58:19,760 --> 06:58:22,320
that's like you

9845
06:58:22,320 --> 06:58:25,280
having a um seeing a cyber incident like

9846
06:58:25,280 --> 06:58:27,360
a phishing

9847
06:58:27,360 --> 06:58:28,638
incident

9848
06:58:28,638 --> 06:58:30,240
pop up on your friend's computer that

9849
06:58:30,240 --> 06:58:31,600
he's talking about or she's talking

9850
06:58:31,600 --> 06:58:33,680
about to you or on their phone and

9851
06:58:33,680 --> 06:58:34,878
you're just ignoring it saying yeah

9852
06:58:34,878 --> 06:58:36,240
that's that's nothing don't worry about

9853
06:58:36,240 --> 06:58:37,280
it

9854
06:58:37,280 --> 06:58:39,280
everyone should have a responsibility

9855
06:58:39,280 --> 06:58:40,958
when it comes to cyber security whether

9856
06:58:40,958 --> 06:58:42,958
it's a individual personal thing whether

9857
06:58:42,958 --> 06:58:44,718
it's at an organization whether it's in

9858
06:58:44,718 --> 06:58:46,240
a government agency

9859
06:58:46,240 --> 06:58:48,320
everyone needs to understand what the

9860
06:58:48,320 --> 06:58:49,840
risks and the threats are so they need

9861
06:58:49,840 --> 06:58:52,400
to be communicated really clearly

9862
06:58:52,400 --> 06:58:54,638
so that people can actually identify

9863
06:58:54,638 --> 06:58:56,320
these problems like the white van in

9864
06:58:56,320 --> 06:58:57,920
front of the school

9865
06:58:57,920 --> 06:58:59,200
like the phishing attempt on your

9866
06:58:59,200 --> 06:59:00,958
friend's phone and actually talk to them

9867
06:59:00,958 --> 06:59:02,718
about it and actually do something about

9868
06:59:02,718 --> 06:59:04,240
that

9869
06:59:04,240 --> 06:59:07,040
so that's really it for me today i don't

9870
06:59:07,040 --> 06:59:09,120
know if i've taken the entire time

9871
06:59:09,120 --> 06:59:11,200
but i hope you all got something out of

9872
06:59:11,200 --> 06:59:14,320
this um no slides for me really like to

9873
06:59:14,320 --> 06:59:15,520
talk from the heart about my own

9874
06:59:15,520 --> 06:59:17,840
experiences in cyber security but that

9875
06:59:17,840 --> 06:59:19,760
is basically what needs to happen on

9876
06:59:19,760 --> 06:59:21,360
both sides we need newcomers from the

9877
06:59:21,360 --> 06:59:22,958
industry to take responsibility for

9878
06:59:22,958 --> 06:59:24,878
their own understanding and learning and

9879
06:59:24,878 --> 06:59:27,280
knowledge we need people from within the

9880
06:59:27,280 --> 06:59:28,958
industry who are

9881
06:59:28,958 --> 06:59:32,718
the technical experts who have got a

9882
06:59:32,718 --> 06:59:35,840
wealth of experience in cyber to also

9883
06:59:35,840 --> 06:59:37,920
take them under the wing mentor them

9884
06:59:37,920 --> 06:59:40,320
educate them a bit better and actually

9885
06:59:40,320 --> 06:59:42,718
stop using acronyms all the time

9886
06:59:42,718 --> 06:59:45,120
thank you

9887
06:59:45,360 --> 06:59:46,878
i think you made your point quite

9888
06:59:46,878 --> 06:59:49,280
bluntly there that was um

9889
06:59:49,280 --> 06:59:51,040
i think it's fair to say though look uh

9890
06:59:51,040 --> 06:59:52,798
i come from a defense background and

9891
06:59:52,798 --> 06:59:54,240
then when you try and bring someone into

9892
06:59:54,240 --> 06:59:56,558
defense it's exactly the same like

9893
06:59:56,558 --> 06:59:58,080
there's a whole page on the defensive

9894
06:59:58,080 --> 07:00:01,200
internet made up of every single friggin

9895
07:00:01,200 --> 07:00:03,920
uh acronym and there's you know multiple

9896
07:00:03,920 --> 07:00:06,558
variants for the same acronym it's very

9897
07:00:06,558 --> 07:00:08,638
it's very off-putting for someone and

9898
07:00:08,638 --> 07:00:10,400
you're right it's it's twofold one is

9899
07:00:10,400 --> 07:00:12,878
not using the acronyms but two is asking

9900
07:00:12,878 --> 07:00:15,440
questions if you they're on it like

9901
07:00:15,440 --> 07:00:16,798
everyone says it but nobody really

9902
07:00:16,798 --> 07:00:18,160
believes it there are no stupid

9903
07:00:18,160 --> 07:00:19,760
questions you always have to ask these

9904
07:00:19,760 --> 07:00:22,320
questions and if you're not the one if

9905
07:00:22,320 --> 07:00:23,600
you're asking a question in a meeting a

9906
07:00:23,600 --> 07:00:25,600
lot it's likely you're not the only

9907
07:00:25,600 --> 07:00:26,878
person who's

9908
07:00:26,878 --> 07:00:28,798
missing the definition or you've missed

9909
07:00:28,798 --> 07:00:30,638

yeah a sock that was the first one i

9927
07:01:04,958 --> 07:01:07,360
that ever well i recognized and probably

9928
07:01:07,360 --> 07:01:09,040
the first one i made a joke about this

9929
07:01:09,040 --> 07:01:11,200
one i actually asked about as well so

9930
07:01:11,200 --> 07:01:13,920
yeah yeah definitely sock

9931
07:01:13,920 --> 07:01:15,200

being in fortress wa we've kind of been

10062

risks so i'll cover a brief history

10067
07:05:52,400 --> 07:05:54,240
how these differ from business risks and

10068
07:05:54,240 --> 07:05:55,680
why these have become a little bit more

10069
07:05:55,680 --> 07:05:57,520
prevalent during the covert era i'll

10070
07:05:57,520 --> 07:05:59,440
talk about how some of these attacks are

10071
07:05:59,440 --> 07:06:01,200
perpetrated and some of the people that

10072
07:06:01,200 --> 07:06:03,920
can look at perpetrating them

10073
07:06:03,920 --> 07:06:05,920
so just a little bit about me really

10074
07:06:05,920 --> 07:06:07,920
briefly i'm currently a technology

10075
07:06:07,920 --> 07:06:10,160
specialist at microsoft i'm based out of

10076
07:06:10,160 --> 07:06:12,478
perth wa as i said before

10077
07:06:12,478 --> 07:06:14,878
i'm a husband and a father and i've been

10078
07:06:14,878 --> 07:06:16,718
in the it industry for a little over a

10079
07:06:16,718 --> 07:06:17,920
decade now

10080
07:06:17,920 --> 07:06:19,840
makes me sound older than i am but a

10081
07:06:19,840 --> 07:06:21,760
decade it is and i've managed cyber

10082
07:06:21,760 --> 07:06:23,360
security and compliance in one way or

10083
07:06:23,360 --> 07:06:24,878
another throughout all of those

10084
07:06:24,878 --> 07:06:27,280
different roles i've started my career

10085
07:06:27,280 --> 07:06:29,360
at the service desk working in it

10086
07:06:29,360 --> 07:06:31,600
support like a lot of others and i then

10087
07:06:31,600 --> 07:06:33,760
moved into some network security network

10088
07:06:33,760 --> 07:06:36,638
architecture roles before focusing on

10089
07:06:36,638 --> 07:06:38,798
security as a consultant

10090
07:06:38,798 --> 07:06:40,320
i've been involved in the security

10091
07:06:40,320 --> 07:06:42,160
community for many years i run a

10092
07:06:42,160 --> 07:06:45,200
microsoft perth security user group

10093
07:06:45,200 --> 07:06:46,798
but i'm hoping that

10094
07:06:46,798 --> 07:06:48,478
and i'm starting to hope that i've got

10095
07:06:48,478 --> 07:06:50,080
that level of experience that i can

10096
07:06:50,080 --> 07:06:52,320
share some of those experiences out and

10097
07:06:52,320 --> 07:06:53,840
the knowledge into other people coming

10098
07:06:53,840 --> 07:06:55,680
into the industry and kind of help them

10099
07:06:55,680 --> 07:06:58,080
that way as well

10100
07:06:58,080 --> 07:07:00,558
so let's kick off uh i guess the best

10101
07:07:00,558 --> 07:07:03,360
way that i think is to start by defining

10102
07:07:03,360 --> 07:07:05,440
the difference between an insider and a

10103
07:07:05,440 --> 07:07:07,600
business risk as i get confused a lot in

10104
07:07:07,600 --> 07:07:08,958
some of the conversations that i've had

10105
07:07:08,958 --> 07:07:10,638
with people and i think it's key to be

10106
07:07:10,638 --> 07:07:11,840
able to tell the difference between the

10107
07:07:11,840 --> 07:07:12,878
two

10108
07:07:12,878 --> 07:07:15,360
so business risks are defined as the

10109
07:07:15,360 --> 07:07:18,400
exposure a company or organization must

10110
07:07:18,400 --> 07:07:20,320
factor in that could lower to its pr

10111
07:07:20,320 --> 07:07:23,040
lower its profits or lead it to fail so

10112
07:07:23,040 --> 07:07:24,718
let's think of things like regulatory

10113
07:07:24,718 --> 07:07:26,718
changes increased competition or other

10114
07:07:26,718 --> 07:07:29,040
like large external factors like fire or

10115
07:07:29,040 --> 07:07:30,400
theft to a building

10116
07:07:30,400 --> 07:07:31,440
they can be

10117
07:07:31,440 --> 07:07:33,520
business risks but when we start talking

10118
07:07:33,520 --> 07:07:35,360
about insider risks these are those

10119
07:07:35,360 --> 07:07:37,200
security risks that occur from within an

10120
07:07:37,200 --> 07:07:38,798
organization and it's normally

10121
07:07:38,798 --> 07:07:41,200
attributed to an individual user and

10122
07:07:41,200 --> 07:07:42,718
these users normally have access to

10123
07:07:42,718 --> 07:07:44,638
things like sensitive data or privileged

10124
07:07:44,638 --> 07:07:45,600
accounts

10125
07:07:45,600 --> 07:07:46,878
so now that we've kicked those out of

10126
07:07:46,878 --> 07:07:49,040
the way i guess let's cover a couple of

10127
07:07:49,040 --> 07:07:50,958
different kinds of business risks just

10128
07:07:50,958 --> 07:07:52,320
to round that out

10129
07:07:52,320 --> 07:07:54,160
anything that threatens a company's

10130
07:07:54,160 --> 07:07:55,840
ability to

10131
07:07:55,840 --> 07:07:57,840
achieve its financial goals can be

10132
07:07:57,840 --> 07:07:59,920
considered a business risk and these are

10133
07:07:59,920 --> 07:08:02,000
influenced by external factors it's due

10134
07:08:02,000 --> 07:08:04,240
to this that it's kind of impossible for

10135
07:08:04,240 --> 07:08:06,400
any company to completely remove a

10136
07:08:06,400 --> 07:08:08,320
business risk these can scale from

10137
07:08:08,320 --> 07:08:10,240
factors from things like the state of

10138
07:08:10,240 --> 07:08:11,520
the economy

10139
07:08:11,520 --> 07:08:13,760
down to regulation changes and

10140
07:08:13,760 --> 07:08:15,520
businesses typically manage these with a

10141
07:08:15,520 --> 07:08:17,760
sort of risk management strategy

10142
07:08:17,760 --> 07:08:19,440
these risks can't be put down to any

10143
07:08:19,440 --> 07:08:21,520
individual and are broader in scope than

10144
07:08:21,520 --> 07:08:23,760
you might typically expect but they can

10145
07:08:23,760 --> 07:08:25,920
be broken down into a few categories i'm

10146
07:08:25,920 --> 07:08:27,280
not going to list them all because

10147
07:08:27,280 --> 07:08:29,200
there's hundreds of them but i'll list

10148
07:08:29,200 --> 07:08:30,878
the four kind of main ones that i see a

10149
07:08:30,878 --> 07:08:31,920
lot

10150
07:08:31,920 --> 07:08:34,240
we have strategic risks and these come

10151
07:08:34,240 --> 07:08:36,080
up when a business don't follow their

10152
07:08:36,080 --> 07:08:37,280
own plan

10153
07:08:37,280 --> 07:08:38,878
so when companies don't follow their own

10154
07:08:38,878 --> 07:08:40,638
business model their strategy becomes

10155
07:08:40,638 --> 07:08:42,718
less effective over time and it makes it

10156
07:08:42,718 --> 07:08:44,558
harder for it to achieve its initial

10157
07:08:44,558 --> 07:08:46,638
goals some examples of this can be

10158
07:08:46,638 --> 07:08:47,680
things like

10159
07:08:47,680 --> 07:08:49,760
technology change within the company or

10160
07:08:49,760 --> 07:08:51,200
the industry as a whole

10161
07:08:51,200 --> 07:08:53,440
materials could become more expensive or

10162
07:08:53,440 --> 07:08:54,798
there can be other large-scale changes

10163
07:08:54,798 --> 07:08:56,958
that can affect a business

10164
07:08:56,958 --> 07:08:59,120
there are compliance risks and this is

10165
07:08:59,120 --> 07:09:00,638
something that i've been working on

10166
07:09:00,638 --> 07:09:02,798
fairly heavily over the last year or so

10167
07:09:02,798 --> 07:09:04,400
but these are the chances that you could

10168
07:09:04,400 --> 07:09:06,478
break law or regulation and get hit with

10169
07:09:06,478 --> 07:09:08,878
a financial penalty most of the time an

10170
07:09:08,878 --> 07:09:10,958
organization won't do these on purpose

10171
07:09:10,958 --> 07:09:12,478
but they do occur due to things like

10172
07:09:12,478 --> 07:09:14,400
oversights or errors laws and

10173
07:09:14,400 --> 07:09:16,478
regulations actually change more than

10174
07:09:16,478 --> 07:09:18,718
you'd actually expect so you've got to

10175
07:09:18,718 --> 07:09:20,080
make sure you're keeping up to date with

10176
07:09:20,080 --> 07:09:22,160
recent changes or the chances that

10177
07:09:22,160 --> 07:09:23,040
you're going to get hit with a

10178
07:09:23,040 --> 07:09:26,000
compliance issue just increase over time

10179
07:09:26,000 --> 07:09:27,760
we then have probably the most

10180
07:09:27,760 --> 07:09:29,840
well-known sort of risk from a consumer

10181
07:09:29,840 --> 07:09:31,040
perspective and these are the

10182
07:09:31,040 --> 07:09:33,600
operational risks these are related to

10183
07:09:33,600 --> 07:09:35,040
the potential of failure for their

10184
07:09:35,040 --> 07:09:37,360
day-to-day operations and the normally

10185
07:09:37,360 --> 07:09:39,440
result of a failed process

10186
07:09:39,440 --> 07:09:41,600
that said they can be people or process

10187
07:09:41,600 --> 07:09:43,600
failures it can be a technical failure

10188
07:09:43,600 --> 07:09:45,120
like let's say for example a network

10189
07:09:45,120 --> 07:09:46,320
outage that

10190
07:09:46,320 --> 07:09:48,240
everyone has seen before in their life

10191
07:09:48,240 --> 07:09:49,600
and we've all seen those sorts of things

10192
07:09:49,600 --> 07:09:51,280
in action

10193
07:09:51,280 --> 07:09:52,638
and just to round it out there's

10194
07:09:52,638 --> 07:09:55,200
financial risks so most categories of

10195
07:09:55,200 --> 07:09:57,840
risk have an element of financial impact

10196
07:09:57,840 --> 07:09:59,920
right that's what companies primarily

10197
07:09:59,920 --> 07:10:01,920
care about so these are things in terms

10198
07:10:01,920 --> 07:10:04,638
of extra costs or lost revenue the

10199
07:10:04,638 --> 07:10:06,400
category of financial risk in this

10200
07:10:06,400 --> 07:10:08,320
instance specifically refers to that

10201
07:10:08,320 --> 07:10:10,638
money coming in and out of a business as

10202
07:10:10,638 --> 07:10:12,878
well as things like sudden financial

10203
07:10:12,878 --> 07:10:14,958
loss

10204
07:10:14,958 --> 07:10:17,040
but now that we've covered it how are

10205
07:10:17,040 --> 07:10:19,920
they different from an insider risk

10206
07:10:19,920 --> 07:10:22,000
when we think of insider risks these are

10207
07:10:22,000 --> 07:10:24,558
primarily focused on threats that exist

10208
07:10:24,558 --> 07:10:27,360
internally think of malicious users

10209
07:10:27,360 --> 07:10:28,958
users that just simply aren't paying

10210
07:10:28,958 --> 07:10:31,040
attention or even molds within an

10211
07:10:31,040 --> 07:10:32,958
organization are all considered to be

10212
07:10:32,958 --> 07:10:35,600
inside risks they are the human element

10213
07:10:35,600 --> 07:10:37,280
of an organization rather than a

10214
07:10:37,280 --> 07:10:38,400
technical one

10215
07:10:38,400 --> 07:10:40,400
business risks in contrast normally

10216
07:10:40,400 --> 07:10:42,638
focus on external things changing of

10217
07:10:42,638 --> 07:10:44,798
laws changing of regulations another

10218
07:10:44,798 --> 07:10:46,558
company potentially growing and taking

10219
07:10:46,558 --> 07:10:48,558
to market share as a competitor they

10220
07:10:48,558 --> 07:10:50,638
would be business risks

10221
07:10:50,638 --> 07:10:52,798
unlike business risks

10222
07:10:52,798 --> 07:10:54,400
insider risk can be attributed to

10223
07:10:54,400 --> 07:10:57,040
individual users or a group of users and

10224
07:10:57,040 --> 07:10:58,638
this normally comes down to an action

10225
07:10:58,638 --> 07:11:00,240
that a user took whether that was

10226
07:11:00,240 --> 07:11:02,558
malicious or accidental

10227
07:11:02,558 --> 07:11:04,160
and they're much harder to measure in

10228
07:11:04,160 --> 07:11:07,040
absolute terms so let's say that a user

10229
07:11:07,040 --> 07:11:09,440
uploads data into a dropbox account that

10230
07:11:09,440 --> 07:11:11,440
could be considered an insider risk

10231
07:11:11,440 --> 07:11:13,040
depending on the data depending on the

10232
07:11:13,040 --> 07:11:15,040
organization's posture but in other

10233
07:11:15,040 --> 07:11:16,798
situations it could be a normal business

10234
07:11:16,798 --> 07:11:18,718
process this all comes down to the

10235
07:11:18,718 --> 07:11:20,160
individual use case of those

10236
07:11:20,160 --> 07:11:22,638
organizations

10237
07:11:22,638 --> 07:11:24,798
so so far i've been focusing on those

10238
07:11:24,798 --> 07:11:26,638
insider risks as they pertain to the

10239
07:11:26,638 --> 07:11:29,120
technology industry but they've existed

10240
07:11:29,120 --> 07:11:30,878
throughout history in every profession

10241
07:11:30,878 --> 07:11:32,400
they're nothing new there have always

10242
07:11:32,400 --> 07:11:34,320
been people looking to share secrets or

10243
07:11:34,320 --> 07:11:36,160
to create some sort of embarrassing

10244
07:11:36,160 --> 07:11:38,240
situation for others and most of us have

10245
07:11:38,240 --> 07:11:39,840
actually probably experienced this in

10246
07:11:39,840 --> 07:11:41,680
our own social circles whether it was

10247
07:11:41,680 --> 07:11:43,840
large or small scale the impact is

10248
07:11:43,840 --> 07:11:45,440
probably higher when we're talking about

10249
07:11:45,440 --> 07:11:47,520
large organizations with

10250
07:11:47,520 --> 07:11:49,760
a lot of ip and lots of money involved

10251
07:11:49,760 --> 07:11:51,680
but the behavior of those users remain

10252
07:11:51,680 --> 07:11:53,360
the same it's the same concept moving

10253
07:11:53,360 --> 07:11:55,040
forward whether it's in a social circle

10254
07:11:55,040 --> 07:11:56,798
or an organization

10255
07:11:56,798 --> 07:11:58,400
recently with covert shifting an

10256
07:11:58,400 --> 07:12:00,558
organization's mindset a lot have

10257
07:12:00,558 --> 07:12:02,638
adopted a hybrid work model this is

10258
07:12:02,638 --> 07:12:04,160
allowing their users to work from

10259
07:12:04,160 --> 07:12:06,558
wherever they need to and studies from

10260
07:12:06,558 --> 07:12:09,600
as recent as 2021 show that 73 of

10261
07:12:09,600 --> 07:12:11,120
employees actually want this way of

10262
07:12:11,120 --> 07:12:12,638
working to stay

10263
07:12:12,638 --> 07:12:14,878
me included and it's not going anywhere

10264
07:12:14,878 --> 07:12:16,478
at least in the short term

10265
07:12:16,478 --> 07:12:18,558
that said this further removes the old

10266
07:12:18,558 --> 07:12:20,638
school mentality of having a company's

10267
07:12:20,638 --> 07:12:23,120
walled garden where users would work

10268
07:12:23,120 --> 07:12:24,878
within a perimeter network and have

10269
07:12:24,878 --> 07:12:26,558
those protections in place to safeguard

10270
07:12:26,558 --> 07:12:28,080
against threats and data theft things

10271
07:12:28,080 --> 07:12:30,000
like network controls firewalls those

10272
07:12:30,000 --> 07:12:31,440
strong perimeter controls that might be

10273
07:12:31,440 --> 07:12:34,478
in place with users working from home or

10274
07:12:34,478 --> 07:12:36,320
they could be in a local coffee shop

10275
07:12:36,320 --> 07:12:38,000
often a library somewhere anywhere that

10276
07:12:38,000 --> 07:12:40,240
has internet access realistically those

10277
07:12:40,240 --> 07:12:42,240
protective roles of corporate networks

10278
07:12:42,240 --> 07:12:43,760
aren't in use anymore they can't apply

10279
07:12:43,760 --> 07:12:45,520
to those situations

10280
07:12:45,520 --> 07:12:47,280
people have sensitive data on their own

10281
07:12:47,280 --> 07:12:49,920
devices now a lot more often as well and

10282
07:12:49,920 --> 07:12:51,920
this only increases that risk profile of

10283
07:12:51,920 --> 07:12:54,240
the potential to have insider threats

10284
07:12:54,240 --> 07:12:55,600
another thing to consider when we're

10285
07:12:55,600 --> 07:12:58,080
talking about this is the great

10286
07:12:58,080 --> 07:13:00,080
resignation there's been recent studies

10287
07:13:00,080 --> 07:13:01,920
showing that there's 41 percent of

10288
07:13:01,920 --> 07:13:03,920
current workforces considering leaving

10289
07:13:03,920 --> 07:13:05,920
their employers this year and that kind

10290
07:13:05,920 --> 07:13:07,920
of provides the perfect situation for

10291
07:13:07,920 --> 07:13:10,160
users to either accidentally or

10292
07:13:10,160 --> 07:13:12,878
purposefully take sensitive data this

10293
07:13:12,878 --> 07:13:14,478
could be due to an employer simply

10294
07:13:14,478 --> 07:13:16,558
forgetting that they have sensitive data

10295
07:13:16,558 --> 07:13:18,878
on a device but in the worst case it

10296
07:13:18,878 --> 07:13:20,478
could be a malicious employee looking to

10297
07:13:20,478 --> 07:13:22,958
take that data to a competitor to use it

10298
07:13:22,958 --> 07:13:24,798
as an advantage and that kind of creates

10299
07:13:24,798 --> 07:13:27,040
a perfect storm lately on why these have

10300
07:13:27,040 --> 07:13:28,400
increased

10301
07:13:28,400 --> 07:13:30,080
they have become much more prevalent

10302
07:13:30,080 --> 07:13:32,240
over the last couple of years so

10303
07:13:32,240 --> 07:13:34,718
if your organization hasn't seen an

10304
07:13:34,718 --> 07:13:36,878
attempt or an increase in an attempt or

10305
07:13:36,878 --> 07:13:38,320
actual data losses during that time

10306
07:13:38,320 --> 07:13:40,080
period you might want to revisit it and

10307
07:13:40,080 --> 07:13:41,360
just see if you're watching the right

10308
07:13:41,360 --> 07:13:43,360
stuff

10309
07:13:43,360 --> 07:13:45,440
so what does this kind of look like over

10310
07:13:45,440 --> 07:13:47,120
the last year how has it increased

10311
07:13:47,120 --> 07:13:48,478
there's recent reports showing that

10312
07:13:48,478 --> 07:13:50,958
there's been a 72 percent of actionable

10313
07:13:50,958 --> 07:13:53,360
insider risk since 2020 this includes

10314
07:13:53,360 --> 07:13:56,080
things like uh theft of trade secrets

10315
07:13:56,080 --> 07:13:58,320
theft of source code as well as working

10316
07:13:58,320 --> 07:14:00,240
with foreign actors and we a lot of us

10317
07:14:00,240 --> 07:14:01,600
would have read some of those articles

10318
07:14:01,600 --> 07:14:03,440
or saw it in the news

10319
07:14:03,440 --> 07:14:05,040
if we break this down even further

10320
07:14:05,040 --> 07:14:07,200
there's been a 42 percent of increase in

10321
07:14:07,200 --> 07:14:09,040
ip or data theft and these are those

10322
07:14:09,040 --> 07:14:10,718
malicious insiders purposefully

10323
07:14:10,718 --> 07:14:12,958
exfoliating data out of an organization

10324
07:14:12,958 --> 07:14:14,478
this has grown the lie just over that

10325
07:14:14,478 --> 07:14:18,478
period of time we've had a 25 increase

10326
07:14:18,478 --> 07:14:20,878
in unauthorized or accidental disclosure

10327
07:14:20,878 --> 07:14:22,400
and that includes activities such as the

10328
07:14:22,400 --> 07:14:24,718
user potentially accidentally sharing

10329
07:14:24,718 --> 07:14:26,400
confidential data that they didn't mean

10330
07:14:26,400 --> 07:14:28,558
to and this can be due to things like a

10331
07:14:28,558 --> 07:14:30,160
lack of education or awareness on the

10332
07:14:30,160 --> 07:14:32,080
subject or just not understanding what

10333
07:14:32,080 --> 07:14:33,760
the correct process is to safeguard that

10334
07:14:33,760 --> 07:14:35,680
data securely there's been a lot of

10335
07:14:35,680 --> 07:14:36,958
things about

10336
07:14:36,958 --> 07:14:38,718
things like s3 buckets being open to the

10337
07:14:38,718 --> 07:14:40,558
internet that haven't been secured and

10338
07:14:40,558 --> 07:14:42,080
that's just one of those types of

10339
07:14:42,080 --> 07:14:43,200
incidents that have recently been

10340
07:14:43,200 --> 07:14:45,280
occurring the last thing i wanted to

10341
07:14:45,280 --> 07:14:46,638
call out from those studies is that

10342
07:14:46,638 --> 07:14:49,600
there's been a 19 increase in purposeful

10343
07:14:49,600 --> 07:14:51,840
malicious sabotage these are insiders

10344
07:14:51,840 --> 07:14:53,920
that want to break the environment and

10345
07:14:53,920 --> 07:14:56,000
statistically when you have a look at a

10346
07:14:56,000 --> 07:14:57,920
lot of those studies they're from

10347
07:14:57,920 --> 07:15:00,320
disgruntled employees or people that

10348
07:15:00,320 --> 07:15:02,400
have been slighted by an organization

10349
07:15:02,400 --> 07:15:04,478
they might have been terminated and then

10350
07:15:04,478 --> 07:15:06,080
they've used that insider knowledge to

10351
07:15:06,080 --> 07:15:07,600
break something within the environment

10352
07:15:07,600 --> 07:15:09,040
after they've left

10353
07:15:09,040 --> 07:15:11,120
a lot of the time it'll happen when a

10354
07:15:11,120 --> 07:15:13,360
user account's not being disabled it's

10355
07:15:13,360 --> 07:15:15,120
really common within an organization if

10356
07:15:15,120 --> 07:15:16,958
the process fails for someone's account

10357
07:15:16,958 --> 07:15:18,478
to remain active for weeks and months

10358
07:15:18,478 --> 07:15:20,478
after they leave this has gone to a

10359
07:15:20,478 --> 07:15:22,080
large amount of people coming back in

10360
07:15:22,080 --> 07:15:23,760
and destroying data

10361
07:15:23,760 --> 07:15:25,440
these numbers might be a little scary to

10362
07:15:25,440 --> 07:15:27,840
look at and honestly they kind of are in

10363
07:15:27,840 --> 07:15:30,000
relation to some of the other threats

10364
07:15:30,000 --> 07:15:32,240
but you just kind of show how new ways

10365
07:15:32,240 --> 07:15:33,840
of working have only helped this risk

10366
07:15:33,840 --> 07:15:35,840
kind of evolve and become more prevalent

10367
07:15:35,840 --> 07:15:38,080
as we go on

10368
07:15:38,080 --> 07:15:39,200
the kind of thing you want to think

10369
07:15:39,200 --> 07:15:42,080
about is are these insider risks always

10370
07:15:42,080 --> 07:15:43,840
trying to be malicious

10371
07:15:43,840 --> 07:15:46,638
and the short answer to that is no

10372
07:15:46,638 --> 07:15:47,920
they normally exist in two different

10373
07:15:47,920 --> 07:15:49,680
categories like most other things the

10374
07:15:49,680 --> 07:15:51,840
good and the bad

10375
07:15:51,840 --> 07:15:53,520
most insider risks are actually in the

10376
07:15:53,520 --> 07:15:55,360
good category these are those users

10377
07:15:55,360 --> 07:15:57,200
trying to do the right thing but they're

10378
07:15:57,200 --> 07:15:58,878
either making mistakes or just aren't

10379
07:15:58,878 --> 07:16:00,240
aware of what the process is to

10380
07:16:00,240 --> 07:16:02,080
safeguard that data

10381
07:16:02,080 --> 07:16:03,840
on the other hand we have the bad the

10382
07:16:03,840 --> 07:16:05,200
people in the organization that are

10383
07:16:05,200 --> 07:16:07,440
trying to cause damage maybe they've

10384
07:16:07,440 --> 07:16:08,478
been paid off

10385
07:16:08,478 --> 07:16:10,080
they might have been planning to leave

10386
07:16:10,080 --> 07:16:12,000
to a competitor or maybe they just want

10387
07:16:12,000 --> 07:16:13,520
to see the world burn after they leave

10388
07:16:13,520 --> 07:16:15,040
an organization

10389
07:16:15,040 --> 07:16:16,558
something to really quickly note as well

10390
07:16:16,558 --> 07:16:18,400
when i find that a lot of people get

10391
07:16:18,400 --> 07:16:20,080
confused i'm having conversations with

10392
07:16:20,080 --> 07:16:22,558
people about it is that insider risks

10393
07:16:22,558 --> 07:16:24,240
and insider threats are two very

10394
07:16:24,240 --> 07:16:25,840
different things

10395
07:16:25,840 --> 07:16:27,120
theoretically a hundred percent of your

10396
07:16:27,120 --> 07:16:29,280
users could be considered insider risks

10397
07:16:29,280 --> 07:16:31,280
either malicious or accidental but it's

10398
07:16:31,280 --> 07:16:32,798
that one percent and that's being

10399
07:16:32,798 --> 07:16:34,638
optimistic that cause issues that

10400
07:16:34,638 --> 07:16:37,040
actually become an insider threat so in

10401
07:16:37,040 --> 07:16:38,638
other words it needs to be an action

10402
07:16:38,638 --> 07:16:40,558
associated with an activity for it to be

10403
07:16:40,558 --> 07:16:43,360
elevated to that level

10404
07:16:43,360 --> 07:16:45,440
so let's have a chat about some of the

10405
07:16:45,440 --> 07:16:48,240
different human types so i like breaking

10406
07:16:48,240 --> 07:16:50,080
these sorts of human related risks into

10407
07:16:50,080 --> 07:16:51,680
different personas because i help i

10408
07:16:51,680 --> 07:16:53,520
think it helps try to understand the

10409
07:16:53,520 --> 07:16:54,638
kinds of people that you should be

10410
07:16:54,638 --> 07:16:56,718
looking out for within an organization

10411
07:16:56,718 --> 07:16:58,320
and keep in mind again

10412
07:16:58,320 --> 07:17:00,240
they're not all malicious so this first

10413
07:17:00,240 --> 07:17:02,840
instance here of the good kind of

10414
07:17:02,840 --> 07:17:04,798
personas they're not doing this on

10415
07:17:04,798 --> 07:17:06,000
purpose

10416
07:17:06,000 --> 07:17:07,520
so for example let's start with the

10417
07:17:07,520 --> 07:17:08,478
saber

10418
07:17:08,478 --> 07:17:10,718
this is the type of person that won't

10419
07:17:10,718 --> 07:17:13,440
take any chance of losing data no matter

10420
07:17:13,440 --> 07:17:15,600
what they have copies of sensitive data

10421
07:17:15,600 --> 07:17:17,360
locally they've backed it up into the

10422
07:17:17,360 --> 07:17:19,600
cloud they've printed this off at home

10423
07:17:19,600 --> 07:17:21,280
they have that data in every single

10424
07:17:21,280 --> 07:17:23,280
circumstance so that no matter what they

10425
07:17:23,280 --> 07:17:25,280
will have access to it they can't stand

10426
07:17:25,280 --> 07:17:27,040
the thought of losing this data at all

10427
07:17:27,040 --> 07:17:29,360
they say things to personal accounts

10428
07:17:29,360 --> 07:17:30,718
there might be company policies

10429
07:17:30,718 --> 07:17:32,478
prohibiting this sign of behavior but

10430
07:17:32,478 --> 07:17:33,600
they're just trying to make sure the

10431
07:17:33,600 --> 07:17:34,958
data is safe

10432
07:17:34,958 --> 07:17:36,958
they might be the most risk averse

10433
07:17:36,958 --> 07:17:39,280
people within an organization and the

10434
07:17:39,280 --> 07:17:40,958
easy way to identify them is how much

10435
07:17:40,958 --> 07:17:42,718
storage they're using these people won't

10436
07:17:42,718 --> 07:17:44,160
delete anything ever and they

10437
07:17:44,160 --> 07:17:45,600
automatically sync things to personal

10438
07:17:45,600 --> 07:17:47,520
devices or external hard drives just to

10439
07:17:47,520 --> 07:17:49,760
make sure

10440
07:17:49,760 --> 07:17:51,440
we then have the planner

10441
07:17:51,440 --> 07:17:53,200
and this is the person they're planning

10442
07:17:53,200 --> 07:17:55,280
for their future after the organization

10443
07:17:55,280 --> 07:17:57,120
every piece of work they've worked on if

10444
07:17:57,120 --> 07:17:58,798
it's confidential or not they've taken a

10445
07:17:58,798 --> 07:18:00,320
backup of it they've got that saved

10446
07:18:00,320 --> 07:18:02,638
locally sometimes planners are mixed up

10447
07:18:02,638 --> 07:18:04,638
with savers but where a saver saves

10448
07:18:04,638 --> 07:18:06,798
literally everything planners focus on

10449
07:18:06,798 --> 07:18:08,160
the work that they themselves have

10450
07:18:08,160 --> 07:18:10,080
created and contributed to whether

10451
07:18:10,080 --> 07:18:11,680
that's going to be used for when they go

10452
07:18:11,680 --> 07:18:14,000
to another organization as a way to kind

10453
07:18:14,000 --> 07:18:16,718
of pad out their resume or not they'll

10454
07:18:16,718 --> 07:18:19,520
save all the work that they've worked on

10455
07:18:19,520 --> 07:18:21,680
the next one is the sharer these are

10456
07:18:21,680 --> 07:18:23,280
those people that want to collaborate no

10457
07:18:23,280 --> 07:18:25,280
matter what the cost is and often they

10458
07:18:25,280 --> 07:18:26,478
want to get more and more people

10459
07:18:26,478 --> 07:18:28,240
involved into a project in order to have

10460
07:18:28,240 --> 07:18:30,240
a better outcome the risk that they

10461
07:18:30,240 --> 07:18:31,520
typically present

10462
07:18:31,520 --> 07:18:33,680
is that they often share data with

10463
07:18:33,680 --> 07:18:35,040
people that shouldn't have access to it

10464
07:18:35,040 --> 07:18:36,398
in the first place

10465
07:18:36,398 --> 07:18:38,718
even worse is how they could potentially

10466
07:18:38,718 --> 07:18:40,718
share that information if they're not

10467
07:18:40,718 --> 07:18:42,558
aware of the secure ways of sharing this

10468
07:18:42,558 --> 07:18:44,398
data within an organization they'll

10469
07:18:44,398 --> 07:18:46,320
share it over usbs and external hard

10470
07:18:46,320 --> 07:18:47,920
drives they'll throw it out of a

10471
07:18:47,920 --> 07:18:50,160
personal email they'll put it up onto an

10472
07:18:50,160 --> 07:18:52,320
online note-taking app there are plenty

10473
07:18:52,320 --> 07:18:54,638
of companies that have confidential data

10474
07:18:54,638 --> 07:18:56,878
in personal shared notebooks

10475
07:18:56,878 --> 07:18:58,398
and often these are shared with people

10476
07:18:58,398 --> 07:19:00,080
outside of the organization without them

10477
07:19:00,080 --> 07:19:02,958
even realizing it worse yet in that kind

10478
07:19:02,958 --> 07:19:04,478
of instance specifically it's really

10479
07:19:04,478 --> 07:19:06,080
hard to capture that kind of data

10480
07:19:06,080 --> 07:19:07,840
exfiltration activity unless you're

10481
07:19:07,840 --> 07:19:10,478
specifically looking for it

10482
07:19:10,478 --> 07:19:12,878
and finally we've got the advisor

10483
07:19:12,878 --> 07:19:14,718
so these are the people that just want

10484
07:19:14,718 --> 07:19:16,878
the best outcome for their customers

10485
07:19:16,878 --> 07:19:19,200
even if it means showing that customer

10486
07:19:19,200 --> 07:19:21,280
how other customers do it they'll work

10487
07:19:21,280 --> 07:19:22,878
on whatever platform the customer wants

10488
07:19:22,878 --> 07:19:24,798
to use instead of using already

10489
07:19:24,798 --> 07:19:26,718
pre-approved sharing methods if the

10490
07:19:26,718 --> 07:19:28,718
customer wants to use dropbox for

10491
07:19:28,718 --> 07:19:31,120
example to share files so will they if

10492
07:19:31,120 --> 07:19:32,958
they collaborate over google docs so

10493
07:19:32,958 --> 07:19:34,638
will they

10494
07:19:34,638 --> 07:19:35,760
they're more than happy to put

10495
07:19:35,760 --> 07:19:37,840
confidential data into these systems to

10496
07:19:37,840 --> 07:19:40,080
help one of their customers out even if

10497
07:19:40,080 --> 07:19:42,240
the organization has no visibility into

10498
07:19:42,240 --> 07:19:43,760
those services

10499
07:19:43,760 --> 07:19:45,360
all of these different personas like i

10500
07:19:45,360 --> 07:19:47,600
spoke about before have no intention of

10501
07:19:47,600 --> 07:19:49,600
being an insider threat they're all well

10502
07:19:49,600 --> 07:19:51,040
intentioned and they're either trying to

10503
07:19:51,040 --> 07:19:52,398
do the right thing for the company or

10504
07:19:52,398 --> 07:19:53,600
their customers

10505
07:19:53,600 --> 07:19:56,160
the majority of insider threats in this

10506
07:19:56,160 --> 07:19:57,760
actually come out in this category of

10507
07:19:57,760 --> 07:20:00,320
user they are the accidental sharers of

10508
07:20:00,320 --> 07:20:01,840
confidential data and they're just

10509
07:20:01,840 --> 07:20:03,520
trying to get things done as efficiently

10510
07:20:03,520 --> 07:20:06,240
as they can

10511
07:20:06,240 --> 07:20:08,638
obviously on the other side

10512
07:20:08,638 --> 07:20:10,798
we have the bad and these are the people

10513
07:20:10,798 --> 07:20:13,520
that are trying to cause impacts that

10514
07:20:13,520 --> 07:20:15,440
are purposefully trying to be an insider

10515
07:20:15,440 --> 07:20:17,280
threat they want to break things they

10516
07:20:17,280 --> 07:20:19,280
want to cause issues they want to cause

10517
07:20:19,280 --> 07:20:21,360
drama whether they've been paid off by a

10518
07:20:21,360 --> 07:20:23,280
third party or they feel like they've

10519
07:20:23,280 --> 07:20:25,280
been slighted by an organization they

10520
07:20:25,280 --> 07:20:27,520
don't particularly care so let's go

10521
07:20:27,520 --> 07:20:29,600
through a couple of those as well

10522
07:20:29,600 --> 07:20:31,040
so first of all and probably one of the

10523
07:20:31,040 --> 07:20:33,520
west most well-known is the sell-out and

10524
07:20:33,520 --> 07:20:35,600
this is spoken about a lot in a lot of

10525
07:20:35,600 --> 07:20:37,600
studies it's always raised and they are

10526
07:20:37,600 --> 07:20:39,040
the people that have received a great

10527
07:20:39,040 --> 07:20:41,200
offer from one of your competitors as

10528
07:20:41,200 --> 07:20:43,600
long as they bring something with them

10529
07:20:43,600 --> 07:20:45,440
and most of the time that's access to

10530
07:20:45,440 --> 07:20:48,160
their current organization's data these

10531
07:20:48,160 --> 07:20:50,000
users will typically be in positions

10532
07:20:50,000 --> 07:20:51,360
where they have access to confidential

10533
07:20:51,360 --> 07:20:52,638
data it could be

10534
07:20:52,638 --> 07:20:55,040
source code it could be proprietary data

10535
07:20:55,040 --> 07:20:56,398
either way it's valuable to their

10536
07:20:56,398 --> 07:20:58,478
competitors they'll try to exfiltrate

10537
07:20:58,478 --> 07:21:00,080
the starter out through personal email

10538
07:21:00,080 --> 07:21:02,000
addresses out by our external hard

10539
07:21:02,000 --> 07:21:03,760
drives but either way they're trying to

10540
07:21:03,760 --> 07:21:05,600
take that data out the organization to

10541
07:21:05,600 --> 07:21:07,440
give to a competitor and get rewarded

10542
07:21:07,440 --> 07:21:08,320
for it

10543
07:21:08,320 --> 07:21:09,600
there have been a lot of reports

10544
07:21:09,600 --> 07:21:12,160
recently with this exact thing happening

10545
07:21:12,160 --> 07:21:14,000
so why would you bother

10546
07:21:14,000 --> 07:21:15,600
trying to put all that effort into

10547
07:21:15,600 --> 07:21:16,958
hacking your way into a corporate

10548
07:21:16,958 --> 07:21:18,558
environment when you can just drop some

10549
07:21:18,558 --> 07:21:20,558
money to a user and get them to exultate

10550
07:21:20,558 --> 07:21:22,958
the data for you better yet you can get

10551
07:21:22,958 --> 07:21:24,478
privileged credentials and you can go in

10552
07:21:24,478 --> 07:21:26,798
and get whatever data that you want

10553
07:21:26,798 --> 07:21:28,798
next we've got the prankster

10554
07:21:28,798 --> 07:21:31,280
simply put these kind of people just

10555
07:21:31,280 --> 07:21:33,360
want to cause trouble for the lulls they

10556
07:21:33,360 --> 07:21:35,680
will open fireport firewall ports

10557
07:21:35,680 --> 07:21:36,718
randomly

10558
07:21:36,718 --> 07:21:38,798
they'll grant themselves rdp access to

10559
07:21:38,798 --> 07:21:40,718
networks so they can log in from home

10560
07:21:40,718 --> 07:21:42,878
they'll use unapproved apps to bypass

10561
07:21:42,878 --> 07:21:44,958
security controls most of the time

10562
07:21:44,958 --> 07:21:46,558
they're bored in their role and they're

10563
07:21:46,558 --> 07:21:48,080
just looking for something to distract

10564
07:21:48,080 --> 07:21:50,000
themselves even if it causes damage to

10565
07:21:50,000 --> 07:21:51,840
the company

10566
07:21:51,840 --> 07:21:53,760
the next one is something that

10567
07:21:53,760 --> 07:21:57,120
is always in movies so this is the um

10568
07:21:57,120 --> 07:21:59,440
the mole so these are the threats for

10569
07:21:59,440 --> 07:22:01,680
ohio also known as corporate espionage

10570
07:22:01,680 --> 07:22:03,680
and they exist in all sorts of different

10571
07:22:03,680 --> 07:22:06,080
industries but primarily in companies

10572
07:22:06,080 --> 07:22:08,958
that house confidential ip like research

10573
07:22:08,958 --> 07:22:10,958
for example last year astrazeneca had

10574
07:22:10,958 --> 07:22:12,958
some blueprints for the vaccine stolen

10575
07:22:12,958 --> 07:22:14,558
it's not been formally attributed but

10576
07:22:14,558 --> 07:22:16,320
it's thought to have been an in insider

10577
07:22:16,320 --> 07:22:17,440
threat

10578
07:22:17,440 --> 07:22:19,200
and finally

10579
07:22:19,200 --> 07:22:20,798
we have the clicker

10580
07:22:20,798 --> 07:22:22,878
these people have had months of

10581
07:22:22,878 --> 07:22:24,798
corporate it training about not clicking

10582
07:22:24,798 --> 07:22:27,280
every single link that has ever been

10583
07:22:27,280 --> 07:22:29,280
presented to them but no amount of

10584
07:22:29,280 --> 07:22:30,718
training can stop the impulse to click

10585
07:22:30,718 --> 07:22:32,558
those links it is embedded within their

10586
07:22:32,558 --> 07:22:33,520
dna

10587
07:22:33,520 --> 07:22:35,280
after all what if they had just won that

10588
07:22:35,280 --> 07:22:36,718
competition that they don't remember

10589
07:22:36,718 --> 07:22:37,920
entering

10590
07:22:37,920 --> 07:22:39,760
some people might not categorize this

10591
07:22:39,760 --> 07:22:41,760
persona as malicious but i can say with

10592
07:22:41,760 --> 07:22:43,760
experience from working with users for a

10593
07:22:43,760 --> 07:22:44,878
long time

10594
07:22:44,878 --> 07:22:46,798
that after the 100th click on a random

10595
07:22:46,798 --> 07:22:48,798
link that user has to be messing with

10596
07:22:48,798 --> 07:22:50,478
you

10597
07:22:50,478 --> 07:22:52,558
so let's talk a little bit about what we

10598
07:22:52,558 --> 07:22:55,120
can do to find some of these risks

10599
07:22:55,120 --> 07:22:56,320
i found

10600
07:22:56,320 --> 07:22:57,920
the best way to kind of detect this

10601
07:22:57,920 --> 07:23:00,320
behavior is to use a platform that

10602
07:23:00,320 --> 07:23:02,240
monitors user behavior and generates

10603
07:23:02,240 --> 07:23:03,920
alerts when weird or abnormal behavior

10604
07:23:03,920 --> 07:23:05,520
is spotted there's heaps of products and

10605
07:23:05,520 --> 07:23:07,120
platforms that do this for you and

10606
07:23:07,120 --> 07:23:08,798
they'll build up a picture of users

10607
07:23:08,798 --> 07:23:10,160
behavior and alert when that user

10608
07:23:10,160 --> 07:23:12,718
deviates from it for example just even

10609
07:23:12,718 --> 07:23:14,240
accounting suddenly have an interest in

10610
07:23:14,240 --> 07:23:16,240
hr documents it's probably something we

10611
07:23:16,240 --> 07:23:18,558
want to be alerted on

10612
07:23:18,558 --> 07:23:20,000
you want to be keeping eyes on users

10613
07:23:20,000 --> 07:23:21,360
that are logging in at weird times as

10614
07:23:21,360 --> 07:23:22,798
well so for example we're an

10615
07:23:22,798 --> 07:23:24,398
australian-based company that might only

10616
07:23:24,398 --> 07:23:26,160
operate in australia but we have a user

10617
07:23:26,160 --> 07:23:28,638
randomly logging at 2 am this could be a

10618
07:23:28,638 --> 07:23:30,558
sign that an insider is attempting to

10619
07:23:30,558 --> 07:23:32,320
hide their activities or it could just

10620
07:23:32,320 --> 07:23:33,600
be a case of an account that's been

10621
07:23:33,600 --> 07:23:35,600
compromised

10622
07:23:35,600 --> 07:23:37,200
you want to be watching out for

10623
07:23:37,200 --> 07:23:38,958
unauthorized applications within the

10624
07:23:38,958 --> 07:23:40,320
network as well

10625
07:23:40,320 --> 07:23:42,080
it's likely to be a dream that you're

10626
07:23:42,080 --> 07:23:43,840
going to have full control of every

10627
07:23:43,840 --> 07:23:45,760
single application that is running every

10628
07:23:45,760 --> 07:23:47,200
single device of your entire

10629
07:23:47,200 --> 07:23:49,200
organization but it's pretty common

10630
07:23:49,200 --> 07:23:50,000
you're going to have a couple of

10631
07:23:50,000 --> 07:23:51,760
approved sharing platforms whether this

10632
07:23:51,760 --> 07:23:53,840
be onedrive dropbox or any other number

10633
07:23:53,840 --> 07:23:55,520
of cloud services you want to make sure

10634
07:23:55,520 --> 07:23:56,958
that you're monitoring and blocking the

10635
07:23:56,958 --> 07:23:58,878
kind of services particularly for

10636
07:23:58,878 --> 07:24:00,558
sharing and collaboration that you don't

10637
07:24:00,558 --> 07:24:02,638
want used

10638
07:24:02,638 --> 07:24:04,558
insider risks also typically look at

10639
07:24:04,558 --> 07:24:06,638
downloading data in order to exfiltrate

10640
07:24:06,638 --> 07:24:08,320
it whether this be out to an external

10641
07:24:08,320 --> 07:24:10,320
device or over email make sure you're

10642
07:24:10,320 --> 07:24:11,760
monitoring the loading on excessive

10643
07:24:11,760 --> 07:24:13,200
downloads of data that are outside of

10644
07:24:13,200 --> 07:24:15,040
the norm for your organization

10645
07:24:15,040 --> 07:24:16,958
particularly over a longer period of

10646
07:24:16,958 --> 07:24:18,638
time because it will be a common way

10647
07:24:18,638 --> 07:24:19,760
that someone's not going to try to

10648
07:24:19,760 --> 07:24:21,520
download a thousand files immediately or

10649
07:24:21,520 --> 07:24:23,200
try to trickle it out so just make sure

10650
07:24:23,200 --> 07:24:26,320
you're monitoring for that behavior

10651
07:24:26,320 --> 07:24:27,200
you want to make sure that you're

10652
07:24:27,200 --> 07:24:28,638
looking for people that are downloading

10653
07:24:28,638 --> 07:24:30,558
or copying files they don't actually

10654
07:24:30,558 --> 07:24:32,798
need access to for their job ideally

10655
07:24:32,798 --> 07:24:33,840
you're already going to have some

10656
07:24:33,840 --> 07:24:36,240
controls in place to prevent this but

10657
07:24:36,240 --> 07:24:37,040
even

10658
07:24:37,040 --> 07:24:39,200
the attempt of trying to do this should

10659
07:24:39,200 --> 07:24:41,280
be logged and followed up even more so

10660
07:24:41,280 --> 07:24:43,120
if the end user is going to be leaving

10661
07:24:43,120 --> 07:24:45,600
the organization soon

10662
07:24:45,600 --> 07:24:47,760
if you're using data classification of

10663
07:24:47,760 --> 07:24:50,478
any kind within your organization make

10664
07:24:50,478 --> 07:24:52,000
sure you're capturing when that data

10665
07:24:52,000 --> 07:24:53,760
classification is downgraded and a

10666
07:24:53,760 --> 07:24:56,478
reason for it having been downgraded

10667
07:24:56,478 --> 07:24:57,840
there's no point having a data

10668
07:24:57,840 --> 07:24:59,600
classification scheme in the first place

10669
07:24:59,600 --> 07:25:01,520
if any employee in the organization can

10670
07:25:01,520 --> 07:25:03,440
downgrade it completely freely without

10671
07:25:03,440 --> 07:25:05,920
being monitored and alert raised

10672
07:25:05,920 --> 07:25:08,558
and i guess finally and most importantly

10673
07:25:08,558 --> 07:25:09,760
is

10674
07:25:09,760 --> 07:25:11,040
make sure you have a built out

10675
07:25:11,040 --> 07:25:12,958
implemented cyber security awareness

10676
07:25:12,958 --> 07:25:15,120
program within your organization and

10677
07:25:15,120 --> 07:25:17,440
include insider risk in it a lot of

10678
07:25:17,440 --> 07:25:19,520
organizations are relying on awareness

10679
07:25:19,520 --> 07:25:21,040
campaigns that are several years old

10680
07:25:21,040 --> 07:25:22,798
that don't cover today's threats and

10681
07:25:22,798 --> 07:25:24,798
these need to be updated regularly so

10682
07:25:24,798 --> 07:25:27,040
users to be can be across these in order

10683
07:25:27,040 --> 07:25:28,878
to prevent some of these current threats

10684
07:25:28,878 --> 07:25:30,958
like i said before the majority of these

10685
07:25:30,958 --> 07:25:33,360
insider risks are accidental and they're

10686
07:25:33,360 --> 07:25:35,440
simply done due to those users not being

10687
07:25:35,440 --> 07:25:37,440
aware of proper processes when it comes

10688
07:25:37,440 --> 07:25:39,840
to confidential data

10689
07:25:39,840 --> 07:25:41,840
and i guess with that we've come to an

10690
07:25:41,840 --> 07:25:42,958
end so

10691
07:25:42,958 --> 07:25:44,320
i could have spoken a little bit more

10692
07:25:44,320 --> 07:25:45,840
about some of the different technologies

10693
07:25:45,840 --> 07:25:47,360
to prevent these things done loss

10694
07:25:47,360 --> 07:25:49,280
prevention correlating these events into

10695
07:25:49,280 --> 07:25:50,878
a scene but these are going to be

10696
07:25:50,878 --> 07:25:52,398
dependent on your environment and the

10697
07:25:52,398 --> 07:25:54,798
technologies you actually have access to

10698
07:25:54,798 --> 07:25:56,638
hopefully i've provided everyone with a

10699
07:25:56,638 --> 07:25:58,080
better understanding of what insider

10700
07:25:58,080 --> 07:26:00,000
risks are and some of the personas that

10701
07:26:00,000 --> 07:26:01,920
you can be on the lookout for i have

10702
07:26:01,920 --> 07:26:04,000
primarily focused on people in process

10703
07:26:04,000 --> 07:26:05,920
on technology and process but those soft

10704
07:26:05,920 --> 07:26:08,160
skills and people are just as important

10705
07:26:08,160 --> 07:26:10,398
most of the time people will know that a

10706
07:26:10,398 --> 07:26:12,398
malicious insider because they can tell

10707
07:26:12,398 --> 07:26:13,760
that their acts they're acting

10708
07:26:13,760 --> 07:26:15,840
differently than they normally do maybe

10709
07:26:15,840 --> 07:26:18,000
they suddenly have heaps of cash maybe

10710
07:26:18,000 --> 07:26:19,280
they're asking other people to send

10711
07:26:19,280 --> 07:26:21,440
confidential information to them so the

10712
07:26:21,440 --> 07:26:22,878
last thing that i want to close it out

10713
07:26:22,878 --> 07:26:24,478
on is make sure you're listening to your

10714
07:26:24,478 --> 07:26:25,440
users

10715
07:26:25,440 --> 07:26:27,280
if they're saying something is wrong

10716
07:26:27,280 --> 07:26:30,320
chances are it probably is and with that

10717
07:26:30,320 --> 07:26:32,718
thank you

10718
07:26:36,000 --> 07:26:38,958
amazing talk i can't believe that's the

10719
07:26:38,958 --> 07:26:41,360
first time you've uh done a

10720
07:26:41,360 --> 07:26:43,120
presentation that is

10721
07:26:43,120 --> 07:26:46,160
so cool and

10722
07:26:46,798 --> 07:26:49,760
definitely that wasn't for hours

10723
07:26:49,760 --> 07:26:53,798
no no no 100

10724
07:26:58,320 --> 07:26:59,520
and i would take the fact that there are

10725
07:26:59,520 --> 07:27:01,360
no questions because of that everyone

10726
07:27:01,360 --> 07:27:03,440
was really clear on understanding like

10727
07:27:03,440 --> 07:27:05,760
it was a great presentation honestly

10728
07:27:05,760 --> 07:27:07,840
yeah thank you yeah a lot of info and a

10729
07:27:07,840 --> 07:27:10,080
lot of really good follow-up info too so

10730
07:27:10,080 --> 07:27:11,680
thank you good taking yeah so if you've

10731
07:27:11,680 --> 07:27:13,440
got any questions for bo please put them

10732
07:27:13,440 --> 07:27:16,320
in the q and a page um we probably don't

10733
07:27:16,320 --> 07:27:17,680
have time to read any app because we're

10734
07:27:17,680 --> 07:27:18,638
going to have to move to our next

10735
07:27:18,638 --> 07:27:20,320
speaker but thank you very much bo that

10736
07:27:20,320 --> 07:27:22,240
was amazing talk

10737
07:27:22,240 --> 07:27:24,000
anytime thanks for having me

10738
07:27:24,000 --> 07:27:26,080
no worries

10739
07:27:26,080 --> 07:27:28,478
um i still don't have a drink and i

10740
07:27:28,478 --> 07:27:30,958
haven't rectified this uh

10741
07:27:30,958 --> 07:27:33,200
i will go have to do that don't can't

10742
07:27:33,200 --> 07:27:34,398
miss that isn't that what hoodie's there

10743
07:27:34,398 --> 07:27:36,240
for no i heard he's not there to make

10744
07:27:36,240 --> 07:27:38,320
drinks for me

10745
07:27:38,320 --> 07:27:41,920
no i don't do that i feel bad

10746
07:27:41,920 --> 07:27:44,160
um but our next speaker is here so i

10747
07:27:44,160 --> 07:27:46,320
will let them in

10748
07:27:46,320 --> 07:27:50,240
hi eleanor hi it's emma from switzerland

10749
07:27:50,240 --> 07:27:51,520
how's it going

10750
07:27:51,520 --> 07:27:53,680
hello eleanor from switzerland i'm dad

10751
07:27:53,680 --> 07:27:55,920
yeah i'm done

10752
07:27:55,920 --> 07:27:57,840
for those who don't know eleanor is my

10753
07:27:57,840 --> 07:27:58,798
child

10754
07:27:58,798 --> 07:28:00,080
it is yeah

10755
07:28:00,080 --> 07:28:02,878
it's it's it's decided in fact yes it is

10756
07:28:02,878 --> 07:28:05,200
a decided fact how is switzerland today

10757
07:28:05,200 --> 07:28:06,958
is it nice and cold

10758
07:28:06,958 --> 07:28:09,600
yeah it's like three degrees um

10759
07:28:09,600 --> 07:28:11,920
we had at the traditional cold snap at

10760
07:28:11,920 --> 07:28:14,240
the beginning of april um it's allegedly

10761
07:28:14,240 --> 07:28:15,760
supposed to snow today but i don't think

10762
07:28:15,760 --> 07:28:17,680
it actually will here

10763
07:28:17,680 --> 07:28:18,878
okay

10764
07:28:18,878 --> 07:28:21,040
and um i think we've asked you this

10765
07:28:21,040 --> 07:28:22,958
before but chicken nuggets versus

10766
07:28:22,958 --> 07:28:25,920
tendees where do you sit on the spectrum

10767
07:28:25,920 --> 07:28:28,958
yeah i gotta say um i rarely consume

10768
07:28:28,958 --> 07:28:32,320
either um but i've had more nuggies so

10769
07:28:32,320 --> 07:28:34,718
i'm going to have to go with the nuggies

10770
07:28:34,718 --> 07:28:36,878
i'm not very committed to this take you

10771
07:28:36,878 --> 07:28:38,558
can't say they can't come back shanna

10772
07:28:38,558 --> 07:28:41,760
because that's not allowed

10773
07:28:42,080 --> 07:28:44,000
did you see i was silent i was selling

10774
07:28:44,000 --> 07:28:46,000
off i know you were you were being good

10775
07:28:46,000 --> 07:28:48,718
i was pretending i didn't hear it what

10776
07:28:48,718 --> 07:28:50,398
happened i missed that nothing nothing

10777
07:28:50,398 --> 07:28:52,878
was said so i have to i have to sing a

10778
07:28:52,878 --> 07:28:55,920
song apparently before eleanor um

10779
07:28:55,920 --> 07:28:57,600
before i put the presentation on because

10780
07:28:57,600 --> 07:28:59,200
it goes with the um

10781
07:28:59,200 --> 07:29:00,638
and because i'm making a fool of myself

10782
07:29:00,638 --> 07:29:02,958
with a crappy voice which is huh

10783
07:29:02,958 --> 07:29:07,440
good god y'all what is it good for um

10784
07:29:07,440 --> 07:29:10,398
absolutely nothing yes

10785
07:29:10,398 --> 07:29:14,080
because eleanor's presentation is about

10786
07:29:14,080 --> 07:29:16,798
quantum computers

10787
07:29:16,798 --> 07:29:19,120
so what are we good for

10788
07:29:19,120 --> 07:29:20,160
yes

10789
07:29:20,160 --> 07:29:22,160
for those who don't not absolutely

10790
07:29:22,160 --> 07:29:23,920
nothing

10791
07:29:23,920 --> 07:29:26,240
absolutely nothing no oh you've just

10792
07:29:26,240 --> 07:29:28,718
given it away um eleanor isn't aussie

10793
07:29:28,718 --> 07:29:31,440
living in switzerland at doing their phd

10794
07:29:31,440 --> 07:29:33,760
lifelong interest in programming in uh

10795
07:29:33,760 --> 07:29:35,920
infosec she's they're a mathematician

10796
07:29:35,920 --> 07:29:38,958
and a physicist they have two cats

10797
07:29:38,958 --> 07:29:40,638
uh we can't get rid of them even though

10798
07:29:40,638 --> 07:29:43,200
they moved to switzerland so um i'm just

10799
07:29:43,200 --> 07:29:44,798
gonna hand it over and learn all about

10800
07:29:44,798 --> 07:29:46,478
quantum computers

10801
07:29:46,478 --> 07:29:49,760
yes and very excited all right let's get

10802
07:29:49,760 --> 07:29:51,520
stuck into it i've got my twitter handle

10803
07:29:51,520 --> 07:29:52,320
um

10804
07:29:52,320 --> 07:29:54,558
up there if you want to check out um

10805
07:29:54,558 --> 07:29:56,798
mostly a bunch of tweets about cats food

10806
07:29:56,798 --> 07:29:58,718
and not a lot else

10807
07:29:58,718 --> 07:30:00,478
um if you get the reference in the

10808
07:30:00,478 --> 07:30:02,958
handle i'm really sorry it's a bad pun

10809
07:30:02,958 --> 07:30:05,280
okay so quantum computers what are they

10810
07:30:05,280 --> 07:30:07,360
good for good question

10811
07:30:07,360 --> 07:30:10,558
so um i am an academic i'm very sorry to

10812
07:30:10,558 --> 07:30:12,320
say i did my degree in physics because i

10813
07:30:12,320 --> 07:30:14,000
was really interested in physics i was a

10814
07:30:14,000 --> 07:30:15,760
kid so i learned a bit of quantum

10815
07:30:15,760 --> 07:30:17,600
physics it's very cool

10816
07:30:17,600 --> 07:30:19,920
i defected i'm afraid to computer

10817
07:30:19,920 --> 07:30:21,360
science because the job market for

10818
07:30:21,360 --> 07:30:23,760
physicists is not great

10819
07:30:23,760 --> 07:30:28,558
um and now i'm a phd student at the uh

10820
07:30:28,558 --> 07:30:32,320
in ch also known as eth zurich um

10821
07:30:32,320 --> 07:30:34,080
during my phd in theoretical

10822
07:30:34,080 --> 07:30:37,040
cryptography so crypto is sort of my my

10823
07:30:37,040 --> 07:30:39,360
little specialty that i've carved out uh

10824
07:30:39,360 --> 07:30:40,558
obviously i'm gonna be talking a bit

10825
07:30:40,558 --> 07:30:42,558
about the implications of quantum

10826
07:30:42,558 --> 07:30:46,000
computers with cryptography all right

10827
07:30:46,000 --> 07:30:48,240
so the story that we're gonna tell today

10828
07:30:48,240 --> 07:30:50,240
starts with what's called the church

10829
07:30:50,240 --> 07:30:52,398
during thesis after alonzo church and

10830
07:30:52,398 --> 07:30:54,958
ellen cheering um maybe you've heard of

10831
07:30:54,958 --> 07:30:57,280
alan turing there's a movie about him

10832
07:30:57,280 --> 07:30:59,360
that i haven't seen but uh i've heard

10833
07:30:59,360 --> 07:31:00,638
it's pretty good

10834
07:31:00,638 --> 07:31:02,718
so the question is what can computers

10835
07:31:02,718 --> 07:31:05,840
actually do are there more powerful

10836
07:31:05,840 --> 07:31:07,680
kinds of computer

10837
07:31:07,680 --> 07:31:08,638
is there

10838
07:31:08,638 --> 07:31:09,440
uh

10839
07:31:09,440 --> 07:31:10,718
is there some

10840
07:31:10,718 --> 07:31:12,638
amazing technology that can solve

10841
07:31:12,638 --> 07:31:14,958
problems that today's computers can't

10842
07:31:14,958 --> 07:31:16,558
theoretically

10843
07:31:16,558 --> 07:31:19,280
well the church turing thesis asserts

10844
07:31:19,280 --> 07:31:22,160
that every realistic computation

10845
07:31:22,160 --> 07:31:24,718
every kind of computation you can think

10846
07:31:24,718 --> 07:31:25,600
of

10847
07:31:25,600 --> 07:31:27,760
could be done efficiently by a

10848
07:31:27,760 --> 07:31:29,840
probabilistic turing machine

10849
07:31:29,840 --> 07:31:31,520
a probabilistic turing machine is just

10850
07:31:31,520 --> 07:31:33,200
one that tosses coins

10851
07:31:33,200 --> 07:31:34,080
um

10852
07:31:34,080 --> 07:31:35,280
and a turing machine if you're not

10853
07:31:35,280 --> 07:31:37,520
familiar it's this abstract idea of a

10854
07:31:37,520 --> 07:31:39,520
computer it's got a tape it can write

10855
07:31:39,520 --> 07:31:41,600
symbols on this tape think back to the

10856
07:31:41,600 --> 07:31:43,680
old days with punch card computers right

10857
07:31:43,680 --> 07:31:45,600
it can read symbols in this tape maybe

10858
07:31:45,600 --> 07:31:47,520
write new ones do certain kinds of

10859
07:31:47,520 --> 07:31:49,920
operations and the claim is that these

10860
07:31:49,920 --> 07:31:52,558
can actually do everything and this is

10861
07:31:52,558 --> 07:31:54,320
quite interesting because

10862
07:31:54,320 --> 07:31:56,878
as far as we can tell

10863
07:31:56,878 --> 07:31:58,478
no one else

10864
07:31:58,478 --> 07:32:01,360
no model of computing exists that is

10865
07:32:01,360 --> 07:32:03,600
inherently more powerful

10866
07:32:03,600 --> 07:32:05,520
than a turing machine

10867
07:32:05,520 --> 07:32:08,240
some of them do stuff a bit faster

10868
07:32:08,240 --> 07:32:10,398
some of them seem to be more powerful

10869
07:32:10,398 --> 07:32:12,718
and we'll revisit this as we go

10870
07:32:12,718 --> 07:32:13,600
right

10871
07:32:13,600 --> 07:32:14,878
so the question that we really want to

10872
07:32:14,878 --> 07:32:16,878
answer are there more powerful types of

10873
07:32:16,878 --> 07:32:20,240
computer maybe there are for it

10874
07:32:20,240 --> 07:32:21,920
so to give you some ground on what we

10875
07:32:21,920 --> 07:32:24,398
call classical computing non-quantum

10876
07:32:24,398 --> 07:32:26,718
classical in this context just means

10877
07:32:26,718 --> 07:32:28,398
it's not quantum

10878
07:32:28,398 --> 07:32:30,798
um basically the way that we think about

10879
07:32:30,798 --> 07:32:32,638
this well it's it's really just a bunch

10880
07:32:32,638 --> 07:32:34,240
of circuits right a bunch of digital

10881
07:32:34,240 --> 07:32:36,240
circuits working together

10882
07:32:36,240 --> 07:32:38,240
so if you want to compute one plus one

10883
07:32:38,240 --> 07:32:39,760
i've got a little diagram on the right

10884
07:32:39,760 --> 07:32:40,798
here

10885
07:32:40,798 --> 07:32:43,840
two ones and i'm gonna compute uh

10886
07:32:43,840 --> 07:32:46,878
one plus one which is one zero in binary

10887
07:32:46,878 --> 07:32:49,120
okay so how does a classic computer

10888
07:32:49,120 --> 07:32:51,760
evaluate this well the first step is

10889
07:32:51,760 --> 07:32:54,160
we're going to copy that one bit because

10890
07:32:54,160 --> 07:32:55,680
we're going to have to do it we're going

10891
07:32:55,680 --> 07:32:58,638
to use it again later when we compute

10892
07:32:58,638 --> 07:33:00,558
okay we we push forward and then we

10893
07:33:00,558 --> 07:33:04,878
compute the bitwise x or exclusive or if

10894
07:33:04,878 --> 07:33:06,558
you're not familiar this is how

10895
07:33:06,558 --> 07:33:08,958
computers add numbers uh somewhere in

10896
07:33:08,958 --> 07:33:11,440
their little cpu tree

10897
07:33:11,440 --> 07:33:13,920
we're gonna calculate the one xor one

10898
07:33:13,920 --> 07:33:14,958
then

10899
07:33:14,958 --> 07:33:16,478
oh boy

10900
07:33:16,478 --> 07:33:19,680
take a drink everybody

10901
07:33:23,200 --> 07:33:26,718
press the back button on my mouse

10902
07:33:26,718 --> 07:33:28,878
okay so if you want to know how

10903
07:33:28,878 --> 07:33:30,398
computers calculate addition we're going

10904
07:33:30,398 --> 07:33:32,320
to take this one bit this one bit

10905
07:33:32,320 --> 07:33:35,280
calculate the bitwise xor in this case

10906
07:33:35,280 --> 07:33:36,878
if they're the same as zero if they're

10907
07:33:36,878 --> 07:33:39,360
different it's one okay so we've got a

10908
07:33:39,360 --> 07:33:41,120
zero because one and one are the same

10909
07:33:41,120 --> 07:33:42,320
and then we're going to push that one

10910
07:33:42,320 --> 07:33:44,558
forward now and calculate the bitwise

10911
07:33:44,558 --> 07:33:45,680
and

10912
07:33:45,680 --> 07:33:48,320
i'm going to put it in this second here

10913
07:33:48,320 --> 07:33:51,360
okay one and one is one so now we have

10914
07:33:51,360 --> 07:33:54,000
our answer 1 0 read bottom to top this

10915
07:33:54,000 --> 07:33:56,160
is the mechanics of how a computer works

10916
07:33:56,160 --> 07:33:58,798
we have these binary circuits these

10917
07:33:58,798 --> 07:34:01,840
digits that are doing logical

10918
07:34:01,840 --> 07:34:03,920
computations and really that's just how

10919
07:34:03,920 --> 07:34:06,160
computer works that's how if you really

10920
07:34:06,160 --> 07:34:08,160
zoom in that's how it's that's how it

10921
07:34:08,160 --> 07:34:10,718
all works so

10922
07:34:10,718 --> 07:34:12,558
what we're interested in is what what

10923
07:34:12,558 --> 07:34:16,878
happens if we try to find other ways

10924
07:34:16,878 --> 07:34:19,040
what if in fact our computer could work

10925
07:34:19,040 --> 07:34:21,760
with bits that are between

10926
07:34:21,760 --> 07:34:24,718
zero and one somehow this is the idea

10927
07:34:24,718 --> 07:34:27,440
that leads us to quantum computing

10928
07:34:27,440 --> 07:34:29,520
no longer do we have bits that are

10929
07:34:29,520 --> 07:34:31,520
either zero or one we're going to try

10930
07:34:31,520 --> 07:34:33,680
something a little bit more general

10931
07:34:33,680 --> 07:34:35,360
all right so now we get to do some

10932
07:34:35,360 --> 07:34:36,878
physics i have a lovely picture of the

10933
07:34:36,878 --> 07:34:40,160
large hadron collider uh over near uh

10934
07:34:40,160 --> 07:34:41,200
lausanne

10935
07:34:41,200 --> 07:34:42,718
um in

10936
07:34:42,718 --> 07:34:44,398
half in switzerland in fact which is

10937
07:34:44,398 --> 07:34:47,120
very exciting you're a nerd like me

10938
07:34:47,120 --> 07:34:49,760
the basic idea you have electrons these

10939
07:34:49,760 --> 07:34:51,840
are the little particles that are

10940
07:34:51,840 --> 07:34:53,840
responsible for electric current in

10941
07:34:53,840 --> 07:34:56,478
wires teeny tiny little charged

10942
07:34:56,478 --> 07:34:57,680
particles

10943
07:34:57,680 --> 07:35:00,000
and it turns out that electrons are sort

10944
07:35:00,000 --> 07:35:01,360
of spinning

10945
07:35:01,360 --> 07:35:03,840
in some sense um as i've got a little

10946
07:35:03,840 --> 07:35:05,280
asterisk here it's sort of it's a lot

10947
07:35:05,280 --> 07:35:07,040
more complicated than that and if you do

10948
07:35:07,040 --> 07:35:08,718
a whole physics degree you'll learn

10949
07:35:08,718 --> 07:35:09,760
about that

10950
07:35:09,760 --> 07:35:11,280
you can think of it like it's spinning

10951
07:35:11,280 --> 07:35:13,200
right and well it's charged that's

10952
07:35:13,200 --> 07:35:15,280
spinning that's kind of like a little

10953
07:35:15,280 --> 07:35:18,000
circular circuit right you've got charge

10954
07:35:18,000 --> 07:35:20,320
moving in a loop and whenever you have

10955
07:35:20,320 --> 07:35:22,958
charges moving in a loop well you have a

10956
07:35:22,958 --> 07:35:26,320
magnetic field this is uh some physics

10957
07:35:26,320 --> 07:35:28,878
that humanity worked out in the 1700s

10958
07:35:28,878 --> 07:35:30,478
whenever you've got current moving the

10959
07:35:30,478 --> 07:35:32,478
circle it's a magnetic field you've got

10960
07:35:32,478 --> 07:35:33,840
one of these

10961
07:35:33,840 --> 07:35:36,240
one of these doodads a wireless charger

10962
07:35:36,240 --> 07:35:38,080
that's kind of how these work you've got

10963
07:35:38,080 --> 07:35:39,680
currents spinning around that creates a

10964
07:35:39,680 --> 07:35:42,240
magnetic field your phone

10965
07:35:42,240 --> 07:35:44,958
picks up that magnetic field induces a

10966
07:35:44,958 --> 07:35:46,478
current and uses that to charge it's

10967
07:35:46,478 --> 07:35:48,798
exactly the same principle

10968
07:35:48,798 --> 07:35:51,440
so i lit an electron okay it's a little

10969
07:35:51,440 --> 07:35:53,200
charged particle but it's also a tiny

10970
07:35:53,200 --> 07:35:56,398
magnet okay so here i've got a diagram

10971
07:35:56,398 --> 07:35:58,160
where it's spinning it's got a north

10972
07:35:58,160 --> 07:35:59,920
pole and a south pole just like a tiny

10973
07:35:59,920 --> 07:36:02,958
little bar magnet and this is how we are

10974
07:36:02,958 --> 07:36:05,200
going to do calculations between zero

10975
07:36:05,200 --> 07:36:06,638
and one

10976
07:36:06,638 --> 07:36:07,680
okay

10977
07:36:07,680 --> 07:36:09,120
so the picture that you have in mind

10978
07:36:09,120 --> 07:36:11,440
i've got an external magnetic field okay

10979
07:36:11,440 --> 07:36:13,840
there's a magnetic field um you don't

10980
07:36:13,840 --> 07:36:15,440
really need to know about how that works

10981
07:36:15,440 --> 07:36:17,200
other than the fact that well sort of

10982
07:36:17,200 --> 07:36:18,878
north and south right so here it's

10983
07:36:18,878 --> 07:36:20,798
pointing upwards okay

10984
07:36:20,798 --> 07:36:23,680
the magnetic field in the background and

10985
07:36:23,680 --> 07:36:26,000
electrons can go one of two ways either

10986
07:36:26,000 --> 07:36:28,958
the north can be aligned with the field

10987
07:36:28,958 --> 07:36:31,120
which is the case on the left here or it

10988
07:36:31,120 --> 07:36:33,600
can be aligned against the field which

10989
07:36:33,600 --> 07:36:35,920
is the case on the right here

10990
07:36:35,920 --> 07:36:37,760
this this it's it's like how you have

10991
07:36:37,760 --> 07:36:40,000
little bar magnets right they they move

10992
07:36:40,000 --> 07:36:41,840
around and they try to snap to the

10993
07:36:41,840 --> 07:36:44,718
magnetic field uh we call this spin up

10994
07:36:44,718 --> 07:36:47,040
for no particularly good reason and we

10995
07:36:47,040 --> 07:36:49,200
call this spin down also for no

10996
07:36:49,200 --> 07:36:51,040
particularly good reason other than the

10997
07:36:51,040 --> 07:36:53,360
fact that up is the opposite of down

10998
07:36:53,360 --> 07:36:55,360
physicists are very creative people i

10999
07:36:55,360 --> 07:36:56,958
promise

11000
07:36:56,958 --> 07:36:59,280
okay so the way we're going to build our

11001
07:36:59,280 --> 07:37:01,120
quantum computer is we're going to call

11002
07:37:01,120 --> 07:37:03,920
spin up the arrow it takes the role of a

11003
07:37:03,920 --> 07:37:06,240
zero bit we're going to call spin down

11004
07:37:06,240 --> 07:37:08,478
one it takes a roll over one bit

11005
07:37:08,478 --> 07:37:10,798
now because we're big nerds we like to

11006
07:37:10,798 --> 07:37:13,200
write numbers um we have this little

11007
07:37:13,200 --> 07:37:15,440
notation this we've got this

11008
07:37:15,440 --> 07:37:17,120
straight line and then a number and then

11009
07:37:17,120 --> 07:37:19,520
an angle bracket this is just saying

11010
07:37:19,520 --> 07:37:22,080
it's the state that we will call zero

11011
07:37:22,080 --> 07:37:24,080
right the electron can be stay up or

11012
07:37:24,080 --> 07:37:26,240
stay down we'll call this one zero and

11013
07:37:26,240 --> 07:37:29,120
we use the fancy brackets say this is a

11014
07:37:29,120 --> 07:37:31,360
quantum state that's all that means

11015
07:37:31,360 --> 07:37:33,280
don't get scared by it

11016
07:37:33,280 --> 07:37:34,840
okay well

11017
07:37:34,840 --> 07:37:37,920
but electrons don't have to be aligned

11018
07:37:37,920 --> 07:37:40,958
with field really they could be

11019
07:37:40,958 --> 07:37:43,120
stuck parallel like this

11020
07:37:43,120 --> 07:37:46,000
so this is kind of half up and half down

11021
07:37:46,000 --> 07:37:47,840
right you've got an up and a down if you

11022
07:37:47,840 --> 07:37:48,638
sort of

11023
07:37:48,638 --> 07:37:50,558
push them together you get half up and

11024
07:37:50,558 --> 07:37:52,878
half down uh and we write this as it's a

11025
07:37:52,878 --> 07:37:56,080
zero plus a one divided by the square

11026
07:37:56,080 --> 07:37:57,280
root of two

11027
07:37:57,280 --> 07:37:59,520
very rich because mathematically you

11028
07:37:59,520 --> 07:38:02,000
have to square it to get a probability

11029
07:38:02,000 --> 07:38:03,600
it's sort of it's basically you think of

11030
07:38:03,600 --> 07:38:06,958
it as half zero plus a half one gives

11031
07:38:06,958 --> 07:38:10,558
you this expression here alpha half down

11032
07:38:10,558 --> 07:38:13,280
interesting it's not just zero and one

11033
07:38:13,280 --> 07:38:15,680
it can actually be in between

11034
07:38:15,680 --> 07:38:18,000
and of course well the real world is 3d

11035
07:38:18,000 --> 07:38:19,760
right it doesn't just have to be it's

11036
07:38:19,760 --> 07:38:22,240
not stuck in this 2d plane it can also

11037
07:38:22,240 --> 07:38:24,878
twist this way pointing inwards into the

11038
07:38:24,878 --> 07:38:26,080
screen

11039
07:38:26,080 --> 07:38:26,878
so

11040
07:38:26,878 --> 07:38:29,840
we write this using this fancy eye which

11041
07:38:29,840 --> 07:38:31,280
you might have heard of imaginary

11042
07:38:31,280 --> 07:38:34,320
numbers oh complex numbers very scary

11043
07:38:34,320 --> 07:38:36,320
all you need to know is that these

11044
07:38:36,320 --> 07:38:38,718
electrons can be lined up down left to

11045
07:38:38,718 --> 07:38:41,040
right or inward and we have a

11046
07:38:41,040 --> 07:38:42,958
mathematical framework that lets us

11047
07:38:42,958 --> 07:38:45,760
combine the zeros and ones

11048
07:38:45,760 --> 07:38:46,958
okay

11049
07:38:46,958 --> 07:38:49,520
so these electrons with their spinny

11050
07:38:49,520 --> 07:38:51,360
states the tiny little biomagnets

11051
07:38:51,360 --> 07:38:54,240
they're called cubits or quantum bits

11052
07:38:54,240 --> 07:38:56,798
and each one is a combination of zero

11053
07:38:56,798 --> 07:38:57,760
and one

11054
07:38:57,760 --> 07:38:59,440
and then we can just do circuits they're

11055
07:38:59,440 --> 07:39:02,398
not the same binary digital circuits

11056
07:39:02,398 --> 07:39:05,120
before but it's the same idea right we

11057
07:39:05,120 --> 07:39:06,878
start with the qubit that is just zero

11058
07:39:06,878 --> 07:39:10,160
pointing up and now we have this aromat

11059
07:39:10,160 --> 07:39:12,878
gate which is this little construction

11060
07:39:12,878 --> 07:39:14,798
that um i won't go into the details of

11061
07:39:14,798 --> 07:39:17,200
because i'm not giving a math talk today

11062
07:39:17,200 --> 07:39:19,120
and then we have this controlled not

11063
07:39:19,120 --> 07:39:21,200
gate which again i won't go too far into

11064
07:39:21,200 --> 07:39:23,280
the details of but it's a bit like the

11065
07:39:23,280 --> 07:39:25,840
xor at the xor and the end that we use

11066
07:39:25,840 --> 07:39:28,398
to add numbers it's a little bit fancy

11067
07:39:28,398 --> 07:39:30,398
so let's just run through this quickly

11068
07:39:30,398 --> 07:39:32,718
apply a hat amount to cubes one what

11069
07:39:32,718 --> 07:39:35,040
this does it takes our zero gives us a

11070
07:39:35,040 --> 07:39:37,040
half zero and a half one that's all it

11071
07:39:37,040 --> 07:39:39,200
does okay we're taking the zero we're

11072
07:39:39,200 --> 07:39:41,600
rotating it so that we now have a half

11073
07:39:41,600 --> 07:39:44,240
zero and a half one all right

11074
07:39:44,240 --> 07:39:47,200
now controlled not says the part of it

11075
07:39:47,200 --> 07:39:50,638
that's one is going to invert the zero

11076
07:39:50,638 --> 07:39:52,958
okay we've got a half one

11077
07:39:52,958 --> 07:39:55,520
and we're going to invert the zero by a

11078
07:39:55,520 --> 07:39:57,840
half that means that half of the zero

11079
07:39:57,840 --> 07:40:00,240
becomes a one so we get the half zero

11080
07:40:00,240 --> 07:40:02,718
half one state again okay don't worry

11081
07:40:02,718 --> 07:40:04,160
too much if that was

11082
07:40:04,160 --> 07:40:06,638
a bit hard to grasp i'm just getting

11083
07:40:06,638 --> 07:40:08,080
across the point they can be between

11084
07:40:08,080 --> 07:40:10,638
zero and one and now the operations work

11085
07:40:10,638 --> 07:40:12,398
with the combinations of zero and one

11086
07:40:12,398 --> 07:40:14,000
that we've got

11087
07:40:14,000 --> 07:40:15,920
now comes

11088
07:40:15,920 --> 07:40:17,600
the

11089
07:40:17,600 --> 07:40:19,440
more conceptually difficult and

11090
07:40:19,440 --> 07:40:21,760
confusing part of quantum physics that

11091
07:40:21,760 --> 07:40:24,000
even professional physicists don't have

11092
07:40:24,000 --> 07:40:26,878
a great understanding of yet we know how

11093
07:40:26,878 --> 07:40:28,398
to do the numbers but we don't really

11094
07:40:28,398 --> 07:40:30,558
know why it works the way

11095
07:40:30,558 --> 07:40:32,558
basically i've got a half zero and a

11096
07:40:32,558 --> 07:40:35,600
half one if i measure it i force it to

11097
07:40:35,600 --> 07:40:38,160
pick either zero or one well then half

11098
07:40:38,160 --> 07:40:39,760
of the time i get a zero half of the

11099
07:40:39,760 --> 07:40:41,920
time i get a one this means because i've

11100
07:40:41,920 --> 07:40:42,958
got two

11101
07:40:42,958 --> 07:40:44,958
coin tosses basically

11102
07:40:44,958 --> 07:40:47,120
a quarter of the time i get two zeros

11103
07:40:47,120 --> 07:40:49,040
quarter of the time i get two ones

11104
07:40:49,040 --> 07:40:50,718
quarter of the time i get a zero then a

11105
07:40:50,718 --> 07:40:52,478
one and a quarter of the time i get a

11106
07:40:52,478 --> 07:40:55,120
one then zero this is power quantum

11107
07:40:55,120 --> 07:40:56,958
computers do this you may have heard

11108
07:40:56,958 --> 07:40:59,760
this tagline all the possibilities at

11109
07:40:59,760 --> 07:41:02,160
once basically

11110
07:41:02,160 --> 07:41:04,478
they're a combination of zeros and ones

11111
07:41:04,478 --> 07:41:06,478
and you're going to measure them and

11112
07:41:06,478 --> 07:41:07,680
it's going to draw it from a

11113
07:41:07,680 --> 07:41:09,680
distribution right here's just an even

11114
07:41:09,680 --> 07:41:12,160
distribution of all of the numbers but

11115
07:41:12,160 --> 07:41:14,958
when we do fancy algorithms we'll have a

11116
07:41:14,958 --> 07:41:16,478
good shot at getting the value that we

11117
07:41:16,478 --> 07:41:18,798
really care about

11118
07:41:18,798 --> 07:41:20,718
there's also the slightly awkward point

11119
07:41:20,718 --> 07:41:22,958
that real quantum computers have an

11120
07:41:22,958 --> 07:41:25,280
error rate okay you're not always going

11121
07:41:25,280 --> 07:41:28,080
to get a perfect even distribution even

11122
07:41:28,080 --> 07:41:30,000
though mathematically you should because

11123
07:41:30,000 --> 07:41:32,320
real quantum computers

11124
07:41:32,320 --> 07:41:34,160
there's some interference going on maybe

11125
07:41:34,160 --> 07:41:36,798
the qubit didn't get rotated quite all

11126
07:41:36,798 --> 07:41:38,798
the way over some other interference

11127
07:41:38,798 --> 07:41:40,638
happening so you don't get the exact

11128
07:41:40,638 --> 07:41:42,160
value that you want

11129
07:41:42,160 --> 07:41:43,760
so normally the way that we deal with

11130
07:41:43,760 --> 07:41:45,680
this we just run the computer a bunch of

11131
07:41:45,680 --> 07:41:48,558
times take the average result um

11132
07:41:48,558 --> 07:41:51,040
obviously you know it's very unlikely

11133
07:41:51,040 --> 07:41:52,478
that you'll get

11134
07:41:52,478 --> 07:41:55,440
10 tails in a row if the queen is there

11135
07:41:55,440 --> 07:41:57,120
but you might get two or three in a row

11136
07:41:57,120 --> 07:41:58,638
so you do it a bunch of times take the

11137
07:41:58,638 --> 07:42:00,398
apples

11138
07:42:00,398 --> 07:42:03,200
okay so i'm going to very quickly talk

11139
07:42:03,200 --> 07:42:05,280
about how one of the most famous

11140
07:42:05,280 --> 07:42:09,040
algorithms quantum computing works um

11141
07:42:09,040 --> 07:42:10,878
you can think of these two cubits as

11142
07:42:10,878 --> 07:42:12,638
representing the numbers zero to three

11143
07:42:12,638 --> 07:42:15,200
right just like in binary zero one two

11144
07:42:15,200 --> 07:42:18,478
3. if i had 3 qubits i could represent 0

11145
07:42:18,478 --> 07:42:19,680
to 7.

11146
07:42:19,680 --> 07:42:22,478
what these quantum operations let us do

11147
07:42:22,478 --> 07:42:25,840
is apply some kind of function to all of

11148
07:42:25,840 --> 07:42:28,240
these numbers in a single step

11149
07:42:28,240 --> 07:42:31,120
so here's a small piece of how shaw's

11150
07:42:31,120 --> 07:42:33,120
algorithm works we do what's called

11151
07:42:33,120 --> 07:42:35,680
modular exponentiation three to the

11152
07:42:35,680 --> 07:42:37,200
power of zero

11153
07:42:37,200 --> 07:42:38,638
is one

11154
07:42:38,638 --> 07:42:41,120
okay so um here's a one

11155
07:42:41,120 --> 07:42:42,798
one to the power three to the power of

11156
07:42:42,798 --> 07:42:45,200
one is three so here's the three

11157
07:42:45,200 --> 07:42:47,680
three uh three to the power of two

11158
07:42:47,680 --> 07:42:49,920
is nine if i take the remainder of

11159
07:42:49,920 --> 07:42:52,240
another four i get one right divide by

11160
07:42:52,240 --> 07:42:55,280
four remainder one and same here this is

11161
07:42:55,280 --> 07:42:57,760
how shaw's algorithm works to

11162
07:42:57,760 --> 07:42:59,040
calculate

11163
07:42:59,040 --> 07:43:01,200
modular inverse exponentials which

11164
07:43:01,200 --> 07:43:03,760
breaks rsa okay the basic idea you're

11165
07:43:03,760 --> 07:43:06,080
applying this exponentiation and then if

11166
07:43:06,080 --> 07:43:07,760
you know what a fourier transform is

11167
07:43:07,760 --> 07:43:09,040
we're going to figure out the period of

11168
07:43:09,040 --> 07:43:12,160
the exponentiation and then we break rsa

11169
07:43:12,160 --> 07:43:13,120
um

11170
07:43:13,120 --> 07:43:14,718
cannot go through this unfortunately

11171
07:43:14,718 --> 07:43:16,798
without it becoming a math talk so

11172
07:43:16,798 --> 07:43:18,718
this is just the idea behind shaw's

11173
07:43:18,718 --> 07:43:19,760
algorithm

11174
07:43:19,760 --> 07:43:21,600
right if you're really interested in

11175
07:43:21,600 --> 07:43:22,878
getting stuck into this as a great

11176
07:43:22,878 --> 07:43:24,878
textbook quantum computation and quantum

11177
07:43:24,878 --> 07:43:27,280
information highly recommend it um you

11178
07:43:27,280 --> 07:43:29,840
do need some math background i'm afraid

11179
07:43:29,840 --> 07:43:32,320
okay so let's revisit our church during

11180
07:43:32,320 --> 07:43:35,920
thesis what can quantum computers do

11181
07:43:35,920 --> 07:43:37,520
maybe they can do something that a

11182
07:43:37,520 --> 07:43:41,040
classical computer can't so the quantum

11183
07:43:41,040 --> 07:43:43,520
church touring thesis says okay well

11184
07:43:43,520 --> 07:43:45,360
now we can do things efficiently with a

11185
07:43:45,360 --> 07:43:47,620
quantum hearing

11186
07:43:47,620 --> 07:43:49,120
[Music]

11187
07:43:49,120 --> 07:43:51,040
an interesting result is we actually

11188
07:43:51,040 --> 07:43:53,520
think classical computers can do

11189
07:43:53,520 --> 07:43:55,600
everything quantum computers can do you

11190
07:43:55,600 --> 07:43:58,160
can always simulate quantum right

11191
07:43:58,160 --> 07:43:59,680
pretend you've got a quantum computer

11192
07:43:59,680 --> 07:44:01,360
just like how you play old super

11193
07:44:01,360 --> 07:44:04,080
nintendo games on an emulator right

11194
07:44:04,080 --> 07:44:06,638
quantum computers are way more efficient

11195
07:44:06,638 --> 07:44:09,840
at some problems in classical computers

11196
07:44:09,840 --> 07:44:12,320
some problems they can't do everything

11197
07:44:12,320 --> 07:44:16,080
faster just certain kinds of things

11198
07:44:16,080 --> 07:44:17,440
so here are some things that quantum

11199
07:44:17,440 --> 07:44:19,440
computers are good at and i'm finally

11200
07:44:19,440 --> 07:44:21,040
answering the title of the talk what

11201
07:44:21,040 --> 07:44:23,760
does a quantum computer go for okay got

11202
07:44:23,760 --> 07:44:25,680
an integer factorization okay i've got

11203
07:44:25,680 --> 07:44:28,558
two i've got a really big number and it

11204
07:44:28,558 --> 07:44:30,958
has two prime factors two big numbers

11205
07:44:30,958 --> 07:44:32,958
that divided i have to figure out what

11206
07:44:32,958 --> 07:44:35,440
those numbers are this is really hard

11207
07:44:35,440 --> 07:44:37,920
classically it takes um

11208
07:44:37,920 --> 07:44:39,440
i think that the world record is

11209
07:44:39,440 --> 07:44:42,958
something like 700 bit numbers um those

11210
07:44:42,958 --> 07:44:45,760
rsa uses 2 000 or more bits

11211
07:44:45,760 --> 07:44:48,718
if you have a big quantum computer well

11212
07:44:48,718 --> 07:44:50,398
that's it it can easily

11213
07:44:50,398 --> 07:44:53,200
compute um these factorizations and

11214
07:44:53,200 --> 07:44:55,200
completely break rsa

11215
07:44:55,200 --> 07:44:57,200
the rsa signature algorithm

11216
07:44:57,200 --> 07:44:59,200
what else is it good at well it's good

11217
07:44:59,200 --> 07:45:02,320
at discrete logarithms so ecdh which is

11218
07:45:02,320 --> 07:45:04,878
a protocol that you use with tls to

11219
07:45:04,878 --> 07:45:07,200
agree when you when you go on https you

11220
07:45:07,200 --> 07:45:09,200
log into a website you're agreeing on a

11221
07:45:09,200 --> 07:45:11,440
key you're probably using ecdh to do

11222
07:45:11,440 --> 07:45:12,398
this

11223
07:45:12,398 --> 07:45:14,000
computers can completely break this as

11224
07:45:14,000 --> 07:45:14,798
well

11225
07:45:14,798 --> 07:45:17,280
also ecdsa this is another type of

11226
07:45:17,280 --> 07:45:19,040
signature algorithm where the

11227
07:45:19,040 --> 07:45:20,798
certificates that you get from websites

11228
07:45:20,798 --> 07:45:23,280
are often signed using ecdsa

11229
07:45:23,280 --> 07:45:25,920
quantum computers can break that as well

11230
07:45:25,920 --> 07:45:28,478
so in other words tls and https

11231
07:45:28,478 --> 07:45:30,878
completely busted with a large quantum

11232
07:45:30,878 --> 07:45:33,280
computer completely breaks um the way

11233
07:45:33,280 --> 07:45:35,360
that it currently works no hope

11234
07:45:35,360 --> 07:45:36,958
whatsoever there

11235
07:45:36,958 --> 07:45:39,840
there's also grover search which is a

11236
07:45:39,840 --> 07:45:41,440
way to

11237
07:45:41,440 --> 07:45:43,680
speed up guessing um

11238
07:45:43,680 --> 07:45:45,760
symmetric keys so you've got your cipher

11239
07:45:45,760 --> 07:45:47,200
you've logged into your website you've

11240
07:45:47,200 --> 07:45:49,440
got an agree symmetric key with your

11241
07:45:49,440 --> 07:45:52,320
https handshake

11242
07:45:52,320 --> 07:45:54,240
and now if your key is not big enough on

11243
07:45:54,240 --> 07:45:56,478
a computer can break that too the good

11244
07:45:56,478 --> 07:45:59,760
news is there's as256 which uses a

11245
07:45:59,760 --> 07:46:02,240
longer key that is still safe even with

11246
07:46:02,240 --> 07:46:04,080
a quantum computer so this is not really

11247
07:46:04,080 --> 07:46:05,440
the end of the world

11248
07:46:05,440 --> 07:46:06,638
okay so quantum computers are great at

11249
07:46:06,638 --> 07:46:09,120
breaking cryptography fantastic

11250
07:46:09,120 --> 07:46:11,600
i did say large quantum computers so if

11251
07:46:11,600 --> 07:46:14,478
you want to break rsa you need thousands

11252
07:46:14,478 --> 07:46:17,360
of qubits that have no errors in them at

11253
07:46:17,360 --> 07:46:18,958
all you know i said quantum computers

11254
07:46:18,958 --> 07:46:20,718
real quantum computers have errors you

11255
07:46:20,718 --> 07:46:22,878
need thousands of the things

11256
07:46:22,878 --> 07:46:25,280
um and they have to have no errors

11257
07:46:25,280 --> 07:46:26,000
the

11258
07:46:26,000 --> 07:46:29,200
good question mark news is if you have

11259
07:46:29,200 --> 07:46:31,600
noisy cubits ones that do have errors

11260
07:46:31,600 --> 07:46:34,160
you can actually emulate error-free

11261
07:46:34,160 --> 07:46:35,520
cubits you have something called an

11262
07:46:35,520 --> 07:46:37,360
error correcting code

11263
07:46:37,360 --> 07:46:39,840
uh you need at least five

11264
07:46:39,840 --> 07:46:42,398
noisy physical cubits per

11265
07:46:42,398 --> 07:46:45,040
perfect logical qubit that you want

11266
07:46:45,040 --> 07:46:47,440
and the error rate can be at most one to

11267
07:46:47,440 --> 07:46:49,600
three percent right your real noisy

11268
07:46:49,600 --> 07:46:51,440
qubits can't have more than a one to

11269
07:46:51,440 --> 07:46:53,280
three percent error rate

11270
07:46:53,280 --> 07:46:56,320
nobody has done this yet okay it has not

11271
07:46:56,320 --> 07:46:58,160
been done we have not got physical

11272
07:46:58,160 --> 07:47:00,240
qubits that are anywhere near this good

11273
07:47:00,240 --> 07:47:02,718
okay so we don't need to panic

11274
07:47:02,718 --> 07:47:05,600
the biggest quantum computer that i

11275
07:47:05,600 --> 07:47:07,360
i'm pretty sure actually exists as

11276
07:47:07,360 --> 07:47:09,520
opposed to marketing spin it was built

11277
07:47:09,520 --> 07:47:13,600
by ibm last late last year it has 127

11278
07:47:13,600 --> 07:47:16,558
physical qubits that's like maybe 20

11279
07:47:16,558 --> 07:47:19,520
logical cubits nowhere near enough to

11280
07:47:19,520 --> 07:47:20,958
break rsa

11281
07:47:20,958 --> 07:47:23,360
okay your rsa keys are still safe right

11282
07:47:23,360 --> 07:47:24,878
now nothing

11283
07:47:24,878 --> 07:47:27,440
no panic all right we're all chill here

11284
07:47:27,440 --> 07:47:28,878
right what are other things quantum

11285
07:47:28,878 --> 07:47:30,240
computers are good at if that is good at

11286
07:47:30,240 --> 07:47:32,320
breaking cryptography this would be kind

11287
07:47:32,320 --> 07:47:35,280
of boring right oh okay they can sample

11288
07:47:35,280 --> 07:47:37,440
from fancy distributions like a bell

11289
07:47:37,440 --> 07:47:40,398
curve in a thousand dimensions okay they

11290
07:47:40,398 --> 07:47:42,160
can do that really efficiently classical

11291
07:47:42,160 --> 07:47:44,320
computers can't do that this is useful

11292
07:47:44,320 --> 07:47:46,958
in some uh like quantitative analysis

11293
07:47:46,958 --> 07:47:49,440
financial market kind of

11294
07:47:49,440 --> 07:47:51,840
they can also do in a related manner

11295
07:47:51,840 --> 07:47:53,840
they can do some kinds of machine

11296
07:47:53,840 --> 07:47:55,600
learning much more efficiently than

11297
07:47:55,600 --> 07:47:58,638
classical computers again if they exist

11298
07:47:58,638 --> 07:48:00,240
which they don't get

11299
07:48:00,240 --> 07:48:01,600
um they're also really good at

11300
07:48:01,600 --> 07:48:04,160
optimization problems um so the

11301
07:48:04,160 --> 07:48:05,600
travelling sales and problems are

11302
07:48:05,600 --> 07:48:07,600
classic we've got a bunch of cities what

11303
07:48:07,600 --> 07:48:09,600
is the most efficient way to visit every

11304
07:48:09,600 --> 07:48:11,760
city once um given that there's

11305
07:48:11,760 --> 07:48:13,600
different roads between them it's a

11306
07:48:13,600 --> 07:48:15,440
classic problem that computer scientists

11307
07:48:15,440 --> 07:48:16,240
love

11308
07:48:16,240 --> 07:48:18,398
a certain kind of quantum computer can

11309
07:48:18,398 --> 07:48:20,478
solve these problems super efficiently

11310
07:48:20,478 --> 07:48:23,680
as well this can be useful in in some

11311
07:48:23,680 --> 07:48:26,398
business context um logistics uh

11312
07:48:26,398 --> 07:48:28,798
scheduling these kinds of things uh

11313
07:48:28,798 --> 07:48:30,478
there is there are problems that class

11314
07:48:30,478 --> 07:48:32,478
computers are just too slow to figure

11315
07:48:32,478 --> 07:48:35,600
out so we have to estimate solutions

11316
07:48:35,600 --> 07:48:38,160
quantum computers once they exist if

11317
07:48:38,160 --> 07:48:39,360
they exist

11318
07:48:39,360 --> 07:48:41,840
we do these a lot faster in a different

11319
07:48:41,840 --> 07:48:43,840
way that i don't have time to get to

11320
07:48:43,840 --> 07:48:46,320
called an adiabatic

11321
07:48:46,320 --> 07:48:48,958
quantum annealing is the d-wave

11322
07:48:48,958 --> 07:48:51,520
marketing terminology uh it's very

11323
07:48:51,520 --> 07:48:52,878
promising but yeah it's super

11324
07:48:52,878 --> 07:48:54,240
experimental

11325
07:48:54,240 --> 07:48:55,280
all right

11326
07:48:55,280 --> 07:48:57,840
now let's get into post quantum crypto

11327
07:48:57,840 --> 07:48:59,760
very exciting you might have heard of

11328
07:48:59,760 --> 07:49:02,478
this okay post quantum crypto does not

11329
07:49:02,478 --> 07:49:05,120
use quantum computers uses a classical

11330
07:49:05,120 --> 07:49:07,520
computer to do crypto that quantum

11331
07:49:07,520 --> 07:49:10,558
computers can't break okay first quantum

11332
07:49:10,558 --> 07:49:13,360
crypto just means it's still safe even

11333
07:49:13,360 --> 07:49:15,360
when quantum computers exist does not

11334
07:49:15,360 --> 07:49:17,920
mean it uses a quantum computer really

11335
07:49:17,920 --> 07:49:19,840
want to stress that

11336
07:49:19,840 --> 07:49:21,760
okay so we've got replacements all these

11337
07:49:21,760 --> 07:49:23,120
things i said quantum computers could

11338
07:49:23,120 --> 07:49:24,958
break rsa ect

11339
07:49:24,958 --> 07:49:28,000
ecdsa cdh all of this stuff that large

11340
07:49:28,000 --> 07:49:29,920
quantum computers could break we've got

11341
07:49:29,920 --> 07:49:33,520
replacements good news um that nist in

11342
07:49:33,520 --> 07:49:35,520
the us is running a competition to

11343
07:49:35,520 --> 07:49:38,478
decide on the new standard protocols uh

11344
07:49:38,478 --> 07:49:40,398
it's not done yet but we've got a few

11345
07:49:40,398 --> 07:49:43,840
candidates that we are pretty sure are

11346
07:49:43,840 --> 07:49:45,760
still safe even if quantum computers

11347
07:49:45,760 --> 07:49:48,398
become real so we don't have to panic

11348
07:49:48,398 --> 07:49:51,520
i am 100 sure that a real world

11349
07:49:51,520 --> 07:49:53,600
deployment will exist that you can just

11350
07:49:53,600 --> 07:49:56,240
plug in and use before any large quantum

11351
07:49:56,240 --> 07:49:58,798
computer exist

11352
07:49:59,040 --> 07:50:00,558
feel free to make fun of me for the rest

11353
07:50:00,558 --> 07:50:01,920
of eternity

11354
07:50:01,920 --> 07:50:04,080
all right now we get into quantum

11355
07:50:04,080 --> 07:50:06,638
cryptography crypto that does use

11356
07:50:06,638 --> 07:50:09,040
quantum computers this is super

11357
07:50:09,040 --> 07:50:11,280
speculative it's all research none of

11358
07:50:11,280 --> 07:50:13,760
this is really practical yet

11359
07:50:13,760 --> 07:50:15,120
one of the problems we're going to have

11360
07:50:15,120 --> 07:50:17,840
to transmit these qubits these electrons

11361
07:50:17,840 --> 07:50:19,680
that are one and zero and maybe a bit of

11362
07:50:19,680 --> 07:50:20,878
both and pointing in different

11363
07:50:20,878 --> 07:50:23,120
directions we have to transmit these

11364
07:50:23,120 --> 07:50:24,958
from point a to point b

11365
07:50:24,958 --> 07:50:27,440
without breaking them without

11366
07:50:27,440 --> 07:50:29,680
accidentally forcing them to be zero or

11367
07:50:29,680 --> 07:50:32,958
one this is a really hard problem and we

11368
07:50:32,958 --> 07:50:34,638
don't have a large scale solution

11369
07:50:34,638 --> 07:50:37,120
there's no internet for qubits okay this

11370
07:50:37,120 --> 07:50:39,600
is one practical problem uh that means

11371
07:50:39,600 --> 07:50:41,680
it's still a research thing

11372
07:50:41,680 --> 07:50:43,600
um my summary

11373
07:50:43,600 --> 07:50:45,840
very cool stuff should be ignored in

11374
07:50:45,840 --> 07:50:48,160
practice for now this is this is the

11375
07:50:48,160 --> 07:50:51,040
realm of research okay

11376
07:50:51,040 --> 07:50:52,558
so there are some things that quantum

11377
07:50:52,558 --> 07:50:54,878
computers are not very good at okay

11378
07:50:54,878 --> 07:50:57,120
quantum key distribution there's a few

11379
07:50:57,120 --> 07:50:59,520
companies offering this right now

11380
07:50:59,520 --> 07:51:01,680
um

11381
07:51:01,680 --> 07:51:04,718
it's complete garbage okay

11382
07:51:04,718 --> 07:51:07,440
you can have so-called perfect security

11383
07:51:07,440 --> 07:51:10,080
key distribution right get two computers

11384
07:51:10,080 --> 07:51:12,558
to agree like on a key in such a way

11385
07:51:12,558 --> 07:51:14,798
that no one can spy on the key sounds

11386
07:51:14,798 --> 07:51:15,920
good right

11387
07:51:15,920 --> 07:51:18,558
the problem is the two computers already

11388
07:51:18,558 --> 07:51:20,878
need to be sure that they're talking to

11389
07:51:20,878 --> 07:51:22,878
each other they need to be sure that

11390
07:51:22,878 --> 07:51:24,638
they're really talking alice is really

11391
07:51:24,638 --> 07:51:26,558
talking to bob bob is really talking to

11392
07:51:26,558 --> 07:51:27,840
alice

11393
07:51:27,840 --> 07:51:31,120
which classical algorithms can also use

11394
07:51:31,120 --> 07:51:33,200
to do the same thing

11395
07:51:33,200 --> 07:51:34,160
okay

11396
07:51:34,160 --> 07:51:36,398
so there's a sort of a theoretical

11397
07:51:36,398 --> 07:51:38,638
benefit to quantum key distribution

11398
07:51:38,638 --> 07:51:41,520
absolutely no practical benefit um as

11399
07:51:41,520 --> 07:51:43,840
far as current research suggests right

11400
07:51:43,840 --> 07:51:46,160
um so yeah you can do it it doesn't

11401
07:51:46,160 --> 07:51:48,320
really do anything useful they're also

11402
07:51:48,320 --> 07:51:50,798
bad at normal computer stuff okay uh

11403
07:51:50,798 --> 07:51:52,478
quantum computers are not very good at

11404
07:51:52,478 --> 07:51:55,840
rendering uh 3d models or

11405
07:51:55,840 --> 07:51:58,320
drawing pew-pew maps or

11406
07:51:58,320 --> 07:52:00,080
adding for viruses they're not very good

11407
07:52:00,080 --> 07:52:02,878
at that the quantum computers will not

11408
07:52:02,878 --> 07:52:05,200
cannot replace classical computers they

11409
07:52:05,200 --> 07:52:07,760
work together kind of like a gpu and

11410
07:52:07,760 --> 07:52:10,638
your cpu work together to solve problems

11411
07:52:10,638 --> 07:52:12,240
they won't replace classical reviews

11412
07:52:12,240 --> 07:52:13,760
cannot happen

11413
07:52:13,760 --> 07:52:15,760
all right and now we get to the fun

11414
07:52:15,760 --> 07:52:18,798
bonus slides um i went around and looked

11415
07:52:18,798 --> 07:52:21,200
at some quantum computing startups and

11416
07:52:21,200 --> 07:52:24,080
um there sure is a lot of stakeholders

11417
07:52:24,080 --> 07:52:25,680
so i call this section whatever the hell

11418
07:52:25,680 --> 07:52:29,040
this is supposed to be uh qr crypto sa

11419
07:52:29,040 --> 07:52:30,558
dot ch

11420
07:52:30,558 --> 07:52:33,440
full range protection from 2g to

11421
07:52:33,440 --> 07:52:36,440
60 whatever 6g is um

11422
07:52:36,440 --> 07:52:37,680
[Music]

11423
07:52:37,680 --> 07:52:40,160
security concern if x plus y greater

11424
07:52:40,160 --> 07:52:42,638
than z i like that they've got sort of a

11425
07:52:42,638 --> 07:52:45,520
copyright equation here it's x plus y

11426
07:52:45,520 --> 07:52:47,760
greater than zero this is not rocket

11427
07:52:47,760 --> 07:52:49,840
science i've also for some reason

11428
07:52:49,840 --> 07:52:53,440
talking about uh des which is a cipher

11429
07:52:53,440 --> 07:52:57,120
that was broken in 1999 when i was two

11430
07:52:57,120 --> 07:52:58,718
years old i don't know why they're

11431
07:52:58,718 --> 07:53:00,718
talking about this yeah

11432
07:53:00,718 --> 07:53:03,920
uh now i've got singularity sdk docker

11433
07:53:03,920 --> 07:53:06,240
slash deployable and we have this lovely

11434
07:53:06,240 --> 07:53:08,878
diagram it's some kind of cloud services

11435
07:53:08,878 --> 07:53:10,798
thing and they're saying look you can

11436
07:53:10,798 --> 07:53:13,200
encrypted anonymized talk to quantum

11437
07:53:13,200 --> 07:53:15,600
computers the thing that doesn't exist

11438
07:53:15,600 --> 07:53:16,478
yet

11439
07:53:16,478 --> 07:53:18,478
don't know what's up with that

11440
07:53:18,478 --> 07:53:19,280
um

11441
07:53:19,280 --> 07:53:21,600
the world's first commercially available

11442
07:53:21,600 --> 07:53:24,718
cryptographic degeneration platform what

11443
07:53:24,718 --> 07:53:26,958
you mean like https

11444
07:53:26,958 --> 07:53:28,878
whenever i connect to my bank we

11445
07:53:28,878 --> 07:53:31,200
generate a key between each other for

11446
07:53:31,200 --> 07:53:33,600
the purpose of commerce um don't know

11447
07:53:33,600 --> 07:53:34,638
about this

11448
07:53:34,638 --> 07:53:37,120
also if i take it really literally it's

11449
07:53:37,120 --> 07:53:39,760
almost like i'm buying a key uh no

11450
07:53:39,760 --> 07:53:41,280
thanks i want to generate that key

11451
07:53:41,280 --> 07:53:42,958
myself i don't want anyone else to have

11452
07:53:42,958 --> 07:53:45,280
it so not really

11453
07:53:45,280 --> 07:53:47,440
stuffed about this idea

11454
07:53:47,440 --> 07:53:49,920
now we have some blockchain crap um i

11455
07:53:49,920 --> 07:53:51,600
will go out and say that i don't think

11456
07:53:51,600 --> 07:53:53,680
blockchains are completely useless in

11457
07:53:53,680 --> 07:53:55,920
theory i think there's some interesting

11458
07:53:55,920 --> 07:53:58,160
research to do but this sure is a bunch

11459
07:53:58,160 --> 07:54:00,718
of not absolute nonsense quantum

11460
07:54:00,718 --> 07:54:02,478
encrypted blockchain that's that's not a

11461
07:54:02,478 --> 07:54:03,280
thing

11462
07:54:03,280 --> 07:54:04,478
sort of thing

11463
07:54:04,478 --> 07:54:06,958
bisect foresees a future where i ai

11464
07:54:06,958 --> 07:54:09,280
technology serves humanity and does not

11465
07:54:09,280 --> 07:54:11,600
endanger it um i don't know what this

11466
07:54:11,600 --> 07:54:13,520
has to do with blockchains it seems like

11467
07:54:13,520 --> 07:54:16,320
a total non-sequitur i didn't patch this

11468
07:54:16,320 --> 07:54:18,320
together this is one screenshot from one

11469
07:54:18,320 --> 07:54:20,000
section of the word

11470
07:54:20,000 --> 07:54:22,080
i just don't know what's going on here

11471
07:54:22,080 --> 07:54:25,200
um we believe that using qkd for

11472
07:54:25,200 --> 07:54:27,120
blockchain we can create highest

11473
07:54:27,120 --> 07:54:29,840
possible security so-called information

11474
07:54:29,840 --> 07:54:31,680
theoretic security

11475
07:54:31,680 --> 07:54:33,360
not how it works you still need an

11476
07:54:33,360 --> 07:54:34,958
authenticated channel

11477
07:54:34,958 --> 07:54:36,958
but it's not going to be information

11478
07:54:36,958 --> 07:54:40,398
theoretics sure it's not how it works

11479
07:54:40,398 --> 07:54:41,280
all right

11480
07:54:41,280 --> 07:54:43,760
so let's let's sum up what do you need

11481
07:54:43,760 --> 07:54:48,320
to know you cyber security specialist um

11482
07:54:48,320 --> 07:54:50,320
doing whatever it is that you guys do

11483
07:54:50,320 --> 07:54:52,160
i'm sorry and i'm an academic i've never

11484
07:54:52,160 --> 07:54:54,718
worked it's a cyber security that's on

11485
07:54:54,718 --> 07:54:55,600
guy

11486
07:54:55,600 --> 07:54:57,600
um number one don't buy anything that

11487
07:54:57,600 --> 07:54:58,958
says it uses quantum computing there's

11488
07:54:58,958 --> 07:55:01,280
no such thing it doesn't exist not yet

11489
07:55:01,280 --> 07:55:03,760
okay don't don't buy it

11490
07:55:03,760 --> 07:55:06,958
quantum crypto is not quantum computing

11491
07:55:06,958 --> 07:55:08,080
but you do

11492
07:55:08,080 --> 07:55:10,878
i strongly recommend have a plan to

11493
07:55:10,878 --> 07:55:13,360
migrate to post quantum crypto when it's

11494
07:55:13,360 --> 07:55:16,000
available okay have a plan with your uh

11495
07:55:16,000 --> 07:55:19,760
tls tickets your ssh um all that kind of

11496
07:55:19,760 --> 07:55:22,240
stuff have a plan to change the key

11497
07:55:22,240 --> 07:55:24,160
schemes once these things are

11498
07:55:24,160 --> 07:55:26,000
practically available

11499
07:55:26,000 --> 07:55:28,398
they'll probably be integrated into

11500
07:55:28,398 --> 07:55:30,878
future versions of pls for your web

11501
07:55:30,878 --> 07:55:32,878
servers for your essence all this stuff

11502
07:55:32,878 --> 07:55:35,120
this will come out at some point okay

11503
07:55:35,120 --> 07:55:37,520
it's maybe not deflated yet it will come

11504
07:55:37,520 --> 07:55:40,160
out don't panic it's not the end of the

11505
07:55:40,160 --> 07:55:43,200
world yeah i say keys are safe okay but

11506
07:55:43,200 --> 07:55:45,600
yeah definitely have a plan to migrate

11507
07:55:45,600 --> 07:55:46,478
okay

11508
07:55:46,478 --> 07:55:48,958
that's that's my takeaway for you all

11509
07:55:48,958 --> 07:55:51,120
um also yesterday i can't put this in

11510
07:55:51,120 --> 07:55:52,638
the slides very nicely because it just

11511
07:55:52,638 --> 07:55:54,718
came out yesterday the latest version of

11512
07:55:54,718 --> 07:55:58,000
open ssh uses post quantum crypto by

11513
07:55:58,000 --> 07:56:00,240
default okay so

11514
07:56:00,240 --> 07:56:02,398
this ecdh key exchange when you're

11515
07:56:02,398 --> 07:56:04,080
connecting to ssh you're trying to get a

11516
07:56:04,080 --> 07:56:06,558
secret key between you and your ssh

11517
07:56:06,558 --> 07:56:10,718
server they now use our at this scheme

11518
07:56:10,718 --> 07:56:13,920
rewind mtr review prime plus x2519k

11519
07:56:13,920 --> 07:56:15,680
exchange method they use these by

11520
07:56:15,680 --> 07:56:18,558
default that's pretty cool um i haven't

11521
07:56:18,558 --> 07:56:21,200
looked into it in detail but um it seems

11522
07:56:21,200 --> 07:56:24,718
good the idea of the hybrid exchange is

11523
07:56:24,718 --> 07:56:25,680
okay

11524
07:56:25,680 --> 07:56:27,760
we'll use the one that we know works

11525
07:56:27,760 --> 07:56:30,398
ccdh and we'll use the one that's first

11526
07:56:30,398 --> 07:56:33,040
quantum secure and then we'll stuff them

11527
07:56:33,040 --> 07:56:35,200
together that way as long as at least

11528
07:56:35,200 --> 07:56:37,200
one of the two is secure we're good

11529
07:56:37,200 --> 07:56:40,160
right so if there's a bug in nthru no

11530
07:56:40,160 --> 07:56:41,680
problem we still have this one which we

11531
07:56:41,680 --> 07:56:43,760
know is good if quantum computers come

11532
07:56:43,760 --> 07:56:45,680
out and break this one no problem we

11533
07:56:45,680 --> 07:56:48,080
have ntru so this is pretty cool and i

11534
07:56:48,080 --> 07:56:49,360
think we'll see

11535
07:56:49,360 --> 07:56:51,040
a lot more of this check come out in the

11536
07:56:51,040 --> 07:56:52,718
next few years so keep your eye on it

11537
07:56:52,718 --> 07:56:54,478
before the sort of person manages

11538
07:56:54,478 --> 07:56:56,718
servers keys all that kind of thing also

11539
07:56:56,718 --> 07:56:59,840
important key distribution is a scam um

11540
07:56:59,840 --> 07:57:01,200
that's it

11541
07:57:01,200 --> 07:57:04,240
okay thanks for watching everyone um

11542
07:57:04,240 --> 07:57:06,478
i hope you enjoyed that quick rip around

11543
07:57:06,478 --> 07:57:08,558
you've got any questions or anything um

11544
07:57:08,558 --> 07:57:11,200
what's up ian and shannon

11545
07:57:11,200 --> 07:57:12,798
uh there's definitely a lot of questions

11546
07:57:12,798 --> 07:57:14,398
however the most important one for me is

11547
07:57:14,398 --> 07:57:16,478
you're a crypto person what's the new

11548
07:57:16,478 --> 07:57:17,920
currency that you're really interested

11549
07:57:17,920 --> 07:57:19,040
in

11550
07:57:19,040 --> 07:57:20,000
um

11551
07:57:20,000 --> 07:57:22,160
i'm interested in

11552
07:57:22,160 --> 07:57:24,958
bitcoin it's a competitor to dirt point

11553
07:57:24,958 --> 07:57:27,350
and it's really fluffy

11554
07:57:27,350 --> 07:57:30,160
[Laughter]

11555
07:57:30,160 --> 07:57:32,240
that's where my money's on i have

11556
07:57:32,240 --> 07:57:34,558
multiple dogecoins here so

11557
07:57:34,558 --> 07:57:36,878
um look i think a lot of us were going

11558
07:57:36,878 --> 07:57:38,398
uh we don't know what's happening but it

11559
07:57:38,398 --> 07:57:41,040
was really good to hear from you um

11560
07:57:41,040 --> 07:57:43,520
no bs what to actually look for i know

11561
07:57:43,520 --> 07:57:46,080
i've been asked about the quantum thing

11562
07:57:46,080 --> 07:57:48,478
a lot and i have no idea i just make it

11563
07:57:48,478 --> 07:57:49,920
up

11564
07:57:49,920 --> 07:57:50,958
um

11565
07:57:50,958 --> 07:57:53,760
so there's a couple of questions um hang

11566
07:57:53,760 --> 07:57:55,040
on i'll pull one out just because we've

11567
07:57:55,040 --> 07:57:56,558
got a couple of minutes

11568
07:57:56,558 --> 07:57:57,440
yeah

11569
07:57:57,440 --> 07:57:59,040
that's what she said we haven't had one

11570
07:57:59,040 --> 07:58:01,600
of those today

11571
07:58:01,760 --> 07:58:04,240
how do solar flares and cosmic rays

11572
07:58:04,240 --> 07:58:06,638
affect quantum computers

11573
07:58:06,638 --> 07:58:09,040
yep um that's a good question i would i

11574
07:58:09,040 --> 07:58:10,478
don't know the answer off the top of my

11575
07:58:10,478 --> 07:58:12,558
head what i would expect

11576
07:58:12,558 --> 07:58:15,280
maybe they uh could collapse the

11577
07:58:15,280 --> 07:58:17,440
superposition right switch the electron

11578
07:58:17,440 --> 07:58:19,760
from a combo state to a single binary

11579
07:58:19,760 --> 07:58:22,080
state this is something error correction

11580
07:58:22,080 --> 07:58:24,638
can handle as long as it's a good enough

11581
07:58:24,638 --> 07:58:27,200
qubit so basically

11582
07:58:27,200 --> 07:58:28,478
maybe you've heard of error correcting

11583
07:58:28,478 --> 07:58:31,120
ram those solar arrays can flip bits in

11584
07:58:31,120 --> 07:58:32,958
your computer's memory

11585
07:58:32,958 --> 07:58:34,878
we have error correction methods to deal

11586
07:58:34,878 --> 07:58:36,320
with this same thing with quantum

11587
07:58:36,320 --> 07:58:39,120
computers i believe

11588
07:58:39,840 --> 07:58:41,920
no fantastic alan says he specifically

11589
07:58:41,920 --> 07:58:43,440
answers requested this talk and it

11590
07:58:43,440 --> 07:58:45,120
answered all of his questions so thank

11591
07:58:45,120 --> 07:58:46,398
you

11592
07:58:46,398 --> 07:58:47,920
so i think there's going to be a couple

11593
07:58:47,920 --> 07:58:49,200
of questions still in the chat but of

11594
07:58:49,200 --> 07:58:51,120
course you're very happy so check that

11595
07:58:51,120 --> 07:58:52,878
out 100

11596
07:58:52,878 --> 07:58:55,040
thank you very much you've given us lots

11597
07:58:55,040 --> 07:58:58,398
to think about awesome have a good one

11598
07:58:58,398 --> 07:59:00,320
yeah my brain is exploding

11599
07:59:00,320 --> 07:59:04,718
yeah my brain is explaining to um

11600
07:59:06,478 --> 07:59:08,320
um we're up to our last speaker of the

11601
07:59:08,320 --> 07:59:09,200
day

11602
07:59:09,200 --> 07:59:10,558
oh

11603
07:59:10,558 --> 07:59:12,718
it's been a long day but i i'm excited

11604
07:59:12,718 --> 07:59:15,840
for this one so i will invite jackie in

11605
07:59:15,840 --> 07:59:18,398
hello jackie how are you doing today

11606
07:59:18,398 --> 07:59:20,798
i'm very well thank you make sure i was

11607
07:59:20,798 --> 07:59:22,160
off mute

11608
07:59:22,160 --> 07:59:24,080
hoping someone's gonna get bingo has

11609
07:59:24,080 --> 07:59:26,000
anyone got bingo yet i don't think

11610
07:59:26,000 --> 07:59:27,360
anyone's got bingo but i think that's

11611
07:59:27,360 --> 07:59:30,160
because they forgot the bingo card um

11612
07:59:30,160 --> 07:59:32,558
we did have simon we did have simon

11613
07:59:32,558 --> 07:59:34,320
earlier just letting it rip with the

11614
07:59:34,320 --> 07:59:35,840
swear words

11615
07:59:35,840 --> 07:59:37,840
like apparently no one's heard him like

11616
07:59:37,840 --> 07:59:40,160
that before so you know i'm sure

11617
07:59:40,160 --> 07:59:42,160
somebody could have had bingo by now

11618
07:59:42,160 --> 07:59:44,320
yeah we've had like slides not going

11619
07:59:44,320 --> 07:59:45,680
we've had

11620
07:59:45,680 --> 07:59:48,240
people on mute we've had dogs in the

11621
07:59:48,240 --> 07:59:50,478
background we haven't had any kids this

11622
07:59:50,478 --> 07:59:51,520
time

11623
07:59:51,520 --> 07:59:53,280
no no we had kids in hilts but they

11624
07:59:53,280 --> 07:59:55,040
didn't like wander in they were actually

11625
07:59:55,040 --> 07:59:56,958
part of the presentation

11626
07:59:56,958 --> 07:59:58,958
yeah yeah no that's a bit different not

11627
07:59:58,958 --> 08:00:02,000
the kid wandering in and um

11628
08:00:02,000 --> 08:00:04,558
i i was at a virtual con

11629
08:00:04,558 --> 08:00:06,478
and the kid wandered in and said daddy i

11630
08:00:06,478 --> 08:00:09,120
just did a poo

11631
08:00:10,160 --> 08:00:11,840
thank you

11632
08:00:11,840 --> 08:00:13,600
did everyone clap because i would have

11633
08:00:13,600 --> 08:00:16,558
played this awesome it was really good

11634
08:00:16,558 --> 08:00:17,300
yeah i love that

11635
08:00:17,300 --> 08:00:19,840
[Laughter]

11636
08:00:19,840 --> 08:00:22,558
so uh jacqueline jane currently serves a

11637
08:00:22,558 --> 08:00:24,398
security awareness advocate for the apac

11638
08:00:24,398 --> 08:00:26,160
region of new before the provider of the

11639
08:00:26,160 --> 08:00:27,840
world's largest security awareness and

11640
08:00:27,840 --> 08:00:30,080
simulated vision platform she is well

11641
08:00:30,080 --> 08:00:32,000
known on linkedin and a whole bunch of

11642
08:00:32,000 --> 08:00:34,798
other places my linkedin feed is full of

11643
08:00:34,798 --> 08:00:36,878
stuff that comes up and involved in the

11644
08:00:36,878 --> 08:00:38,478
community as well so we're really happy

11645
08:00:38,478 --> 08:00:40,558
to have her here and today she's going

11646
08:00:40,558 --> 08:00:42,240
to be talking about how to create a

11647
08:00:42,240 --> 08:00:44,160
cyber security education and awareness

11648
08:00:44,160 --> 08:00:45,040
program

11649
08:00:45,040 --> 08:00:47,840
so i will add your slides

11650
08:00:47,840 --> 08:00:50,080
and hopefully it works and you are ready

11651
08:00:50,080 --> 08:00:51,600
to go

11652
08:00:51,600 --> 08:00:54,160
fabulous and what a day i hope your

11653
08:00:54,160 --> 08:00:57,760
brains are okay eleanor that was amazing

11654
08:00:57,760 --> 08:01:00,798
you'd explain that beautifully my brain

11655
08:01:00,798 --> 08:01:04,080
is sore i'll do my very best not to

11656
08:01:04,080 --> 08:01:07,120
lose it as i present however today we're

11657
08:01:07,120 --> 08:01:08,878
going to be talking about how to create

11658
08:01:08,878 --> 08:01:10,398
a cyber security

11659
08:01:10,398 --> 08:01:12,240
education and awareness program to

11660
08:01:12,240 --> 08:01:14,718
change behavior beau mentioned earlier

11661
08:01:14,718 --> 08:01:16,878
about the out-of-date type of training

11662
08:01:16,878 --> 08:01:18,320
and things like that that's happening

11663
08:01:18,320 --> 08:01:20,478
from a security awareness point of view

11664
08:01:20,478 --> 08:01:22,798
insider threats insider risks human

11665
08:01:22,798 --> 08:01:25,360
error has been mentioned a lot already

11666
08:01:25,360 --> 08:01:26,798
are not been mentioned again a lot

11667
08:01:26,798 --> 08:01:28,718
tomorrow and it's something we really

11668
08:01:28,718 --> 08:01:32,160
need to understand now um yes bit of

11669
08:01:32,160 --> 08:01:33,440
mention about know before we are the

11670
08:01:33,440 --> 08:01:35,440
world's largest integrated security lens

11671
08:01:35,440 --> 08:01:37,840
training and simulated phishing platform

11672
08:01:37,840 --> 08:01:39,360
we've got a head office in tampa bay

11673
08:01:39,360 --> 08:01:41,760
florida office in melbourne office in

11674
08:01:41,760 --> 08:01:44,478
singapore japan and all around the world

11675
08:01:44,478 --> 08:01:46,160
we do help tens of thousands of

11676
08:01:46,160 --> 08:01:48,558
organizations and this is important

11677
08:01:48,558 --> 08:01:50,878
manage the ongoing problem of social

11678
08:01:50,878 --> 08:01:53,600
engineering and we've won a heap of

11679
08:01:53,600 --> 08:01:56,080
awards which is very exciting something

11680
08:01:56,080 --> 08:01:59,280
i will say whether you are using any

11681
08:01:59,280 --> 08:02:00,718
platform right now for security

11682
08:02:00,718 --> 08:02:03,120
awareness training fabulous we're all

11683
08:02:03,120 --> 08:02:05,520
fighting the cyber criminal so this is

11684
08:02:05,520 --> 08:02:06,558
not about

11685
08:02:06,558 --> 08:02:09,360
platforms this is about that human

11686
08:02:09,360 --> 08:02:11,760
element of cyber security and education

11687
08:02:11,760 --> 08:02:14,080
and how you go about engaging people and

11688
08:02:14,080 --> 08:02:16,398
getting the right done okay let's

11689
08:02:16,398 --> 08:02:18,160
have a look at the threat landscape as

11690
08:02:18,160 --> 08:02:21,120
it stands right now now i suppose i

11691
08:02:21,120 --> 08:02:23,200
could talk for three days on the

11692
08:02:23,200 --> 08:02:25,200
statistics however these was kind of

11693
08:02:25,200 --> 08:02:27,760
important because cybercrime is up 600

11694
08:02:27,760 --> 08:02:30,160
percent just a bit since covet and it's

11695
08:02:30,160 --> 08:02:32,478
not necessarily because of covert covet

11696
08:02:32,478 --> 08:02:34,958
has definitely added a dimension to it

11697
08:02:34,958 --> 08:02:36,878
because of the opportunistic nature of

11698
08:02:36,878 --> 08:02:39,360
fear-mongering misinformation fake news

11699
08:02:39,360 --> 08:02:42,718
etc but it also we went to work remotely

11700
08:02:42,718 --> 08:02:45,040
so rework remote work has increased that

11701
08:02:45,040 --> 08:02:47,200
average cost of a data breach because

11702
08:02:47,200 --> 08:02:48,718
people are home and they're not

11703
08:02:48,718 --> 08:02:51,840
necessarily aware of what's happening so

11704
08:02:51,840 --> 08:02:53,280
those things have definitely made a

11705
08:02:53,280 --> 08:02:54,320
difference

11706
08:02:54,320 --> 08:02:56,878
in 2020 i think this is terrifying i

11707
08:02:56,878 --> 08:02:59,760
know it's more for stats from 2021

11708
08:02:59,760 --> 08:03:02,000
the average time to identify a breach

11709
08:03:02,000 --> 08:03:04,718
was 207 days now i'm sure there are

11710
08:03:04,718 --> 08:03:06,638
people watching right now who say

11711
08:03:06,638 --> 08:03:09,680
actually it's 300 or actually it's 800.

11712
08:03:09,680 --> 08:03:12,638
the average has increased dramatically

11713
08:03:12,638 --> 08:03:14,558
and it means that cyber criminals are

11714
08:03:14,558 --> 08:03:16,160
spending more time in our systems and

11715
08:03:16,160 --> 08:03:18,398
it's the way they get into our systems

11716
08:03:18,398 --> 08:03:20,958
that's so important now the majority of

11717
08:03:20,958 --> 08:03:23,040
cybersecurity breaches and successful

11718
08:03:23,040 --> 08:03:25,280
attacks are in fact the result of human

11719
08:03:25,280 --> 08:03:27,680
error multiple reports from multiple

11720
08:03:27,680 --> 08:03:29,600
different places will tell you it's

11721
08:03:29,600 --> 08:03:31,040
seven percent eighty percent ninety

11722
08:03:31,040 --> 08:03:34,000
percent ninety five percent the majority

11723
08:03:34,000 --> 08:03:35,840
is because of human error i'm going to

11724
08:03:35,840 --> 08:03:38,320
talk about more about that as well

11725
08:03:38,320 --> 08:03:40,798
and malicious email fishing i'm sure you

11726
08:03:40,798 --> 08:03:42,718
all know about fishing is the main way

11727
08:03:42,718 --> 08:03:44,478
they do this someone's engaging in a

11728
08:03:44,478 --> 08:03:46,478
malicious email that they really

11729
08:03:46,478 --> 08:03:48,160
shouldn't be and most of the time guys

11730
08:03:48,160 --> 08:03:50,558
this comes down to awareness people

11731
08:03:50,558 --> 08:03:52,958
don't know what to look for so we'll

11732
08:03:52,958 --> 08:03:54,638
look into that

11733
08:03:54,638 --> 08:03:56,878
firstly i always like to educate because

11734
08:03:56,878 --> 08:03:58,958
it could be one person here who may not

11735
08:03:58,958 --> 08:04:01,360
have heard of what i'm about to tell you

11736
08:04:01,360 --> 08:04:02,958
i'm sure you've heard of phishing this

11737
08:04:02,958 --> 08:04:05,920
is your malicious email sent in bulk by

11738
08:04:05,920 --> 08:04:08,080
cyber criminals to everywhere like a big

11739
08:04:08,080 --> 08:04:10,478
bucket of mud on a wall see what sticks

11740
08:04:10,478 --> 08:04:13,200
see who engages and opens up a malicious

11741
08:04:13,200 --> 08:04:15,600
attachment clicks on a link whatever it

11742
08:04:15,600 --> 08:04:17,840
might be to deploy malware go to a

11743
08:04:17,840 --> 08:04:19,920
website give away the keys to the

11744
08:04:19,920 --> 08:04:21,440
kingdom which is of course your login

11745
08:04:21,440 --> 08:04:24,080
details and these um

11746
08:04:24,080 --> 08:04:25,600
phishing emails have become very

11747
08:04:25,600 --> 08:04:27,920
sophisticated you can't spot them

11748
08:04:27,920 --> 08:04:30,000
anymore even the people with the cyber

11749
08:04:30,000 --> 08:04:32,478
brains can struggle to spot these

11750
08:04:32,478 --> 08:04:34,398
then we have spear fishing again you've

11751
08:04:34,398 --> 08:04:36,000
probably heard of this spear phishing is

11752
08:04:36,000 --> 08:04:37,440
a lot more

11753
08:04:37,440 --> 08:04:40,240
targeted as the name suggests and it's

11754
08:04:40,240 --> 08:04:42,398
about targeting an organization or an

11755
08:04:42,398 --> 08:04:44,240
individual in an organization same

11756
08:04:44,240 --> 08:04:46,638
approach but research takes place and

11757
08:04:46,638 --> 08:04:49,360
they're a lot more specific about the

11758
08:04:49,360 --> 08:04:51,920
outcome it could be a bec business email

11759
08:04:51,920 --> 08:04:54,240
compromise where communications taking

11760
08:04:54,240 --> 08:04:56,320
place money is about to change hands in

11761
08:04:56,320 --> 08:04:58,478
jump cyber criminal takes away the money

11762
08:04:58,478 --> 08:04:59,840
people don't know for a while and it

11763
08:04:59,840 --> 08:05:02,638
really is very frustrating we also have

11764
08:05:02,638 --> 08:05:04,638
and as you may be realizing this is the

11765
08:05:04,638 --> 08:05:08,478
ishing family i s h i n g i've called it

11766
08:05:08,478 --> 08:05:10,638
the ishing family because it really is

11767
08:05:10,638 --> 08:05:12,638
because fishing some people think it's

11768
08:05:12,638 --> 08:05:14,958
video phishing it's voice fishing so

11769
08:05:14,958 --> 08:05:16,478
you've probably heard of it either real

11770
08:05:16,478 --> 08:05:19,280
people on a call or that robot call from

11771
08:05:19,280 --> 08:05:21,840
the ato if you're based in australia

11772
08:05:21,840 --> 08:05:23,520
you've probably got this call where it

11773
08:05:23,520 --> 08:05:24,958
says you know this is the australian tax

11774
08:05:24,958 --> 08:05:27,040
department very convincing aussie voice

11775
08:05:27,040 --> 08:05:28,080
by the way

11776
08:05:28,080 --> 08:05:29,280
and it says you know you've not paid

11777
08:05:29,280 --> 08:05:30,878
your taxes we've got a warrant out for

11778
08:05:30,878 --> 08:05:32,558
your arrest press one to speak to our

11779

11781
08:05:36,160 --> 08:05:38,320
to the scammer and it proceeds this

11782
08:05:38,320 --> 08:05:41,120
happens every year it's been promoted as

11783
08:05:41,120 --> 08:05:43,520
in please don't do this don't engage and

11784
08:05:43,520 --> 08:05:46,160
australians are still losing millions of

11785
08:05:46,160 --> 08:05:49,280
dollars because of it why human error

11786
08:05:49,280 --> 08:05:51,600
again it's a theme you'll get used to it

11787
08:05:51,600 --> 08:05:53,600
the other thing we have is smishing and

11788
08:05:53,600 --> 08:05:56,398

08:06:08,320 --> 08:06:10,000
fascinating because of the human

11797

it says we've been capturing you off

response of oh my goodness what is that

11802
08:06:24,320 --> 08:06:27,440
then we have one of my favorites cushing

11803
08:06:27,440 --> 08:06:30,160
now this has become very very popular

11804
08:06:30,160 --> 08:06:32,240
because and it's a qr code version of

11805
08:06:32,240 --> 08:06:34,558
fishing been around for a while i'm sure

11806
08:06:34,558 --> 08:06:36,558
some of you might have heard of the the

11807
08:06:36,558 --> 08:06:38,638
qr code fishing that has taken place

11808
08:06:38,638 --> 08:06:40,958
over time however because of the super

11809
08:06:40,958 --> 08:06:43,280
bowl where coin based use a very

11810
08:06:43,280 --> 08:06:46,478
brilliant ad in my opinion where the qr

11811
08:06:46,478 --> 08:06:49,120
code was bouncing around the screen for

11812

60 seconds how many people clicked how

11813
08:06:51,600 --> 08:06:53,120

happening already it's going to hit

11824
08:07:15,120 --> 08:07:16,958
mainstream as one of those things and

11825
08:07:16,958 --> 08:07:19,040
cyber criminals being the opportunistic

11826
08:07:19,040 --> 08:07:21,040
creatures that they are will take

11827
08:07:21,040 --> 08:07:23,280
advantage of it so something to be aware

11828
08:07:23,280 --> 08:07:26,398
of why am i telling you this do you know

11829
08:07:26,398 --> 08:07:28,638
all about this probably you're in cyber

11830
08:07:28,638 --> 08:07:30,798
if you're not you need to know about it

11831
08:07:30,798 --> 08:07:32,478
do your friends do your family do your

11832
08:07:32,478 --> 08:07:34,240
co-workers know about it does the

11833
08:07:34,240 --> 08:07:36,160
c-suite do the executive team know about

11834
08:07:36,160 --> 08:07:38,160
it do your kids know about it they need

11835
08:07:38,160 --> 08:07:40,478
to so this is where the education comes

11836
08:07:40,478 --> 08:07:43,840
into play human error by the way cat

11837
08:07:43,840 --> 08:07:45,680
warning i've got two and this is

11838
08:07:45,680 --> 08:07:47,360
witching hour so there's every chance

11839
08:07:47,360 --> 08:07:49,280
however if you're lucky that is they're

11840
08:07:49,280 --> 08:07:51,120
pretty precious creatures

11841
08:07:51,120 --> 08:07:53,840
human error now this includes those

11842
08:07:53,840 --> 08:07:55,600
wonderful things that beau did bring up

11843
08:07:55,600 --> 08:07:57,440
before about that insider risk and

11844
08:07:57,440 --> 08:08:00,080
insider threat human error is not always

11845
08:08:00,080 --> 08:08:02,718
technical in nature there's a technical

11846
08:08:02,718 --> 08:08:05,120
and a non-technical element yes i'll

11847
08:08:05,120 --> 08:08:06,638
make the slides available of course this

11848
08:08:06,638 --> 08:08:08,558
is a very popular slide for some reason

11849
08:08:08,558 --> 08:08:11,120
actually i get it it it shows you that

11850
08:08:11,120 --> 08:08:14,320
human error is so complex it's not one

11851
08:08:14,320 --> 08:08:15,840
thing so there's all these different

11852
08:08:15,840 --> 08:08:18,080
elements we need to educate our people

11853
08:08:18,080 --> 08:08:20,558
on to understand it's not just where the

11854
08:08:20,558 --> 08:08:23,280
star is at the top the ishing family

11855
08:08:23,280 --> 08:08:26,160
that's very important because it covers

11856
08:08:26,160 --> 08:08:28,558
the main threat vector that cyber

11857
08:08:28,558 --> 08:08:30,080
criminals use because it's the path of

11858
08:08:30,080 --> 08:08:32,320
least resistance because people aren't

11859
08:08:32,320 --> 08:08:34,398
aware if you don't know about something

11860
08:08:34,398 --> 08:08:36,478
you don't know about it it's the aha

11861
08:08:36,478 --> 08:08:38,080
moment we get when people realize and

11862
08:08:38,080 --> 08:08:39,920
explain things like ellen lloyd just did

11863
08:08:39,920 --> 08:08:41,920
so beautifully it's like oh okay that's

11864
08:08:41,920 --> 08:08:43,360
how it works well

11865
08:08:43,360 --> 08:08:45,520
that's when you start to open yourself

11866
08:08:45,520 --> 08:08:47,520
up to the possibilities

11867
08:08:47,520 --> 08:08:49,120
so when we think about

11868
08:08:49,120 --> 08:08:51,600
human error this is the type of stuff we

11869
08:08:51,600 --> 08:08:54,000
need to be educating on

11870
08:08:54,000 --> 08:08:56,638
when it comes to the security stack that

11871
08:08:56,638 --> 08:08:59,040
we're probably familiar with that term

11872
08:08:59,040 --> 08:09:02,000
most customers that we find are building

11873
08:09:02,000 --> 08:09:04,160
four layers and of course there's layers

11874
08:09:04,160 --> 08:09:06,478
within layers we've got devices keeping

11875
08:09:06,478 --> 08:09:08,398
them safe we've got the network the

11876
08:09:08,398 --> 08:09:10,398
infrastructure and then there are the

11877
08:09:10,398 --> 08:09:11,440
people

11878
08:09:11,440 --> 08:09:13,840
now interestingly enough i was reading i

11879
08:09:13,840 --> 08:09:15,200
have to find the article because someone

11880
08:09:15,200 --> 08:09:16,718
might want to see it

11881
08:09:16,718 --> 08:09:18,478
there's an average spend of around three

11882
08:09:18,478 --> 08:09:20,320
to five percent of the cyber security

11883
08:09:20,320 --> 08:09:22,878
budget on the human factor

11884
08:09:22,878 --> 08:09:24,638
three to five percent

11885
08:09:24,638 --> 08:09:26,718
which means now just think for a moment

11886
08:09:26,718 --> 08:09:28,718
my friends if we're looking at

11887
08:09:28,718 --> 08:09:31,360
between 75 and 95

11888
08:09:31,360 --> 08:09:33,200
of successful security breaches in

11889
08:09:33,200 --> 08:09:34,958
organizations are the result of human

11890
08:09:34,958 --> 08:09:35,840
error

11891
08:09:35,840 --> 08:09:37,440
and only three to five percent is being

11892
08:09:37,440 --> 08:09:39,760
spent on that human error and educating

11893
08:09:39,760 --> 08:09:42,398
them it makes absolutely no sense it's

11894
08:09:42,398 --> 08:09:44,080
like saying we know they're breaking in

11895
08:09:44,080 --> 08:09:46,080
through the door we know they're coming

11896
08:09:46,080 --> 08:09:47,520
in the front door so

11897
08:09:47,520 --> 08:09:50,398
let's reinforce the windows

11898
08:09:50,398 --> 08:09:52,240
it makes no sense could be a joke there

11899
08:09:52,240 --> 08:09:54,240
with reinforcing windows however i

11900
08:09:54,240 --> 08:09:56,320
digress let's come back here

11901
08:09:56,320 --> 08:09:57,760
the human layer

11902
08:09:57,760 --> 08:10:00,478
is important we cannot look past it

11903
08:10:00,478 --> 08:10:02,320
anymore i'm very passionate about it as

11904
08:10:02,320 --> 08:10:03,840
you probably realize i get on the

11905
08:10:03,840 --> 08:10:05,920
soapbox because when it comes to

11906
08:10:05,920 --> 08:10:08,320
security i.t professionals they have

11907
08:10:08,320 --> 08:10:11,120
done a very good job at the other

11908
08:10:11,120 --> 08:10:12,320
elements

11909
08:10:12,320 --> 08:10:14,320
it's the people element that is so

11910
08:10:14,320 --> 08:10:16,398
important and even the brilliance

11911
08:10:16,398 --> 08:10:17,600
they've done

11912
08:10:17,600 --> 08:10:19,760
can't stop all of the emails that are

11913
08:10:19,760 --> 08:10:21,840
malicious the phishing emails getting

11914
08:10:21,840 --> 08:10:24,718
through to the inboxes of the end user

11915
08:10:24,718 --> 08:10:26,638
could be five percent of them

11916
08:10:26,638 --> 08:10:28,240
we've got to do something to make sure

11917
08:10:28,240 --> 08:10:30,398
that they don't click

11918
08:10:30,398 --> 08:10:32,718
so cyber crime has no borders there's no

11919
08:10:32,718 --> 08:10:34,638
two ways about that it's a global

11920
08:10:34,638 --> 08:10:37,440
approach that we need and historically i

11921
08:10:37,440 --> 08:10:39,280
t have been responsible for cyber

11922
08:10:39,280 --> 08:10:41,040
security and as i mentioned done a very

11923
08:10:41,040 --> 08:10:43,360
good job and they'll continue to do so

11924
08:10:43,360 --> 08:10:46,080
the attack vector has changed we are

11925
08:10:46,080 --> 08:10:48,320
mobile with some pretty powerful devices

11926
08:10:48,320 --> 08:10:50,638
that we're walking around with and the

11927
08:10:50,638 --> 08:10:53,120
technology technological developments

11928
08:10:53,120 --> 08:10:55,520
it's not easy to say late at night

11929
08:10:55,520 --> 08:10:58,080
increased internet speeds accessibility

11930
08:10:58,080 --> 08:11:00,000
even our kids have access to incredible

11931
08:11:00,000 --> 08:11:02,320
things but we don't tell them what they

11932
08:11:02,320 --> 08:11:04,080
should be doing parental control seems

11933
08:11:04,080 --> 08:11:05,520
to be a really challenging thing for

11934
08:11:05,520 --> 08:11:07,520
parents and caregivers they get a lot of

11935
08:11:07,520 --> 08:11:09,680
flack for it however

11936
08:11:09,680 --> 08:11:11,200
they're making the same mistakes that

11937
08:11:11,200 --> 08:11:13,360
the kids are making online because they

11938
08:11:13,360 --> 08:11:14,878
don't actually know

11939
08:11:14,878 --> 08:11:16,798
and the increased level of risk and

11940
08:11:16,798 --> 08:11:19,120
threats means that we all have a role to

11941
08:11:19,120 --> 08:11:21,040
play there is a level of responsibility

11942
08:11:21,040 --> 08:11:23,440
now when it comes to cyber security that

11943
08:11:23,440 --> 08:11:25,600
we can't say that's it's problem it

11944
08:11:25,600 --> 08:11:27,280
isn't they're the smes they're the

11945
08:11:27,280 --> 08:11:29,440
subject matter experts but we have a

11946
08:11:29,440 --> 08:11:31,280
role to play we look after our cars

11947
08:11:31,280 --> 08:11:33,200
where we should be don't drive on bold

11948
08:11:33,200 --> 08:11:34,718
tyres make sure you've got petrol get it

11949
08:11:34,718 --> 08:11:37,040
serviced look after it if you don't

11950
08:11:37,040 --> 08:11:38,080
there's going to be a problem and you

11951
08:11:38,080 --> 08:11:40,000
could even get fined and drive safely on

11952
08:11:40,000 --> 08:11:42,478
the roads another thing i love my car

11953
08:11:42,478 --> 08:11:44,638
analogies and driving analogies with

11954
08:11:44,638 --> 08:11:47,280
cyber it tends to make sense for people

11955
08:11:47,280 --> 08:11:49,120
so we can't say that people in a

11956
08:11:49,120 --> 08:11:50,398
workplace

11957
08:11:50,398 --> 08:11:52,240
just do your training or don't click on

11958
08:11:52,240 --> 08:11:54,160
malicious links it doesn't work you

11959
08:11:54,160 --> 08:11:56,320
can't make it compulsory you can't do

11960
08:11:56,320 --> 08:11:58,638
that people need to know why why do i

11961
08:11:58,638 --> 08:12:00,718
need to do this why is it so important

11962
08:12:00,718 --> 08:12:03,680
what does it mean explain it to me

11963
08:12:03,680 --> 08:12:05,680
and that combined approach to cyber

11964
08:12:05,680 --> 08:12:08,798
security is so important i want to talk

11965
08:12:08,798 --> 08:12:10,718
about what that is

11966
08:12:10,718 --> 08:12:13,600
all right let me click on

11967
08:12:13,600 --> 08:12:15,600
here are some observations important to

11968
08:12:15,600 --> 08:12:17,200
you all training people on cyber

11969
08:12:17,200 --> 08:12:19,120
security once a year will not work

11970
08:12:19,120 --> 08:12:21,680
compliance tick box it will not work so

11971
08:12:21,680 --> 08:12:24,240
don't do it changing behavior takes time

11972
08:12:24,240 --> 08:12:25,440
and effort

11973
08:12:25,440 --> 08:12:27,760
for anything think about kids pets

11974
08:12:27,760 --> 08:12:31,120
yourself changing behavior takes time

11975
08:12:31,120 --> 08:12:33,360
and you really need to buy into it to do

11976
08:12:33,360 --> 08:12:36,638
it knowledge and awareness is not enough

11977
08:12:36,638 --> 08:12:38,320
to know about something and to be aware

11978
08:12:38,320 --> 08:12:40,080
of it is one thing but what do i do when

11979
08:12:40,080 --> 08:12:42,478
it happens how do i know what's the next

11980
08:12:42,478 --> 08:12:45,280
steps is just as important and there is

11981
08:12:45,280 --> 08:12:47,520
a need to make cyber security personal

11982
08:12:47,520 --> 08:12:49,440
to everybody these days for any real

11983
08:12:49,440 --> 08:12:52,240
change to occur and for the ideal

11984
08:12:52,240 --> 08:12:54,000
scenario of the culture of cyber

11985
08:12:54,000 --> 08:12:57,040
security to develop which means that

11986
08:12:57,040 --> 08:12:59,520
when you are away from work or at home

11987
08:12:59,520 --> 08:13:01,920
you're making better decisions when it

11988
08:13:01,920 --> 08:13:03,360
comes to staying safe online and

11989
08:13:03,360 --> 08:13:05,520
security and not sharing things and

11990
08:13:05,520 --> 08:13:07,360
saving things on dropbox because you

11991
08:13:07,360 --> 08:13:10,398
just want to you're aware of it it's so

11992
08:13:10,398 --> 08:13:12,878
important and changing behaviour is akin

11993
08:13:12,878 --> 08:13:14,798
to integrity it's the type of thing you

11994
08:13:14,798 --> 08:13:17,520
do when no one's watching it's just

11995
08:13:17,520 --> 08:13:19,680
hopefully we're all moving that way as

11996
08:13:19,680 --> 08:13:21,760
far as cyber security goes

11997
08:13:21,760 --> 08:13:23,360
so how do you go about it what do you do

11998
08:13:23,360 --> 08:13:24,878
now everything i'm sharing with you is

11999
08:13:24,878 --> 08:13:27,280
based on what i did

12000
08:13:27,280 --> 08:13:29,600
years ago to actually roll out a cyber

12001
08:13:29,600 --> 08:13:31,360
security education awareness program

12002
08:13:31,360 --> 08:13:33,520
that did change behavior and the reason

12003
08:13:33,520 --> 08:13:35,760
it worked and you'll find out why but

12004
08:13:35,760 --> 08:13:37,360
it's my background and the skill set and

12005
08:13:37,360 --> 08:13:39,520
what i did in the approach so it's not

12006
08:13:39,520 --> 08:13:42,160
just the content of the training it's

12007
08:13:42,160 --> 08:13:44,080
everything else around it getting that

12008
08:13:44,080 --> 08:13:47,280
executive buy-in so remember

12009
08:13:47,280 --> 08:13:49,360
you can't just roll things out once you

12010
08:13:49,360 --> 08:13:51,600
need research and preparation i'm going

12011
08:13:51,600 --> 08:13:53,280
to talk about these in a little bit more

12012
08:13:53,280 --> 08:13:55,840
detail as well just so you understand

12013
08:13:55,840 --> 08:13:57,680
okay that's where it all fits

12014
08:13:57,680 --> 08:13:59,120
and the first part of research and

12015
08:13:59,120 --> 08:14:01,200
preparation also includes part one of

12016
08:14:01,200 --> 08:14:03,520
executive buy-in we have part two of

12017
08:14:03,520 --> 08:14:05,520
executive buy-in which is probably the

12018
08:14:05,520 --> 08:14:08,240
most important part and then finally

12019
08:14:08,240 --> 08:14:10,320
launching and then managing a cyber

12020
08:14:10,320 --> 08:14:12,878
security education and awareness program

12021
08:14:12,878 --> 08:14:14,558
i know it's a lot

12022
08:14:14,558 --> 08:14:16,320
it kind of needs to be it's not one of

12023
08:14:16,320 --> 08:14:17,760
those things just train the people or

12024
08:14:17,760 --> 08:14:20,080
tell them not to click on it

12025
08:14:20,080 --> 08:14:21,440
doesn't work because they don't know

12026
08:14:21,440 --> 08:14:23,840
what it is they shouldn't be clicking on

12027
08:14:23,840 --> 08:14:27,920
okay so these days the people are we've

12028
08:14:27,920 --> 08:14:29,680
heard this term they're the last line of

12029
08:14:29,680 --> 08:14:31,600
defense we're going to build a human

12030
08:14:31,600 --> 08:14:33,680
firewall we do it's the path of least

12031
08:14:33,680 --> 08:14:35,920
resistance it's the weakest link

12032
08:14:35,920 --> 08:14:38,080
that those words have been used for many

12033
08:14:38,080 --> 08:14:39,760
many years and the fact is if you

12034
08:14:39,760 --> 08:14:42,160
educate your people and you change and

12035
08:14:42,160 --> 08:14:44,320
create a culture of security you have

12036
08:14:44,320 --> 08:14:47,760
probably the most powerful and empowered

12037
08:14:47,760 --> 08:14:48,798
people

12038
08:14:48,798 --> 08:14:50,798
in your whole organization to protect

12039
08:14:50,798 --> 08:14:52,878
the crown jewels and also they'll be

12040
08:14:52,878 --> 08:14:54,240
grateful because they're protecting

12041
08:14:54,240 --> 08:14:56,558
their own personal stuff as well

12042
08:14:56,558 --> 08:14:59,120
all right let's get into it

12043
08:14:59,120 --> 08:15:01,360
research and preparation now this is

12044
08:15:01,360 --> 08:15:03,840
about usually creating a program and the

12045
08:15:03,840 --> 08:15:06,638
request will come down from let's say

12046
08:15:06,638 --> 08:15:08,160
this could be

12047
08:15:08,160 --> 08:15:10,080
the board says we need to educate our

12048
08:15:10,080 --> 08:15:13,120
people auditors compliance regulatory

12049
08:15:13,120 --> 08:15:14,958
bodies you need to make sure people

12050
08:15:14,958 --> 08:15:16,398
aren't clicking on links or how are you

12051
08:15:16,398 --> 08:15:18,958
protecting your pci dss what are you

12052
08:15:18,958 --> 08:15:20,798
doing in this space to protect all of

12053
08:15:20,798 --> 08:15:23,120
this stuff most people say i don't know

12054
08:15:23,120 --> 08:15:24,798
better train the people

12055
08:15:24,798 --> 08:15:27,120
to do it properly create a program bring

12056
08:15:27,120 --> 08:15:28,798
some people together if you can

12057
08:15:28,798 --> 08:15:29,920
depending on the size of the

12058
08:15:29,920 --> 08:15:31,360
organization i'm just going to say that

12059
08:15:31,360 --> 08:15:33,760
once as a caveat bring in someone from

12060
08:15:33,760 --> 08:15:35,520
hr if you can with learning and

12061
08:15:35,520 --> 08:15:38,478
development communication organizational

12062
08:15:38,478 --> 08:15:40,240
development even change management

12063
08:15:40,240 --> 08:15:42,638
skills to work with them this needs to

12064
08:15:42,638 --> 08:15:44,958
be a team effort folks you can't just

12065
08:15:44,958 --> 08:15:47,200
get one person to do it it's not a

12066
08:15:47,200 --> 08:15:48,398
common thing

12067
08:15:48,398 --> 08:15:50,558
find an executive sponsor maybe someone

12068
08:15:50,558 --> 08:15:52,958
from it might be a good idea to act as

12069
08:15:52,958 --> 08:15:54,878
that subject matter expert because it is

12070
08:15:54,878 --> 08:15:56,638
they they are the subject matter expert

12071
08:15:56,638 --> 08:15:58,558
in this but when you're trying to change

12072
08:15:58,558 --> 08:16:00,080
behavior and engage in the entire

12073
08:16:00,080 --> 08:16:02,638
organization that's not in it's

12074
08:16:02,638 --> 08:16:04,080
wheelhouse that is just not going to

12075
08:16:04,080 --> 08:16:06,398
happen and it's unfair to even ask them

12076
08:16:06,398 --> 08:16:09,360
to they have a big role to play

12077
08:16:09,360 --> 08:16:10,558
now

12078
08:16:10,558 --> 08:16:12,798
the whole point of this is to find out

12079
08:16:12,798 --> 08:16:15,040
what's your program's intent what's its

12080
08:16:15,040 --> 08:16:17,040
objectives how are you going to measure

12081
08:16:17,040 --> 08:16:19,200
the success of this program and by the

12082
08:16:19,200 --> 08:16:20,798
way if you want any more details about

12083
08:16:20,798 --> 08:16:22,398
this please let me know i have quite a

12084
08:16:22,398 --> 08:16:24,398
lot of information that can support it

12085
08:16:24,398 --> 08:16:25,680
if this is something you're looking at

12086
08:16:25,680 --> 08:16:27,440
doing or currently doing and want to

12087
08:16:27,440 --> 08:16:28,558
make it better

12088
08:16:28,558 --> 08:16:30,080
will you get a security awareness

12089
08:16:30,080 --> 08:16:32,478
training platform to underpin your

12090
08:16:32,478 --> 08:16:34,398
program that has all the content that

12091
08:16:34,398 --> 08:16:36,160
you need the training the e-learning the

12092
08:16:36,160 --> 08:16:38,638
videos the opportunity to do simulated

12093
08:16:38,638 --> 08:16:40,000
phishing

12094
08:16:40,000 --> 08:16:42,160
emails because they are so important for

12095
08:16:42,160 --> 08:16:44,318
people to apply their knowledge you

12096
08:16:44,318 --> 08:16:46,160
can't teach people things and not get

12097
08:16:46,160 --> 08:16:47,680
them to apply their knowledge it doesn't

12098
08:16:47,680 --> 08:16:49,440
work that's telling teaching and

12099
08:16:49,440 --> 08:16:51,680
educating are very very important it's

12100
08:16:51,680 --> 08:16:53,040
not telling

12101
08:16:53,040 --> 08:16:55,200
what are your key messages is this about

12102
08:16:55,200 --> 08:16:57,280
you know protecting our information are

12103
08:16:57,280 --> 08:16:58,478
you in healthcare is this about

12104
08:16:58,478 --> 08:17:00,398
protecting our clients is this about

12105
08:17:00,398 --> 08:17:02,160
protecting your information we hold in

12106
08:17:02,160 --> 08:17:04,240
hr because just think about the

12107
08:17:04,240 --> 08:17:06,080
information you've got in different hr

12108
08:17:06,080 --> 08:17:07,520
places around the world where you've

12109
08:17:07,520 --> 08:17:09,120
applied for jobs they've got everything

12110
08:17:09,120 --> 08:17:11,520
about you so you want that protected i

12111
08:17:11,520 --> 08:17:12,878
know i do

12112
08:17:12,878 --> 08:17:14,080
how will this align with the

12113
08:17:14,080 --> 08:17:16,000
organization so if you want to teach

12114
08:17:16,000 --> 08:17:18,000
people about cyber and get them to do

12115
08:17:18,000 --> 08:17:19,520
the right thing and make good decisions

12116
08:17:19,520 --> 08:17:21,520
when it comes to security

12117
08:17:21,520 --> 08:17:23,440
make it align with what you currently

12118
08:17:23,440 --> 08:17:25,280
have your vision your mission your

12119
08:17:25,280 --> 08:17:27,280
values all of those things what's your

12120
08:17:27,280 --> 08:17:30,160
strategic plan how will that align if

12121
08:17:30,160 --> 08:17:32,318
you want this to work properly this is

12122
08:17:32,318 --> 08:17:34,398
the correct way to approach it

12123
08:17:34,398 --> 08:17:36,160
reporting how are you going to do that

12124
08:17:36,160 --> 08:17:38,798
how what off how often what information

12125
08:17:38,798 --> 08:17:41,120
will you report on who needs to know

12126
08:17:41,120 --> 08:17:43,840
about it resources will you need some

12127
08:17:43,840 --> 08:17:46,398
budgets maybe we need people to actually

12128
08:17:46,398 --> 08:17:48,240
do this and manage this program

12129
08:17:48,240 --> 08:17:50,000
part-time as part of their role whatever

12130
08:17:50,000 --> 08:17:51,040
it might be

12131
08:17:51,040 --> 08:17:53,120
when this moves from a project because

12132
08:17:53,120 --> 08:17:54,398
that's what it is if you haven't worked

12133
08:17:54,398 --> 08:17:56,718
it out to business as usual because it

12134
08:17:56,718 --> 08:17:58,958
is a big setup and then off it goes to

12135
08:17:58,958 --> 08:18:01,040
an ongoing situation

12136
08:18:01,040 --> 08:18:03,040
what will the employees be experiencing

12137
08:18:03,040 --> 08:18:05,280
each month is it two types of training

12138
08:18:05,280 --> 08:18:07,520
they need to do by the way it's not a

12139
08:18:07,520 --> 08:18:09,200
lot that you need to do it could be 15

12140
08:18:09,200 --> 08:18:11,600
minutes of training per month in

12141
08:18:11,600 --> 08:18:14,558
e-learning videos talks newsletters

12142
08:18:14,558 --> 08:18:16,478
whatever it might be it's not a lot

12143
08:18:16,478 --> 08:18:18,398
that's required it's the ongoing nature

12144
08:18:18,398 --> 08:18:20,080
that's required because this stuff

12145
08:18:20,080 --> 08:18:21,440
changes

12146
08:18:21,440 --> 08:18:23,760
daily and we cannot be on top of it any

12147
08:18:23,760 --> 08:18:24,798
other way

12148
08:18:24,798 --> 08:18:26,478
then what's best practice out there for

12149
08:18:26,478 --> 08:18:28,080
security awareness training there's so

12150
08:18:28,080 --> 08:18:29,920
many resources for you guys to find

12151
08:18:29,920 --> 08:18:31,920
these days have a look at a timeline

12152
08:18:31,920 --> 08:18:33,680
over the next year here's what we're

12153
08:18:33,680 --> 08:18:35,840
doing now research then we'll launch

12154
08:18:35,840 --> 08:18:37,040
then we'll have a look at things we'll

12155
08:18:37,040 --> 08:18:38,878
do a baseline to see how many people are

12156
08:18:38,878 --> 08:18:40,160
clicking on stuff and then we'll do

12157
08:18:40,160 --> 08:18:42,160
training we'll see what happens then

12158
08:18:42,160 --> 08:18:43,680
here's the big audits coming up so we

12159
08:18:43,680 --> 08:18:45,280
need reports for that

12160
08:18:45,280 --> 08:18:46,718
etcetera

12161
08:18:46,718 --> 08:18:48,958
then we have engaging the organization

12162
08:18:48,958 --> 08:18:50,000
you've got to tell them what you're

12163
08:18:50,000 --> 08:18:51,760
doing why you're doing it back to the

12164
08:18:51,760 --> 08:18:53,840
intent and all of that kind of stuff so

12165
08:18:53,840 --> 08:18:55,360
that they know what's coming and they

12166
08:18:55,360 --> 08:18:58,718
know what's in it for them it is so

12167
08:18:58,718 --> 08:19:01,040
important to know what's in it for them

12168
08:19:01,040 --> 08:19:02,878
then the communication plan are you

12169
08:19:02,878 --> 08:19:04,558
going to email are you going to be town

12170
08:19:04,558 --> 08:19:06,240
square and walk around with a bell i

12171
08:19:06,240 --> 08:19:08,398
will there be posters will you send out

12172
08:19:08,398 --> 08:19:09,920
snail mail or something to people's

12173
08:19:09,920 --> 08:19:11,760
houses what are you going to do to

12174
08:19:11,760 --> 08:19:13,920
communicate what's happening with this

12175
08:19:13,920 --> 08:19:15,440
program and then what are the

12176
08:19:15,440 --> 08:19:17,680
expectations of the program from a

12177
08:19:17,680 --> 08:19:19,760
leadership all the way down what do you

12178
08:19:19,760 --> 08:19:21,520
need to do what do we expect from

12179
08:19:21,520 --> 08:19:22,398
everybody

12180
08:19:22,398 --> 08:19:25,040
so it's quite a lot guys it's not just a

12181
08:19:25,040 --> 08:19:26,638
just roll out some training and she'll

12182
08:19:26,638 --> 08:19:29,040
be right it doesn't work that way

12183
08:19:29,040 --> 08:19:31,360
then we move into executive buying part

12184
08:19:31,360 --> 08:19:32,398
one

12185
08:19:32,398 --> 08:19:33,840
during all of that process on the

12186
08:19:33,840 --> 08:19:36,398
previous slide which you know that could

12187
08:19:36,398 --> 08:19:38,478
take two months to do could take three

12188
08:19:38,478 --> 08:19:40,160
depends you know depending on where you

12189
08:19:40,160 --> 08:19:41,840
work and what you do and how many people

12190
08:19:41,840 --> 08:19:43,840
you're actually looking at um working

12191
08:19:43,840 --> 08:19:46,318
with here executive buy-in is about

12192
08:19:46,318 --> 08:19:49,120
understanding the universe of each of

12193
08:19:49,120 --> 08:19:51,040
those executives or business units

12194
08:19:51,040 --> 08:19:53,200
departments whatever you want to call it

12195
08:19:53,200 --> 08:19:55,120
because if you can get the information

12196
08:19:55,120 --> 08:19:58,318
from them about the stuff they have as

12197
08:19:58,318 --> 08:20:00,080
beau mentioned like looking at marketing

12198
08:20:00,080 --> 08:20:02,080
with how they might share information or

12199
08:20:02,080 --> 08:20:03,520
even sales or anywhere in an

12200
08:20:03,520 --> 08:20:05,760
organization finding that path of least

12201
08:20:05,760 --> 08:20:07,360
resistance to just get the stuff out

12202
08:20:07,360 --> 08:20:09,440
there we need to communicate and

12203
08:20:09,440 --> 08:20:11,680
understand what's happening to bring it

12204
08:20:11,680 --> 08:20:13,600
all back in because in the next part

12205
08:20:13,600 --> 08:20:15,440
we're going to present it back

12206
08:20:15,440 --> 08:20:17,280
and as soon as you present information

12207
08:20:17,280 --> 08:20:19,840
back that's out of the horse's mouth

12208
08:20:19,840 --> 08:20:21,280
it's really hard for them to say

12209
08:20:21,280 --> 08:20:23,040
actually we don't like that

12210
08:20:23,040 --> 08:20:25,360
so just something else to think about

12211
08:20:25,360 --> 08:20:27,120
now we also want to know

12212
08:20:27,120 --> 08:20:28,878
information such as

12213
08:20:28,878 --> 08:20:31,360
what data do they have that's important

12214
08:20:31,360 --> 08:20:33,120
to them what would it mean if it was

12215
08:20:33,120 --> 08:20:35,120
stolen or breached this is logical

12216
08:20:35,120 --> 08:20:36,638
questions guys and you wouldn't know the

12217
08:20:36,638 --> 08:20:38,240
answers to them that's not the point

12218
08:20:38,240 --> 08:20:40,638
here the point is you want them to tell

12219
08:20:40,638 --> 08:20:42,638
you you write it down and then you

12220
08:20:42,638 --> 08:20:44,398
present it back because if you make it

12221
08:20:44,398 --> 08:20:47,360
really clear that we're stuffed if all

12222
08:20:47,360 --> 08:20:49,600
of our data gets stolen and breached how

12223
08:20:49,600 --> 08:20:50,958
are they going to ignore the fact that

12224
08:20:50,958 --> 08:20:52,398
they need to do something about it and

12225
08:20:52,398 --> 08:20:53,920
by doing a security awareness training

12226
08:20:53,920 --> 08:20:56,798
and education program is the way to go

12227
08:20:56,798 --> 08:20:59,360
and then do their people understand how

12228
08:20:59,360 --> 08:21:01,760
to protect this data most of them won't

12229
08:21:01,760 --> 08:21:03,920
that's good you want that feedback it's

12230
08:21:03,920 --> 08:21:05,600
like entrapment in a nice way it's

12231
08:21:05,600 --> 08:21:07,120
strategic entrapment getting the

12232
08:21:07,120 --> 08:21:09,600
information so that you can shift the

12233
08:21:09,600 --> 08:21:12,000
needle and create a culture of security

12234
08:21:12,000 --> 08:21:13,360
and then what's the biggest challenge

12235
08:21:13,360 --> 08:21:14,718
they have when it comes to cyber

12236
08:21:14,718 --> 08:21:15,920
security

12237
08:21:15,920 --> 08:21:18,558
really really enlightening question some

12238
08:21:18,558 --> 08:21:20,240
of the answers will be we have no idea

12239
08:21:20,240 --> 08:21:22,160
what we need to do or we're just too

12240
08:21:22,160 --> 08:21:23,360
scared someone's going to click on

12241
08:21:23,360 --> 08:21:25,840
something whatever it might be again you

12242
08:21:25,840 --> 08:21:27,280
write all that down

12243
08:21:27,280 --> 08:21:29,520
then we move into i like to call the

12244
08:21:29,520 --> 08:21:32,318
next level of executive buy-in where you

12245
08:21:32,318 --> 08:21:33,760
are bringing it all together and

12246
08:21:33,760 --> 08:21:35,520
presenting it back

12247
08:21:35,520 --> 08:21:38,318
at this point you're wanting agreement

12248
08:21:38,318 --> 08:21:39,760
and sign-off

12249
08:21:39,760 --> 08:21:41,840
to what you want to achieve and how

12250
08:21:41,840 --> 08:21:44,638
you're going to do it so remember the

12251
08:21:44,638 --> 08:21:46,240
organization as a whole doesn't even

12252
08:21:46,240 --> 08:21:48,000
know you're doing this yet this is

12253
08:21:48,000 --> 08:21:50,000
purely to get buy-in if you don't get

12254
08:21:50,000 --> 08:21:52,638
buy-in you will fail the program will

12255
08:21:52,638 --> 08:21:55,040
fail because if you don't do all of that

12256
08:21:55,040 --> 08:21:56,878
and you just roll out training from i.t

12257
08:21:56,878 --> 08:21:58,240
to everyone and tell them you've got to

12258
08:21:58,240 --> 08:22:00,398
do this training guess what happens we

12259
08:22:00,398 --> 08:22:02,558
don't have time for this this is taking

12260
08:22:02,558 --> 08:22:04,718
productivity away from everything we

12261
08:22:04,718 --> 08:22:06,398
haven't we don't understand why we need

12262
08:22:06,398 --> 08:22:08,398
to do this we're sales we haven't got

12263
08:22:08,398 --> 08:22:10,718
time we've got budgets to me

12264
08:22:10,718 --> 08:22:12,240
this is why you need to do all this

12265
08:22:12,240 --> 08:22:14,478
process stuff first and create this

12266
08:22:14,478 --> 08:22:17,280
project before it even launches so part

12267
08:22:17,280 --> 08:22:19,280
two of executive buy-in

12268
08:22:19,280 --> 08:22:20,878
this is where you get agreement and

12269
08:22:20,878 --> 08:22:21,920
decide

12270
08:22:21,920 --> 08:22:23,440
are we going to get a security awareness

12271
08:22:23,440 --> 08:22:25,600
training platform if we are which one

12272
08:22:25,600 --> 08:22:27,680
are we going to go with okay yes let's

12273
08:22:27,680 --> 08:22:29,200
move forward there might be a budget

12274
08:22:29,200 --> 08:22:30,958
requirement for that will there be a

12275
08:22:30,958 --> 08:22:33,200
look and feel a logo something to engage

12276
08:22:33,200 --> 08:22:35,120
people the marketing and advertising

12277
08:22:35,120 --> 08:22:37,120
brain is so important in something like

12278
08:22:37,120 --> 08:22:38,958
this for engagement it's not just

12279
08:22:38,958 --> 08:22:41,360
security training or cyber training

12280
08:22:41,360 --> 08:22:42,798
people don't even know what cyber is if

12281
08:22:42,798 --> 08:22:44,000
you actually ask them they'll give you

12282
08:22:44,000 --> 08:22:45,840
10 different responses if you ask 10

12283
08:22:45,840 --> 08:22:47,520
different people

12284
08:22:47,520 --> 08:22:48,878
how are you going to communicate get

12285
08:22:48,878 --> 08:22:50,318
that signed off are you going to do a

12286
08:22:50,318 --> 08:22:52,878
benchmark phishing email i hope so a

12287
08:22:52,878 --> 08:22:54,638
simulated one because you want to know

12288
08:22:54,638 --> 08:22:55,840
where you're at you want to know where

12289
08:22:55,840 --> 08:22:58,080
am i starting so if you're ever going to

12290
08:22:58,080 --> 08:23:00,080
get healthy you weigh yourself and think

12291
08:23:00,080 --> 08:23:02,478
i can need to lose 20 kilos you need a

12292
08:23:02,478 --> 08:23:04,718
baseline it's no different to cyber

12293
08:23:04,718 --> 08:23:06,398
security you want to know

12294
08:23:06,398 --> 08:23:08,478
we can say for certain that 20 of our

12295
08:23:08,478 --> 08:23:10,478
employees will click on a link

12296
08:23:10,478 --> 08:23:12,478
now let's train them now let's do these

12297
08:23:12,478 --> 08:23:14,398
things and let's see that come down it's

12298
08:23:14,398 --> 08:23:17,280
a good easy first measurement but i in

12299
08:23:17,280 --> 08:23:18,878
the id world you want to come down to

12300
08:23:18,878 --> 08:23:20,718
behavior that's where the change

12301
08:23:20,718 --> 08:23:22,718
actually takes place and embedding

12302
08:23:22,718 --> 08:23:23,680
things

12303
08:23:23,680 --> 08:23:25,600
will there be some assessments because

12304
08:23:25,600 --> 08:23:26,958
it'd be great to know what our people

12305
08:23:26,958 --> 08:23:29,600
know about cyber security and what are

12306
08:23:29,600 --> 08:23:31,600
our people's attitudes towards it do

12307
08:23:31,600 --> 08:23:34,160
they actually care do they realize that

12308
08:23:34,160 --> 08:23:35,680
they've got a role to play here so it's

12309
08:23:35,680 --> 08:23:37,680
about building that whole story around

12310
08:23:37,680 --> 08:23:39,360
it as well

12311
08:23:39,360 --> 08:23:41,760
the simulations that you do for any type

12312
08:23:41,760 --> 08:23:43,840
of social engineering or fishing you

12313
08:23:43,840 --> 08:23:45,680
need to have thought into that depending

12314
08:23:45,680 --> 08:23:47,280
on the culture of where you work nothing

12315
08:23:47,280 --> 08:23:49,280
to do with cyber security culture but

12316
08:23:49,280 --> 08:23:51,360
just where you work what type of

12317
08:23:51,360 --> 08:23:53,200
simulated phishing emails are off the

12318
08:23:53,200 --> 08:23:55,040
table that could be anything to do with

12319
08:23:55,040 --> 08:23:57,440
hr for example or we don't want to do

12320
08:23:57,440 --> 08:23:58,798
anything covered related because you've

12321
08:23:58,798 --> 08:24:01,040
had a lot of impact from covert whatever

12322
08:24:01,040 --> 08:24:03,280
it might be have a conversation there's

12323
08:24:03,280 --> 08:24:05,280
thousands of different um templates that

12324
08:24:05,280 --> 08:24:06,878
you can choose from on our platform and

12325
08:24:06,878 --> 08:24:08,398
i'm sure with others

12326
08:24:08,398 --> 08:24:11,280
don't try to be clever um and send

12327
08:24:11,280 --> 08:24:13,360
something out you know he he let's see

12328
08:24:13,360 --> 08:24:15,600
who clicks it can backfire and it will

12329
08:24:15,600 --> 08:24:17,440
be in social media and you don't want

12330
08:24:17,440 --> 08:24:19,520
that so a bit of thoughts required

12331
08:24:19,520 --> 08:24:20,318
then

12332
08:24:20,318 --> 08:24:21,440
what are the training minimum

12333
08:24:21,440 --> 08:24:23,440
requirements you need sign off people

12334
08:24:23,440 --> 08:24:25,600
will be taking time out of their usual

12335
08:24:25,600 --> 08:24:27,520
days to do this

12336
08:24:27,520 --> 08:24:29,760
so that's going to cost if productivity

12337
08:24:29,760 --> 08:24:31,360
to the organization and you need to get

12338
08:24:31,360 --> 08:24:33,040
the okay to do that

12339
08:24:33,040 --> 08:24:35,040
then how the reporting will work so all

12340
08:24:35,040 --> 08:24:36,558
the things we've been talking about you

12341
08:24:36,558 --> 08:24:38,638
need to sign off an agreement from the

12342
08:24:38,638 --> 08:24:39,920
exact team

12343
08:24:39,920 --> 08:24:41,280
then you're thinking to yourself this is

12344
08:24:41,280 --> 08:24:44,718
ridiculous i've got no time for this uh

12345
08:24:44,718 --> 08:24:47,200
i've just wanted to train the people yep

12346
08:24:47,200 --> 08:24:49,040
it won't work if you have the attitude

12347
08:24:49,040 --> 08:24:51,120
if you've just got to train the people

12348
08:24:51,120 --> 08:24:53,520
there's so much more to it and the fact

12349
08:24:53,520 --> 08:24:55,200
is that you're doing something pretty

12350
08:24:55,200 --> 08:24:56,718
big here which i'll talk about a little

12351
08:24:56,718 --> 08:24:58,478
bit later firstly

12352
08:24:58,478 --> 08:25:00,478
launching and managing now when you

12353
08:25:00,478 --> 08:25:02,958
launch a program it's like a space

12354
08:25:02,958 --> 08:25:04,398
shuttle launch when i'm trying to think

12355
08:25:04,398 --> 08:25:07,040
of analogies here you don't just take

12356
08:25:07,040 --> 08:25:09,200
off there's a whole process that takes

12357
08:25:09,200 --> 08:25:10,000
place

12358
08:25:10,000 --> 08:25:12,798
before there's actual countdown ignition

12359
08:25:12,798 --> 08:25:14,798
and then liftoff happens it's the same

12360
08:25:14,798 --> 08:25:17,200
with launching preparing to launch a

12361
08:25:17,200 --> 08:25:19,440
program like this everything we've just

12362
08:25:19,440 --> 08:25:21,760
talked about we bring it together and

12363
08:25:21,760 --> 08:25:23,840
think okay when are we going to start

12364
08:25:23,840 --> 08:25:25,360
this how's it going to go how we're

12365
08:25:25,360 --> 08:25:26,958
going to communicate and now you put it

12366
08:25:26,958 --> 08:25:29,760
in place and start that process tell

12367
08:25:29,760 --> 08:25:31,760
everybody what's happening maybe before

12368
08:25:31,760 --> 08:25:33,520
you do is a really good idea send out

12369
08:25:33,520 --> 08:25:35,680
that benchmark phishing email first just

12370
08:25:35,680 --> 08:25:37,920
to see where everyone's at then you say

12371
08:25:37,920 --> 08:25:39,280
we're going to be doing this here's why

12372
08:25:39,280 --> 08:25:40,878
we're going to be doing it maybe share

12373
08:25:40,878 --> 08:25:42,638
the results of the baseline test that

12374
08:25:42,638 --> 08:25:44,718
freaks people out a bit not name and

12375
08:25:44,718 --> 08:25:46,638
shame this is about here's where we're

12376
08:25:46,638 --> 08:25:48,638
at and here's where we want to be so all

12377
08:25:48,638 --> 08:25:50,478
of these things pop in people know what

12378
08:25:50,478 --> 08:25:52,638
to expect you're treating them as adults

12379
08:25:52,638 --> 08:25:54,798
they need to know why we're doing this

12380
08:25:54,798 --> 08:25:57,040
it's very important but you can't just

12381
08:25:57,040 --> 08:25:59,520
say it's important you have to do it we

12382
08:25:59,520 --> 08:26:01,440
need to know why so that what's in it

12383
08:26:01,440 --> 08:26:04,000
for me is so critical and sharing put up

12384
08:26:04,000 --> 08:26:05,600
posters all sorts of things that you can

12385
08:26:05,600 --> 08:26:08,318
do to get engagement maybe gamification

12386
08:26:08,318 --> 08:26:10,798
etc and it'd be great to have some

12387
08:26:10,798 --> 08:26:13,280
security uh officers like first aid

12388
08:26:13,280 --> 08:26:15,360
officers or mental health officers which

12389
08:26:15,360 --> 08:26:17,920
i'll talk a little bit about as well

12390
08:26:17,920 --> 08:26:18,878
and then

12391
08:26:18,878 --> 08:26:20,958
you launch the program which is where we

12392
08:26:20,958 --> 08:26:23,200
say start your training

12393
08:26:23,200 --> 08:26:26,080
once that happens it's moved into bau so

12394
08:26:26,080 --> 08:26:28,318
this is where it's time for we look at

12395
08:26:28,318 --> 08:26:30,398
the rocket launch scenario after there's

12396
08:26:30,398 --> 08:26:32,398
takeoff you know the engine cuts off the

12397
08:26:32,398 --> 08:26:34,718
payload separates ongoing checks it

12398
08:26:34,718 --> 08:26:36,558
never ever ends until

12399
08:26:36,558 --> 08:26:38,318
that device comes back or that rocket

12400
08:26:38,318 --> 08:26:40,240
comes back to earth if that's that's its

12401
08:26:40,240 --> 08:26:41,200
plan

12402
08:26:41,200 --> 08:26:42,958
it's the same with the cyber security

12403
08:26:42,958 --> 08:26:45,360
edge or education and awareness program

12404
08:26:45,360 --> 08:26:48,558
the success of this requires some

12405
08:26:48,558 --> 08:26:51,600
ongoing time and management and it could

12406
08:26:51,600 --> 08:26:53,840
be like in an ideal world depending on

12407
08:26:53,840 --> 08:26:55,920
the size of your organization it could

12408
08:26:55,920 --> 08:26:58,240
be a job share situation it could be a

12409
08:26:58,240 --> 08:27:00,080
part-time person it could be a full-time

12410
08:27:00,080 --> 08:27:02,240
person if it's a big company that's

12411
08:27:02,240 --> 08:27:03,440
actually going to do this this is

12412
08:27:03,440 --> 08:27:04,798
stakeholder management this is

12413
08:27:04,798 --> 08:27:06,398
communication this is learning and

12414
08:27:06,398 --> 08:27:08,478
development this is organizational

12415
08:27:08,478 --> 08:27:11,760
change this is quite complex so if it's

12416
08:27:11,760 --> 08:27:14,240
a party of five totally different you

12417
08:27:14,240 --> 08:27:16,000
still need to follow the process though

12418
08:27:16,000 --> 08:27:20,000
if it's 5 000 50 000 it's just scaling

12419
08:27:20,000 --> 08:27:21,760
it up to suit that particular group of

12420
08:27:21,760 --> 08:27:24,160
people that you need to educate

12421
08:27:24,160 --> 08:27:26,558
and then we're looking at well what does

12422
08:27:26,558 --> 08:27:28,000
the month look like and you can see

12423
08:27:28,000 --> 08:27:30,240
listed there the type of things that you

12424
08:27:30,240 --> 08:27:32,478
actually need to do each month

12425
08:27:32,478 --> 08:27:34,398
and it doesn't take as much time as you

12426
08:27:34,398 --> 08:27:35,840
might think if you've done all the

12427
08:27:35,840 --> 08:27:38,558
preparation first it's just that

12428
08:27:38,558 --> 08:27:41,600
continuous iteration sending it out like

12429
08:27:41,600 --> 08:27:43,680
anything that you might be doing in your

12430
08:27:43,680 --> 08:27:46,558
organization and as i mentioned the

12431
08:27:46,558 --> 08:27:49,920
cyber security safety officers cssos

12432
08:27:49,920 --> 08:27:51,680
whatever you want to call them they're

12433
08:27:51,680 --> 08:27:53,600
like work health safety officers your

12434
08:27:53,600 --> 08:27:55,600
champions your security advocates

12435
08:27:55,600 --> 08:27:57,680
whatever you want to call them they're

12436
08:27:57,680 --> 08:27:59,680
so important they're the ones who know a

12437
08:27:59,680 --> 08:28:02,718
bit more about cyber and can help the

12438
08:28:02,718 --> 08:28:05,120
team who are putting this in place to

12439
08:28:05,120 --> 08:28:07,280
really be a touch point for others to

12440
08:28:07,280 --> 08:28:09,040
say is this a weird email should i do

12441
08:28:09,040 --> 08:28:11,040
something about this or i'm not sure

12442
08:28:11,040 --> 08:28:13,200
what to do with this usb i just found

12443
08:28:13,200 --> 08:28:15,120
those type of things it can make such a

12444
08:28:15,120 --> 08:28:16,558
difference

12445
08:28:16,558 --> 08:28:18,558
and then some other considerations

12446
08:28:18,558 --> 08:28:20,878
because it never ends never punish human

12447
08:28:20,878 --> 08:28:23,520
error it's a it's a learning opportunity

12448
08:28:23,520 --> 08:28:25,680
and please see it as such people will

12449
08:28:25,680 --> 08:28:28,240
click people who have a very good cyber

12450
08:28:28,240 --> 08:28:30,638
brain will click they will do things

12451
08:28:30,638 --> 08:28:32,478
they shouldn't do they're tired they're

12452
08:28:32,478 --> 08:28:34,318
multitasking when they shouldn't be

12453
08:28:34,318 --> 08:28:35,760
they're just not paying attention

12454
08:28:35,760 --> 08:28:38,080
because they're human and human emotions

12455
08:28:38,080 --> 08:28:39,920
still come into play

12456
08:28:39,920 --> 08:28:42,318
develop maybe a newsletter or something

12457
08:28:42,318 --> 08:28:44,080
on your intranet you could do something

12458
08:28:44,080 --> 08:28:45,600
on linkedin you could do something

12459
08:28:45,600 --> 08:28:48,080
anywhere to communicate things

12460
08:28:48,080 --> 08:28:50,718
developing useful tools and just giving

12461
08:28:50,718 --> 08:28:52,958
those to people as reminders of what

12462
08:28:52,958 --> 08:28:54,398
they need to do share them with their

12463
08:28:54,398 --> 08:28:55,600
families

12464
08:28:55,600 --> 08:28:57,680
do some live hacks if you can or

12465
08:28:57,680 --> 08:28:59,840
demonstrate them using youtube if you're

12466
08:28:59,840 --> 08:29:01,360
not comfortable going down that rabbit

12467
08:29:01,360 --> 08:29:02,558
hole

12468
08:29:02,558 --> 08:29:04,718
share them scare people they need to

12469
08:29:04,718 --> 08:29:06,878
understand what is actually going on out

12470
08:29:06,878 --> 08:29:09,440
there education deep web dark web here's

12471
08:29:09,440 --> 08:29:11,520
what it's all about those type of things

12472
08:29:11,520 --> 08:29:13,360
do some ocean open source intelligence

12473
08:29:13,360 --> 08:29:16,080
with permission just to show how easy it

12474
08:29:16,080 --> 08:29:18,318
is to get information on people

12475
08:29:18,318 --> 08:29:20,080
and if you can give some information

12476
08:29:20,080 --> 08:29:21,520
what's happening in the organization

12477
08:29:21,520 --> 08:29:23,680
where you are let's say 10 000 emails

12478
08:29:23,680 --> 08:29:24,718
come in

12479
08:29:24,718 --> 08:29:26,240
to the inbox

12480
08:29:26,240 --> 08:29:28,798
5 000 of those are known malicious spam

12481
08:29:28,798 --> 08:29:30,878
yucky emails we don't let them in then

12482
08:29:30,878 --> 08:29:32,240
we go through another filter and we get

12483
08:29:32,240 --> 08:29:35,520
rid of another 2 000 and then 2 000 end

12484
08:29:35,520 --> 08:29:38,080
up in the inboxes of our employees and

12485
08:29:38,080 --> 08:29:39,920
there's going to be a percentage that

12486
08:29:39,920 --> 08:29:41,040
are malicious

12487
08:29:41,040 --> 08:29:42,638
let people know what's actually

12488
08:29:42,638 --> 08:29:44,398
happening because they really have no

12489
08:29:44,398 --> 08:29:45,440
idea

12490
08:29:45,440 --> 08:29:47,440
and have a look at the data you have how

12491
08:29:47,440 --> 08:29:49,520
you can protect it what you can do what

12492
08:29:49,520 --> 08:29:51,200
is its real value because as soon as you

12493
08:29:51,200 --> 08:29:53,520
put a value on things it becomes a

12494
08:29:53,520 --> 08:29:55,120
different conversation

12495
08:29:55,120 --> 08:29:57,280
and focus on the data that you have for

12496
08:29:57,280 --> 08:29:59,280
each employee to say we've got

12497
08:29:59,280 --> 08:30:00,558
everything all of your personal

12498
08:30:00,558 --> 08:30:02,638
identifiable information here we want to

12499
08:30:02,638 --> 08:30:04,878
protect it so this is a responsibility

12500
08:30:04,878 --> 08:30:06,160
of yours it's not just about our

12501
08:30:06,160 --> 08:30:09,280
customer data or our ip it's about your

12502
08:30:09,280 --> 08:30:12,558
information as well so incorporate that

12503
08:30:12,558 --> 08:30:14,478
because what you're embarking on is a

12504
08:30:14,478 --> 08:30:16,478
whole of organization change management

12505
08:30:16,478 --> 08:30:19,040
program that results in everyone making

12506
08:30:19,040 --> 08:30:20,558
better decisions when it comes to

12507
08:30:20,558 --> 08:30:23,200
security ensuring all regulatory and

12508
08:30:23,200 --> 08:30:25,520
compliance elements are achieved risk is

12509
08:30:25,520 --> 08:30:27,920
reduced and your people are a formidable

12510
08:30:27,920 --> 08:30:30,478
human firewall and a culture of security

12511
08:30:30,478 --> 08:30:32,878
is actually created

12512
08:30:32,878 --> 08:30:35,280
it's not just that train the people as i

12513
08:30:35,280 --> 08:30:37,360
mentioned all right quickly with what we

12514
08:30:37,360 --> 08:30:39,600
do at know before the platform we have

12515
08:30:39,600 --> 08:30:42,398
provides that we train the people we can

12516
08:30:42,398 --> 08:30:44,638
fish them and do other simulated social

12517
08:30:44,638 --> 08:30:47,040
engineering and the reporting that we

12518
08:30:47,040 --> 08:30:50,000
provide can give you

12519
08:30:57,760 --> 08:30:58,958
oh

12520
08:30:58,958 --> 08:31:00,558
i think we had a bit of an issue there

12521
08:31:00,558 --> 08:31:01,520
so

12522
08:31:01,520 --> 08:31:02,878
unfortunately

12523
08:31:02,878 --> 08:31:05,280
that is going to be the last talk of the

12524
08:31:05,280 --> 08:31:06,718
