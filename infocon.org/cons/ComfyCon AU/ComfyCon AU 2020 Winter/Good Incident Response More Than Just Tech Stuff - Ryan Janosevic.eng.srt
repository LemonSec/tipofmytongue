1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,969
there is Ryan so Ryan has spent his

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,219
entire career working in cybersecurity

3
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:14,678
which was entirely by accident he spent

4
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:16,329
six years at the a CSC working in the

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,130
incident response team before heading up

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,738
the joint cybersecurity sensor program

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,810
briefly as its national director

8
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:24,880
currently he's the co-founder and chief

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,070
operating officer at retrospect Labs a

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,099
security startup that specializes in

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,320
cybersecurity exercises Ryan you were

12
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:33,730
ready to go I sure AM everyone can see

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,380
my screen or you guys can see my screen

14
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,989
we can see your screen you're all good

15
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,180
he's working which is ironic because as

16
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,680
IANS just noted I am useless at

17
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,600
technology and that's definitely not my

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,880
background so that's what I'm here to

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,480
talk to you guys about today how I kind

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,190
of fell into Incident Response or IR why

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,319
I think it's really cool and I guess

22
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,150
some of the skills that you maybe need

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,700
to think about including in your IR

24
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:01,870
teams not just from a technical

25
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:04,629
perspective so just a little bit about

26
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:08,140
me I guess you guys have either read or

27
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:10,510
heard the bio that just very kindly read

28
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,820
out at the moment I'm the co-founder and

29
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,580
chief operating officer at retrospect

30
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,220
labs which is awesome because it means I

31
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,289
get to live in Melbourne which is much

32
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,600
better in my humble opinion than my

33
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,970
former job which was one of the incident

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,130
response leads at the Australian

35
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,530
cybersecurity Center but that meant that

36
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,869
I spent seven years in cold wintery

37
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,630
Canberra now for those of you that are

38
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:36,610
in Melbourne today it feels like camera

39
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,158
it's about 14 15 degrees and bloody

40
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,930
freezing so I'm reliving my Canberra

41
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,060
night terrors but I did have a really

42
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:46,299
great time in Canberra at the ACS sea

43
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,970
and it was a really really awesome space

44
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:51,100
to kick off my career in cyber and in

45
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,470
incident response particularly I think

46
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,199
one of the cool things about the ACS see

47
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,670
was actually how they did I are so

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,939
admittedly not entirely sure how other

49
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,530
organizations do I are at the moment but

50
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:04,960
I think the ACS II did it pretty well

51
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,700
although I am biased and the ACS see

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,038
really broke their Incident Response ops

53
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,409
up into two kind of roles or two

54
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,119
different functions so we had the

55
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:15,519
incident responders who were your

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,130
technical traditional forensic analysts

57
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,590
looking at you know images of hosts

58
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,230
memory dumps that kind of thing looking

59
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,780
at malware working out what the actor

60
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,459
had done I'm a machine or a network how

61
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,440
they could investigate it how they could

62
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,690
remediate it and then we had another

63
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,920
kind of team of group of people like

64
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,070
myself called operations coordinators

65
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,470
OCS

66
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,970
and our focus was much more on managing

67
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,270
the Incident Response operation as a

68
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,690
whole so basically a bird's-eye view of

69
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:48,010
every single component of the IR op

70
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,930
which was pretty cool working with the

71
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,209
victim managing the strategic

72
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,030
relationships the strategic messaging

73
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:57,880
all the comms and basically corralling

74
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,250
all of the troops the acs CSI our

75
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,310
activities were pretty big and kind of

76
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,950
significant so often we'd have 30 or 40

77
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,870
people working full-time on any one

78
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,489
incident response activity so it was

79
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,830
really really cool it was really really

80
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:15,070
fun possibly the best job that I ever

81
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,360
had it was awesome and guess just

82
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,560
looking at that slide they're all of

83
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,580
those threat reports and a CSE put out

84
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,560
all of those incident response

85
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,390
activities the case studies in there are

86
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,270
ones that I actively worked which is

87
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:32,109
really really awesome so what did a

88
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:34,330
typical IR look like at the ACS sea they

89
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:37,600
were kind of big so typically four six

90
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,370
eight months a lot of time spent gaining

91
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,230
visibility of the network trying to

92
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,900
understand what the actor had done on

93
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,459
the network how they done it and how we

94
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,980
could stop them from doing it again or

95
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,860
continuing from doing it

96
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,720
usually a PT state based actors so

97
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,090
pretty kind of you know sophisticated

98
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,400
techniques will often investigating

99
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,620
although often simple things work well

100
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,270
as you would all know so sometimes

101
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,120
nothing fancy just simple things that

102
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,800
worked they always had extensive access

103
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,959
to the victim network that was a given

104
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,470
you know by the time we got called in

105
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,000
typically domain level admin had already

106
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,220
been gained they were throughout the

107
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,200
network which was probably why it took

108
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,579
us so long to kind of conduct these

109
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,200
operations because we had to be so

110
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,599
thorough to really understand where they

111
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,099
had gone and of course we were dealing

112
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,890
with really sensitive victim level

113
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,540
Victim networks so often government

114
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:32,090
networks or systems of national interest

115
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,620
systems of national

116
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,989
interest critical infrastructure

117
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,910
networks those kinds of things we

118
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,810
definitely couldn't afford to screw up

119
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:43,490
the ir activities we kind of know what

120
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,100
the purpose of ir is right we're all

121
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,169
here doing IR to make sure we minimize

122
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,160
the impact of any incident we want to

123
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:51,560
stop it spread

124
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,330
minimize its harm and restore services

125
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,850
of business functions so that the

126
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,280
organization can keep going on and keep

127
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,600
conducting its business and of course we

128
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,820
really want to know what the act is done

129
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,729
on the network how they did it the tools

130
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,990
that they used to do it etc etc our main

131
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:07,789
goal is really to keep the business

132
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,590
operating and I think that's a really

133
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,780
important thing for organizations to

134
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,150
recognize is the IR is really an enabler

135
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,349
for business it's a critical function in

136
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,659
this day and age when we're all

137
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,580
connected to the Internet but it's a

138
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,740
hard job it's really tough there's a

139
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,659
range of actors out there we're

140
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,700
constantly battling them they're highly

141
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,410
motivated individuals as you will all

142
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,120
know and they're always coming up with

143
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,280
new techniques that we have to think

144
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,380
about and defend against that means new

145
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,719
challenges that means new things to look

146
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,039
for analyze and respond to and that

147
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,200
means we need to have kind of you know

148
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,560
the most awesome best team in place so

149
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,680
that we can do that so in order to be

150
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,220
fully awesome I think we really need a

151
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,940
blend of tech and non tech skills

152
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,000
it's probably nothing groundbreaking

153
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,710
that I'm going to talk about tonight but

154
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,419
I think some of these basic things are

155
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,909
often overlooked in IR and we tend to

156
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:01,190
just focus on that technical aspect the

157
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,050
tech aspect is absolutely important it

158
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,789
is essential obviously I are doesn't

159
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,990
exist without it but I think it's a

160
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:08,120
whole lot of other skills that we need

161
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,270
to make sure incorporating to these

162
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,950
teams so as we said you know I oh it's

163
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,010
really fun really really challenging

164
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,450
it's much broader than it used to be

165
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:20,270
it's not just that technical response

166
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:23,060
anymore it's increasingly increasingly

167
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:25,639
it's apart the rest of the organization

168
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,919
is about how you manage the media public

169
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,440
messaging report to the Privacy

170
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,570
Commissioner talk to your customers all

171
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,010
of those kinds of things so it really

172
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,139
kind of makes sense when you look at ER

173
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,120
and that broader sense that you need

174
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,880
more than just your technical skill base

175
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,950
to do IR properly to really excel at it

176
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,330
I guess there's no point in having

177
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,430
someone that's really really brilliant

178
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,870
really really technically brilliant

179
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,490
if their brilliance isn't able to be

180
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,820
communicated effectively up to the rest

181
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:55,850
of the organization seniors

182
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:58,190
decision-makers etc etc so I think I ask

183
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,500
definitely a team sport

184
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,960
personally I've got no time for people

185
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,340
who don't respect technical skills and

186
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,489
I've definitely got no time for people

187
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,349
who don't respect non tech skills it's

188
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,729
really important we all need each other

189
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,039
and if we're going to win these kind of

190
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:16,310
you know battles that were up against we

191
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,840
all need to support each other so I

192
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,050
think that's kind of you know broadly

193
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,119
speaking four key skills five if you're

194
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,210
a bit like me and your bit cheeky four

195
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,229
key skills that we all really need to

196
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,340
master and these are the kinds of things

197
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:30,409
that we're going to talk about to make

198
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:35,239
sure your idea I our team is ready to

199
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:37,550
excel obviously communication that is

200
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,139
almost a given right you want to be able

201
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,740
to control the information from the

202
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:43,639
first minute and i--i an incident occurs

203
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,849
you're going to control the information

204
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,979
spread bring people in early keep them

205
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:50,539
informed and make sure that your minute

206
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:53,360
central the day know that you're the

207
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:55,130
central font of all information to do

208
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,020
that effectively though you really need

209
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,300
to be able to talk to absolutely

210
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,090
everyone in the organization senior

211
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,520
execs your analyst across the court

212
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,020
print from corporate letter information

213
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,219
is really really useful and you've got

214
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,500
to make sure that they're getting the

215
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,110
right information you need to understand

216
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,159
what to communicate to them and that

217
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,360
means you need to understand what

218
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,820
they're going to do with the information

219
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,620
that you're giving them so you need to

220
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,449
make sure we give me the media team the

221
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,849
right information so they can create

222
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:24,289
that public messaging properly you need

223
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:26,330
to make sure that you're giving the

224
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,190
senior exec the right information so

225
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,010
that they can make that right business

226
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:33,349
decision that involves updating and very

227
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,240
regularly and consistently that really

228
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,300
helps build trust and if you have trust

229
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,529
believe me it'll go a long long way

230
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,789
people won't doubt you and you don't

231
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:42,469
want to be doubted when you're in this

232
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,800
stressful situation of responding to an

233
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:47,660
incident I find running regular sink

234
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,699
meetings really really helpful and I

235
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,770
also find breaking them up often really

236
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,570
really useful so keeping a more

237
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,790
technical oriented sink where you can

238
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,650
have kind of that technical

239
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:00,019
problem-solving discussion and then a

240
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:02,629
difference more strategic sink just for

241
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:05,149
executives the media your legal team etc

242
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:07,610
etc so I would usually take the

243
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:09,589
information that I was learning in that

244
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,509
technical sink fact check it

245
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:13,610
double-check it with the technical guys

246
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:16,220
so that I had interpreted correctly and

247
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,709
then go and present that information to

248
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,600
the non-technical if you light sink so

249
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:22,878
that they could digest it and use it in

250
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,809
the right way and make sure that I guess

251
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,639
you know you're communicating

252
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:27,949
effectively between those groups of

253
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:30,350
people that's where for more updates

254
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:32,389
comes in is a really really useful tool

255
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,889
so making sure that people know when

256
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:36,019
they're going to get an update that

257
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:38,809
helps stopping them constantly coming to

258
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:40,220
you with questions the frequency that

259
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:42,079
you want to send those updates out

260
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,239
really does depend I guess on the

261
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:46,399
severity of the incident how comfortable

262
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:48,679
the organization is that you're dealing

263
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,259
with maybe even the maturity of the

264
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:53,389
organization that you're dealing with

265
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:55,819
but I'd say certainly daily at the start

266
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:58,309
of a big incident twice daily if needs

267
00:09:55,819 --> 00:10:00,319
be and then making that you know letting

268
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:02,118
that taper off as time goes by it

269
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,529
doesn't need to be constant it's just

270
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:04,970
about making sure that people know that

271
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,869
they've got the most up-to-date and

272
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:10,009
current information

273
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:12,279
I guess ironically we all know that in

274
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:15,410
cyber information changes really quickly

275
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:17,209
so information that's critical at the

276
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,639
moment is what you need to really think

277
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:22,399
about what the particular paying points

278
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,990
are for your organization so that you

279
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,549
can identify them early on and

280
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,319
communicate any issues around them

281
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:29,990
quickly and effectively to whoever you

282
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:31,759
need to talk to I always think it's

283
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,850
better to bring people in loop them in

284
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,869
early give them a heads up and even if

285
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,179
it's not something that you're a hundred

286
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:40,429
percent sure is going to occur or

287
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,290
whether that has occurred if you're just

288
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:44,509
warning them of the potential impacts

289
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:48,349
etc I think that's a much better place

290
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:50,269
to be rather than oh we now know

291
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,919
this definitely did happen but again I

292
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:53,779
think that kind of looking back to what

293
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,610
we were talking about earlier in terms

294
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,199
of building trust is something you can

295
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,779
only really do if you have that trust

296
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:02,059
with those people so information can be

297
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:03,559
used to build that trust but we're all

298
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:04,969
going to make sure that we kind of have

299
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,769
that mutual respect for how we're

300
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,079
communicating with each other and that

301
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:12,199
that trust is there so making sure we've

302
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:13,469
got clear concise consistent and regular

303
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:15,689
information for our

304
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:19,770
consumers is a really really important

305
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:22,050
thing all right the other thing that's

306
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,939
super important obviously relationship

307
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,140
management starting to feel a little bit

308
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,850
like a job application rights

309
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,470
presentations these are some of the kind

310
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,120
of things that you might expect to talk

311
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,680
about there but I think it's really

312
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,050
important that you have good

313
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,760
relationships in the organization that

314
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,640
you're working with or your customer the

315
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,250
victim or or victim organization if you

316
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,510
can before an incident happens if you

317
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,730
already have their trust if they at

318
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,290
least know your face know your name know

319
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,450
kind of what your role is that's going

320
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,430
to make it a lot easier for you when you

321
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,530
are that person to go and potentially

322
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,569
ruin their day their week their month or

323
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:56,550
that year by letting them know that

324
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,220
you've got an incident there's nothing

325
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,849
worse than you being constantly

326
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,460
second-guessed during an incident

327
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,200
response activity or being directed down

328
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,000
a path that you know is the wrong way to

329
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,170
go or that you don't want to go just

330
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
because you don't have to trust your

331
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,740
senior management so making sure that

332
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,630
you're building that trust wherever you

333
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,660
can whether that's internal in your own

334
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,740
organization or with your customers

335
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,480
whenever you can is really really useful

336
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,700
and remember that it's a two-way street

337
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,070
the whole relationship thing you've got

338
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,500
to be able to work across every part of

339
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,120
the organization the IR team should

340
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,410
absolutely be the central team when

341
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,420
there's an incident and you've got to

342
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,079
make sure you've got firm control of the

343
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,969
situation

344
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,220
so having relationships really really

345
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,620
helps you do that knowing who to talk to

346
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,840
the right people in the right roles is

347
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,260
not going to do you any harm it's only

348
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,520
going to serve you really really well

349
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,680
negotiating you know you're going to

350
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,640
have some tough just tough decisions to

351
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,459
make during an incident response

352
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:53,220
operation that might be switching off a

353
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,500
certain part of the network to protect

354
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:59,010
the broader network that might be

355
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,540
shutting down you know particular parts

356
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:03,360
of the network that serve certain

357
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,640
customers and and really annoying those

358
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,020
customers it's really really tough so

359
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,970
you're going to have to balance all of

360
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,400
these different issues with the core

361
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,620
objective of minimizing the impact of

362
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,449
the incident so you've got to have those

363
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,370
relationships in place use your

364
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,200
excellent communication skills as we've

365
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,270
discussed to make sure that you can have

366
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,520
those difficult conversations build

367
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,870
those relationships over time and really

368
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,180
get sure that you're getting that trust

369
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,830
from most people and I guess

370
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,140
that comes back to your ability to

371
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,570
persuade people as well so using the

372
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,880
right information negotiating with them

373
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,680
and basically bringing them on board

374
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,840
bringing them on that instant response

375
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,880
journey so that you all get to the right

376
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,390
goal together rather than separately

377
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,620
which is just not fun during an IR op

378
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,900
incident response ops are really messy

379
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,060
they're really stressful they're really

380
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,770
busy no one actually knows what's going

381
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,489
on so you need to make sure that people

382
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:58,319
know that your IR team is absolutely

383
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,940
late you're absolutely going to smash it

384
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,160
out of the park and you're doing your

385
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,750
very very best and make sure that

386
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,339
they've got that trust in that faith in

387
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,380
you that you're out there doing the

388
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:10,470
right thing it's only going to help you

389
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:14,939
during your IR operations to just head

390
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:17,610
down them up and get the work done the

391
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,100
ability to do strategic analysis so

392
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,380
definitely not talking about down in the

393
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,200
weeds technical analysis again that's

394
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:28,260
super important but more the ability to

395
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:32,010
join those high-level dots so I think

396
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,840
I've seen that domain before or hmm

397
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,610
there's a bit of a trend going on here

398
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,880
you know we had this kind of fishing

399
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:40,560
activity recently or I know you know the

400
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,240
threat environments changed in this way

401
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,729
and maybe this is something we're seeing

402
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,060
now I heard that this energy company in

403
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:50,460
Iran suffered a similar attack recently

404
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:52,709
those kinds of you know analytical finds

405
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,450
are really really useful so definitely

406
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,460
let your technical analysts do that

407
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:58,800
detailed tech work you should just be

408
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,470
able to bring all of that together and

409
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,640
maintain that central kind of

410
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,930
coordination role that's so critical in

411
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:09,330
an IR operation part of that's also

412
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,969
understanding the business knowing the

413
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,310
organization that you're working with

414
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,090
understanding its pain points

415
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,369
understanding the potential implications

416
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:20,070
of decisions that you're making or that

417
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,840
you're recommending to executives and

418
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,640
using the information you have to really

419
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,920
predict and warn them or possible

420
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,410
scenarios so being able to pull all of

421
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,390
those different things together can be

422
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,969
quite hard to take in that giant you

423
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:35,370
know 1000 foot high level view of the

424
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,960
world but I think people will thank you

425
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,290
if you're the one that's maintaining

426
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:42,509
visibility of the 75 different moving

427
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:45,809
of an IR up and just enabling them as

428
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:47,369
specialists to go and do their role so

429
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:49,769
news use your knowledge to really think

430
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:51,089
outside the box and just you know just

431
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:52,739
remember that you're empowered to make

432
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:54,869
some cool decisions here or you're

433
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:58,019
really empowered through your amazing

434
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:59,519
strategic not analytical skills to give

435
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,509
someone the right information to go and

436
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,879
do something different

437
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:05,220
I think that's a really really useful

438
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,569
thing and it could be quite hard when

439
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,999
you've got a whole bunch of people

440
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:10,919
focused on the extreme technical detail

441
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:12,449
to kind of just take a moment and lift

442
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,169
yourself back up and think about the

443
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,878
bigger picture

444
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:17,039
think about your broader incident

445
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:21,410
response operation and how that fits

446
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:24,449
into the rest of the organization and

447
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:27,389
lastly being able to identify good

448
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:29,878
opportunities so who else in the

449
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:33,749
organization can help you individuals

450
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:36,089
teams what about external organizations

451
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:38,129
you know is it a time that you call in

452
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:40,859
some expertise from another incident

453
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:43,109
response provider or do you contact the

454
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:45,059
ACS see perhaps because you know you

455
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:46,439
really need some of their knowledge or

456
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:48,209
you're hoping that they've got some

457
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:51,269
secret source material that can maybe

458
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:53,849
help you out who can bolster your skills

459
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:55,410
who can bolster the care capability of

460
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,389
your team what kind of areas are you

461
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:01,049
strong in where what areas do you need

462
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:03,389
help in again internal and external to

463
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:05,069
the organization if it's a true crisis

464
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:07,620
organizations should absolutely be

465
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:10,230
working together supporting each other

466
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:12,510
cyber impacts is also there's no point

467
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,799
in one of us suffering a cyber incident

468
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,959
we know it's going to happen to all of

469
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,490
us at some point in time what are the

470
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,689
other things that you can do to really

471
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,870
help drive your incident response

472
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:25,459
operation forward they could be big they

473
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:28,319
could be small could be as little as

474
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:30,059
making sure that you're feeding and

475
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,519
supporting your team giving them energy

476
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:35,370
drinks red ball buying coffee all the

477
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:38,129
way through to you know somehow

478
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:40,739
supporting some crazy new idea about

479
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:42,928
disconnecting from the internet for 72

480
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,399
hours just for fun to really get an

481
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:47,100
understanding of what the actors done on

482
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:48,750
your network thinking about things as I

483
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,129
guess differently as possible and

484
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,230
looking at those different opportunities

485
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:53,520
that you see so that you can take

486
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,710
advantage of them

487
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,990
I guess an incident is always a good

488
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:01,860
time to try and take advantage of it and

489
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:03,600
so we want to be not too outrageous but

490
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,540
we also want to remember that it is a

491
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,399
good time to maybe put forward some

492
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,350
ideas that you've had or that your team

493
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,700
is trying to work towards get some of

494
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,620
that capability that you might be

495
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,800
lacking in you've been pestering your

496
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:19,770
Saizo or you see a CIO for a while that

497
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,860
could be a new tool yeah don't go panic

498
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:24,270
buying a good hoarding toilet paper that

499
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,949
just maybe have a think about some of

500
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,000
those things that you really need that

501
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,610
you perhaps haven't had an opportunity

502
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,100
to get before there's no shame in doing

503
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,870
it after an incident I'm pretty sure

504
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,120
most organizations go and spend a whole

505
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,830
lot of money on a whole lot of kit so

506
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,060
you may as well make sure that it's the

507
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,470
right kind of stuff that you actually

508
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,780
need and that you're actually going to

509
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:47,850
use to help you know your sock your IR

510
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:49,260
function improve so I think you know

511
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,209
we've done a very quick run-through and

512
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,540
I'm conscious that I am standing between

513
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,190
you and dinner virtually not physically

514
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,930
but if we can kind of add some of these

515
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,540
skill sets in and really we're talking

516
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:03,270
about kind of you know four broad common

517
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,310
skills no one has to be an expert in any

518
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,290
one of them but just having that I guess

519
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,970
in the back of your mind is some

520
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:12,120
additional things that we could all work

521
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,890
to to really really improve IR and make

522
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,570
it that really really organizational

523
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,580
function I still think that's a really

524
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,770
good outcome Incident Response is

525
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,889
absolutely a team sport

526
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:24,629
again there's no I in team hahaha but it

527
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,130
really is a team sport you know we all

528
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,290
need these diverse skills to come

529
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,150
together so that we can do good incident

530
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,889
response and I think if we're doing good

531
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,290
incident response then we're really

532
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,240
limiting harm we're limiting the impact

533
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,159
of an incident we're limiting the cost

534
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,290
of an incident to an organization and

535
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,830
we're all fundamentally doing our jobs a

536
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:45,980
fair bit better

537
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,330
so just very lastly I think team

538
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,950
important is one of the most team

539
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:51,289
development sorry is one of the most

540
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,029
important things that we can do as a

541
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:55,220
manager I think it's something we should

542
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:57,230
all be investing in for our staff so

543
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,929
whether that's sending them on courses

544
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,610
giving them work time to come to awesome

545
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:03,769
events like this on the weekend for

546
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,658
instance all of those things if you can

547
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:08,269
help build your team if you can build

548
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:10,100
technical n soft skills you're going to

549
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:11,120
have much more rounded individuals

550
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,830
you're going to have a much more

551
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,600
cohesive team and they're going to be

552
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,549
able to do the job much better when the

553
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,139
time inevitably comes that they have to

554
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,570
get in and do that Incident Response pop

555
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:23,658
I think that kind of goes for a lot of

556
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,950
organizational roles not just IR but I

557
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:27,980
think it is something that we kind of

558
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:31,070
forget about we often just focus on one

559
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,409
skill set so that might be forensics or

560
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,879
one particular tool but you know those

561
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:36,620
soft skills are still really really

562
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,870
important when you combine them with the

563
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,580
tech skills you've got an awesome person

564
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,709
you've got an awesome team if you can

565
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,210
balance that in your team you're gonna

566
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,190
have the best life as a manager it's

567
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,840
gonna be so much easier so it's

568
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,909
definitely what I try and build in my

569
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,379
teams and I hope it's something that you

570
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:54,529
guys can all start to build if you're

571

eloquently described the the interaction

592
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:46,869
between the sort of technical sides and

593
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,340
the non technical sides and what I

594
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:50,830
really love is talking about that bigger

595
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,269
picture piece like if it's one thing

596

598
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,489
