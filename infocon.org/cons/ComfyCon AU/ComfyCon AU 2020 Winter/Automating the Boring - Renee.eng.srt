00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:33,520
desktop Support Jackie um sysadmin done

19
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:36,850
all the front end dirty work given the

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,500
poor infrastructure and said make it

21
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:46,030
work and my talk today is gonna cover a

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:48,670
little bit of the wacky things the silly

23
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:53,350
things the oh my god who did what things

24
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:58,360
that I have discovered while being UNIX

25
00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:00,579
this admin working in all kinds of

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,189
environments I've come through banks

27
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:05,169
I've done defense I've done state

28
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:08,149
government I've done tertiary education

29
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,640
and every single one of them

30
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:12,110
has got some audio God facepalm moments

31
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,619
that they have created in their

32
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,620
infrastructure

33
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,159
my current feeling of work is that I'm

34
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,840
doing a lot of system automation and

35
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,929
orchestrations are working with other

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,390
danceable various types of scripting

37
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:33,739
[Music]

38
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:37,488
with a view towards providing metrics

39
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:40,040
data knowledge up to the business layer

40
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:46,959
so they can learn how to make better

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,959
decisions all right we shall start

42
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:59,930
no come on clicky do the quickie right

43
00:02:54,579 --> 00:03:02,450
please be aware some of the stuff that I

44
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:05,359
had discovered will make you cringe if

45
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,280
you have a propensity towards flirting

46
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:09,379
your coffee through you I'm on to your

47
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:17,359
keyboard I recommend putting your coffee

48
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:20,480
cup down now we start with why would you

49
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:23,989
want to automate your user account

50
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,268
creation process we know that we want to

51
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:28,819
give least privileged privileged access

52
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:31,910
to our application admins

53
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:35,690
rc-aid means our end users what happens

54
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,980
when you don't well you have what

55
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,690
happens when I turned up at a recent

56
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,569
engagement where I looked at my account

57
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:44,449
and went I have Enterprise at me why do

58
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:46,879
I have enterprise admin on a check that

59
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:50,359
a single domain account no trees no

60
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,739
forests but 12 people had enterprise

61
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:53,739
admin on their account

62
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:58,959
they included two service accounts I

63
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:03,530
kept digging into my account and went

64
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,390
alright there's a bunch of other prints

65
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,220
in here that will be useful and not

66
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,518
necessary but it useful so I can have

67
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,680
I've got full control over the

68
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,299
confluence site the JIRA apps alright

69
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,820
I'm not normally employed as this is

70
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,709
admin this role but I've got the skills

71
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:23,539
I can do that wait I've got domain admin

72
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:29,120
again I did a quick scan through that

73
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:32,750
particular forest although that

74
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,199
particular set of user probes and did a

75
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:39,979
count on how many people had domain

76
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:44,690
admin prints for a business unit which

77
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:49,039
had 43 people in a total organization of

78
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:51,919
I think about 110 we had 65 accounts

79
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:54,259
with the main admin for service accounts

80
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:59,090
and to object account to computer

81
00:04:54,259 --> 00:05:04,550
objects and about 20 people who had left

82
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:09,590
but accounts were still active what we

83
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:11,900
take away from this is build process

84
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,909
that follows from when you bring a

85
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,489
person into your organization have a

86
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:17,060
process that you just click three or

87
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,190
four buttons

88
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,930
theory and all the magic happens in the

89
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,250
background you don't have to think about

90
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,130
it you don't have to worry about getting

91
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:29,599
it right or getting it wrong there is a

92
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:32,240
process that has been automated that

93
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:34,940
saves you these paints and same again

94
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,260
when it's time for people to leave your

95
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,130
organization have all the automation put

96
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,099
in the background

97
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,020
such that it's not the city admins doing

98
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:48,460
the work it can be an HR person who just

99
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,460
says thank you button

100
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,870
get disabled and then you're a period of

101
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,120
time later they you they lock themselves

102
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:59,500
they shut down

103
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:06,050
and we don't leave gaping security holes

104
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:10,520
behind in our infrastructure a minor

105
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:12,560
other one is wrapped around UNIX root

106
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,960
access where we have a similar proof of

107
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,630
you know the account which can do

108
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,630
anything and everything on your server

109
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,370
in most scenarios root access is really

110
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:34,130
only necessary when you're doing your

111
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:38,720
initial build of a server and then

112
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:42,440
during serious recovery issues

113
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:46,070
99% of a service life you don't need it

114
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:49,280
so you rarely log into it you let your

115
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,469
automated tools do the monitoring you

116
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,650
let your service accounts to the

117
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:58,190
management you split off responsibility

118
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:00,200
of processes you into a web server

119
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:03,860
you let your web server process handle

120
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,770
it stuff and you say okay things but

121
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,340
when you have an environment that is

122
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,340
poorly managed

123
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:20,258
you end up with new ssh route being 11

124
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:21,489
and then as I discovered when I went to

125
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:22,990
say alright who's logged into the

126
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,159
bastion host today so I can find out

127
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,479
who's on site that I can have a

128
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,330
conversation we have to talk about its

129
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,740
particular issue I found and I have six

130
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,969
routes logged in and they're all remote

131
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,370
did you did

132
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,500
all right remote access has been remote

133
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:39,220
root SSH access is enabled on the

134
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,930
bastion host and what they have SSH as

135
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:45,030
route to all of their application

136
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:48,030
service that entire team was using route

137
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,030
everywhere

138
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:56,170
they used it for copying files they used

139
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:56,170
it for anything and everything

140
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:04,130
the I had the epic facepalm that day I

141
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,630
almost walked out of the building and

142
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,890
said I can't work with this job this is

143
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,770
this is too much

144
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:19,310
this is beyond reasonable for oh my god

145
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:23,150
what the Ari the root cause was we

146
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:25,960
had four directory trees running in that

147
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:30,049
environment for independent

148
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:34,059
authentication sources none of which had

149
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:36,380
been properly deployed or or which soon

150
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:38,809
they'd been deployed some survivors have

151
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,570
been tied against them and then another

152
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:43,280
directory had been deployed because

153
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,890
reasons and more servers were tied to

154
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,829
the new one so there were there's no

155
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,560
consistency of authentication across our

156
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,990
entire environment you needed to be we

157
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,459
had I think about eight passwords just

158
00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:01,330
to get to the six or seven servants that

159
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,330
that team were managing

160
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,640
away from access to reporting on their

161
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,200
systems

162
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:21,280
I like metrics I like being able to give

163
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,720
metrics to my colleagues I like being

164
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,270
able to say eight years of pretty graphs

165
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,460
would demonstrate that this 5:00 p.m.

166
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,120
every Friday this server has a consumer

167
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:32,350
we can go and have a look at it

168
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,940
too many environments have come across

169
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:39,520
has my monotreme just just none which I

170
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,920
say the monitoring system is he uses

171
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,079
when something goes wrong but you're a

172
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,500
person walks up your desk and says hey

173
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,820
hey Jerry I can't get into the the

174
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,230
production finite system have you said

175
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,400
you know anything wrong with that and

176
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,570
you go wait I'll check in on that uh

177
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,670
Lauren please no I never let that happen

178
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,400
never Lee let never let that be the norm

179
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:05,800
for your organization have it be where

180
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:09,040
you can say yes I'm aware of that yeah

181
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,469
Billy blue over in apps is fixing that

182
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,000
he's aware of it we've got under control

183
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:16,660
we should haven't response back to you

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,839
in maybe next 10-15 minutes or the best

185
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,150
one that I've come across was when

186
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,830
somebody has an issue they've wandered

187
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,180
down you desk and go hey there's an

188
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,040
issue and you go yeah we've got that

189
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,150
five minutes ago text already and you by

190
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,730
the time they're back at their dentist

191
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:38,069
by the time they reached the problem has

192
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:42,060
been resolved but I've come across

193
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:45,360
I lose count now of the number of times

194
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:49,739
when I've been assigned to an

195
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:54,660
organization and there's been no event

196
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:56,670
no syslog event aggregation not even on

197
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:02,280
the windows kit which is really easy to

198
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:06,209
do monitoring is at best minimal a fault

199
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,350
reporting is the your colleagues and end

200
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:12,590
users wandering around the building

201
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:15,740
telling you about what's gone wrong and

202
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:28,140
you get as what I send down the bottom

203
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:29,700
uses I'm frustrated about this but there

204
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:34,439
are better things we can do there are

205
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:35,310
more things we can do to make it users

206
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,700
can do whatever they like

207
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:42,060
but when sis had means and developers

208
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:46,560
are pushed into the world of testing and

209
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:51,239
prod you get all kinds of strange

210
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:54,449
strange stuff happening as well I had

211
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,750
the hard hard case of a couple years ago

212
00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:01,110
a piece of work that I was doing a proof

213
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:04,620
of concept on will suddenly dropped onto

214
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:06,450
was suddenly said you this is now live

215
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,190
you have to use this in production and

216
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,350
the two of us working on it which is

217
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,790
like a heart helper now this is not

218
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,340
ready this has got another three months

219
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,250
worth of development work in it before

220
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,840
we can even consider putting it to test

221
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:21,710
let alone production that's it no no if

222
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,710
we want to be using it now

223
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,330
we got to develop input which meant that

224
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,600
we got to develop for all of the mice

225
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:34,660
love the edge cases we had in profit but

226
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,140
how development cycle was just throwing

227
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:40,630
out the window we came out of that I

228
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:44,980
think about eight weeks worth of work

229
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:46,779
we've no documentation we had to go

230
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,330
through and then review everything and

231
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:50,770
put all of the code back in to back you

232
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:53,230
back into our dev environment

233
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,390
roll up the documentation read all the

234
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:59,410
tests and then run it through the test

235
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:02,080
environment and into product but why why

236
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,540
won't we push to develop in prod and not

237
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,589
actually functionally run it through our

238
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:12,579
dev test prod regulus type deployment

239
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:15,550
process was because none of us could

240
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,050
trust the environment in death it was

241
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,479
significantly different different enough

242
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:22,390
again from test that any work we did in

243
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,880
dev was effectively redeveloped in tests

244
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,650
and tests was once again different

245
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,360
enough from production that we had to

246
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:36,000
redo all the testing again anyway so our

247
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,900
business process and business flow when

248
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,890
it's going to be cheaper and easier to

249
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,890
all the development and probe

250
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,279
we come away from this is this is a

251
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,980
security comes from operational

252
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:01,139
excellence is a phrase I came across on

253
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,480
Twitter a couple of years ago and I

254
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:06,120
write it down on every way or that I

255
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:10,980
come across in way my work places these

256
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:13,740
days it innate the concept of

257
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:17,670
operational excellence to me means that

258
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:22,410
you you give your front-end

259
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:25,920
ops staff sufficient tooling to do their

260
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,839
job you train them you give them the

261
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,759
knowledge and the skills such that they

262
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,699
are competent at doing their job so that

263
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:36,569
they're not overwhelmed or constantly

264
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:38,880
fighting for knowledge to work out how

265
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:41,130
to do be the issue there's just music in

266
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,740
front of them they can look at it and go

267
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:46,259
oh yeah I've seen this before you know

268
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,779
my senior talked about this a couple of

269
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:50,310
weeks ago I know where to find it okay I

270
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,290
know where to find the process and I've

271
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,209
yeah I'm comfortable going through and

272
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:58,780
resolving this issue you don't want your

273
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:59,930
front-end staff constantly searching for

274
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,209
[Music]

275
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:05,599
that the process and the parts of how do

276
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:09,768
I do this

277
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,019
you give your infrastructure sufficient

278
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:15,269
management that it is stable that it is

279
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:19,019
that all of your implementations are

280
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:22,439
consistent so that when you deploy say a

281
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:24,449
Red Hat eight SOE server you have a

282
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:26,339
standard SOE which goes out and is

283
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:27,920
standard you know that there's going to

284
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,410
be a certain config

285
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,319
every server in your network it's not

286
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,029
going to be are these ones talking to

287
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:37,139
this NTP server over here and these ones

288
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:38,430
are talking about get up and over here

289
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,399
and these ones never got configured so

290
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:46,349
they're talking to near the pool servers

291
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:53,670
from from the default OS configuration

292
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:56,399
just little things like that I have seen

293
00:15:53,670 --> 00:16:00,209
where NTP get configure miss configure

294
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,370
configured just it led to inconsistent

295
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:08,109
behavior on our systems

296
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:11,980
you automate your deployment tooling you

297
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:14,700
automate your process creation you you

298
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:21,220
you your process has become automated

299
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:23,080
you get fewer fewer customizations

300
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,670
turning up in your environment your

301
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,240
dodgy hacks that you have to use to work

302
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:30,819
around a single thing sure we have to do

303
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,520
them but they get documented they become

304
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:36,400
part of the build process everyone is

305
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:39,040
aware of what's happening so you don't

306
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:44,410
get your unintended consequences

307
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:46,089
you get your documentation represent

308
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:53,380
your being an accurate representation of

309
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:56,680
what your environment actually is sorry

310
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:58,150
I don't open up for questions in a

311
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,729
couple of minutes and discussions and

312
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:06,639
your shared rants but remember the

313
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:10,300
within infrastructure if there is a

314
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,220
problem the cannot be what if there's a

315
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,760
problem in process people will work

316
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,790
around it

317
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:20,410
their end aim is to do their job

318
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:22,300
they may not want to they may not see it

319
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,490
as a good or a bad thing they just see

320
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:27,310
it as I need to do these things that I

321
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,050
can meet the requirements a project

322
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:35,110
manager or the business has placed upon

323
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:39,190
me and all concepts of security of good

324
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:42,100
process of good implementation go out

325
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,850
the window they may not be aware of them

326
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,550
they don't see them they don't

327
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,740
understand the consequences or the

328
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:54,040
problems that they caused from their

329
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:57,220
decision choices do manage your

330
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,340
privilege access and your concept of

331
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,720
least proof when you're creating

332
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:07,060
accounts and when you're bringing staff

333
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:12,070
in have a security model for users

334
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:14,500
groups applications computer objects may

335
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,290
you're monitoring your logging your

336
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:20,590
capacity management data collection just

337
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,180
automatic have it built into the OS into

338
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,899
your SOA so that when it computer goes

339
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,300
onto the network

340
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,170
be a network switch a Linux box and

341
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,750
Windows machine

342
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:32,380
it gets chatty with all of the data

343
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:36,940
aggravation I told you you have out

344
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:40,440
there and the one thing that I always

345
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:44,710
take away that I always try and talk and

346
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:48,100
stick into people is the security it's a

347
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,900
mindset it's not just a slap a bandaid

348
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,300
on the thing and it's done it is not

349
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,880
we've got some policies with we're

350
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:58,389
secure it is not here as their standard

351
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:03,730
procedures it's all of those things it's

352
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:06,780
the people you keep your people inside

353
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:08,890
you keep your people well maintained

354
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,200
your infrastructure becomes well

355
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:17,700
maintained your processes become well

356
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,700
maintained your business works thank you

357
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:25,240
thank you very much for that Renee I

358
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:28,750
know I was personally cringing a lot as

359
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:31,630
some of the examples I think it's really

360
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,310
useful and interesting to understand

361
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,110
automation and one of the things you

362
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,810
sort of brought up is the assurance of

363
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:39,490
the automation if you automate something

364
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,980
and you've documented that then you know

365
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,690
that's what it's going to do and so

366
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,670
having that so you know that your system

367
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,590
is to sign the right way and you know

368
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,930
that everything is you know doing what

369
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:52,709
it should then it's perfect so thank you

370
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,710
very much for that I know

371
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,879
you
