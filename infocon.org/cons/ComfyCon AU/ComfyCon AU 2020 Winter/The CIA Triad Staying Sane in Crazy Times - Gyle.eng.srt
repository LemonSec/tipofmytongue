1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,830
I will do now as I will hand over to our

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,350
next speaker are you ready girl awesome

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,910
so our next speaker is guile she grew up

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,199
during a brutal dictatorship and a

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,510
country riddled with all the natural

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,070
calamities happening on a frequent basis

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,929
I'm gonna read the whole one of this

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,349
because this is amazing writing by the

9
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:26,448
way she has survived wading through

10
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:30,198
dirty flood waters drinking potentially

11
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:32,060
radioactive coke and the y2k bug and

12
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,130
before moving to tax she trained as a

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,570
psychologist currently she works as a

14
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,910
cyber threat analyst where she works

15
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,399
from home a hundred percent and she's

16
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:43,279
going to talk to us today about a little

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,780
bit of a variation on the CIA triad so

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,780
thank you very much Kyle take it away

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,920
good morning good afternoon good evening

20
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:58,819
wherever you are so okay so one of the

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,559
main reasons why I decided to submit

22
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,469
this talk was that with the things

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,560
happening around me it was very

24
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:09,110
overwhelming and I decided to draw up on

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,640
my background in order to understand why

26
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,789
people are doing this what's like

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,829
happening everywhere and I wanted to

28
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:19,250
also share like you know what I've

29
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:21,139
talked about the past few weeks months

30
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,299
and everything that's happening here

31
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,030
that's why I call it the CIA triad

32
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:29,119
staying sane increasing times okay so

33
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:32,899
first of all verification this is not a

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,960
talk about tracking down this CIA

35
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:38,509
they're that pretty level agency and I'm

36
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,320
not gonna be talking about cybercrime

37
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:40,909
dams

38
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,949
you know like triads and all those

39
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:45,560
things are just classification despite

40
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,390
lead-pipe out it's not about red Intel

41
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,930
or cybercrime okay

42
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:54,049
so instead it's about the concept

43
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:57,710
pricing or reframing what we think about

44
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:59,509
the green mexico CIA in our community or

45
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,210
in the infrastructure cybersecurity

46
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:03,799
industry so everybody knows like what we

47
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,979
see is you have confidentiality

48
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,539
integrity availability I'm not gonna

49
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:11,480
defined all those things but if you're

50
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:15,290
interviewing for your cissp exam didn't

51
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:18,600
understand this okay so what I'm trying

52
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:22,079
to do now is like refrain describe into

53
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,150
understanding what is happening or what

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,120
has happened so i basically summarized

55
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,430
it into these three points like first

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,290
community and culture then individual

57
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,250
background and aspects I'm going to be

58
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:39,690
going through all of this individual

59
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,660
you know points here okay now I don't

60
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:46,260
know about you but everything like the

61
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:49,710
end of 2019 after like 20 20 I feel like

62
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,679
every morning I wake up it's like damage

63
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,740
report like what's happening and I have

64
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,510
this habit of like the first thing I

65
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,990
reach for when I wake up is equity in my

66
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,820
phone

67
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,740
I look at it I scroll through the news

68
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,299
and try to understand like you know

69
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,880
what's happening and especially in my

70
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,290
case because I have family all over the

71
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,269
world so I have family in different

72
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,820
parts of the world and I want to know

73
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:18,690
what's like happening there yeah so it's

74
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:21,959
like yeah every morning now one of the

75
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,210
first thing that I try to understand

76
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,830
when I encounter like any person I

77
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,840
always look at like you know where

78
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,690
they're coming from the community even

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:35,490
their you know cultural background so I

80
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:37,800
I was just like a maze it was in it felt

81
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,600
like a year ago but it was just the

82
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,110
first week of March when I first heard

83
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,230
about teepee shortage and you're like oh

84
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:51,750
my gosh what's like happening why are

85
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:54,959
people you know talking of wire people

86
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,570
you know boarding you know toilet paper

87
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:01,050
why is it like where's like people

88
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:03,750
fighting over toilet paper so I look at

89
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,120
it from a perspective of in terms of

90
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,850
cultural background so in terms of

91
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,190
cultural background we have different

92
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,380
ways of dealing with you know personal

93
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,890
hygiene okay so one of the things that I

94
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,839
put here if you could guess you know

95
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:21,320
google babble doctor aside from today so

96
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:25,070
you have those other options there so

97
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:29,370
this is something that is like quite

98
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:31,590
personal to us and to see something that

99
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,420
we take for granted but we need

100
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,520
the daily basis being gone from the

101
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,770
shelves just make sense that I need to

102
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,409
get this and I need to you know get as

103
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,479
much as I can now the other thing here

104
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,690
is that we have to think about community

105
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,600
you know our community like there are

106
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:53,570
people in our community who needs you

107
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:57,360
know who may not have the ability to

108
00:04:53,570 --> 00:05:00,630
drive around and look for different you

109
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,330
know for stores which tasks like you

110
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:07,200
know toilet paper so we have to like

111
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:09,419
think about we need to make sure that we

112
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,330
just take what we have instead of you

113
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:16,020
know taking a lot okay and I'm really

114
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:18,150
glad that immediately this you know the

115
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:26,400
big supermarkets here started you know

116
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:28,409
implementing limits so when I another

117
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,710
thing about trying to understand is the

118
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,480
individual background oh I have here pop

119
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,239
quiz I don't know whether you could like

120
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:41,160
see it right now so pop quiz so I come

121
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:45,210
from a country who was famous for for

122
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:48,630
someone heavy or hoarding 3000 pairs of

123
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:50,580
shoes okay I don't know whether

124
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,740
anybody's like in the tractor who would

125
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,500
be like you know chatting or like

126
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,490
popping up like okay so first of all to

127
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,260
say which particular country I came from

128
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,000
so if you could tell from my accent or

129
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,740
this pop quiz wherein we talk about

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,450
there's like three thousand pairs of

131
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:15,270
shoes so I grew up during a time where

132
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:18,060
yes thanks I saw that okay I grew up

133
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,520
during the time working there there was

134
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,860
a lot of scarcity it was there was this

135
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,680
massive difference either you're very

136
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:30,360
very poor or you're part of the good

137
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,650
ruling oligarchy okay and at that time I

138
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,990
really didn't know about excesses

139
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:37,289
because in a way I was quite sheltered

140
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:39,630
by my parents I remember going to the

141
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:42,180
supermarkets with them but it's not a

142
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:45,620
frequent thing and then years later I

143
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:48,419
realized that my parents did not take

144
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:51,300
grocery shopping we used to go you know

145
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:54,030
like monthly on a monthly basis and they

146
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,950
and my parents didn't think that's a

147
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,200
supermarket when there's this you know

148
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,969
that shortages or things that are

149
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,900
business people who are like panic

150
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:06,419
buying business massive like you know

151
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,489
hurricanes and you know typhoons we call

152
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:11,070
them typhoon so it's on a frequent basis

153
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,770
and every time there's a big one coming

154
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,570
in people try to you know buy as much as

155
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,789
they they can in fact just like the word

156
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:20,130
hoarding that was the first English word

157
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,470
that I actually learned the concept of

158
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,630
courting wherein you keep on you know

159
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,580
buying stuff so that you have something

160
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:29,400
to prepare you but my parents have

161
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:32,010
always emphasized that we buy enough so

162
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,989
that just in case you know we lose

163
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:38,460
electricity we have the canned food

164
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:43,110
there and that's why after this time I'm

165
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:47,729
a big fan of spam think spam little

166
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:50,280
berries you know everything okay so we

167
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:52,620
have two environments of people who grew

168
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:56,820
up in certain you know situations where

169
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:59,310
in you have this kind of those car city

170
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,560
it's sort of like you have that kind of

171
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,080
scars like up to this point I thought

172
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,810
that and it was normal that everybody

173
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,729
will buy you know a little bit something

174
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,700
extra like if you're going to the

175
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:13,710
supermarket like on a fortnightly or in

176
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,820
a weekly basis you always get like an

177
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:19,409
extra until you have your own you know

178
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:24,090
items that's good for at least two weeks

179
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:26,010
and then I realized that it's it's not a

180
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,830
useful thing you know it's like it gets

181
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,260
me I had I was fortunate to move from

182
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,390
Philippines to Singapore and I had like

183
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,419
roommates or flatmates saying that Oh

184
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:39,718
in times of like there's like any issues

185
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:42,598
or anything I want to be your flatmate

186
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,930
because you've always have at least two

187
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,760
weeks worth of food there so I was

188
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:50,310
thinking perhaps from the perspective of

189
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,650
other people they they don't really

190
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,540
actually have this you know kind of

191
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,920
background so that's why it's like oh no

192
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,719
this is like the first time we're gonna

193
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,860
experience this so I gotta make sure

194
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,640
that

195
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:05,190
you know I have enough food to last and

196
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,860
also there's our second access to

197
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:12,390
resources so if people have this

198
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,240
scarcity mindset there's always the idea

199
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:18,449
that I have to make sure that I have

200
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,540
enough and this is something that I grew

201
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:24,360
up with because my my paternal

202
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:27,030
grandmother grew up during World War two

203
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,870
and it was like really time of scarcity

204
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:33,120
and for her being secure means having

205
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,550
enough food in the pantry so we have to

206
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,700
look at this so in my early childhood

207
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,530
you know experiences has led me to a

208
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,220
situation an interesting situation

209
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:45,900
wherein I have enough like food for

210
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,270
about three weeks

211
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,910
and that's not because I hold it because

212
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,620
like the past few shopping like from

213
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,480
last year I would always get something

214
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,790
extra if let's just see there's a sale

215
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,700
on like you know canned beans I'm gonna

216
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:03,329
buy instead of two I by 3 so a little at

217
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,250
a time so that has provided a buffer for

218
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,130
me especially during the time I was made

219
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:10,230
redundant last year so it was a source

220
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,510
of comfort that yeah I know that we have

221
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,990
enough food in the pantry for three

222
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,800
weeks

223
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:20,340
okay so individual background now if you

224
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:24,240
come from a background where in there's

225
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:26,400
always you know a lack of food a lot of

226
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,150
things there like for example I remember

227
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,709
the old song about I can't I can't tell

228
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,890
the truth like I come from the land down

229
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:37,440
under there's like a land of plenty so

230
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:39,750
there's that land of plenty and for me

231
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,880
to go to a supermarket with all the bare

232
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,200
shelves they are sort of like where's

233
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,980
that land of plenty

234
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,110
so they I have that you know cognitive

235
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,600
dissonance for him there's that song

236
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,480
there's that idea where in there's like

237
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,160
this is a land of plenty but you have

238
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,980
bare shelves there so that's quite

239
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,640
confronting for me okay and maybe for

240
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:05,700
other people who who are used to having

241
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:07,590
you know this this plant

242
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,690
like having a planting fool like all

243
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:12,050
these options available it is quite

244
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,050
confronting

245
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:18,000
now I talked about you know the

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,310
background so if for example you grew up

247
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,620
in an environment where in there's

248
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,000
always hurricanes floods volcanic

249
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,310
eruptions and all those things so you

250
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,970
kinda have that you know discuss the

251
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:33,388
preparedness mindset and now the reason

252
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,920
why I put up me here this meme is

253
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:38,070
because I'm not quite sure if you

254
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:41,219
haven't met me in real life I'm not

255
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:43,829
really quite short so in the Philippines

256
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,889
when there's flood the flood waters is

257
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:49,410
like up to my waist level so I'm like

258
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:53,579
I'm really way that you know like you

259
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:56,250
know across flooded you know roads like

260
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:58,620
for example high school where I went to

261
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,170
every time there's like a massive you

262
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,850
know rain and then always the street is

263
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,250
flooded and I better be just waiting

264
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,500
there so if you have this kind of

265
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:11,279
backgrounds you're sort of like kinda

266
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:13,680
you know comfortable about certain

267
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,750
issues but if this is like the first

268
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,029
time that you're encountering you know

269
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,130
something different then it does make

270
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,870
sense that you'll think like I have to

271
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:26,939
make sure that they have enough you know

272
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:29,730
to sustain me and my family now another

273
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,170
thing that is interesting was that one

274
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,790
of the things that I read there was this

275
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,010
paper that was released by the

276
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:37,890
Australian government about food

277
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:40,230
insecurity and also about this

278
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,089
particular numbers at 95 percent of

279
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,600
Australian households maintain between

280
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:47,339
two and four days pantry stop so I have

281
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,680
to remember I have to keep on

282
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,440
remembering their numbers because it may

283
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,209
be due to personal circumstances

284
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,910
economic circumstances or it could even

285
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:59,670
be because of you know access to

286
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:01,560
resources maybe your calling in from a

287
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,060
rural area worrying you have to drive

288
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,439
about two hours to get to the

289
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:11,479
supermarket so if you have a different

290
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,339
situation so definitely people who need

291
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,560
shopping book because of their you know

292
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,389
their distance so there are access to

293
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,279
their resources definitely they will be

294
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:22,649
putting in they would be having more

295
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:25,589
fancy stuff but for us who live in the

296
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:26,310
suburbs or in the city were in it's so

297
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:28,440
easy

298
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:31,410
down like what about 5-10 minutes you

299
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,630
have the movies and Kohl's it's all just

300
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,730
like buy something here so you have that

301
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,850
Pontiff stock of like it's between two

302
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,860
and four days so now we talk about

303
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,779
self-isolation working we need to or

304
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,610
like quarantine we need to have like 14

305
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:47,279
days if you come from overseas or from

306
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:49,440
another state you have to like for self

307
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,839
isolate for 14 days and definitely if

308
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,850
you come home and you only have like two

309
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,440
to four days of time to stock then it

310
00:13:53,850 --> 00:14:00,120
does make sense that you will be like

311
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:03,839
buying a la okay now so I talked about

312
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,700
looking at you know community cultural

313
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,100
background talk about you know

314
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,290
individual backgrounds now I'm gonna be

315
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:14,820
talking about because basically I was

316
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:16,709
trained as a psychologist and this just

317
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,020
clarify what's the meaning of affect

318
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,860
this is basically the broad range of

319
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,610
feelings that the people can experience

320
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,620
this is different

321
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,330
regarding like emotion some people think

322
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,339
effect and emotions are the same the

323
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,020
same but emotions just like it's like

324
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:33,210
the vector it's like short you know

325
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:36,060
short so it's just after it's the range

326
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:38,700
of feelings and in situations like this

327
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,739
exciting levels do you know go up

328
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,070
because there's a lot of uncertainties

329
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:47,190
so it makes sense that in order to make

330
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:49,589
sure that you are able to you know

331
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:52,080
manage your anxiety levels you turn to

332
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:54,420
what is comforting for you so you have

333
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,370
to look at what you know makes you feel

334
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,010
you know safe you know in your

335
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,420
environment so now in order to

336
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,310
understand this I'm gonna do like

337
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,680
psychobabble so I'm going to be talking

338
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:08,939
about Freud and Maslow okay

339
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:11,729
so so but this is a quick you know

340
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:16,589
summary of Freud psychodynamic approach

341
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:20,070
for Freud there's several I think of it

342
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:21,990
like developmental stages so we first go

343
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,900
through the oral phase okay

344
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:27,480
and depending on how our needs were met

345
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:30,660
during that phase we either become or

346
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,089
are passive or aggressive okay and then

347
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,219
we also have in you know part of

348
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:35,740
development in these coincides during

349
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,300
the

350
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,800
that you do your toilet training when

351
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,510
you know when you're a toddler your

352
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,829
parents toilet trained you if your

353
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:45,220
parents were too harsh

354
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:49,000
you know retentive so that means you

355
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,770
have this this need to make sure that

356
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,620
everything's tidy or you could be like

357
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:56,319
obsessive mean or stubborn but if it's

358
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,210
to lots that means your you know your

359
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,190
your untidy and then of course there's

360
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,110
the other you know stages there but I'm

361
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:05,050
just gonna focus on the you know part

362
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,760
because I was thinking this probably

363
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,410
explain why people are hoarding toilet

364
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,630
paper because they been playing that you

365
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:13,449
have to make sure that you know how to

366
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:15,910
clean after yourself you may and sign up

367
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,920
being a big boy or a big girl now is

368
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,319
that you aren't able to take care and

369
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,750
clean after yourself so maybe when I

370
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,220
some sort of like you know the back of

371
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,080
our mind we need to make sure that we

372
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,210
have to make sure that if you're on a

373
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,770
fourteen days I don't know how many how

374
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,290
long like you know in terms of self

375
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,569
isolation we have to make sure that we

376
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:43,959
take care of painting after ourselves

377
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:46,960
okay another train of thought in

378
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,940
psychology are the ones that really

379
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,710
resonated with me when I was studying

380
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,840
psychology before because you have like

381
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:55,090
Freud and then have math nowhere in my

382
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:58,780
flow is a little bit more liberal in

383
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:01,900
terms of looking at in order to progress

384
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:05,920
you know develop yourself you need to

385
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:07,720
make sure that the basic or at the

386
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,630
bottom of that pyramid or your hierarchy

387
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:14,380
of needs the basic needs are met and

388
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:18,190
then you move on at the bottom part of

389
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:22,330
my screen or this pyramid or triangle

390
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:24,700
you see the red part there it's

391
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:28,689
physiological needs so it's about like

392
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:31,600
having food water gel you know shelter

393
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,640
clothing having sleep and included there

394
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,840
is you know you're taking care of your

395
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:42,100
bodily functions so toilet paper goes

396
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,290
under that okay so for me it makes you

397
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,060
no sense that yeah people you know are

398
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,340
hoarding it because of this and of

399
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,149
course there's also this after that once

400
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,370
you

401
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,800
your physiological needs you're next you

402
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,679
know the next layer here is about safety

403
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,800
and security and unfortunately there's

404
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,420
been a lot of unemployment and I

405
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:04,450
personally have some survivor killed

406
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:07,120
like I am so lucky I feel so blessed and

407
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,010
lucky that I have a job when you know

408
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,320
millions of people have lost their jobs

409
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:14,530
in their livelihood and that will

410
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:18,550
definitely impact their you know sense

411
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:20,590
of you know security and safety and then

412
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:23,320
we have love and belonging okay this is

413
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:27,909
about you know friends and family and it

414
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:31,000
is like doing self isolation is an act

415
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:33,880
of great love it's an act of great love

416
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,220
because as we isolate we know that what

417
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,070
we're doing it's being interdependent

418
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:43,300
and taking making sure that everyone

419
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:45,220
okay Stacy okay and then you have like

420
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,860
service team self-actualization all

421
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,830
those hierarchy of needs now if the

422
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,689
bottom layers or the bottom part of

423
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,659
these hierarchy of needs are not meant

424
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:58,290
it is quite difficult to move up and do

425
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,980
you know stuff actualization and part of

426
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,980
self-actualization is that you have the

427
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:05,980
morality you know acceptance all those

428
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:08,770
ethical you know things now if the basic

429
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:11,230
parts are not being met then there's a

430
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:13,330
big possibility that you know people

431
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:15,310
just regress - yeah it's just gonna be

432
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,870
against I'm gonna think of myself or I'm

433
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,750
just gonna think of my you know my

434
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,610
family I don't care about other people

435
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:25,870
so we have to understand it from this

436
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:28,959
you know perspective now how do we move

437
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:34,899
forward from this on once again I use

438
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:37,810
the CIA first is from see compassion and

439
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,970
community okay we need to be

440
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:45,639
compassionate we have to remember that

441
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:47,230
we need we need other people it's normal

442
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,930
the thing that okay I have to make sure

443
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:52,000
that you know my family they're all okay

444
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:54,760
but once you move to that point where he

445
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,860
you have secured you know what you need

446
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,730
make sure that you reach out reach out

447
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:02,530
your community and I'm really lucky in a

448
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,170
sense that we have this

449
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:07,330
of virtual cyber cons or we have all the

450
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:10,450
technology available here to connect

451
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:13,240
with everybody we may not be there you

452
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,310
know in a physical sense but we have

453
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,820
this community an online community where

454
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:21,750
in we can reach out to our colleagues or

455
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,980
our friends or people you know in

456
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,900
conferences I mean I made a lot of

457
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,420
friends because of the conference as

458
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:32,950
I've been to it so let's have and then

459
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:36,210
the compassion so I had seen means we're

460
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:38,350
in people are like quite mean to

461
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,390
supermarket workers and all those things

462
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,340
and for me I don't understand that

463
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:47,140
because these are the people who are

464
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:48,550
helping us we need to understand it you

465
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,010
know because they're going out there

466
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:54,820
they may not be your you know highly

467
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:57,820
degree you know medical doctors but they

468
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:01,899
are there and then there's and in the

469
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:04,409
second part of the CIA card what when we

470
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,390
are what I'm trying to refrain is in

471
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:11,510
integration so when I talk about

472
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:14,630
integration is it's a matter of

473
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:16,160
we in the community tend to you know be

474
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:20,060
like kind of socially awkward at times

475
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:22,880
and there are things that are like nerds

476
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:28,190
and Geeks you know and we have like our

477
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:31,670
own you know our niche our own you know

478
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:33,950
community but we need to integrate with

479
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:37,070
the other you know the bigger community

480
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:39,530
like we have seen like a rise in terms

481
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:43,659
of spearfishing at times you know like

482
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:47,450
small businesses being targeted okay

483
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:51,140
please consider you know volunteering

484
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:55,580
some of your time in terms of helping

485
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:58,730
this different you know businesses and

486
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:01,580
even our community members and it would

487
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,770
be as simple as you know helping someone

488
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,230
check their you know email whether this

489
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,870
is legitimate or you can go to LinkedIn

490
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:12,200
and volunteer with a copied nineteen

491
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:14,899
group wearing we have our own Australian

492
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,810
group were in this is to help the

493
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:20,030
different small businesses or the health

494
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,610
care sector so that's one way how we can

495
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:25,970
integrate and then lastly it's about

496
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:29,870
availability when I say availability I'm

497
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:34,880
talking about being available to people

498
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:37,010
who need your help okay of course we

499
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,930
need to do you know is to set boundaries

500
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,879
in terms of like time because I

501
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:43,520
understand that for some who are still

502
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,130
working right now the volume of work is

503
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,290
massive and then that leaves very little

504
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:51,320
of your personal time to help other

505
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:53,810
people but if you know other resources

506
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:57,470
or another person who may be able to

507
00:22:53,810 --> 00:23:01,010
help that other person you know ask that

508
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:03,410
person hey hey dear are you available to

509
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:06,050

510
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:09,470
loaded but I could help this you know so

511
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:12,740
so now let's look at CIA not just in

512
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:16,070
terms of the security triad but in terms

513
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:18,980
of you know being compassionate being

514
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:23,179

515
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,920

516
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,560

517
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:31,510
our community so that's my call to

518
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:35,620
action for everyone you know and anyway

519
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:39,330
any questions I think I haven't liked

520
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:41,800
you know I'm not I haven't done or over

521
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,090
look god that was fantastic I know

522
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,620
there's a lot of conversation on the

523
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,449
slack right now about the relevance of

524
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:50,020
this talk to the situation we're all in

525
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:51,940
right now and how hang on sorry I'll

526
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,770
just turn this one down and how

527
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,640
important it is for us all to work

528
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:59,170
together to get through this situation

529
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:03,250
it's really good to see I know there's

530
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:04,980
been some work between in the UK when I

531
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,390
was in the UK a couple of weeks ago

532
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,520
there was a group set up that basically

533
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:11,440
said we're incident responders we're

534
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,730
here to help like come messages if

535
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,020
you're a health care provider and you

536
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,510
need some help and I think there's some

537
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,820
work in the Australian market to do that

538
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:20,740
as well so it's been really good to sort

539
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,750
of see so for me for this talk it was

540
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:25,210
really nice to see sort of the the

541
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,890
reason why we do things and that's sort

542
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,660
of driving a lot of what the behaviour

543
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,850
of people have right now and why there's

544
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,650
you know people don't understand the

545
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,689
behaviour sometimes because we work we

546
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:38,500
will have different ways of growing up

547
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:40,240
and different different experiences so

548
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,260
