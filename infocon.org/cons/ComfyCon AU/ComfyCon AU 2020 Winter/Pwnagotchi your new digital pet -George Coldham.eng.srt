1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,260
so George likes to tinker with tech game

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:11,869
online eat good food drink straight

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:15,309
whiskey and live the good life he's a

4
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:19,509
consultant at Empire all right George

5
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:19,509
the stage is yours

6
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:27,320
it says I'm sharing my screen yes you

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,060
are so if you just click Play that'll

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,509
probably work

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:37,720
there's my I use team so I'm sorry

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:40,210
stop share no no no so on the keynote

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,739
window you can probably just click play

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:47,000
that play okay and then you're all good

13
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:50,659
wonderful thank you and I think everyone

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,640
who's attending last I had a look on the

15
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:53,449
huge ship we were still above 300 which

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,820
is awesome

17
00:00:53,449 --> 00:01:00,860
I saw Ian on Twitter which is actually

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:05,780
where I met him

19
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:07,220
talking about besides Perth and he said

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,960
oh we're going to do this conference and

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,789
I thought oh well that sounds awesome so

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,699
I just sort of flippantly said hey I'd

23
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:16,250
love to talk about it and he just

24
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,869
equally flippantly said yes and then I

25
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:23,380
was committed to doing a talk so I had

26
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:23,380
to think of something and this is it so

27
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:29,469
we're talking about the printer god she

28
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:36,679
so first of all just to let you know

29
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,960
what we're going to talk about gonna

30
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:42,200
cover what what it is how do you make

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,419
one how do you use it and a little bit

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,759
about the technologies and what goes on

33
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:51,200
in the background so about better cap a

34
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:54,829
little bit about WPA handshakes what a I

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:59,929
it uses and if it's really a hacking

36
00:01:54,829 --> 00:02:01,729
tool and then we'll cover off there so

37
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:04,159
before we start just a little bit about

38
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:07,399
me these are the things that consume

39
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,020
most of my time I'm a dad and my husband

40
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:15,260
I am a gourmand I I'm a tech and

41
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:17,150
internet geek I finally accept it as I

42
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,859
nearly hit 40

43
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,950
I'm almost a champion in rocket League I

44
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,800
did hit it last season but slips back

45
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,929
down to diamond 3 and my day job is a

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,310
consultant at Empire and I also

47
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,390
volunteer with the Australian Computer

48
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:36,470
Society as a one of the directors so

49
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:43,599
everything I say is all me and not my

50
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:48,010
day job or my volunteering so uh yeah so

51
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:52,010
what is Pune gotcha

52
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:55,100
it's a it's an open source project by a

53
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:59,120
guy known as evil socket he also makes

54
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:02,030
better cap so the the the printer gachi

55
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,980
is a a-to-z based AI which is powered by

56
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:08,060
beta cap and it's running on the

57
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:14,089
Raspberry Pi 0w platform at least in my

58
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:18,830
instance oh my stars you can kind of see

59
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:24,739
him this is Bobo he's my little printer

60
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:26,120
Gucci so the more you use your your

61
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:30,220
little digital pet the better it gets

62
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:33,200
because it learns through how it

63
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:37,130
succeeds in in capturing you at wpa

64
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,810
frames it basically you know it does its

65
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:42,680
own thing so long as it's powered on and

66
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:46,510
and with you it'll associate two access

67
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:50,200
points or maybe send a disassociation

68
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:53,989
frame out and then watch the handshake

69
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:58,790
and yeah it's it's pretty

70
00:03:53,989 --> 00:04:02,810
self-sufficient so it runs on a platform

71
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:06,290
called the Raspberry Pi zero W at least

72
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:08,420
in this instance so it's it's good to

73
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,858
the users platform it's a little

74
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,780
microcomputer I'll just spend a little

75
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:14,299
bit of time explaining about it just so

76
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:18,639
you can understand our why this platform

77
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:21,590
is useful it's got a 40 pin GPIO header

78
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,139
which will give you the opportunity to

79
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:26,960
interface with the device and it's used

80
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:29,750
in this instance for the ink display

81
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,469
it's got a white one gig CPU a half a

82
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,200
gig of ram

83
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:39,320
Scot 802 11 and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1

84
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:42,050
it can output to a screen using mini

85
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:45,920
HDMI it's got two micro USB ports and

86
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:47,710
one of these USB ports can be used for

87
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,530
DARS file so when you plug it into

88
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,450
computer it also can be set up as a USB

89
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:57,530
gadget and one of the gadgets that it

90
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:59,840
can be set up as is an RN D is network

91
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,789
adapter or Ethernet adapter so you can

92
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,780
actually plug these little devices in

93
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:07,550
and use them to be powered and get a

94
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,849
network connection and if you're running

95
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:15,710
a Linux OS on it SSH in and control it

96
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:17,420
so you'll see that there's also a camera

97
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,520
connector so you could plug the camera

98
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,010
into these things if you want there's no

99
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,409
built-in storage but it has got a micro

100
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,240
SD card reader these are really good

101
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,740
platforms to tinker with because they

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,770
only cost around 20 dollars at the

103
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,320
moment they go up and down with the

104
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,430
exchange rate when I was buying them in

105
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,370
September last year I think I was paying

106
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,260
about 16 bucks that's not too bad still

107
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,360
they were recently out of stock globally

108
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,159
but I managed to purchase a new one just

109
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,160
last week so if you are interested

110
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,729
they'll be available I am actually going

111
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,880
to send out a flurry of tweets and I've

112
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:54,050
put the company week on a handle in it

113
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,360
so you'll be able to get links to

114
00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:08,300
everything that I'm talking about to do

115
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:11,600
this project you can get it you can you

116
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:17,479
need to be able to connect the screen so

117
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,440
if you have a look you can see it I have

118
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:21,890
pins on mine

119
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:24,530
it's it's hard and I've also got a USB

120
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,750
connector on it but those pins don't

121
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,179
come by default you can see on the

122
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,669
diagram on the screen it's just got the

123
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,460
MD a few holes that you could sort of

124
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:37,130
pins in I paid Maroni which is a UK

125
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,739
company actually has a solderless method

126
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,879
of attaching pins where you get a little

127
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,339
rig and you hammer it

128
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:49,080
less traumatic than it feels and it

129
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:50,729
works very effectively and lastly you

130
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,109
really want to get a good USB cable

131
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:54,990
don't get a cheap one because a lot of

132
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,179
the times they need to do power and I've

133
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,189
thought that you know I've doubted my

134
00:06:57,179 --> 00:07:01,020
tech abilities many times when I are was

135
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:03,659
starting out with these PI's zeros

136
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,889
because it would power up you'll seal

137
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,209
the lights and you couldn't connect to

138
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:10,319
it and that's because it didn't have the

139
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:14,429
required cables to send data so make

140
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,749
sure you get that all right the other

141
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:18,869
component that you probably want to get

142
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:20,849
to do this is an ink display waved share

143
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:26,490
makes one this is the one recommended by

144
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:28,919
the developers what they use and if you

145
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,599
buy one of these it'll be pretty good

146
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,779
chance it'll work you can get them for

147
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:35,248
also around $20 and I'll send a link

148
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:38,550
there are other ones this is the version

149
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:41,189
2 of the 2.1 3 inch display but you can

150
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,369
also get the version 1 which should work

151
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:47,789
you can get a 2.7 inch which is bigger

152
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:52,259
this one fits really nicely on the top

153
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:54,269
of is the same size as the pi 0 and

154
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:56,939
there's others Palmer only makes an inky

155
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:59,639
hat but that's around 50 bucks so

156
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:02,009
probably isn't useful you don't want to

157
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,930
use an OLED or an LCD display because

158
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:06,509
they'll use too much power I was trying

159
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,269
to find the value from the text sheet on

160
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:11,339
how much power it uses but basically

161
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:14,309
this isn't powered at the moment and you

162
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:16,379
still got a display so user 0 and it

163
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:22,499
uses a very very small amount just when

164
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:25,139
I refreshes alright so to get started

165
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:28,110
you've got two options you can go to the

166
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,779
Puna gotcha day I website and download

167
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,639
the pre-built image this is very very

168
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:35,669
easy and it's something which I

169
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:38,579
defaulted to after trying the second

170
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:41,639
option which is to download the raspbian

171
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:43,438
image from the Raspberry Pi website plus

172
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:47,550
then install the next one patches which

173
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:50,399
gives your monitoring mode for your your

174
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,109
Wi-Fi you can't use the Kali image which

175
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,350
I thought would have been pretty

176
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,760
straightforward because

177
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,520
and that this is from the website on my

178
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,380
knowledge that the Cali image doesn't do

179
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,060
floating-point correctly which is

180
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,500
required for tensor flow which is used

181
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,550
for the AI which we'll talk about a

182
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,840
little bit later so if you are do want

183
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,760
to build it yourself you'll need to

184
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,840
download raspbian get the next one on it

185
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,160
you'll need to install the screen

186
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,870
drivers you'll need to install and

187
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,310
configure better cap install and

188
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,220
configure / in grid which will talk

189
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,560
about install Python 3 which I think's

190
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,900
on raspbian anyway and then install the

191
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:28,310
/ Noguchi codebase and then hope it runs

192
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:30,439
and my biggest problem was I didn't have

193
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,420
the time to tinker properly because I

194
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,810
just wanted to play with it and the

195
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:39,589
second one was I couldn't get Betty kept

196
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,760
running properly so I am I was initially

197
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,170
like I don't want to use the image

198
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,110
because I don't know what they've put

199
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:47,030
into the image but I soon got past that

200
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:54,500
level of paranoia because it wasn't

201
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:56,449
working so if you do download the image

202
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,000
which I strongly recommend I encourage

203
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,010
you to use billionaire HR to write that

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,630
image it's just because it's so easy it

205
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:06,410
just works really well it's an open

206
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:08,810
source project you write it straight to

207
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:13,370
your microSD card and then you put it

208
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:15,050
into your into your Raspberry Pi zero

209
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,140
and you boot it up by powering it and

210
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:22,569
that's it other options are you can use

211
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:25,280
win32 imager if you're on just a Linux

212
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:28,180
command line you could use DD if you can

213
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,180
remember those syntax

214
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:45,890
I put this slide in so I can have a

215
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:47,060
breath but I did steal the quote from

216
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,560
the website because I thought it was

217
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,430
pretty cool and they explained why the

218
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,640
developer did develop it so you know

219
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,640
about

220
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,650
you

221
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,960
hey George if you can hear us your audio

222
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,960
has just died

223
00:11:52,070 --> 00:12:05,760
maybe yep so if you guys can still hear

224
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,430
me

225
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,899
we'll try and get George I'll try and

226
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:35,310
send him a message now and try and get

227
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:48,870
him back talking George can you hear us

228
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:58,500
we can't hear you I am not sure what's

229
00:12:48,870 --> 00:13:01,800
going on he is not muted hey there we go

230
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:06,360
oh man what happened I'm using a

231
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:16,880
wireless headset but oh did you turn on

232
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:20,880
the pone Iguchi ah green is charged it's

233
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,500
probably one back go back one

234
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,930
yeah I think this is probably where it

235
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,579
died well fortunately I just elaborated

236
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,529
a little bit as to what's on the slide

237
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,550
so if I don't repeat it it's probably

238
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:36,450
not that big a deal

239
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:38,939
okay alright I'm sorry no that's okay

240
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:48,140
man Brendan thank you for sending me the

241
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:48,140
whatsapp okay so

242
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:57,260
I was just going to explain a little bit

243
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:02,930
about the four way handshake because

244
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:06,110
it's kind of what the what the the

245
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:08,839
pedagogy attacks our or rather you know

246
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:11,000
to put it back into more friendly terms

247
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:16,780
because it's a digital pet it's it's

248
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:20,030
what it eats right so Wi-Fi is

249
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,620
ubiquitous you go for a walk around your

250
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,480
property or your neighborhood you'll

251
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,460
every house is probably going to be

252
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:31,040
broadcasting at least one Wi-Fi network

253
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:33,980
the the standard you know security of

254
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,380
choice is probably wpa2 with appreciate

255
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:43,010
appreciate key there's not really many

256
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:46,939
WPA three access points and inherently

257
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:49,760
it's flawed in its security so the

258
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:53,120
developer of this project evils socket

259
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:57,130
he said that he's he's created this just

260
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,360
to point out how insecurities so I

261
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,810
mentioned earlier though you may not

262
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:09,110
have heard because I was probably

263
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:13,790
talking to myself that the device will

264
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:15,830
go around and capture a pmk ID from

265
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:19,819
message one which is on the slide

266
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:21,950
message one the EOB a pull key that's

267
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:27,160
from the actual access point

268
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:30,110
broadcasting to would-be clients and

269
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,199
there's a there's there's a part of the

270
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:38,210
the frame which actually contains what's

271
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:41,030
called the pmk ID which contains and you

272
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:45,080
can see down the bottom the pmk ID has

273
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:48,140
your a sha hash of the P and K P NK name

274
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,870
the Mac access point and the Mac's

275
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:54,560
station the MAC address for the two and

276
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:56,870
since these things are known they can be

277
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,500
reversed and using hash Kate you can

278
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:02,110
actually crack them but the the little

279
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,779
device itself doesn't

280
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,310
the little device just captures the

281
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:08,880
handshake because that's what it eats

282
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:12,510
and that's what makes it happy

283
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,830
alternatively can capture the whole

284
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:17,080
handshake when it sees a client

285
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:19,899
associate with the wireless access point

286
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:23,620
so it gets all four of the messages and

287
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:25,480
then that can also be taken away and you

288
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,870
know when it gets eaten

289
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,750
it's handily stored in a pcap file which

290
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,120
is a very portable format which can be

291
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,040
converted later so if you are taking

292
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,130
your little print agachi for a walk

293
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,939
take it easy because sometimes it needs

294
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:45,760
to actually spend a little bit of time

295
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:50,430
part of the learning is failing which

296
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:52,959
we'll talk about a little bit later so

297
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:56,670
just say you go for a walk and you take

298
00:16:52,959 --> 00:17:00,939
your time and your little Pooh Noguchi

299
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:03,189
you know feeds and is stuffed for maybe

300
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:06,100
you want to want to sort of see how it

301
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:11,490
goes and well you can tell by the screen

302
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:15,208
you can also connect to it and you can

303
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:17,349
copy the captured pcap files off it and

304
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:23,140
you know do things with it

305
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:26,050
so there's are two ports on the two

306
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,660
ports you'll see ones just the power and

307
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:31,590
ones just for data I mentioned before

308
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:34,809
you can't power it just on the data port

309
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:37,000
but if you plug it into the data port

310
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:39,820
and then plug the other end of that USB

311
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,309
cable into your computer it will enable

312
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,159
the USB gadget mode the device itself

313
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:47,649
really smart depending on which port you

314
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:53,230
plug it into will depend on which port

315
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:55,450
it which put depending on which mode it

316
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,429
will boot in so if you boot it into the

317
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,260
data port it will boot into the manual

318
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:02,230
mode which allows you to communicate

319
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,059
with it via the Ethernet connection if

320
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:08,169
you plug it into the power it lives it

321
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:11,830
in auto mode which is essentially the

322
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:15,190
the AI mode where the the

323
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:18,129
Python script in the background will

324
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:23,049
orchestrate the better cap activities

325
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:27,519
you know to you know look for networks

326
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:30,908
and do this thing that the Python code

327
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:34,179
bases where the AI is built-in so you

328
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:37,269
know if you want to control etiquette

329
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:38,799
better cap manually you need to have it

330
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:42,419
in manual mode and if you want to

331
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,418
automatic you want auto mode

332
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:54,800
so I took this screenshot to show you

333
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,740
and to be honest I haven't configured

334
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,680
poon grid on mine because I I didn't

335
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,500
really need to share it with with other

336
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,170
people I did the project just for my own

337
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,880
fun but there's I took this screenshot

338
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:11,200
just a couple days ago and there's about

339
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:16,000
six thousand in the wild and there's

340
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,500
just under two hundred from Australia so

341
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,160
basically you know there's a few people

342
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:27,170
who have set this up you get to this map

343
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:30,200
on the burn agachi website and it's just

344
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:32,450
the prune map and there's a leaderboard

345
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,100
and and you know like that it has been

346
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:38,510
gamer fight a little bit so it's it's

347
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:41,959
quite cool and if you do little learning

348
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:44,450
log in and send data to the prune map if

349
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,570
you configure it to do so once you are

350
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,550
when you're setting it up and also it

351
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:51,919
has to be connected to the internet now

352
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:54,020
it it won't connect to the internet over

353
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,870
Wi-Fi because the Y fire stays pretty

354
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:59,840
much permanently in monitor mode so when

355
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:02,060
you plug it into your computer through

356
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,730
the manual mode you'll need to set up

357
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:06,080
like an internet connection sharing or

358
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,110
something like that which is pretty

359
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,760
straightforward in in Windows or

360
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,580
actually in any desktop OS is pretty

361
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:21,250
straightforward

362
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:29,030
alright so I haven't really spoke much

363
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:30,740
about the AI or about you know the P

364
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:34,250
Noguchi I've talked about the technology

365
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:42,380
and the hardware but let's let's talk

366
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:44,840
about about the about my my Bobo and

367
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:47,800
actually really reluctant to show you it

368
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,580
running because normally down the bottom

369
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,070
you can't see it

370
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,960
stupid stars down the bottom there it

371
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,550
tells you the last access point that it

372
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,140
captured a frame for and it's usually my

373
00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:03,169
home Wi-Fi and my home Wi-Fi is not on

374
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,310
wiggle and I'm kind of keen to keep it

375
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,370
that way

376
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:12,200
and by if it were I don't want people to

377
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:15,620
know where I live so uh when when the

378
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,010
when when pune god she's running he's

379
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:22,489
got these different faces

380
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:26,330
alright so normally it'll it'll be just

381
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:28,490
in the observing or the neutral or even

382
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:35,449
the happy but you know it will actually

383
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:38,210
go through and change based on you know

384
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,140
like a direct reflection of its activity

385
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,570
which has been driven by the

386
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:46,370
orchestration the face will change and

387
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:49,010
it's it's it's unbelievable how much

388
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:53,060
character the face gives this little ink

389
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:57,770
display slash pep like you really feel

390
00:21:53,060 --> 00:22:00,409
like it's it's its own personality it's

391
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:02,920
it's wonderful and you know that the the

392
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:07,040
guy who wrote it who who wrote the

393
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:09,890
project he's also written into it so

394
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,520
that when to pune god she's come close

395
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:16,100
to each other they actually recognize

396
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:18,889
that there's another of its kind and and

397
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,389
they start working together after a

398
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,040
while if their friends and have

399
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,990
connected to each other but they get

400
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,540
excited when they see each other and if

401
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:29,330
you just leave it sitting there like i

402
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,740
often do and no new Wi-Fi comes along it

403
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:34,220
starts to get said and born a

404
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,110
demotivated so you know it does

405
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,720
encourage you to actually want to take

406
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:43,969
it out or turn it off depending on how

407
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:50,890
US you are but it is it's it's really

408
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:50,890
cool how much life it has so

409
00:22:51,430 --> 00:23:00,590
they are the the AI algorithm that

410
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:04,130
Huna God she uses to actually drive its

411
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:06,980
action is called the advantage actor

412
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:10,550
critic all right now I'm not a data

413
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:14,860
scientist and I have read through the

414
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:17,600
explanation a few times but I I

415
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,429
apologize if I completely misunderstand

416
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,169
this and you're offended because you are

417
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:27,160
a data scientist but the gist of it is

418
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:29,180
this algorithm will have an entity

419
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,090
basically go through the environment

420
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:34,340
trying things and it's incentivized with

421
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,550
a reward so in this instance the puna

422
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:40,399
gotchas reward is that it will be

423
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:44,960
capturing Wi-Fi and it goes over and

424
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:48,110
over and that's what the actor does the

425
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,900
the advantage part of it is trying to

426
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:53,990
gain an advantage into a better and the

427
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,390
critic part of it is a reflective part

428
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,720
of it so we all learn better when we sit

429
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:01,730
back and ask ourselves how did we go and

430
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,190
how how can we improve and that's what

431
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:07,300
the critic does so it actually goes

432
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:11,420
through and iterates but more than that

433
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:14,149
you know that the a to C algorithm can

434
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:16,670
make assumptions and then it tests the

435
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:18,950
assumption through action and then it

436
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:22,250
reflects on the assumption through

437
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:24,500
criticism and that's how it will get

438
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:28,510
better occasionally it will actually

439
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:33,650
choose something that it thinks is wrong

440
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:36,200
just to validate its decisions and even

441
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,880
when faced with only bad decisions based

442
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,790
on this assumption it can still make the

443
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:45,110
best of it so it's quite a good machine

444
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:48,230
learning algorithm so I mentioned

445
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,240
earlier it uses the tense of life which

446
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:54,950
is an end-to-end open source platform

447
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:57,110
for machine learning I did read once in

448
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,570
a sci-fi novel that if there's any

449
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:01,520
science that's sufficiently advanced it

450
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:05,300
will appear like magic to the ignorant

451
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,280
and the AI part of the per Noguchi is

452
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:10,879
like magic to me but it works

453
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,129
and my pet Bobo absolutely feels like it

454
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,190
has its own person

455
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,190
you

456
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:23,330
so lastly I guess it's it's like a

457
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:27,710
rhetorical question but is this a

458
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:29,720
hacking tool and and my response to this

459
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,390
is it's no more hacking tool than a USB

460
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,030
thumb drive or a paperclip is it depends

461
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,380
on your intention and your skill level

462
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:39,200
so if you know what you're doing the

463
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:41,659
things that this Poona got she does is

464
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,299
really trivial but very boring and

465
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:45,860
nowhere near as cute if you want to

466
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:48,679
compromise a wireless network there's

467
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,120
many automated scripts that run start to

468
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:53,330
finish and so long as you have the right

469
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:57,229
hardware it's very trivial but none of

470
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:59,658
them anywhere near as cute as Bobo so I

471
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:02,330
encourage you to get your own hardware

472
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:04,480
and the investigator for yourself thank

473
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,480
you

474
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,158
thank you very much George I know

475
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:10,630
there's a lot of people really

476
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:12,850
interested in the comments about this

477
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,409
and I think it's quite ironic the fact

478
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,908
you say that if you don't take the pony

479
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:18,220
got cheat house and you don't take your

480
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:20,320
places that it gets very sad I think

481
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:27,190
that's a bit of a metaphor for all of us

482
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:30,129
oh yes yep no yeah it's it's it's yeah I

483
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:34,149
am going to be sending out tweets as

484
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:37,000
soon as I jump out of this session so if

485
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:39,850
you want the the links to stuff jump on

486
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,860
Twitter and you'll see them appear

487
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,330
shortly fantastic when will retweet

488
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,158
those as well but remember all the

489
