8
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:28,489
than just the sort of watered-down

9
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:30,140
version we have yeah it's okay because

10

right thing and and it's pretty locked

16

down and yeah we're just game no worries

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,050

too far away thankfully and a lot of

57
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,000
people think that when you work in the

58
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:49,489
snowboard industry it's just you get to

59

00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,510
really snowboarding is it wouldn't use

74
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,639
meeting of snowboard industry it's all

75
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,828
about people it's not actually not very

76
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,620
much about snowboarding and can relate

77
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:50,120
to many other industries and a lot of

78
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,980
what we did in the snowboard industry

79
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:57,019
was basically take people who were

80
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:00,500
scared who had a tremendous amount of

81
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:02,930
fear and introduced snowboarding to them

82
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,139
and introduced a passion and a love for

83
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,639
the sport and that's really what my job

84
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:09,739
was

85
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:14,150
but this was also my job that was my

86
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:16,160
office in copper Colorado for quite a

87
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,970
few years and you can see the old

88
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,490
monitor on the desk and I was like I was

89
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:25,870
in a leadership position for a long time

90
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:28,880
in the ski industry and I was able to

91
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:31,740
initiate a few changes which I'm really

92
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,349
proud of but I was a 20-something

93
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:39,690
snowboarder woman and most of the

94
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:43,620
management team were 40 50 plus in age

95
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,449
and grew up skiing and had a quite a

96
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,639
prejudice against snowboarding so I was

97
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:49,470
they they were in complete fear of me

98
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:55,590
because I represented everything that

99
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:57,449
they didn't like um and this talk is you

100
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,109
know about keeping kick-ass women in

101
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:02,759
tech and basically to you basically keep

102
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,669
kick-ass women in anything you need to

103
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:09,330
provide for them right you need policies

104
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:11,520
you need to you need to provide

105
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,620
reinforcement I can sit there and I can

106
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,539
say I'm a kick-ass woman but I can do

107
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,460
that because my entire life I've had

108
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:23,940
people telling me I'm a kick-ass woman

109
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:25,258
and that I am that not only am i kick

110
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,219
ass woman but I'm a kick-ass woman

111
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,620
because of this

112
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,789
they've given me reasons X Y Zed and it

113
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,229
doesn't mean I don't have imposter

114
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:34,440
syndrome because I haven't posture

115
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:37,289
syndrome on a daily sometimes basis

116
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,880
weekly basis but luckily I have a lot of

117
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:41,400
people and a lot of support around me

118
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,090
that are constantly reinforcing this

119
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:49,020
fact that I am a kick-ass person and I

120
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:54,289
can get through it so if you know a

121
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:57,180
kick-ass woman then tell them because

122
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:59,280
with a promotion a woman will give you

123
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,349
five reasons why she's not ready and a

124
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,609
man will give you five reasons why he

125
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:05,430
should have had that job yesterday

126
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,620
and yes this is generalizing I know that

127
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,990
this talk is about kick-ass women and it

128
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,830
will be a bit generalized and that was

129
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:17,400
from Donna carpenter in 2019 and Donna

130
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:19,139
carpenter and Jake started the snowboard

131
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,870
company back in the 70s

132
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,990
Jake is known as one of the inventors of

133
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:29,009
snowboarding of the snowboard in general

134
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:32,490
and him and his wife Donna started this

135
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:34,740
company and originally when they this

136
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,419
company has grown massive there's over a

137
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,490
thousand employees it's an international

138
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:41,279
company it is still privately owned

139
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,229
which means that they actually can do I

140
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,710
can initiate a lot of programs without

141
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:47,500
going through the board or

142
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:50,130
without worrying about shareholders and

143
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,140
they really care about company culture

144
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,400
and when the snowboarding started when

145
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,159
snowboard industry started it was

146
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,909
actually equally pioneered by both men

147
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:04,240
and women back in the day there were you

148
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:06,100
know it wasn't dominated by men and in

149
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,290
you know it was basically it was a place

150
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,790
for you know the surfers and skaters the

151
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,880
punks and the rebels and you know

152
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:15,100
something that they could do and it was

153
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,420
in fact banned by many resorts and there

154
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,970
was a lot of the effort that Jake and

155
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:21,910
Donna put into contacting resort owners

156
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:25,570
and getting them to allow snowboarding

157
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:27,760
at their resorts to actually you know

158
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,620
explain to them look this is what the

159
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,570
youth want if you want to grow your

160
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:36,520
business you need to accept snowboarding

161
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:39,159
so they did that and then in 1998 the

162
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,169
Olympics and now gonna Olympics had

163
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,350
therefore their news one of their new

164
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:46,450
sports was it snowboarding halfpipe so

165
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,060
all of a sudden snowboarding was on the

166
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,780
international stage and it was absolute

167
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,460
boomtown

168
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,739
everybody thought snowboarding was the

169
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:58,960
coolest thing in the world and everybody

170
00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:01,960
wanted to be a snowboarder and at this

171
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,049
time even the the one of the golden

172
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,780
Olympic medalist actually got lost his

173
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,760
medal got disqualified and because he

174
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,429
tested positive for marijuana so again

175
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,080
it was just one of those things that

176
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,960
just proved that snowboarding was just

177
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,359
for you know the rebels and punks and

178
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,609
everybody that wanted to basically jump

179
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,060
on a snowboard and go but during this

180
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:27,550
time as Burton grew to this massive

181
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,870
company they grew really fast and they

182
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,700
pulled from all these industries they

183
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,980
had to pull from ski and surf and other

184
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,730
similar cultured injury and industries

185
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,570
but there are all really male-dominated

186
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,850
industries they hold they all had a

187
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,910
male-dominated culture so then all of a

188
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:45,160
sudden Burton has a male-dominated

189
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:52,660
industry snowboarding has male-dominated

190
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:54,880
industry in fact um back in 2003 Jake

191
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:58,089
walked into a leadership meeting at

192
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,600
Burton and he looked around the room 25

193
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:02,230
people

194
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,829
and he saw two women so less than 10% of

195
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,440
the leadership team was women and he

196
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:14,219
basically walked out of that meeting and

197
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:17,470
said Oh poo Oh poo emoji to be kind and

198
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,810
realized they have a problem there's no

199
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,180
way you can be a successful innovative

200
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:26,410
and world leading company if you're not

201
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:30,670
including 50% of the population so at

202
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:32,769
the time his wife Donna who was also a

203
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,979
co-founder and co-owner of the company

204
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:39,339
had taken some time out and traced you

205
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,410
know their kids and he basically Jake

206
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:45,220
basically said I need you back I need

207
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:47,740
you to I need you to be here I really

208
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,199
feel like this is something that you can

209
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,339
help with I need I need you to make a

210
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:58,000
difference so Donna was like sweet I've

211
00:09:53,339 --> 00:10:00,250
I'm coming into this I've got a I've got

212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,370
a plan I've got something to focus on

213
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:05,529
you know this is what I'm gonna do

214
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,329
so Donna started the Women's Leadership

215
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,819
Initiative and it's something that's

216
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:13,620
still going today so started back in

217
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:18,189
2002 2003 still going today and

218
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:20,829
basically it's what ended up happening

219
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:23,290
the very first meeting because Donna got

220
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:25,569
the entire all of the women in the

221
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,149
company that existed got them all

222
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:30,009
together and we're like what's the

223
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:32,079
problem what do we you know you know we

224
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:33,730
don't have enough women why how do we

225
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:38,199
get here what do we need to fix what do

226
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:39,550
we need to do and so they decided to put

227
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:43,209
two guys together and they've got all

228
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:44,349
these goals and they decide to write

229
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,018
down some shirts short-term

230
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,970
opportunities to increase women's

231
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:50,680
leadership and the long term things to

232
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,089
work on cuz nothing changes in a night

233
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,829
but there's some things you can focus on

234
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:58,329
straightaway and there's some things

235
00:10:53,829 --> 00:11:00,279
that you can plan for and it's it hasn't

236
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:01,959
stopped it's a continuous process this

237
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:04,329
is still going along today and it

238
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:07,149
continues to iterate along the way but

239
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:12,160
they decided to focus on three things

240
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:14,769
the family mentorship and recruitment

241
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,360
and it's important to note here that

242
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:18,279
there were many things that they

243
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,790
concentrated on but these were the three

244
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:25,779
that actually have some measurable and

245
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,980
action actionable results so in regards

246
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:28,420
to family which talked to the women in

247
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,220
the company none of them could see

248
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,139
themselves in the company for more than

249
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,800
five years and as soon as they wanted to

250
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:34,629
have a family

251
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,819
they left the company there was no

252
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:40,439
pathway to keep them in the company or

253
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:43,689
get them back to the company so

254
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:46,480
unfortunately you know women would come

255
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:48,699
in and very similarly it's a tech and

256
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,009
have that kind of five-year goal five

257
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:53,199
year kind of tipping point and then

258
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:56,670
leave and this is similar to a lot of

259
00:11:53,199 --> 00:12:01,240
industries that don't actually cater for

260
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:03,128
women having families so family they

261
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,500
decided and in states they don't have

262
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:07,540
paid paternity and maternity maternity

263
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,019
leave and its ups of companies to do

264
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:14,490
that so Burton was like sweet yep this

265
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:19,230
is what we can do we can absolutely

266
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:24,189
initiate paid maternity turn to leave

267
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:27,910
and so first job done company offered

268
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:30,250
paid leave with job guarantees but then

269
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,050
going from a stay-at-home mom to five

270
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,689
full working days a week speaking from

271
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,279
experience is really hard so they

272
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:38,110
created flexible working days with

273
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:41,410
reduced hours that were managed on an

274
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:44,500
individual basis and depending on your

275
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:48,399
circumstances and then they also offered

276
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,709
paid childcare so under 18 months if you

277
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,750
had a child under 18 months a lot of the

278
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:54,969
jobs within Burton meant to a lot of

279
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,009
travel but they would actually send a

280
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,569
care taker with you so that you could

281
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,130
still be with your child you could still

282
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,889
do your job and you'd have someone there

283
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,420
to help provide them for you if your

284
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:06,670
children were over 18 months they

285
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,410
provide a paid childcare so they had a

286
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,899
childcare center set up within the

287
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,790
company so with these actions women

288
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:15,970
could now see themselves working for the

289
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,740
company for five years and much more

290
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,809
than five years because there weren't a

291
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:24,610
lot of other companies in the u.s. doing

292
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:25,569
this they also started the mentorship

293
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,850
program

294
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,720
so there's two sections of the

295
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,450
mentorship program

296
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,150
one was the grassroots four which is a

297
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,020
program for everyone that was completely

298
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,550
organic

299
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,520
he messed you up with someone slightly

300
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,439
more senior than you and it could last a

301
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,819
month it could last years it was

302
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,890
completely up to the participants of the

303
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,720
program but it did provide someone

304
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,360
outside of your management track that

305
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,340
could talk to they could talk to you and

306
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,860
then the other thing they offered was a

307
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,840
senior management fixed turn mentorship

308
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,360
and so anyone that were in the first

309
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,150
tiers of management would be able to get

310
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:06,580
six months mentorship with a director or

311
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:11,500
above and help them get further along in

312
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:14,740
their management roles what they ended

313
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,910
up seeing is in two years over 62% of

314
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,510
the women that participated in these

315
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,939
programs

316
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,500
either were promoted or removed into a

317
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,330
line of business that better suited

318
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,340
their goals because they were able to

319
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,050
talk about what they wanted to get out

320
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:31,270
of the company with people outside of

321
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:32,500
their management track so the other

322
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,689
thing that happened which is kind of

323
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,270
funny is the other guys in the company

324
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:40,870
are like hey this this is amazing like

325
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:42,790
we want this so they actually after two

326
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,720
years decided to make it a company-wide

327
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:48,910
initiative and everyone could be part of

328
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,920
the mentorship program and I know from

329
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:54,579
my own experience I have several mentors

330
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,010
that are men I don't have a lot of women

331
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:00,010
mentors and but I do like the

332
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:02,470
perspective of both so they made it

333
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,630
completely co-ed and it's another

334
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,760
example of how something which started

335
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:11,530
to benefit women ended up and fitting

336
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:15,580
the entire company and they also focus

337
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:17,680
on recruitment so the three tiers of the

338
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,600
recruitment process we're getting more

339
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,459
women on the mountain improving their

340
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,200
new hiring process and the one woman

341
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:27,370
policy which I'll get to at the end so

342
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,380
they realized they were doing

343
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,690
recruitment all wrong they realized they

344
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,810
were making it marketing completely from

345
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:37,510
and not taking input from from women

346
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:39,550
they were posters and I completely

347
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,620
remember this there were posters of men

348
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:45,189
dropping 30 foot cliffs and hitting 60

349
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,350
foot kickers and you know something that

350
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,090
when I looked at that I was like no I'm

351
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,640
gonna hurt myself I cannot do those

352
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,020
things and they realize you know like

353
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,750
men look at her and be like heck yeah I

354
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,550
want to be able to do that's awesome

355
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,110
fantastic but you know a woman looks at

356
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,680
it and like now I guess snowboarding is

357
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,470
not for me

358
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,959
so they actually changed all of their

359
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:08,050
marketing it used to be taking a men's

360
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,630
product aboard a jacket pants anything

361
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,760
and their whole motto is take immense

362
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:15,820
product pinkett shrink it and women will

363
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,340
want it and then that failed abysmally

364
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:20,680
and no women wanted it didn't fit right

365
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,480
it didn't look right no one cared for it

366
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,370
so they wanted to get more women on the

367
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,500
mountain and then decided to just start

368
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:30,610
with the change in marketing they had

369
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,650
more photos of women hitting rails and

370
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,540
doing wall rides you know having fun

371
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,220
snowboarding and I thought yeah that's

372
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,530
achievable I you know I can do that

373
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:43,000
snowboarding is for me so I remember

374
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:44,949
this time quite vividly and they also

375
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,290
created a women's learn to ride program

376
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,000
which I was able to work on through my

377
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,160
time at Copper Mountain which was

378
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,470
designed to teach women's snowboarding

379
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,750
and it was designed by women and taught

380
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,040
by women and eventually again it's

381
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,810
another program that opened up to be

382
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,930
co-ed it didn't matter if you being

383
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:05,260
taught but a you know a female coach a

384
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,490
male coach whatever but the fact that

385
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:10,480
you actually got to learn with a group

386
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:15,730
of women was a for some women is much

387
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:18,030
needed in safer environment um and it

388
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,439
did get more women in the mountain

389
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:22,389
participation during that program went

390
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:25,300
from under 20 percent to over 35 percent

391
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:29,770
in three years so that was pretty

392
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:31,000
fascinating um and then the other thing

393
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,000
they did to get more women on the

394
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,520
mountain is they created women only ride

395
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,490
days for the company so there would be a

396
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,550
day where all the women went and rode

397
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:45,100
for a day which actually had to do at

398
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,559
Lowe's dual-purpose head to two purposes

399
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,939
one is when I go and I ride whether it's

400
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,590
snowboarding mountain biking whatever

401
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,360
when I ride with a lot of other women I

402
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:54,580
feel way more empowered I feel like I

403
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,549
could try anything I don't feel as

404
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,470
judged and you know I feel like I can

405
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:01,450
have fun without having to be the best

406
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:04,929
representation of my gender all the time

407
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:07,570
so you know you get really empowered and

408
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:09,280
have a good time and also I left the

409
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,740
entire company to run for a day without

410
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,139
any women and they actually learned like

411
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,820
hey this is actually kind of hard they

412
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,110
realized the value that women add to

413
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:22,780
their team um and then the when it comes

414
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,250
to the hiring process you know we know

415
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,710
about this in tech right unconscious

416
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,710
bias you hire people that look like you

417
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,150
you hire people you can relate to and

418
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,860
you know that this is exactly what was

419
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,390
happening within Burton you know you're

420
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,280
just hiring the same person over and

421
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:39,490
over again and you're not getting any

422
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,490
diversity in your hiring so the people

423
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,679
that were hiring also weren't

424
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:49,080
necessarily women so there weren't any

425
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:49,080
women in the room hiring for other women

426
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:54,340
so Burton proactively sought women

427
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,230
candidates and better trained their

428
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,510
women better trained their managers to

429
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,190
hire women so this means that they

430
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:03,129
actually worked on their unconscious

431
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:05,520
bias they put women in the room and they

432
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,780
made sure that they were always

433
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,720
promoting women within the company and

434
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,850
again yes they're focusing on women but

435
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,880
in the end and overall this made it

436
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:18,490
better the entire company better now in

437
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,370
Burton 50% of their new hires are women

438
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,289
and agreed this is not necessarily

439
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:29,830
something that tech can achieve tomorrow

440
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:31,629
but it is achievable so yeah another

441
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,610
quote from Donna let's be honest it can

442
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,080
be frat boyish but I knew adding more

443
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,149
women would change the culture of her

444
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,970
company it has and they're very

445
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:42,370
successful because of it when you have a

446
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,789
good diverse range of people within your

447
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,239
company

448
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:49,870
it makes culture it you have culture for

449
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:53,770
the better and getting back to the

450
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:56,129
leadership team in 2002-2003 the

451
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,418
leadership team which was less than 10%

452
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,080
women they're like what are we gonna

453
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:02,730
what are we

454
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:05,889
do about this and basically they

455
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:09,360
initiated the one-woman policy and this

456
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:11,409
means that for every single job in

457
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,709
definitely a controversial approach but

458
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:18,519
for every single management and hire job

459
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,809
there had to be a female finalist for

460
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:21,730
every leadership position that are

461
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:23,559
looking to fill if they didn't have a

462
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:26,110
female female finalist that they had to

463
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:29,019
go out and find one it was their job to

464
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:31,719
have the best candidates possible and as

465
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:33,279
Donna says if you have two equally

466
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,450
qualified candidates chances are you're

467
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,419
gonna end up hiring a woman fifty

468
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:40,720
percent of the time so in the end their

469
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:43,419
leadership team is now 50 percent women

470
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,700
and it's really important that you know

471
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:47,769
we differentiate the fact that Burton is

472
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,809
a snowboard company they are a retail

473
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:51,700
company and a lot of their the people

474
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:53,019
they're selling to are women so they

475
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,240
want to make sure that they represent

476
00:20:53,019 --> 00:21:04,000
that in their product but it's really no

477
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:06,010
different to check so three things that

478
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,169
they did they focused on family they

479
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:11,110
motivated with mentorship and they

480
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:13,450
revolutionized their recruitment some

481
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:16,000
things that you can do do you have class

482
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,649
do you do you or your company have

483
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,480
pathways in place to see themselves in

484
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:20,768
the company women in the company for

485
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,799
more than five years have you asked

486
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:25,899
anyone are you promoting and providing

487
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:28,179
mentorship for your employees to grow

488
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:30,518
and develop within the company and are

489
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:32,889
you prepared to revolutionize the way

490
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:35,080
you are recruiting people the way you

491
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:37,840
are marketing yourself to both men and

492
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,600
women the way your training your hiring

493
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,850
managers or online on unconscious bias

494
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,969
and ensuring there's a woman in the room

495
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:47,918
and enforcing the one woman policy for

496
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,880
leadership positions even if the

497
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,799
candidates don't think they're ready

498
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,600
because when you make when you become a

499
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:57,700
better you become a better place for

500
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:03,480
women to work you become a better place

501
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:03,480
for everybody to work and that's me

502
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,550
was fantastic tiny thank you very much I

503
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:14,940
think there's a definite lot of lessons

504
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:17,190
noting the way cybersecurity is focused

505
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,710
and the amount of people there and

506
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,470
bringing some of those things in I note

507
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:25,110
that I think it was mark Eldo said that

508
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:28,290
and it was one of the comments you sort

509
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:30,510
of made where changes to these things in

510
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:32,310
in the long term don't only just affect

511
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:34,260
women but they affect men as well so the

512
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:37,020
the increase of paternity leave for men

513
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,580
is something that is a definitely

514
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,320
example that you see that coming through

515
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,970
and everyone gets it and it's an

516
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,280
increase for everyone and it's it

517
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,420
changes the culture for everyone so it's

518
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,100
really important to have these things

519
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:50,940
and try and take these lessons forward

520
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:52,379
cool and I just want to say that for

521
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,240
anyone out there who hasn't done a

522
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,820
presentation yet who hasn't gone to a

523
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,380
conference get out there do it you have

524
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,840
something that is relatable

525
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,750
I just related snowboarding to tech you

526
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,220
can do it to a hundred percent agree

527
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,720
we've had some really good talks about

528
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,480
things that you know they're not

529
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,740
traditional Tech Talks but that doesn't

530
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,630
mean they're not relevant to all of us

531
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:18,080
so thank you very much again for that no

532
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,080
worries

533
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,280
you
