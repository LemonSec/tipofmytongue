21
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:10,030
like to run through is what does a bad

22
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,550
CV look like what does a good CV look

23
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,580
like Photoshop spoke to a lot of hiring

24
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:18,850
managers about this and shims sharing

25
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:21,100
some feedback in terms of how long

26
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,740
should a CV be which is a question I get

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,470
asked a lot and also just where's the

28
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:29,619
real key information we're looking for

29
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,750
and then giving you an example they see

30
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,690
that I've built myself cuz I don't like

31
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,580
a share other people's CDs and I'd be if

32
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:40,590
I still that would be really happy and

33
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:44,530
first guest for a bit of context I see

34
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:47,470
hundreds of Series a week so I yeah a

35
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,680
lot of CVS lot of information and

36
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:54,370
there's a lot of work that people can do

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:58,150
but doesn't have to be too in-depth so a

38
00:01:54,370 --> 00:02:00,460
bad CV it's all about the information is

39
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,400
to comment is the content and then how

40
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:07,360
you deliver that content so it's not

41
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,489
informative enough really there's some

42
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,440
terrible CDs that I see in terms of

43
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:13,659
someone just literally just talks about

44
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,920
the job title they have it doesn't even

45
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:16,130
talk about the role what they've

46
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,329
achieved in that position

47
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:28,590
it can be too long I once got sent

48
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:32,520
someone cv and that was a 112 page white

49
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:35,940
paper as a CV which no one's gonna read

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,060
that and I do see a lot of CDs that are

51
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,400
between sort of 6 to 12 pages long again

52
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,150
I think is too long but we'll talk about

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,260
what a good length of CV is further on

54
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,780
there's a lot of CDs that just look

55
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,000
horrible on the ice I just they just

56
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,920
look horrible to be honest nothing

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,500
there's a lot of tools and templates you

58
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,958
can use to really just help yourself

59
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,300
stand out a bit more incorrect

60
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,660
information is a pleasant way of saying

61
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,190
that someone lies so there are times

62
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,530
when people been caught out lying on

63
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,690
their CV or maybe over-exaggerating

64
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,450
skills or things that they have done

65
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,040
please do not do that it's a this is an

66
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,790
industry where you can or will get

67
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:21,260
caught out you don't have to over

68
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:25,590
exaggerate things long paragraphs so

69
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,940
really lots of big sentences really you

70
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,769
want to break things up into bullet

71
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,640
points and then just general poor

72
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:34,470
formatting and spelling errors I think

73
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,140
we've we've all the technology and stuff

74
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:42,170
we have these days there is no excuse to

75
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:44,880
have bad grammar on a CV and just boring

76
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,850
there are a lot of CVS that literally

77
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,890
are boring you want to basically grab

78
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:54,720
someone's attention we'll talk about

79
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:57,899
that as well so thanks google here's a

80
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,930
couple of very average looking CVS that

81
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,269
I copied and pasted and I mean this is

82
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,760
not relevant for security these are fake

83
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:08,010
series I'm sure they are but I do see a

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,410
lot of CDs like this though where you'll

85
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,290
see that there's not really much detail

86
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:17,339
in there at all and in the personal

87
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:20,250
profile there are certain key words and

88
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:22,530
phrases that come across every so every

89
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,020
time but very often in terms of I'm a

90
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,650
hardworking person and things like this

91
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,628
and there's really generic terms so

92
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,789
something like that

93
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:33,639
really doesn't help you stand out as an

94
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:39,919
individual

95
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:42,889
thanks for us and yeah just you want to

96
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,438
make it as personal as possible here's

97
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:49,009
another example again lay out pretty

98
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,589
average it's way too much personal

99
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:53,089
detail in there you do not need your

100
00:04:51,589 --> 00:05:00,020
home address and things like that

101
00:04:53,089 --> 00:05:02,990
date of birth even and yeah just very

102
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:05,419
average looking CDs but again this looks

103
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:08,599
quite normal compared to some CDs that

104
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:10,369
we see and seek we've got some good

105
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:14,119
information out there so they've got a

106
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:16,819
couple of slides that I've borrowed this

107
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:18,889
is the example of a bad one so very

108
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:22,610
similar to those other two in terms of

109
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:23,990
just lack of information something like

110
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,419
this just doesn't tell you about the

111
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,669
person what my general advice about

112
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:30,919
Seavey's is this is your personal

113
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:32,779
marketing material this is how you're

114
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:34,909
going to sell yourself present yourself

115
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:36,949
to normally people that don't know you

116
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:39,529
if you're pretty fortunate where are you

117
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,419
in the community and maybe a friends

118
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:43,689
recommending your or friends even hiring

119
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:46,099
you then it's a different situation but

120
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:47,930
most the time we're applying for roles

121
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:49,938
where you might not know the hiring

122
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,009
manager or is being seen by someone else

123
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:53,930
from HR or different manager that's

124
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:57,800
going to be reviewing the profile you do

125
00:05:53,930 --> 00:06:00,079
need to sell yourself so grabbing

126
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,089
attention it is one of the most

127
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,930
important things I think for me the two

128
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:08,119
key elements for CV is how quickly you

129
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,769
can basically introduce yourself grab

130
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:15,439
attention and the other thing is the

131
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:20,209
quality content so time this is an

132
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:21,680
interesting one I will check the

133
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:25,039
questions as I go if that's okay or

134
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,879
afterwards that's okay in terms of

135
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,619
questions so a time how long do we

136
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,649
actually have in terms of someone

137
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:35,959
reviewing a CV and it may surprise some

138
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:38,659
people might have not surprised others

139
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:42,880
that maybe actually do review CVS but I

140
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:45,380
can say it's not long so

141
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,909
60-seconds personally I think that be

142
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:51,920
very generous could it be more or could

143
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,090
it be less so could it be 30 seconds

144
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,090
wrong again

145
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:03,260
so again Google thank you telling us

146
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,820
that between six and eight seconds

147
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,000
you'll see some others that say 11

148
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:10,370
seconds or whatever is and it might not

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,650
be six seconds that you have to grab

150
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,740
someone's attention but to be honest you

151
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,330
don't have a long time at all so you

152
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,520
want to make as much impact as possible

153
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,289
to grab that person's attention that

154
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,380
comes with that initial sort of profile

155
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,670
the look of a CV they look and feel

156
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,980
again if it looks interesting then

157
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:31,610
someone will gravitate and spend more

158
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:34,670
time on that here's an example of a CV

159
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,350
interesting the surnames on there is

160
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:40,580
Burke I have nothing to do with that CV

161
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,630
um this is an OK CV there's definitely

162
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,690
some improvements that can be actually

163
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:48,830
made on this but what's good is the way

164
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:51,410
it looks sort of first of all in the

165
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,300
first paragraph the personal profile is

166
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,820
you're selling yourself and I think it's

167
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,610
really important that first key bit you

168
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,620
need to tell someone who you are what

169
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,830
you're doing about it or where you want

170
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,330
to be so depending on what level you're

171
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,070
at in your career if you're some who's

172
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,780
aspiring to get into security it's gonna

173
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,240
be a different type of description

174
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,219
compared to someone who's a CSO or a

175
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,260
threat analyst or someone in the

176
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,330
industry already but effectively you

177
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,030
talk about yourself and what you do

178
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,430
start off with then looking at some key

179
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,929
skills and then talking about the role

180
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,260
and I think it's important to talk about

181
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:30,770
the context of your role you may have

182
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:33,049
the job title of security consultant

183
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,030
which in this industry can mean so many

184
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:38,419
different things from pentesting to GRC

185
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:40,039
and many many more or it could be more

186
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,400
of a job title that other people do know

187
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,319
so it could be a sysadmin but assists

188
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,640
admin at one company is very different

189
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,800
so maybe at a different different

190
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,390
business or what defines your role

191
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,969
compared to somewhere else is what you

192
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:56,240
achieved in that role so you don't have

193
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,480
to do the copy and paste which often it

194
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,740
feel

195
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,279
like someone's literally just copying

196
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:03,550
and pasting their their responsibilities

197
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,170
from a job ad and pasting into their CV

198
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,990
we know what the role generally does if

199
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,849
if it's a bit unusual of a position then

200
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,310
maybe give a brief one or two sentence

201
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,199
summary but I think really focus on your

202
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,810
achievements what did you do in that

203
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:20,359
role that other people find interesting

204
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:23,239
and again depending on your job itself

205
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,680
it can differ from whether you've

206
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,980
delivered something we've used to help

207
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:31,910
save money it's all about the the

208
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:35,899
context or the content I'll come back to

209
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,790
how long a CV will be very shortly so in

210
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:39,920
typical fashion of putting out a tweet

211
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,339
that quite a few people did see there

212
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,300
was a spelling error which is fantastic

213
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:47,779
but I want to get some feedback from

214
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,910
people out there so it's one thing we

215
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:52,339
have an opinion I see lots of CVS we

216
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,939
help hire people across the country and

217
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:57,980
beyond but again this is my opinion I

218
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,899
like to get the feedback of other people

219
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,790
in the industry the actual hiring

220
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,819
managers what do they want to see from a

221
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:07,610
CV in terms of how how is it presented

222
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:11,290
the length of it the information and

223
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,290
this is the feedback that others shared

224
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:21,560
so you'll see some very familiar themes

225
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,279
here so I think some very simple thing a

226
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,189
lining

227
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:27,370
I guess the role being advertised so you

228
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,870
want to get the information correct I

229
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:34,310
guess taking a backward step but looking

230
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:36,319
at this as a bigger picture if you're if

231
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,790
you're maybe desperate for a role maybe

232
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:39,889
you're looking for your first role in

233
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,019
the industry a lot of people will apply

234
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:44,389
for as many jobs as possible and I don't

235
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:46,699
think they tailor their search or they

236
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:49,490
tailor their applications on a roll by

237
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:50,540
role basis yes it might it will take you

238
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,970
more time but I think if you're

239
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,740
selective about who you're applying to

240
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,139
and then the information you're sharing

241
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,940
because they can differ slightly role to

242
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,970
role depending on the needs of them or

243
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,529
the role and what you have to offer you

244
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,519
can have a much more successful approach

245
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:09,840
that way so the key things I'm seeing

246
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,760
across here where Thomas's points

247
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,490
it's basically outcomes and businesses

248
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,920
business problem I think if we remember

249
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,530
the effectively security IT in general

250
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,420
is there to support business and if you

251
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,260
can show that you are aware of that and

252
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,719
you're helping solve problems that is

253
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,430
that is massive and then effectively

254
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,220
being aware that what you're doing is

255
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,390
help helping produce outcomes and this

256
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,440
is the information you want to be

257
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:40,380
highlighting on your CV so this guy here

258
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,390
looks quite familiar and I fully agree

259
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,240
with him not just because ins helped him

260
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:47,880
run the conference but it's the

261
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,960
information so his last comment is

262
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,400
examples examples examples this is huge

263
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,020
it's one thing saying that you've done

264
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,199
something it's another thing talking

265
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,610
about the actual experience itself so if

266
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,710
you can then talk about that and then

267
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,810
put even in business context know what

268
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,700
did you do how did you help deliver

269
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,040
something and what did it mean to the

270
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,810
business that shows that you've got a

271
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,910
very very different level of

272
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,890
understanding there may be a lot of

273
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,110
others out there so if you can

274
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:23,160
demonstrate that business impact massive

275
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:27,030
and you do that through examples then

276
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,439
great another one outcomes so some

277
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:32,250
familiar names that people will see

278
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:35,420
there I think good example by Brendan

279
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,710
there sparkle ops is bullet points so

280
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,420
again don't list your job description as

281
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:45,990
bullet points but again what outcomes

282
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:48,240
did you get what else so this is massive

283
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:51,150
as well again this more an information

284
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,150
about basically keeping it personal and

285
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:56,400
relevant to yourself you may be new to a

286
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:58,020
to a job maybe you're aspiring to your

287
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,730
first role in security maybe your spines

288
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,550
to pivot from one role to another role

289
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,260
and security but often it's maybe not

290
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,839
it's not about what you do in your job

291
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,400
that's really relevant or it is but the

292
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,770
additional stuff is what you do in your

293
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,209
spare time so again it could be what

294
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,890
tools you're building what research

295
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:16,410
you're doing it doesn't have to be

296
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,930
technical things all the time but it's a

297
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,520
bit easier to highlight you get github

298
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,069
account it could be easier to highlight

299
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,529
a research blog that you're sharing

300
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,149
this is stuff that people really really

301
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:28,550
want to see hiring managers because it

302
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:31,370
shows another level of commitment and

303
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,979
determination and if you have to people

304
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,230
are very similar and again it could be

305
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,910
whether people are experienced or not

306
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,529
you've got let's say a couple he's

307
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,819
experienced both people working at a

308
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:43,189
certain tough business certain type of

309
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:46,189
role it's how they present themselves

310
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:48,050
that can help one person basically move

311
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,029
on and progress quicker and that can

312
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:53,149
come from information that's sharing on

313
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:55,279
their CV so that's the examples that's

314
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:57,889
the outcomes and also the stuff they're

315
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,540
doing in their spare time so not not

316
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:01,610
enough people actually put the things

317
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,560
they do in their spare time so whether

318
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,350
it's conference is involvement going to

319
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,300
meetups again the research blogs the

320
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,190
things like that the amount of times

321
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,500
I've told people to put their research

322
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,389
blog and their github account on their

323
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,880
CV because it's really relevant or even

324
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:18,649
their LinkedIn is massive and I think

325
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,180
you keep doing those things people will

326
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:27,829
see the value you can add in different

327
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:30,859
ways so another for outcomes-based I'm

328
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:33,019
sure it is down there somewhere but okay

329
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,089
problem solving so again it's thinking

330
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:36,980
about problem solving and having that

331
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:38,660
sort of learned mindset nothing that's

332
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,060
that's really key as well so if you

333
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,319
share it again aware of whether there's

334
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,800
business outcomes you're a problem

335
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:48,139
solver you could be a level where yes

336
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,609
you understand this technology here but

337
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:51,949
the thing is technology's moving so

338
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,300
quickly that what you know today it

339
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:54,680
might be relevant in a couple of years

340
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,599
but there'd be lots of other things you

341
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,579
need to learn as well so if you can

342
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,980
demonstrate that you are a consistent

343
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:03,800
learner and you actually enjoy you're

344
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,569
passionate about something you know

345
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,510
you've got much more likelihood of

346
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:09,769
getting hired for new roles and getting

347
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,680
opportunities for learning and

348
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:16,819
development if you show that basically

349
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:19,638
you are that sort of person already big

350
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:23,389
question how long so how long should a

351
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:25,100
CV be I've had some interesting

352
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:29,389
conversations with this over the years

353
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,220
and if I'm completely honest my opinion

354
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:33,889
has changed and I'll tell you where

355
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,750
that's basically gone so these are

356
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:37,220
actual hiring managers

357
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,940
they're very kindly shed some feedback

358
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:47,530
on LinkedIn so one page one page being

359
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:51,860
customized I agree so mark who runs

360
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:53,510
security over Accenture two pages just

361
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,690
in contributing there again two pages

362
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:59,540
and I think he's spot on there it's

363
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,640
about communication so you don't have to

364
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:05,959
list everything you do but I think it's

365
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:08,300
about how you share the information I

366
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:14,720
think is really important

367
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:16,790
Chris another for two pages and we have

368
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,510
others as well is maybe two pages or

369
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:24,140
more if you're a more experienced some

370
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:26,480
people like the whole history they like

371
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,830
to see everything but if I'm honest I

372
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,010
think the way that I speak to a lot of

373
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,120
managers these days the feedback is

374
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,740
effectively what you're seeing here

375
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,410
they want to see concise information

376
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,960
that's articulated very well you don't

377
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,939
have to talk about everything obviously

378
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,040
list the jobs you've had we don't have

379
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,870
to go into crazy depth in about each

380
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,120
position so be very selective and that's

381
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,280
where a tailored approach about your

382
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,620
maybe roles you're looking looking at or

383
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,180
applying to is relevant because certain

384
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,980
information could be relevant for this

385
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:58,609
company here or may be different for

386
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:03,470
another business over there and this was

387
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:08,990
the feedback so the vast vast majority

388
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:12,260
was up to two pages I used to be someone

389
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:15,620
who would say five six pages that's okay

390
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,510
I look to be honest I still send TVs of

391
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,819
people that are still those sort of

392
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:22,040
lengths but my recommendations of these

393
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:24,589
days is you want to compact things as

394
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,139
much as possible I think it goes in line

395
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:32,210
with demonstrating your ability to

396
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:35,120
communicate I think really emphasizing

397
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:37,280
things and it's that impact so does

398
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,709
someone realistically are they going to

399
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,500
spend the the whole time duration

400
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,780
reading a five six page CV some people

401
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,300
will I'd say the most vast majority

402
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,280
won't be they'll be scanning the CV for

403
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,169
the rights of information to say

404
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,180
this person worth getting in for an

405
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,530
interview and that's all you're looking

406
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:59,270
to do you're looking to generate enough

407
00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:00,830
I guess interest in that description or

408
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,360
the sharing of your profile initially

409
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,460
then to then have the proper

410
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,080
conversation of talking about what you

411
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,040
have to offer understanding their

412
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:13,040
requirements and sharing information so

413
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,139
that said where do we start because talk

414
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,830
to be honest

415
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,080
creating a CV is a pain in the ass I

416
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:23,000
review lots of CVS

417
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,470
do I like putting them together the

418
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,680
answer is no and I think the vast

419
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:30,530
majority of people don't I think through

420
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,810
our careers we don't update our Seavey's

421
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:35,540
too much I think we only do it when we

422
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,129
actually are maybe needing or looking

423
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,720
for a new job which unfortunately might

424
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:43,850
be relevant for a few people out at the

425
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,410
moment but I think the the I guess the

426
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,409
usual thing I see is someone who's got a

427
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:50,120
CV that's a number of years old and all

428
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,010
they do is every time I've got a new job

429
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,959
they just add at the next one at the

430
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,570
next one at the next one and they

431
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,360
haven't actually taken the time to

432
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:01,490
actually revamp the whole thing start

433
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,590
from scratch which again it sounds

434
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,210
really labor-intensive and to be honest

435
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:08,990
it can be but it can also be really

436
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,880
refreshing to analyze yourself and

437
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,530
actually think about what things you

438
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,240
want to demonstrate which what do you

439
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,490
want to highlight to people out there

440
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,820
because again it's your marketing

441
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:22,430
material so if you don't want to read

442
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:28,280
your CV how are other people going to

443
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:31,790
feel about that so for me these are the

444
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:36,560
key things a good CV so clear relevant

445
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:37,070
information a profile summary so who are

446
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,290
you

447
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:42,020
basically what do you do or what do you

448
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:44,149
want to do and then the next thing is

449
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:48,889
information this is the content so

450
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:51,140
examples examples examples outcomes so

451
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:55,790
business outcomes or problem-solving

452
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:58,730
sharing information so again too many

453
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:01,100
CVS read like someone's copy and pasted

454
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,890
their job description from a role you

455
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,360
know you could be a pen

456
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,490
testing you're basically writing you're

457
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,949
doing web application pen tests it

458
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,720
doesn't mean much yes we know what

459
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,380
you're doing but maybe talk about some

460
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,600
examples

461
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,610
you can't shared obviously specific

462
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,620
things like customer names and certain

463
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,810
things but you can talk about some of

464
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,389
the more interesting projects that

465
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:25,120
you've done so you know talking about

466
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,710
maybe the scope of it the the outcomes

467
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,229
you know what did you do what was your

468
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:31,510
impact in that and you're not gonna do

469
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,090
for every engagement but it as an

470
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,710
example it could be again you're a

471
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,649
security architect and you're some

472
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:41,110
particularly tricky architecture because

473
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:43,870
of a certain customers infrastructure

474
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:46,090
maybe they were what everyone be there's

475
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,909
lots of millions examples out there but

476
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:51,699
keep it relevant to you you know what

477
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:53,470
did you do not do you know we do as a

478
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,410
collective but what did you do what was

479
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:59,680
your impact that's the key stuff people

480
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:02,020
want to see and also then it then

481
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,910
demonstrates you have the skills and

482
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,100
it's one thing talking about that you've

483
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:09,850
done something again let's just go back

484
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,620
to pen testing but let's go web apps or

485
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,199
even this let's keep it relevant for

486
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,270
someone like Ian where it's let's call

487
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,000
it more of a soft type roll incident

488
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:25,139
response so there's a difference between

489
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:28,060
someone who has done one investigation

490
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,890
compared to someone who's done 20 so

491
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,060
it's that sort of information as well

492
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,880
because you could put on your CV that

493
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:36,280
you have done instant response but it's

494
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,570
the then the next level is the depth how

495
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,010
much have you done of that what's the

496
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:42,850
real interesting stuff that people want

497
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:45,940
to see keep it short keep concise one to

498
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:47,590
two pages easy on the eye keeping it

499
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,060
easy on the eye is easier said than done

500
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,850
but there's some really helpful

501
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:55,690
templates out there but I recommend so I

502
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:57,429
will share those as well and one other

503
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,940
thing I was talking to Casey from

504
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,340
bugcrowd

505
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:04,210
who gave me some feedback and I think is

506
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:05,740
really relevant on a CV it's easy if you

507
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,420
have the experience if you have the work

508
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,990
experience but what about the people out

509
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,740
there that don't have it yet and

510
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,440
unfortunately there's plenty of people

511
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,600
that looking for a job in this space

512
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,910
that haven't had that opportunity yet

513
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,620
and this is where again those things you

514
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,900
do outside of your work or education

515
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,370
because again you could be someone who's

516
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,400
a software engineer that wants to get

517
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,199
into security but at home you're playing

518
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,690
around with cts maybe you're doing bug

519
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,700
bounties maybe you're building tools

520
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,940
this is the stuff that people are not

521
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:41,470
putting on their CV so everyone should

522
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:42,910
but even more so if you are trying to

523
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,130
get into the industry or trying to

524
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,810
transition or again maybe you'll want to

525
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,630
go from this role to another role in

526
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:52,030
security so you want to be a pen tester

527
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:54,130
want to go into blue teaming or vice

528
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,540
versa so if you can demonstrate the

529
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,670
skills that you're learning on the side

530
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,190
or in your spare time this then

531
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:02,980
demonstrates to people that you don't

532
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,050
just know fancy moving into that but you

533
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:11,410
actually are putting your time effort

534
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:13,690
and money to doing so as well and that's

535
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:16,270
just sort of rehashing that and if

536
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:19,420
anyone wants a link for this I'm happy

537
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:22,150
to share yeah happy to show the details

538
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,500
anyway but basically it's very similar

539
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,290
to the last thing about being clear and

540
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,970
concise but I think again it's it's the

541
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,980
conference's the meetups the self

542
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,600
learning demonstrating that you're

543
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,280
really passionate about this space and

544
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,959
there are there were so many people out

545
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,370
there that I see regularly at the

546
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,450
conference's at meetups and they're

547
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,120
desperate to try and get into the

548
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,560
industry but maybe they're not doing

549
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,570
themselves justice by actually then

550
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,580
putting that information out there so

551
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,080
particularly and this is for LinkedIn as

552
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,550
well I would recommend putting this

553
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,909
stuff on your LinkedIn profile as well

554
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:53,740
you can let your LinkedIn and CV mirror

555
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:56,920
each other I don't see much of a

556
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:59,440
difference personally but effectively

557
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,180
you want to from a linkedin perspective

558
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,890
it helps if you're putting lots of key

559
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,570
information on there that's going to

560
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,270
help you get found on searches as well

561
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:09,040
and then if a hiring manager is looking

562
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,410
at your profile and sees you doing all

563
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,940
this cool stuff even if you don't have

564
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,280
the experience that then shows that

565
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:18,400
you're pretty committed in your passion

566
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,410
about getting to this area and also one

567
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,480
page I've seen people with no experience

568
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:26,230
have three four pages CVS

569
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,830
I'm sorry but you don't have much to

570
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,500
share

571
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:32,260
so one page is enough

572
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,870
unless your second page could be a list

573
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,190
of vulnerabilities that you found or

574
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,739
research or something like that but

575
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,000
again that could be a link for your blog

576
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:43,590
but you don't need much more on the page

577
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,590
TV if you don't have much experience

578
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:51,310
don't share too much this is I'm deadly

579
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:53,020
serious about this I'll be honest it's

580
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:55,530
not so much from people in Australia it

581
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:59,080
is people from overseas because I do get

582
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:01,389
resumes from all over the world I think

583
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,179
the worst one I saw was someone and this

584
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:06,520
is this was a security professional

585
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:09,220
putting on not just their passport

586
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,500
details but the information for their

587
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,260
parents and all of their details

588
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,690
including passport information as well

589
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:20,590
which is really scary when that person's

590
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:23,500
in security so you do not need even your

591
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:25,120
full name is in like your middle name if

592
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,510
you have one you don't need your full

593
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,469
address

594
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:30,460
I think suburb or city is enough people

595
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,960
don't need to know your marital status

596
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:36,400
people don't need your possible details

597
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,680
you don't need your date of birth on

598
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,900
there and sometimes people put their

599
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,180
reference details on there I don't think

600
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,730
it's it's always relevant so you can

601
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,410
just put a bit of references available

602
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:50,200
on request but you don't need to put a

603
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:54,550
referees name phone number of things

604
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:57,580
like that and to be honest if you do you

605
00:25:54,550 --> 00:26:01,300
are then just generally sharing that for

606
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,379
other people then to use and a that's a

607
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,320
trick that a lot of recruitment

608
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:07,870
companies would to be honest use as well

609
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,250
so do yourself a favor and those people

610
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:11,469
from the references even though you're

611
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,280
they want to help you and vice versa you

612
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:18,550
don't need to share that information

613
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:20,920
until you need to here's two templates

614
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:23,680
that I would use so if I'm honest I've

615
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,780
I've only been on the the bottom one

616
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:30,160
there I've not actually used it but it

617
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:32,649
looks really cool can I use for a lot of

618
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,150
stuff anyway for our business but the

619
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:36,670
resume templates are really good they've

620
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:38,050
got so

621
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:41,350
and they're pretty pretty easy to use

622
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:43,480
and I think this is where having easy on

623
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:46,320
the iron makes a big difference and you

624
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,270
know if you've got two identical

625
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,129
documents of information how you present

626
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,629
it is the next thing so it's the quality

627
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:57,370
information and then how you present

628
00:26:52,630 --> 00:27:00,190
that is really two big factors in having

629
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:03,149
more time spent on your CV in terms of

630
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:07,600
the viewer spending more time in your CV

631
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:08,980
so I put this together it didn't take

632
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,719
that long if I'm honest there's a lot of

633
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:15,040
copy and paste information but this is

634
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,040
what you could do you could have a sieve

635
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,200
you already existing but you can just

636
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:23,050
use a template like this and some people

637
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:26,170
might not like it having a photo on a CV

638
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:29,080
might seem really weird and to be honest

639
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:30,730
until I came to Australia it was quite

640
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,689
normal for me I used to recruit a lot in

641
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:37,540
Germany where Germany people pay for

642
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:39,040
profile headshots and then it goes on

643
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:41,170
their CV it's like a quite an official

644
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,420
thing so most Seabees I've come across

645
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:45,490
in Germany actually had photos on it and

646
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,640
then coming over to Australia

647
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:52,300
most people 99 percent of people don't

648
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:59,080
because that's quite normal thank you

649
00:27:52,300 --> 00:28:00,909
very much TM yeah so this is a if we

650
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,310
think about it might seem weird photo on

651
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:06,310
a CV but then your photo is normally on

652
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:08,980
your LinkedIn profile anyway so it's not

653
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:11,409
much of a difference and personally this

654
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,970
is one I put together specifically for

655
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:17,770
the example of someone that has no work

656
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:20,410
experience so again I've kept the

657
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:23,230
personal profile in my opinion personal

658
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:25,630
in terms of enjoying coding singers 12

659
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:27,400
if someone reads that person if I read

660
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,110
this I'll be really excited because it

661
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,030
feels like this person is going to go a

662
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,070
long way in security because they're

663
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:34,629
taking a lot of boxes that I would look

664
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,840
for they look like a curious person

665
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:39,840
they're playing around with things which

666
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,550
is what you want you want a curious mind

667
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,310
they've you've got the stuff there but

668
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:47,490
outside of Education so what am i

669
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:51,990
following in terms of

670
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:54,780
any self-study CTS bug bounties which

671
00:28:51,990 --> 00:29:00,210
conferences I've been to on the other

672
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:03,780
side we've got my university security

673
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:05,640
club being involved in the CTFs so again

674
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,620
information about that just demonstrates

675
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,210
because again not enough people even put

676
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,590
about they could be the present of this

677
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:13,559
security club but it's not even on their

678
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:14,730
CV so this information is really

679
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,500
relevant because again you're going

680
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:19,140
above and beyond a lot of other people

681
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,929
out there so particularly if you are

682
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:24,570
trying to get in the industry

683
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:26,820
unfortunately there are ten thousands of

684
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:29,700
people that want to get into security

685
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:32,100
every single year with their new degrees

686
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:35,690
and masters so it's a very competitive

687
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:38,669
space so you need every single possible

688
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:40,830
competitive advantage you can get so

689
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:43,679
stuff like this will help you stand out

690
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:45,210
over some who doesn't have that and then

691
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,690
I've put on there about a github account

692
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:51,510
some tools or tool that I've built and

693
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:54,300
some basically programming skills and

694
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:56,370
then sort of courses from university as

695
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:59,550
well or even personal courses that

696
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:02,399
someone could be studying like I say I

697
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:06,330
see a lot of Seabees if I saw that I'd

698
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:08,820
get very excited again other people are

699
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,770
different but you could have that with

700
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:14,100
you know you could replace the work

701
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:15,510
that's the external CTF head information

702
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,980
if you're already working you could have

703
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,510
obviously a current workplace there and

704
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,610
if you had one or two things like that

705
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:23,790
two or three bullet points about again

706
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:26,129
what you've demonstrated and your

707
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:29,928
outcomes then that that's enough I think

708
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,929
to generate interest in your CV

709
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:36,750
questions so I've seen some questions

710
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:41,010
popping up on slack if you don't mind

711
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:42,510
I'll go through those go for it

712
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,770
there's some very interesting questions

713
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,030
I think there's a lot of interest in

714
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:49,920
some of the things you've had to say as

715
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:52,379
well okay so I'm not filtering this okay

716
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,740
some getting complaints I'll take it one

717
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,740
at a time

718
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:04,580
so have I had to worry about personally

719
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:07,219
identifying information yeah I think

720
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:10,159
going back to the thing of yeah you

721
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:13,640
don't even need so much information you

722
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,020
know keep it very simple even put your

723
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,460
LinkedIn profile on there and some can

724
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,000
find you as well but you only need your

725
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,090
name

726
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,920
I think city or suburb you don't need

727
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:25,550
much more personal information that like

728
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:28,880
that in my opinion do I think one page

729
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:32,000
CV is too short no no that that's

730
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:35,150
perfect Endicott so what yeah if you've

731
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:41,720
only don't have much experience that

732
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:44,480
once one page is definitely enough so

733
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,900
cool thanks for you and for sharing that

734
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,900
as well

735
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:55,820
feedback with that so what else so mark

736
00:31:52,760 --> 00:32:05,990
Alito law graduate CVS half in the first

737
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:07,520
page educational qualifications I feel

738
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:13,040
really awkward answering questions about

739
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:15,530
education because like university

740
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,389
degrees are helpful but they're not

741
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:20,300
they're not going to land some other job

742
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:23,750
I think it's many years since a degree

743
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:26,600
actually got some other job I think when

744
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:29,270
they're complimentary with basically

745
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,770
what someone's doing in terms of and I

746
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,180
think whether you're working or whether

747
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,560
you're in education I think the

748
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,290
important thing is what you're doing

749
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,790
outside of work that's the like your

750
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:40,190
education your degree or whether you're

751
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:43,250
working a job you don't get determined

752
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,780
or you don't determine the work or the

753
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,120
course work that you're doing at the

754
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:49,399
time what you do outside of your work

755
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,479
that's the stuff that you are interested

756
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,150
in that's where you're spending your

757
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,410
time or money so always always always

758
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:59,570
have that in tandem with an education

759
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:04,310
degree or whatever or master's or your

760
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:05,899
existing work as well so would you

761
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:08,389
recommend having degree some yeah

762
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,419
definitely still have degree on the CV

763
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,889
I've it on the first page

764
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:15,039
just depends on on the layout of a page

765
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:17,168
to be honest I wouldn't worry about

766
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,299
having the education at the very top

767
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:21,850
again this is just my opinion there's

768
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:23,379
other hiring managers or hiring managers

769
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:26,609
out there might there might different

770
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:28,539
opinion but I couldn't care less

771
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:30,668
when I'm not looking at someone's

772
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:32,739
education I'm really looking at

773
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:35,049
someone's education to be honest it's

774
00:33:32,739 --> 00:33:38,919
more about yeah the other stuff on the

775
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:40,210
CV so it the degree is helpful it does

776
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:42,639
show different things in terms of

777
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,440
commitment and other things like that

778
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:47,258
and sometimes for certain roles it's

779
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,450
very helpful you know if it's if I'm

780
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:50,919
looking for like a knapsack person or

781
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:54,669
security engineer that's going to be

782
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:58,139
doing cloud and infrastructure type work

783
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:59,980
there may be their degree can be helpful

784
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:02,590
things like there were a system

785
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,940
engineering or whatever or if someone

786
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,949
wants to get into Penn testing and

787
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,929
they've done some awesome or they've

788
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:11,199
been fortunate enough to have you know

789
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:13,569
someone like Sylvia sharing information

790
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,178
which some of those guys and girls don't

791
00:34:13,569 --> 00:34:17,799
even know how lucky they are you know

792
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,440
depends a lot that sort of stuff I would

793
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:23,790
massively put that on there and and it's

794
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:27,369
not just highlighted somewhere it's okay

795
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:29,500
so Shannon as a hire how do I prevent

796
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:37,270
people trying to fake enrolls they have

797
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:43,299
zero you can't so Shannon can you see my

798
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:45,159
slack Channel can anyone hear me can

799
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:46,329
hear you we can't see this like Jenna

800
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:49,030
was still seeing the slides right now

801
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:50,230
okay cause Shannon's question is sorry I

802
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,720
wasn't away you couldn't save my

803
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:56,230
apologies um so Shannon's got a good

804
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,819
question as a hire how do I prevent /

805
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:00,460
discourage people from applying for

806
00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:01,990
vacant roles that have zero relevant

807
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,910
experience or skills that the vast

808
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:06,700
majority of CVS I receive a completely

809
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:11,348
unsuitable and is evident that they are

810
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:14,200
they have not read TPD um you can't

811
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:15,970
I'm afraid Shannon there's a reason why

812
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,779
to be honest as a business we don't

813
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:21,339
bother advertising jobs for me they

814
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,780
don't work yes we might get the odd

815
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:26,140
person

816
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:27,820
that's applying for a role but a lot

817
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:31,330
obviously right now is a really weird

818
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:33,610
time and good people for no fault of

819
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:36,970
their own you know losing some jobs out

820
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:40,900
there but on a normal basis good people

821
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:42,430
are in jobs and you know they they might

822
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,570
be open to leaving but they might not be

823
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:48,100
actively applying for jobs so

824
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:59,100
unfortunately I don't know how to

825
00:35:48,100 --> 00:36:01,350
discourage that yeah okay thanks Sharon

826
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,549
sure yes

827
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,049
similar experiences there with people

828
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,740
overseas unfortunate people share too

829
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:11,440
much information right so any tips in

830
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:16,450
tailoring your CV to play nicely with

831
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:20,170
those awful HR systems I don't know if

832
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:25,509
I'm honest I think the key thing is is

833
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:28,500
just making sure the the information is

834
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:32,260
relevant for the job the job application

835
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:34,510
but yeah I'm not fan of those HR systems

836
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:36,010
either to be honest and a lot of them or

837
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:39,340
different businesses use different one

838
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:42,750
so I couldn't tell you a key thing to

839
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,750
get round what what they're looking for

840
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:49,930
some companies are skin Philippines for

841
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:52,720
mounts of status and photo well okay I

842
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:55,000
think scale wasn't aware of that

843
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,310
yeah obviously over here that's that's

844
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,470
not standard so I think now just

845
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:03,130
commenting that yeah overseas people do

846
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:05,080
actually ask those information Brett in

847
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:07,120
terms of work history how many previous

848
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,170
roles or years do you go back current

849
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,490
and previous that's an interesting one

850
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,200
especially obviously as the more

851
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,459
experienced you are the the more

852
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:20,859
positions you have and things like that

853
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:22,960
I have some people say 10 years if the

854
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:25,480
cuts off one and I've seen their to be

855
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,700
honest up I think a lot of people are

856
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,410
still happy to see sort of your pathway

857
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,330
your history so just to understand where

858
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:33,339
you're coming from where you got to so

859
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:35,410
it doesn't have to be much of a

860
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,359
description even be could that could be

861
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:39,180
literally a very

862
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:41,640
all the roll the year the job title

863
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,769
company and just even a one-liner about

864
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,499
the role but it doesn't have to be

865
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:48,808
in-depth at all I think what's important

866
00:37:46,499 --> 00:37:50,368
is some of these roles that we've had in

867
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:52,259
the past they can be stepping stones to

868
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:55,109
where we are now but maybe this may be

869
00:37:52,259 --> 00:37:56,789
the work itself isn't so relevant now as

870
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:58,859
it would have been years ago so you

871
00:37:56,789 --> 00:38:00,450
don't have to go into depth I think

872
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:03,660
think about the future as opposed to the

873
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:05,700
past if there's certain roles against

874
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:08,368
where a tailored approach helps if

875
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,169
there's a role where it can actually

876
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:12,480
utilize some experience you had from a

877
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:14,579
job or two jobs ago then you put it on

878
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,140
there but you don't have to tell them

879
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:20,940
about everything you've done in previous

880
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:22,950
roles so just one last one Ricky and

881
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,839
because I noticed it was posted earlier

882
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:29,009
on today actually before we even started

883
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:30,390
streaming today by Liz for a long time

884
00:38:29,009 --> 00:38:31,980
now been wondering whether there should

885
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:35,640
be a difference between the content of

886
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:37,710
one's LinkedIn profile versus CV is the

887
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,480
CV a bit redundant these days or should

888
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:43,559
it be a more detailed version of what's

889
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:46,619
on LinkedIn and depends what you go for

890
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:50,220
look again for me I quite like the shore

891
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:54,420
to page CV there it seems like a lot of

892
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:57,200
managers are asking for these days so I

893
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:01,230
think you can just Amir the information

894
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:03,689
so purposely I just copy and paste the

895
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:06,119
whole thing if I'm honest yeah

896
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:08,130
no that's great look I think from

897
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,690
everyone thank you very much Ricky and

898
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:11,519
thank you very much for us answering

899
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,170
some questions as well there's loads

900
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:14,519
more questions if you've got some time

901
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:17,819
to answer those in the chat as well

902
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:19,950
definitely but yeah thank you very much

903
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:22,099
I know there's a lot of people who are

904
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:24,359
very interested and there's also some

905
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:26,249
conversation you know discussions so

906
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,839
things about you know government for

907
00:39:26,249 --> 00:39:29,430
example still has a requirement on

908
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,609
bachelor's degrees for certain positions

909
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:35,430
ApS particularly and how that doesn't

910
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:37,799
necessarily fit into the cybersecurity

911
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:41,578
mindset the way that we've sort of

912
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:44,430
favored qualifications rather than you

913
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,569
know you cispes your Sans courses all

914
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:48,239
those kind of things rather than a

915
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:49,410
four-year degree necessarily so there's

916
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,980
definitely lots of conversation about

917
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:52,230
that

918
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,300
just on that on that note I'm not an

919
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:57,119
ectopic so I'm not an expert becomes to

920
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,770
hiring in Canberra I mean that certain

921
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,270
types of companies I am been terms of

922
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:03,180
actual government and their needs I

923
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:06,420
don't really have too much exposure so I

924
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:08,339
yeah I guess a lot of what I say maybe

925
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,950
is catered or directed more towards

926
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:14,340
industry because that's what my

927
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:15,930
experience is yeah so for everyone

928
