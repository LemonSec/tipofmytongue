the cyber community me and Shanna is the

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,429
way that we're very inclusive of

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,948
everyone so we're not just talking about

9

local security in community meetups

41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,440
InfoSec security conferences like

42
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,690

is just a slide that we were going

57
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:02,910
through but the kids and I go local

58
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,290
security community groups and in fact

59
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,269
here in Canberra

60
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:12,660
you ventured down to Melbourne for us

61
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:17,880
said quality security day and I work in

62
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:20,659
cyber so yeah let's go next so here's

63
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,250
some examples of the kids you know

64
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,639
grandma Grant Park and people arts mum

65
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,639
and dad

66
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,840
yeah so yeah here's a couple of

67
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:40,180
conferences that the kids have gone to

68
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:43,280
over the last year or two you'll enjoy

69
00:04:40,180 --> 00:05:09,890
okay guys so can anyone pick a lock

70
00:04:43,280 --> 00:05:19,280
isn't that illegal so when we pick the

71
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:21,530
lock at home like a front door so couple

72
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,770
rules yeah it's not illegal to pick

73
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,119
locks we use practice locks and as you

74
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,370
can see on the bottom there we get those

75
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,210
from local security chapters like

76
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,210
InfoSec

77
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:47,299
you can get them online at big powers

78
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:49,880
Amazon and this is very cheap but the

79
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,290
kids can pick locks yeah you can get a

80
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,480
practice lock and you can teach them

81
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:55,250
it's a really cool family hanging the

82
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:02,450
more you do it the more addicted you

83
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:25,430
become let's go through some of the

84
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:30,250
tools guys let's step through what makes

85
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:32,840
up a lot well we've got inside

86
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,730
Yelland which is the pot that you put

87
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,369
your key in just point to the cylinder

88
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,370
formula yeah cool

89
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,259
[Music]

90
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,498
[Music]

91
00:07:04,060 --> 00:08:27,080
so yeah okay what would happen for

92
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,299
trying open this with out okay so we

93
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:36,198
attempt to open it without the key what

94
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:39,890
happens to those pins they get into a

95
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:42,348
bond so that's where the upper pin is

96
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:45,470
getting a bond against the barrel and

97
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:48,399
the hazard so that's what happens you

98
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,959
can see that jargon just is subtly there

99
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,360
how that upper pin is getting stuck in a

100
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,880
bond if you can see how it's moving if

101
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,470
you look at it

102
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,170
[Music]

103
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:01,939
let's have a look let's say I'd operates

104
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:06,709
with a cane yeah we put the cane which

105
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:09,319
is just what happens to those pens with

106
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:24,378
the spring when you push the keys and

107
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:27,230
then you twist it on because all your

108
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:29,660
pins are different levels so if you have

109
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:35,449
a jagged key it means that the pins are

110
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:37,850
different it's gonna next side so let's

111
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:40,128
have a look at this side view what

112
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:49,519
you'll see now is the pens not getting

113
00:09:40,129 --> 00:10:07,370
into a jam or bind so what happens now

114
00:09:49,519 --> 00:10:09,139
guys up into the low pins are yeah guys

115
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:14,180
this is the favorite bit you guys don't

116
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:23,089
like using keys do you let's go to the

117
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:35,809
next one so we see bees in a barn it's

118
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:44,720
in a bond pen so I'm gonna keep breaking

119
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:47,029
will show them in a minute taking that

120
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,309
second pin out of the bonds and now we

121
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:52,429
can see that third being the back of the

122
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:54,079
barrel is in a bond so this technique is

123
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:56,629
called a lifting technique it's not

124
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,839
raking later on the girls will actually

125
00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:03,199
show you a raking technique lining the

126
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:08,170
top pins and the bottom pins and the

127
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:10,719
garo take the bond away yes

128
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:14,740
for the viewers just coming a bit closer

129
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:20,410
there you go as you can see with that

130
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:21,970
tension wrench now we can open that okay

131
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:36,069
so that's using a lockpick with the

132
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:38,769
lifting technique okay that's right so

133
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:43,000
this technique now is lifting but we can

134
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:46,089
also right so if you can do it a bit

135
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,889
closer to the screen if you can hear on

136
00:11:46,089 --> 00:12:01,810
that microphone you can hear the kids

137
00:11:47,889 --> 00:12:14,079
just raking the pins so just do that and

138
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:31,898
then I just clicked it without writing

139
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:34,180
again jagged so you can actually so with

140
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:36,430
the wave tool we're raking the Pens so

141
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:44,439
gently and put enough tension on the

142
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:54,040
barrel and that takes all the pins and

143
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:56,800
then you end up doing this so we've gone

144
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,969
through a few techniques I'm going to

145
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,949
give credit this is all open source

146
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:05,949
material so it's found on Tools dot u s

147
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:08,469
DV aren't a column is awesome god that's

148
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:10,420
helped build this content up and it's

149
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,319
open and available to present at

150
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,319
demonstrations like this

151
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,450
[Music]

152
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:35,569
okay so Leila take out your picking the

153
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,219
tension wrench so again these are just

154
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:47,089
practice locks which you can get online

155
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:49,220
on eBay blue box and one thing that we

156
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:51,770
get a lot of questions of is can you

157
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:55,100
travel with pigs now you can't take them

158
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:57,230
in carry-on luggage into aeroplanes it's

159
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,630
all online you can check your to sa

160
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:02,240
traveling to the states to have your

161
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:05,029
coins and things of that nature you can

162
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,860
put them in your pack luggage I think

163
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:10,310
the rules have changed slightly because

164
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,260
they're within a certain size limit you

165
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:14,959
can take them on carry on but we

166
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,790
encourage you guys to certainly jump

167
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,620
online check the local rules for the

168
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:25,370
countries or states and territories

169
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:26,839
you're heading to so I'm just going to

170
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:31,550
practice luck here and we're going to

171
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:35,150
get Leila to show us her I've got

172
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:47,089
attention ring one Cisco and I've also

173
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:51,819
got to do is get the tension wrench and

174
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:51,820
then we put our picking with the bump on

175
00:14:52,780 --> 00:15:05,959
facing the pins yeah hey Mike can you um

176
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:23,870
just stop the screen share and maybe we

177
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:26,060
can get some full screen of this can you

178
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:29,200
say full screen now so just over here

179
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,199
just right

180
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,389
so if you can hear the audio hopefully

181
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:44,420
it's good enough you can hear those pins

182
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:46,190
racing up and down Leila's yeah she's

183
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:56,000
putting just enough tension on it to

184
00:15:46,190 --> 00:16:04,220
take it out of the barn okay we've got

185
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:09,920
our last slide which is just a few guys

186
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:12,500
can see that one cheering still up girls

187
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,180
I want to thank you for for the

188
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,079

190
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:21,519
about this over the last week or two

191
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,139
yeah we convinced the kids to practice a

192
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:33,230
bit and we're gonna do is chew an

193

source material we demo locks where you

196
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:49,550

much

204
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,799
I think we could probably do a couple of

205
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:19,489
the questions from the room actually if

206
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:22,520
you want oh actually no apparently we

207
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:25,819
need to see the last slide first yes no

208
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,199
problem there is a request to see the

209
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:31,120
last slide because I know that there

210
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,120
were some modifications made to it

211
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:41,650
something fun to say thank you we say

212
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,649
that one you need to share the screen

213
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:53,620
[Music]

fantastic thank you very much guys look

216
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:01,610
I I know Mike it's always really

217
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,260
exciting when I see you and we catch up

218
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,629
for lunch and you show me another video

219
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,190
of your kids like lock-picking or

220
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,660
breaking into something something

221
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,130
they've been told they can break into I

222
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,690
love that piece

223
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:21,020
but then again I'm also never telling

224
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:22,730
you where I live you know for example

225
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:27,020
where I was at Colleen Melbourne and

226
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:29,510
it's an industrial industrial art centre

227
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:32,809
so actual locksmiths learn to pick locks

228
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:36,190
there and these two guys and even Jackie

229
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:38,928
boy were at the back picking locks and

230
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:41,090
no one's business and because they're so

231
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:44,260
young and just curious there's no

232
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,949
pressure there's no you know

233
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:51,140
preconceptions so they're just so

234
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:52,900
relaxed they pop locks and they know the

235
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,760
rules you know it's really really

236
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,770
important that if mum and dad or Grandma

237
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,540
and Grandpa are gonna you know get a

238
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,000
practice look and panning out with the

239
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,830
kids or the grandkids have some really

240
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,420
clear ground rules these guys know they

241
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,760
can't just go up to a house and pick

242
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,770
locks they know if there's and I would

243
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,960
lock on the ground or office you know

244
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,760
and I'll lock in the garage they can ask

245
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,190
mom and dad and they can have a crack at

246
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:20,150
picking it so it teaches them

247
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,230
responsibility boundaries and I think a

248
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,700
lot of that kind of stuff is very

249
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,890
relevant for things like the internet

250
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,179
now as well you know going and accessing

251
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,490
the internet when you know Mom and Dad

252
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,960
are not necessarily there and those sort

253
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,000
of things

254
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:36,290
so thank you very much the three of you

255
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,870
