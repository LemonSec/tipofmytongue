1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,830
we're a little early but I'll go through

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,129
the introductions so we've got Sarah

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,830
young who I believe you are a princess

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,809
of as your security is that correct

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,150
yeah totally it is my official job title

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,720
that is your official job title yeah

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,430
yeah I need to get a new job title James

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,140
if you're listening I would like that as

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,070
no I don't want that as my job title

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:33,090
I'll have Prince though so let me bring

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,449
up my little guide you realize now your

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,149
job titles gonna be princess it's our

13
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:40,710
gym for all the see I don't think your

14
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,380
mics completely in China or I'm just

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,940
going no hang on ignore me

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,020
my headphones are broken ignore me

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,180
we're happy that's all right we're just

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,440
talking about you talking about me it's

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,200
fine I'm a horrible person

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,940
okay Sarah is the self-titled Princess

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,120
of Microsoft's key as your security

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,699
allegedly Syd lives in Melbourne but is

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,589
most likely to be found in airport

24
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,440
lounges across Asia but obviously not at

25
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,090
the moment I know the the changi airport

26
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,190
lounge when I went through it three

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,190
weeks ago is very deserted of people

28
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:17,190
Sarah loves cloud security and spends

29
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,690
most of our time telling people how to

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,250
do it better and generally nerding well

31
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,110
we definitely appreciate that over here

32
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,410
so I without further ado I will hand

33
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,750
over to you Sarah cool thank you and

34
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,459
thanks everyone and who's watching I

35
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,349
hope they're all safe and well I'm

36
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,429
currently as I said I allegedly live in

37
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:36,179
Melbourne I'm actually currently in

38
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:39,569
Wellington so there you go not even in

39
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:41,429
my home country right now so oh I say

40
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:42,840
home country actually Australia is not

41
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:45,770
my own country you can probably tell by

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,239
the accent but let me share my screen

43
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:52,020
and hopefully all this stuff will work

44
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,580
so um hello everyone my name is Sarah

45
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,789
young and today I'm going to talk to you

46
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,349
about hacking voice I used to be for

47
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:01,080
background I used to be a network

48
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:03,330
engineer I used to do a lot of VoIP work

49
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,330
so much point work I've deployed

50
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,728
hundreds of thousands of telephones

51
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,470
mostly across Europe and so since I

52
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,870
transitioned into security about six

53
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,640
seven years ago it's always been

54
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,290
something I wanted to revisit which is I

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,839
finally got to do it with this talk so

56
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,480
we're gonna talk about hacking for

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,280
so um I actually thought it would be

58
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,200
really fun to use the design suggestions

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,060
on PowerPoint for the for all these

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,709
slides so if its kind of burning your

61
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,410
eyes I'm really sorry

62
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,210
I just never really used the design

63
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,190
ideas on PowerPoint so I decided that

64
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:39,420
the next time I did a talk I would try

65
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:42,120
and try and do it using the design ideas

66
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,649
just to see see how it came out so I'm

67
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,590
gonna blame that if you don't want my

68
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,560
sides and real quick Who am I I'm an

69
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,870
OSHA security architect I was nicknamed

70
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,520
the princess of security by some of my

71
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,820
teammates in Hong Kong it's kind of

72
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,070
stuck with some people I live in

73
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,329
Melbourne oh I did do this I meant to

74
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,730
take that out I'm pretty sure everybody

75
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,590
here knows your Melbourne is I did do

76
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,570
this talk in America which is why I have

77
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,600
that colder and wetter bit of Australia

78
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:12,480
and I really love dogs that is not my

79
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,590
dog sadly it's my parents dog because I

80
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,720
can't have a dog because I live a very

81
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,200
small apartment and travel too much or

82
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,120
at least I used to I used to be a VoIP

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,429
engineer and now I do car security stuff

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,470
I am a prolific user of gifts and memes

85
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,060
in my presentations if you've ever seen

86
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,250
anything I've done before it will be

87
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,110
full of them I think that my gift and

88
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,450
mean game and this particular topic is

89
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,580
not how strong and that's largely

90
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,380
because there's not that many about

91
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,480
telephones that are relevant but you

92
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,320
know bear with me I've still got nothing

93
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,359
I think um I didn't again I should have

94
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,859
a shifter I meant to do something I

95
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,270
meant to put I live in Melbourne and

96
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,670
there's Melbourne but I'm actually in

97
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,740
Wellington and I think I have

98
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,200
accidentally deleted it yeah I did oh

99
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,030
wow so and what are we going to talk

100
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,010
about today I'm gonna talk about a brief

101
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,550
history of phone hacking before voice

102
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:05,040
because of course voice over IP did you

103
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,900
know is a normal telephones and normal

104
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,109
telephone technology are still around

105
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,480
and they were a precursor to Voight and

106
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,000
we're going to recap very quickly the

107
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,238
basic principles are the basic tech

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,040
principles of a VoIP system so if you've

109
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,659
never worked with it before it's just

110
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,310
useful to understand some of the

111
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,430
concepts just before we talk about how

112
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,570
you winter how are you in hack here and

113
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,080
then we'll have a look at some of the

114
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,500
common

115
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,169
pack vectors for voice so let's crack on

116
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,330
now I really hope this will work and

117
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:46,799
come see on the zoom so if anyone's

118
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:47,580
watching and it doesn't tell me I'm sure

119
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,360
you thought you were going to be

120
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,900
watching clips or movies during during

121
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,900
the stream

122
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:36,450
please the number for dr. Robert Hume H

123
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:44,490
um II on tall Cedar Road what does that

124
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:47,820
mean I'm sorry oh wait uh Balkin dr.

125
00:06:44,490 --> 00:07:05,460
Stephen Falken si el que en at the same

126
00:06:47,820 --> 00:07:07,230
address right now someone just messaged

127
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,120
me and said that there was no sound on

128
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:12,360
that so sorry if you didn't hear any

129
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,950
sound I was I hope this would work but I

130
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,170
wasn't too sure anyway

131
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,430
if you didn't if you couldn't hear that

132
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,430
and you've never seen that clip before

133
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:23,460
of course that's from war games and that

134
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,410
is our classic voice or phone phone

135
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,039
hacking technique or how most people

136
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,210
perceive it to be now interestingly and

137
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm not going to go into this in too

138
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:35,969
much detail interestingly that clip

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,270
where Matthew Broderick sort of trips

140
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,670
the phone to get a dial tone of course

141
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,990
wargames is from the 80s and that

142
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,300
wouldn't have been possible to do on a

143
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,740
phone in the 80s it actually you don't

144
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,880
now to do that sort of stuff since the

145
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,650
60s because dial tone now was as you

146
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,690
know when you pick up a phone Dan tone

147
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:58,169
is there by default and the reason for

148
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,850
that is because it's so people can call

149
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,590
the emergency services it was actually

150
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,450
changed for that precise reason so you

151
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,409
don't need to get a dial tone in the

152
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,719
same way

153
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,070
anyway and there's a lot of if you go

154
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,750
and look that up you want to listen to

155
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:13,260
that clip the sound if you couldn't hear

156
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,580
it then and my apologies there wasn't a

157
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,409
way to test whether this would work

158
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,080
through the live stream beforehand I was

159
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,280
just kind of hoping it would if you

160
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,200
listened to that if you look at that

161
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,690
clip and have a look at it and there's

162
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,880
loads of real hardcore phone nerds

163
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,040
actually explaining in depth why that

164
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,330
won't work in the 80s but anyway that

165
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,729
was just to give you an idea of what we

166
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:37,079
typically know as classic kind of phone

167
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:40,140
hacking but let's look at the history so

168
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,169
in fact the first-ever hack of any

169
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,240
telephone technology was in 1903 it was

170
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,189
well over a hundred years ago and it was

171
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,880
done by a magician his name was Neville

172
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:54,510
Maskull line now what he did was he was

173
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,070
hacking Marconi's Wireless service and

174
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:59,100
he did it with this very very basic

175
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:02,490
antenna and with sender sending funny

176
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,640
messages through Wireless he was saying

177
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:08,520
things like just rats rats rats rats

178
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:12,360
which hey it was a hundred years ago

179
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:14,490
okay and he was saying little little

180
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,310
ditties and little poems that were sort

181
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,870
of bad-mouthing Marconi

182
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,520
obviously Marconi wasn't very happy and

183
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,080
it kind of showed him up at his big

184
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,319
public event where he was demonstrating

185
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,970
the wireless and four days later he

186
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,060
actually wrote into the times and

187
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:34,050
confessed what he'd done and his his

188
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:36,569
justification for doing it was that he

189
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:39,120
was showing that the wireless actually

190
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,610
had security vulnerabilities that it

191
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,120
could be hacked because one of Marconi's

192
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,970
claims was that no one could intercept

193
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,490
it it was it was absolutely secure you

194
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:53,160
can have privacy so that might sound a

195
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:56,640
little bit familiar but a hundred years

196
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,469
ago so and yeah humans don't change so

197
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,689
it seems so this was the chap Neville

198
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:05,220
and it was it transpired that he was

199
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:08,040
clicked oversight but also transpired he

200
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,260
was actually paid to do this by a rival

201
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,060
telegraph company who weren't using

202
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:16,140
wireless technology that actually paid

203
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,219
him to do it so yeah again people don't

204
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,420
change

205
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,810
the next time I'm gonna move on to is

206
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,540
phone phreaking now I'm skipping over

207
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,219
what happened in the Second World War

208
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,279
and and because arguably we could talk

209
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:33,460
here about the Enigma machine and how

210
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:35,710
that was decoded etc the signals were

211
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,480
decoded but I think a lot of that's been

212
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,130
covered quite extensively and I'm sure

213
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,170
most people have seen something about

214
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,240
that so I'm going to move on just to

215
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:46,569
talk about phone and phone phreaking

216
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:50,460
which started in the 1950s and the term

217
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:53,529
freak comes from phone free and freak

218
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,420
freaking big and it began when people

219
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:57,880
could when you used to have your dial

220
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:01,000
tone and the phone tone all in one

221
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,339
signal then you could send certain

222
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,110
frequencies down the phone line that

223
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:06,820
would match the dial tone and you could

224
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,130
essentially dial numbers for free and

225
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,100
trick the phone system into thinking

226
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:15,550
that that if it was a pay phone that you

227
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,950
paid etc essentially free cos usually

228
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,810
use this for make free phone calls it

229
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:23,290
was possible to do some eavesdropping as

230
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:25,029
well but and as you can see as I said my

231
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,650
gift and meme game is slightly weaker

232
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:28,600
because there's not that many things at

233
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:33,579
the telephone but his Barney with a very

234
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:35,680
big telephone so there you go some fun

235
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,300
facts about freaking and there are some

236
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,029
people who can actually whistle in a

237
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:44,439
perfect two thousand six hundred

238
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:46,150
megahertz pitch one freaka who was quite

239
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,920
famous called John Draper discovered

240
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,600
that a whistle that was distributed and

241
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,599
Captain Crunch cereal in the u.s.

242
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,480
actually emitted a perfect pitch and so

243
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,400
he used that extensively for phone

244
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,430
phreaking and that there is a picture of

245
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:03,400
said whistle which is just a complete

246
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,839
coincidence this is the first thing I

247
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,800
actually learned about phone phreaking

248
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:11,950
was blue boxes blue boxes were created

249
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,240
specifically to do phone phreaking and

250
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,880
that's the first time I'd ever heard of

251
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,650
it when I came across a blue box I think

252
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,050
it was a Kiwi con it was definitely at a

253
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:23,380
security conference a number of years

254
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:27,329
ago some famous freaker's are Steve Jobs

255
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:30,239
and and was they did not a college

256
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:32,878
it did stop largely in the 1980s when

257
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:34,920
dial tones were taken out of bounds so

258
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,959
they didn't sit in this in the main

259
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,059
voice stream and that actually stopped

260
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,638
because you couldn't in and that stopped

261
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:46,709
freaking largely because in order to

262
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:49,049
input the because in in band meant that

263
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:51,238
both the the voice signal your actual

264
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:53,339
speech and the dial tones and the

265
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:55,499
different tones were all together when

266
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,509
the dial tone when the control tones

267
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:59,429
were taken out profound it meant the

268
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,589
just by whistling down the phone it

269
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:07,920
wasn't in the same stream so that's what

270
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:10,739
stopped it largely in the 1980s um this

271
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,469
is a very short clip I know I it's

272
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:16,709
basically a very famous guy called Joe

273
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,959
and Gracia he could he could actually

274
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:21,209
whistle he was a blind man in the States

275
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,670
who could whistle and a perfect pitch to

276
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:26,040
do phone phreaking now it's a pretty

277
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:29,099
short clip I don't know if anyone can

278
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:31,469
hear it and I know the point of this is

279
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,660
that you can hear it so sorry if you can

280
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:37,889
and I'll play it and hope maybe people

281
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:39,238
can hear it if you can't do go and look

282
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:42,860
this up on YouTube and listen to it

283
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:42,860
yourself because it's really really cool

284
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:13,199
so there you go it's a pretty good party

285
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:14,610
trick if you can manage it and of course

286
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,579
as I said it doesn't really work anymore

287
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:20,759
but if you can find some old phones and

288
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:23,609
make your own little phone network into

289
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:29,970
that doesn't hit the normal PSTN who

290
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:32,459
knows you might be able to do it oh I do

291
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:35,009
not want that start again so let's just

292
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:37,559
have a quick look at voice and how VoIP

293
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:39,990
works so if you've never worked with it

294
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:43,770
before of course VoIP is voice over IP

295
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:46,620
it is it's so everything's done over

296
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:50,579
tcp/ip so just to give you a really

297
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:52,680
basic call flow for a VoIP phone calling

298
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,029
another VoIP phone point phones are

299
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,459
pretty done they actually don't know how

300
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:59,040
to do anything by themselves so when

301
00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:02,760
someone makes a call on a point phone it

302
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,620
will signal up to its core manager now

303
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,120
I've called a core manager because

304
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,100
that's the name of the Cisco product

305
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,720
that I used to work with a lot but you

306
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,839
can call it any kind of it sometimes

307
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,720
people call them PB X's but not really

308
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,209
PB X's or any kind of other centralized

309
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,399
void server just I call it call it core

310
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,899
manager so the IP phone will talk to the

311
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,089
core manager server and it will say hey

312
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:27,089
this person has dialed this number and

313
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:29,100
what do I do with it the core manager

314
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:32,070
server will signal back and it will say

315
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,620
okay that number is actually actually

316
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:36,810
corresponds to this IP address if it's

317
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,149
an internal phone that's on the system

318
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,310
so it's a little bit like DNS in a way

319
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:43,620
it's essentially doing it's actually

320
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,599
resolving things so the pool manager

321
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,209
server will tell the IP Phone

322
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,070
this is the IP you need to send the

323
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:52,859
voice stream to and then the voice

324
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,930
stream will go to the other IP Phone so

325
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,390
at no time and then of course and the

326
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,040
other IP phone will return it inside of

327
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,860
the voice stream and that makes a

328
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,469
two-way call so you can see here at no

329
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:07,709
time does the voice stream actually go

330
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:09,240
up to the management server it doesn't

331
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:10,770
go through there at all all the

332
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,020
management server does is signal and

333
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,399
tell the phone's what to do and that's

334
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,319
really important to understand because

335
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,930
that's different to how traditional

336
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,610
telephony networks work in traditional

337
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,829
telephony networks everything would go

338
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,870
through all the different switches where

339
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:28,189
is it's tried to be rationalized a bit

340
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:31,140
here to minimize the number of hops and

341
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:34,579
so looking at just a slightly different

342
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:37,709
scenario this is how you would call a

343
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:39,930
phone there was outside your VoIP

344
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:41,459
network so you know normally and you

345
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:44,219
would have a void network within a

346
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:46,380
company right so if someone tries to

347
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,420
call the number as usual the IP phone

348
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,820
will ask the call manager it will say

349
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,300
hey this phone number where is it

350
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,870
now the call manager will know

351
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,849
if that number is not inside its system

352
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,030
and the core manager will have rules in

353
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,980
it that says this if this is not if this

354
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:05,710
number is not find internally you need

355
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:09,060
to send it to a gateway and the gateways

356
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:11,620
are or it's labeled as a router they're

357
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:14,829
essentially voice gateways are routers

358
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:16,419
with special cards in them at least they

359
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:18,280
used to be now they don't even have

360
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,310
special cards it's more about licensing

361
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:24,129
because we just use SIP trunks usually

362
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:25,629
so the core manager will tell the the IP

363
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,480
phone it will give it the gateways

364
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,880
address so the stream will go to the

365
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,620
gateway the Gateway is connected in some

366
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,100
way shape or form either through

367
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,899
traditional voice technologies or VoIP

368
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,929
traditional telephone technologies or

369
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,540
using things like sip so modern IP based

370
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:46,120
protocols and then it will send that

371
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,370
into the phone network the wider phone

372
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,510
network which we call the PSTN the

373
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:54,760
public switched telephone network you so

374
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:57,610
that would be like a Telstra or spark or

375
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,470
whoever it is and then the call goes

376
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:02,290
between there all of those different

377
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:04,360
things also I should mention the router

378
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,070
or the voice gateway does actually also

379
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,240
talk to the call manager because it

380
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,820
doesn't know what to do with things

381
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,760
either so it when it receives calls

382
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,620
inbound from the PST and it will say

383
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,440
hello I have a call from this number

384
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,419
which IP address do I send it to so you

385
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,730
know the call manager server is in

386
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,710
charge but no calls go through it it's

387
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,250
always it's important to understand that

388
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,980
bit

389
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:31,240
so there's your VoIP 101 if if you've

390
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:33,010
never worked with it before so and here

391
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,650
are some VoIP providers we have known

392
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,629
and loved over the years I have worked

393
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:40,540
with and replaced quite a number of them

394
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:44,500
of course nowadays we are starting to

395
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:46,270
move away from we are moving away a bit

396
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,070
from having physical phones on our desks

397
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,680
I mean a lot of us will just now use a

398
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,870
soft client on our machine you know you

399
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,550
might be using slack team zoom but this

400
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,899
is still got VoIP technology built into

401
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,730
the back of it so even if you don't have

402
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,520
a physical phone and you're not using

403
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,470
one of these big the big void players

404
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,430
I can guarantee you are using VoIP

405
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,430
somewhere so

406
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,639
and so finally let's have a look at some

407
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:12,158
of the common attack vectors for VoIP

408
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:15,279
which is the whole point of what I just

409
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:18,429
talked the first one is a classic

410
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,380
VoIP attack of island hopping so that is

411
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:23,380
when and normally when you have an

412
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:26,289
access port of a physical access port so

413
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,240
we're not talking wireless here you will

414
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:30,669
have configured on that access port a

415
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,409
dative VLAN and a voice VLAN so your

416
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,960
voice traffic will be separated into the

417
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:37,299
voice VLAN and everything else goes in

418
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:43,720
to access VLAN so if you connect a

419
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:47,379
laptop to a a network port and you can

420
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,630
then you can pop between the VLANs and

421
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,190
if you can get on to the voice VLAN you

422
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,799
can effectively then sit there and

423
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:57,120
eavesdrop and listen to all the voice

424
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:59,830
traffic it's incredibly easy to do

425
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,559
incredibly easy and I'm going to talk

426
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,449
about it on another side a lot of VoIP

427
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,299
protocols by default are often in the

428
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:10,590
clear so essentially you put a Wireshark

429
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:13,840
on and you know you've got a VoIP stream

430
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,879
so again like I said this is my

431
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,039
eavesdropping very easy way to eavesdrop

432
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,500
I've done it and in pieces of work

433
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:22,720
before and the mitigations for this are

434
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,909
things like it's to the mitigations are

435
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,830
all around physical actually stopping

436
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:29,590
people physically accessing the port to

437
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,658
be able to do this so I mean tamper

438
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,699
proof cables is a good way of doing it

439
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:35,950
hard-coding MAC addresses now I have to

440
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,440
say it is a mitigation for this

441
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,330
particular attack I personally am NOT a

442
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,360
huge fan of hard-coding MAC addresses

443
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:45,399
for various other reasons but so so

444
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,168
nobody pulled me apart on slack I

445
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:48,879
actually don't love hard coding MAC

446
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:51,490
addresses but it does mitigate this

447
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,769
particular attack and of course

448
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,630
firewalling off any phones or ports that

449
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:57,909
are in public areas where people could

450
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,500
get into them and physically plug

451
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:05,860
themselves in there essentially how you

452
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:07,720
can de how you can stop that so now I

453
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,620
look at deed offs again we're going of

454
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,269
course we're going through all the

455
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:14,918
classic Network attacks with a bit of a

456
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:16,690
void Sun and DDoS for VoIP is also known

457
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:19,110
as teed off so telephony denial of

458
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:24,029
service it's essentially the

459
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:26,370
kind of principle in that any it's

460
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:28,200
basically about overwhelming avoid

461
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,658
server so it can't process requests and

462
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,470
it can't function um some quite

463
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:36,779
notorious ones were in 2016 this iOS bug

464
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:39,929
bounty hunter he was really new I've

465
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:41,669
managed to teed off nine nine one one

466
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:44,940
service in several cities in the u.s.

467
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:47,190
because he was just looking for a bug in

468
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,870
iOS because we know that Apple pay big

469
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:54,029
bucks for him for their bug bounties and

470
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,469
what he was doing was the he was the the

471
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:58,080
phone was getting stuck in a loop

472
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:00,419
calling 911 he didn't actually realize

473
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,908
it was doing that but of course um

474
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:05,960
because he was running this test again

475
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:08,549
and again and again he basically

476
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,620
overwhelmed 9-1-1 which is obviously not

477
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:14,879
good being that it's the emergency

478
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:17,908
services the other the other good weak

479
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,950
point from t dosing perspective is dns

480
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:22,200
service because VoIP do you need that to

481
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:25,769
resolve things as many network things do

482
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,570
and of course there's also war dialling

483
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:29,610
where you get machines and it basically

484
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,590
calls numbers time and time and time

485
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:34,889
again again you should go and watch

486
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:37,139
wargames if you haven't seen that again

487
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:38,519
I couldn't find anything for DDoS

488
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:40,889
surprisingly so I just went for

489
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:43,380
overflowing beer because you know we're

490
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:46,158
overwhelming things one of the things

491
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:48,240
that I think when I was researching this

492
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,970
one of the things that was really really

493
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,700
I think sad about the tea dosing than

494
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,590
diamond one service was that afterwards

495
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,929
there are a lot of copycat attacks so

496
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:02,010
this this gentleman genuinely didn't

497
00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:03,870
mean to he dose 9-1-1 but afterwards

498
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:05,340
there are a lot of copycat attacks and i

499
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,489
I don't want to know what kind of

500
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:10,289
strange people want to mess around with

501
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:13,279
the emergency services but you know

502
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:18,240
there are some strange folks out there

503
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:20,190
um so this is VoIP protocols I said I'd

504
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,679
come back to this there's not much to

505
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,539
say apart from VoIP protocols are split

506
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,490
into two types the signaling and then

507
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:28,289
there's the actual voice traffic the the

508
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,460
protocols that actually carry the voice

509
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:31,649
traffic

510
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,830
and most of them are by default in the

511
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:36,449
clear so there's only one one

512
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,080
appropriate give here which is of course

513
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,299
shame

514
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,520
I mean bear in mind a lot of these are

515
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:48,570
older protocols and they were written

516
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:51,059
when having a having things encrypted by

517
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,918
default was not normal of course there

518
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:55,230
are secure visions of at least some of

519
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:56,909
these but I know that it can be a pain

520
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,919
some of them there isn't a secure

521
00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:00,299
version and you effectively have to VPN

522
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,570
you have to put them in some kind of

523
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:04,918
tunnel which can be a pain and a lot of

524
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:09,120
people don't bother because it's too

525
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:10,890
much hassle so sadly so that's and of

526
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,289
course and then if you manage to get

527
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,700
somebody onto your network eavesdropping

528
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:17,610
when sometimes in the clear is really

529
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,950
really easy it's becoming easier now

530
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,870
with with soft clients because usually

531
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,669
it requires loading on certificates and

532
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,229
I can tell you for I can speak from

533
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:27,419
experience telling you that loading

534
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:30,330
certificates on to physical foments can

535
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:31,860
be a real pain but now we're but that

536
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:34,428
was sort of five six years ago now it's

537
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:38,610
become much easier to to mitigate this

538
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:40,559
depending on what you're using toll

539
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,199
fraud this is kind of its success as

540
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,090
your freaking toll fraud and if there's

541
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,309
anybody from any of these countries on

542
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:50,129
on the stream I do apologize to in

543
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:52,139
advance the top five countries to call

544
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:54,870
using toll fraud at the moment are

545
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,390
apparently Cuba Somalia Bosnia and

546
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:59,789
Herzegovina Estonia and Latvia

547
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,500
so that's apparently what they are at

548
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:03,629
the moment I can tell you when I was

549
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,240
doing a lot of white work we also used

550
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:08,070
to preemptively ban Pakistan and Nigeria

551
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,890
because a lot of fraudulent activity

552
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,000
happens there with telephones and in

553
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:16,039
what does it do

554
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,750
toll fraud it's essentially usually

555
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:21,210
manipulating either users or Mis

556
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:24,330
configuring systems so for example if

557
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:26,250
you have a public phone that you have

558
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,570
that can do call for at all because some

559
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,700
people will call forward their desk

560
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,950
phone to their mobile but if you do call

561
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,929
forward all to a foreign number and you

562
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,789
can allow the system to do that because

563
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:37,919
you can stop that in the configurations

564
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:40,740
it basically means that someone could

565
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,570
call from their mobile your desk phone

566
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,970
that desk phone could then subsequently

567
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:48,090
call a foreign number and because the

568
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:50,040
leg of the call that comes from the go

569
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,230
to the foreign number is on the desk

570
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:56,040
phone the organization will be charged

571
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:57,960
for that call so you know and and I we

572
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,170
did see this and with a customer I work

573
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,350
with a long time ago in the UK there was

574
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:06,179
a security guard who forwarded a camera

575
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,730
what country he was from it was

576
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:13,290
somewhere overseas and he put a call

577
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:14,910
forward all to his to somewhere abroad I

578
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,740
assume it was his family or something

579
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:18,570
and through looking subsequently at the

580
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,640
call logs we could see every night

581
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:23,010
between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m. he was

582
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,950
calling somebody in another country and

583
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:29,330
not paying a penny for it so it does

584
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:32,580
happen so yeah do do watch out for that

585
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:36,629
because people can actually it sounds

586
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,520
silly just um scamming for sort of

587
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:41,220
trying to effectively steal free minutes

588
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:44,300
from a phone system but it does happen

589
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:47,429
really really frequently you even today

590
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:51,510
I'm voice phishing now I'm not gonna

591
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:52,980
talk about this too much but I guess we

592
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,590
kind of just need to acknowledge it of

593
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:58,070
course there's voice phishing so that is

594
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:01,199
when someone calls you pretends to be

595
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:02,879
support dependent events to be support

596
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,150
from another company saying you've got a

597
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,190
virus or I think we all know about them

598
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,900
if there's anyone here who has never

599
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:12,240
been called by a voice scammer then

600
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:16,590
you're very lucky and I need to know

601
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,000
your secret and what I really in my one

602
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,639
of my old jobs when I lived in New

603
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,440
Zealand and we gave out chocolate fish

604
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,360
as part of our phishing campaign so I

605
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,370
just felt that was appropriate were we

606
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,129
doing this in person I totally would

607
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:30,928
have brought chocolate fish so if if you

608
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,580
can get hold of chocolate fish if you're

609
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:35,220
in New Zealand and you're lockdown go

610
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,990
buy chocolate fish on my behalf I can't

611
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,370
stand them anymore because I ate so many

612
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:42,800
of them like three or four years ago

613
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:45,209
when we did this campaign the just now

614
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,850
so contact centres when you call a

615
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:49,610
contact centre and I'm putting that up

616
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,540
just so everyone can read it as we go

617
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:53,219
contact centers when you go through that

618
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,320
an annoying menu

619
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,720
that's called IVR or interactive voice

620
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,780
response I know now who some of them are

621
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,610
better than others but think about maybe

622
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,500
when you call your bank or someone who

623
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,780
does financial services for you you know

624
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,700
sometimes the call center person will

625
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,050
say I'm gonna put you on hold I'm gonna

626
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,450
put me on hold or you need to enter your

627
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:14,909
PIN and then come back so you don't tell

628
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,740
them your PIN and that sounds oh great

629
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,570
that's super that sounds super secure

630
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,640
because I'm not telling a person but you

631
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:23,429
are still when you do that in putting it

632
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,660
into an application and so if that

633
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:26,730
application doesn't handle that

634
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:29,130
correctly or it's interfacing with other

635
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:31,980
databases and systems isn't done

636
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:34,020
properly you know there can be data in

637
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,890
there that someone could steal and it

638
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,070
does happen

639
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:40,800
so you know if you're if you're in a

640
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:42,810
company that uses IVR please don't

641
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,990
forget about looking at how the IVR

642
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:47,159
handles some of the sensitive data

643
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,870
because it's you know it is still

644
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,140
essentially just an application in the

645
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:54,840
backend so it does often get overlooked

646
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,340
so worth bearing in mind if you can test

647
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:02,010
things or if you're doing security

648
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:04,080
assessments um ss7 hacking so ss7 is the

649
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:06,390
signaling that's used in the PSTN

650
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,830
network so the bigger wider phone

651
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:10,050
network it's been around a long time

652
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:13,590
it's not a new protocol but it kind of

653
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:16,830
this this technique into prevalence back

654
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:20,129
in 2014 when the Italian company hacking

655
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:22,139
team got hacked and it turned out that

656
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,880
they were if you're not familiar with

657
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:27,000
that story it turned out that they were

658
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:30,120
creating specialized hacking tools

659
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
that included ss7 hacking tools and they

660
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,879
were selling them to regimes with

661
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,560
questionable human rights records and

662
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,170
those vulnerabilities in s27

663
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,450
allow for call forwarding call recording

664
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:44,100
reading SMS and you can track the

665
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:47,250
location of your phone so you know they

666
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:49,020
can do a lot with it since then some

667
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:52,770
carriers have installed monitoring

668
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:55,200
systems but basically the entire phone

669
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:57,150
network across the whole world runs on

670
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,270
SS sevens and that's not going to change

671
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:04,470
anytime soon and this is why we say

672
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:05,320
don't use SMS as part of MFA because SMS

673
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:09,850
is fundamentally

674
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:13,918
broken now I will cover that with if the

675
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:17,289
only MFA you are able to use is SMS then

676
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,610
SMS is better than nothing but really

677
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:20,980
you should look at other ways of doing

678
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:23,590
MFA and that's a different grant that we

679
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:27,159
won't go into but yeah please try and

680
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:29,080
avoid using Emma's SMS if you have an

681
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,539
alternative so because you know we want

682
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,689
to avoid the hackers and I always put

683
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:36,370
this this one in my stream I always put

684
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:39,009
this one in my presentation somewhere

685
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:43,389
because it's my favorite favorite gift

686
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:45,190
on hacking voicemail attacks and so

687
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:47,439
voicemail is probably one of the worst

688
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,720
bits of a phone system one of the most

689
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,009
vulnerable and it's often when people

690
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,779
are talk to your voice systems one of

691
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:54,789
the first things I look at and

692
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:57,460
voicemails always come with a pin but

693
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:59,500
it's usually a default pen cliffy is on

694
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,000
this page for no reason at all this is

695
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:04,870
when were we in person I would probably

696
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,370
give you clip e stickers if anyone wants

697
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,830
them posted when New Zealand's out of

698
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:12,610
lockdown just ping me if I'll do it when

699
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:14,470
I can and that leads onto you may

700
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:16,389
remember a number of years ago now there

701
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,129
was a big scandal in the UK about

702
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:20,949
celebrity voicemail hacking and I say

703
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:23,019
hacking in inverted commas because what

704
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,000
actually happened was if you're not

705
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:26,500
aware you don't remember essentially a

706
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,779
lot of celebrities and well-known

707
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,690
figures in the UK had their voicemail

708
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:34,240
hacked now what exactly what actually

709
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:36,519
happened was that the UK phone networks

710
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,539
didn't enforce you to change your PIN

711
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:42,159
when you set up voicemail they do now

712
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:44,080
basically in response to this so what

713
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,029
journalists were doing was managing to

714
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,210
find the phone numbers of these

715
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:52,289
high-profile people and then dialing the

716
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:54,879
voicemail getting into their voicemail

717
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:57,399
because they knew their number and then

718
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:59,620
just guessing using the default pin and

719
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:01,120
most of the time they were successful in

720
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,129
getting in and being able to listen to

721
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,168
voicemails so clearly there's a huge

722
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:08,620
invasion of privacy and you know

723
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:10,360
ethically morally very very bad but I

724
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:13,689
think the saddest thing about all of

725
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,979
this was there was a girl who was

726
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:18,640
murdered

727
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:20,950
and the journalist managed to get hold

728
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,419
of her number and when the investigation

729
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:25,059
was going on when they were still

730
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:26,650
looking for her some journalist managed

731
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:29,320
to get into her voicemails and they

732
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:31,900
listened to some of her voicemails and

733
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:35,590
that gave the police and her parents

734
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:37,570
false hope that she was still alive

735
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:39,699
because they've been changes made to her

736
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:41,830
voicemail box and so obviously that's

737
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,919
probably the saddest thing about all of

738
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:46,750
this now and people did go to prison for

739
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:48,610
this in the UK and that was why the news

740
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:52,660
of the world paper went bust a few years

741
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:56,320
later and quite rightly so but that is

742
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:58,150
the voicemail hacking that was you know

743
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:03,010
quite quite prevalent a number of years

744
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:04,660
ago so why is void um why is this still

745
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,669
important I've already sort of said this

746
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,290
I put the whole thing up but wait

747
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:09,730
technology is still around even if you

748
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,990
don't have a phone on your desk and I

749
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:13,330
haven't had a phone on my desk for a

750
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,830
number of years now void is still behind

751
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,750
the scenes it's still carrying voice

752
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:19,418
because we still need that capability

753
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:20,919
even now if it's built into some kind of

754
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:25,630
collaboration platform if you're using

755
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:26,919
select team zoom hangouts whatever so

756
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,450
it's gonna be in your current

757
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:31,120
collaboration technology so you should

758
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:33,400
have a look you may want to think about

759
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,678
incorporating this into risk assessments

760
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,740
pen taps or any kind of threat modeling

761
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:42,240
and definitely the SMS you might still

762
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:45,700
be using that in real life I know I

763
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,460
still have some companies that I am a

764
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:51,549
customer I've still still use SMS as as

765
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,320
their MFA and of course understanding

766
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:56,080
how things work is always grateful you

767
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,668
know hacking things hacking anything

768
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,678
because when you know how things work if

769
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:01,809
you can if you know how things work you

770
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,520
you can think about how to break them so

771
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:05,770
I think it's really it's something we

772
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,660
don't talk about as much and and I'm a

773
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:10,418
big fan of VoIP so I think we should

774
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:12,609
talk about it more and can I take a

775
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:15,699
photo or I guess take a screenshot for

776
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:18,909
link slide there's some really cool

777
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:20,529
articles some of which I drew on for

778
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:22,659
this but I would definitely go look at

779
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:24,280
how phone phreaking work by the 8-bit

780
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:28,720
guy and that's

781
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:32,290
much more in-depth presentation that he

782
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:35,109
did about that look at phone phreaking

783
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:40,779
have a look at t dosing 9-1-1 that's not

784
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:41,500
cool and don't do it and yeah that is me

785
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,470
done

786
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,699
thank you very much comfy con thank you

listening no worries thank you very much

792
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:03,250
Sarah I think actually NIST has said

793
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,779
don't use SMS is for MFA now they've

794
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:07,150
actually explicitly all there there's

795
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:09,700
one thing that you shouldn't do with all

796
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:12,760
the people getting their sim cards

797
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:15,189
stolen and all that kind of stuff yeah I

798
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,200
know that there's a lot of people in the

799
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:20,920
the mein kampf econ channel feeling a

800
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,069
bit old right now remembering a lot of

801
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:26,410
the things that that the old phones

802
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,480
provided I saw some oh god I feel a bit

803
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,060
old statement so I think that was a

804
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,340
really awesome talk thank you very much

805
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:38,290
