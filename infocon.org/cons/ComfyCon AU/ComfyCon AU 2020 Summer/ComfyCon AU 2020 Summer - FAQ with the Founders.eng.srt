28
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:47,560
would be good idea to have a nice little

29
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,409
session where people could ask questions

30
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:55,569
and they could get to know us / ask

31
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:59,049

73
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:20,228
Saturday in Sunday because the Friday is

74
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:23,800
not a public horror the conference will

75
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,020
be the same last time you'll have

76
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,789
speakers from all over throwing new

77
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,800
zealand's she looks like she wants to

78
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:40,690
jump on your lap so many distractions

79
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,379
[Music]

80
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:46,749
court papers opens 10 20 30 minute talks

81
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:48,849
we're also accepting we're going to do a

82
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:50,679
separate workshop screen this year which

83
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:55,059
is the 30 60 90 or 120 minute long

84
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:57,759
workshops will also do registration for

85
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,469
those to keep them relatively small so

86
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:01,269
that workshop people can actually

87
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,099
interact directly with the speaker and

88
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:09,339
the attendees yes so some examples that

89
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:10,059
people have been talking about

90
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:14,889
previously is things like how to begin

91
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:17,549
programming in rust or how to begin

92
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:20,169
working with encryption which I think

93
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:21,789
there's some people who've been asking

94
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:27,569
for the workshops could be like George's

95
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:36,069
PI the Raspberry Pi what was it the

96
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,719
printer got you um how do you make the

97
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:40,119
pin Agassi um basically we're very much

98
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,799
open to any sort of form again in

99
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,248
relation to

100
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,670
[Music]

101
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,430
okay that's fine now it's fixed it's

102
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,340
fixed it's fixed mic is muted yes the

103
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,110
dog is we were having fun too many

104
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,740
dollars which I can't remember that's it

105
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,280
papers workshops cyber or cyber adjacent

106
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,810
so we're really keen to have talks that

107
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,420
are on things like mental health and

108
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,800
recruitment and all those kind of things

109
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,220
like same as last time we've already got

110
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,140
about five to ten papers so far which is

111
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,460
really good but also we're keen to have

112
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,840
the workshops and those things as well

113
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,660
so beginner's guide to ex intermediates

114
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,090
guide to why you know it will probably

115
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,060
be groups of I don't know 20 up to 20 to

116
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,610
30 people working with a single speaker

117
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,880
over a period of time and then they'll

118
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,700
work on that the other thing we're gonna

119
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,790
have this year and they're gonna hate me

120
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,430
for mentioning their names so Benzies

121
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,610
and civilize will also be working on

122
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,820
managing a CTF so the idea is that come

123
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,740
pick on will have caps of fight

124
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,650
competition the way it will be arranged

125
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,850
is we want to make sure that people

126
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,560
don't spend all night working on the

127
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,570
capture the flag because obviously one

128
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,830
of the things we encourages everyone to

129
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,810
go off and do their own thing and get

130
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,790
away from the computer we're still

131
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,930
working it how we're going to do that

132
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,750
but the idea is we're going to get a lot

133
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,000
of challenges put them up people will go

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,250
through those challenges and hopefully

135
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,200
we'll have some prizes at the end from

136
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,910
some people as well

137
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,400
brings up an interesting a good point we

138
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,230
are sticking with the idea of no

139
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,280
sponsors for the main conference string

140
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,530
we may consider asking for sponsorship

141
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,360
for prizes but if that happens what

142
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,800
we'll do is the sponsors will send the

143
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,070
prizes directly to the winners and we'll

144
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,240
stay out of the whole situation

145
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,050
essentially we will do match for summer

146
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,500
yeah 2020 Oh get to that hoping that

147
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,820
you'll be able to order it and receive

148
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,860
it before the conference starts unlike

149
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:02,060
unlike last time bingo bingo is gonna be

150
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,130
a lot of fun I'm really looking forward

151
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,190
to bingo

152
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,720
we're gonna have a few questions in

153
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,530
there which will be easy

154
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,590
yeah we'll have some easy questions and

155
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,450
some harder one so we'll base some of

156
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,550
the bingo questions on the talks and the

157
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,140
people doing those talks and what we

158
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,440
know about them and some other random

159
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,870
things and wipe some prizes with bingo

160
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,910
as well so we'll have a little bit more

161
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,940
to do during the breaks between talks as

162
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,700
well although I think like poppers went

163
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,530
down a lot like fur babies went down

164
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,360
well last it will do fur babies again

165
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,330
yeah definitely we may see if you can

166
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,830
tell the difference between a wallaby in

167
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,419
a kangaroo and a pelican and a bean

168
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,490
chicken so story behind that is we were

169
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,930
driving down the highway today and we

170
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,340
saw something again on the edge of the

171
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,920
road wasn't great I'm like is that a

172
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,350
wallaby or a wombat I know you said is

173
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,030
that a wallaby or a kangaroo it looks

174
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,420
like a hairy Pig yes so again apparently

175
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,700
I can't recognize Australian native

176
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,170
animals which is a bit of a problem

177
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,060
I know some zoologist we could get in

178
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,950
for that game that would be good yeah my

179
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,900
dad's a zoologist if we really need one

180
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,220
yeah we may need a trigger warning on

181
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,910
that segment yes can you can you name

182
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:36,390
this red kill okay we will go through oh

183
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,370

the secret to a luscious be the secret

190
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,500
to a luscious spirit is just be lazy and

191
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,470
let it grow out pretty much that's it

192
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,990
like I've been grinding this since what

193
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,250
last you know it's it's it's my secret

194
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,900
it's it's the way you're doing in mind

195
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,820
your secret is good genetics good

196
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,430
genetics yes

197
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,570
obviously one from Ben Ben I'm not

198
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,350
answering that question

199
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,760
I'm here for that question

200
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,240
Ben and I have some very good okay next

201
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,810
question

202
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,580
what do you miss most about conferences

203
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,250
and what do you miss the least Jenna I

204
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,530
miss the most is definitely the

205
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,760
networking and hanging out with people

206
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,460
hmm what do I miss the least the fact

207
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,600
that they start them at 9 a.m.

208
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,870
exactly so you know my you know I just I

209
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,670
never get the 9 a.m. started especially

210
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,460
on the second day I mean officially we

211
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,380
chose 12 so that Western Australia you

212
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,030
could join but unofficially it's because

213
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:02,430
yes yes what do I miss about conferences

214
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,530
I miss catching up with people like I

215
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,540
generally get I miss the whole weight

216
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,130
it's like I generally I'll be honest I

217
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,590
don't go to the talks very often I just

218
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,300
I just go and talk to other people but

219
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,650
it's fun cause like you go to a big

220
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,690
conference like a Bayside's or something

221
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,340
and then everyone who you know from

222
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,960
across the country is in the same place

223
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,820
yeah and so you can catch it with

224
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,120
everyone all at once and then in my case

225
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,430
as a horrible person you can say I'll

226
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,720
catch up with you later and then forget

227
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,400
to do so we still haven't caught up with

228
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,750
the people that you said we were gonna

229
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,330
have yeah I know I'm sorry if you're

230
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:42,990
watching what would your message be to

231
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,670
students and/or junior security

232
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,290
professionals who may be afraid or

233
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,330
hesitant to submit a talk to comfy Khan

234
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,400
or conferences in general I'd love to

235
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,050
see more of that demographic to giving

236
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:57,300
this a good so that's from Josh my

237
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,790
message would be just submit something

238
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,070
and we'll probably approve it I think

239
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,180
we've actually got a box on the form

240
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,980
that says if you're a new speaker please

241
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,320
just take this box yeah and it probably

242
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,890
will fit within our criteria for review

243
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,000
although we haven't really got an

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,370
official criteria for review let us know

245
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,230
in the comments when you're putting in

246
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,850
your submission let us know if you want

247
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,500
some coaching if you aren't doing

248
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,480
through it because we'd be more than

249
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,000
happy to coach you mentor you provide

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,930
feedback even if you don't really

251
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,540
if your topic is interesting submit it

252
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,990
and we can give you feedback on it and

253
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,309
suggest you know if you've got an area

254
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:40,439
of expertise we can maybe suggest it's

255
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:41,910
not like an exam or something we're not

256
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,619
gonna be like the only chance to talk to

257
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:45,360
us is going to be through your your

258
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,550
submission like if you have an idea come

259
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,110
talk to one of the three of us and be

260
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,579
like hey I've got this idea and we'll be

261
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:51,629
like yeah that's a really good idea

262
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:55,829
please submit it yeah we will jump top

263
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:58,139
tip if it's cyber don't ask me don't ask

264
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,220
Andrea yeah yeah she'll probably just

265
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,019
come to me and say hey what is this

266
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,569
sound like but yeah like I encourage

267
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:08,970
everyone to submit talks because when

268
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,410
you like talking in general when you

269
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,360
when you get further into this cyber

270
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,829
field you have to start talking with

271
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:17,939
managers you have to start giving

272
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:19,290
presentations it's not just the

273
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,689
technical stuff and so being able to

274
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:23,399
communicate effectively is probably one

275
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,869
of the most important skills you can

276
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:28,230
have because but I think even if you

277
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,660
like because we don't know how many

278
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,170
submissions were gonna get etc just the

279
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,269
experience of submitting for a talk is a

280
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:38,100
good experience it's the same thing as

281
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,449
applying for jobs and going to

282
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:40,800
interviews and things like that it's

283
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,889
good to give that first get that first

284
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,689
one out of the way like rip the band-aid

285
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:48,689
off yeah and then you learn things I

286
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,459
would say while we're on the topic of

287
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,649
submissions one pro tip for submissions

288
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:54,269
if you submit something that's already

289
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:56,129
been seen at another talk that will

290
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:58,439
probably count against you just being

291
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:00,959
honest we want to seem nice and new and

292
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,170
original things that said nice new

293
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,089
original doesn't mean it has to be well

294
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:08,399
like peer-reviewed research or something

295
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,779
it could just be some idea you've had

296
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,399
that actually is relevant to everyone

297
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,410
else in the industry yeah it's kind of

298
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,549
if it's on YouTube already probably

299
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:19,709
won't qualify for what we're looking for

300
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:24,540
yeah case-by-case basis yeah what a

301
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,319
success look like for Kathy Kohner you

302
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:30,749
who said that of course he did they are

303
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:33,509
the most active twitter yes thank you

304
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:35,309
very much much to one of our moderators

305
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:38,910
Kirk who has been very helpful and I'm

306
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,470
sure he's volunteering himself to do

307
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,139
something at this point what is

308
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:44,370
successful I don't know

309
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:57,910
no one cutting themselves I think my

310
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:03,009
bones smuggle you know miserable yeah

311
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:11,709
timely yes but yes yeah I think one of

312
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:13,120
the big things with comfy Connie's we

313
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,430
are all about accessibility of

314
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,769
information and talk to people who maybe

315
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:19,449
necessarily don't live in an area where

316
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:21,069
they can make it to conferences or

317
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:23,019
they're not able to make it to

318
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:25,240
conferences for their own personal

319
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,279
reasons and I think success for us is

320
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,649
creating that community and that's

321
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:32,170
support particularly in a world where a

322
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,750
lot of us work virtually where you don't

323
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,970
necessarily have that like office banter

324
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,740
that you may have had previously and

325
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,170
just general hallway talks in an office

326
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,810
so creating that community for people is

327
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,259
the big kind of success for us yes I

328
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:48,940
know I told this story to some

329
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,170
moderators and some of the speakers

330
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,519
beforehand but like we got a message

331
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,819
towards the end of comfy cotton in my

332
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,560
April which was thanks very much for I

333
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,269
mention their name but thanks very much

334
00:15:58,269 --> 00:15:59,829
for running a conference it's great that

335
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:01,720
you had something that people who

336
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,389
normally can't go to conferences could

337
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:06,819
attend and be a part of unlike there's

338
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:08,199
there's a number of factors that like

339
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:09,760
you could be physically unable to attend

340
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,279
a conference because location or you

341
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,550
could all like conferences are really

342
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,769
stressful stressful

343
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,990
not everyone has a conference budget No

344
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,920
so making that really accessible to

345
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,040
everyone and like making it so anyone

346
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,899
can it's like for us the important thing

347
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:40,600
is sharing the ideas not anything else

348
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,040
like making sure that people can share

349
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,980
their ideas really easily and having a

350
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,449
conference online is really easy to do

351
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:48,519
that so that's the main thing the other

352
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,230
half of that question is six conferences

353
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,360
and a movie question mark do you want us

354
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,130
to name six conferences or do you think

355
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,810
after six conferences we should produce

356
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,180
a movie on it are we produce

357
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,100
a movie by virtue of having an online in

358
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,529
the first place they can pick on a

359
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:08,920
documentary we could we could do a

360
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,290
flogging and then do a vlog season about

361
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,730
us making a conference and all the

362
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,160
twists and turns and like room isn't

363
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,939
working oh my god I'm not editing that

364
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,500
what are your self-care routines and has

365
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,859
that changed in the past months I'm

366
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,890
assuming that's for co-ed myself care

367
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,000
routines my horses and my dogs really

368
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,040
they're the ones that keep me sane and

369
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,650
active and together

370
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,510
it hasn't changed that much luckily I

371
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,100
was able to ride my horses all

372
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,809
throughout Kovach because we're in a

373
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,030
pretty secluded place anyway

374
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,460
and we're all that allowed to still go

375
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,250
there so not really I've watched him

376
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,880
home for about 10 years so love being it

377
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,360
loving it

378
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,980
this is yeah it's been actually a really

379
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,600
happy time for me

380
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,059
I've not traveled since last December

381
00:17:58,059 --> 00:17:59,830
which is bizarre because before that I

382
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,150
was traveling every couple of weeks I

383
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,860
it's actually been quite nice to just

384
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,870
sit down and relax and actually have a

385
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,790
self-care program is your suitcase

386
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:12,010
unpacked it is unpacked my suitcase from

387
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,660
our trip is still in fact I don't think

388
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,370
Wow well you did move so that's Midtown

389
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,429
I was unpacked the week yeah took me

390
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:22,750
like three weeks but I was also busy

391
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,670
what's your what's myself playing video

392
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,800
games okay

393
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,750
playing video games and running a

394
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,750
conference yes firm for me like sounds a

395
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,140
bit weird or whatever like comfy little

396
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,460
like that sort of thing is kind of my

397
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,530
thing like making sure everyone else is

398
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,900
okay like I like where my friends are

399
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,300
happy and all that kind of stuff so you

400
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,280
know being able to run this and chat and

401
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,540
join in it's kind of my thing

402
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,090
what about you I just watch Netflix and

403
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:05,770
YouTube just excessive be my skin well

404
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,700
the first time you did it you fell over

405
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,590
yes many times

406
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,200
yes we'll do it again yes what's it

407
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,920
again like this

408
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,010
new parts since they need to go - yeah

409
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,720
there's possible cost the car park with

410
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,520
all the like joins in the concrete was

411
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,410
not no I wasn't it was not a good thing

412
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,540
and yeah I don't think any of our

413
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,400
changes really changed that much in the

414
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,060
past few months

415
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,620
I just don't we just don't go that well

416
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,660
like for us it was annoying that you go

417
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,070
shopping and then there's so many people

418
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,450
that you don't want to go shopping

419
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,360
yeah I just delivery so I'm the delivery

420
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,550
girl but like we like the idea of going

421
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,750
around to a shop and then seeing

422
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,160
everything in the shop and all that kind

423
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,110
of stuff and then you gotta like what

424
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,480
was anyone to like spotlight and

425
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,980
spotlight it's completely packed with

426
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,170
people which is you know there's a

427
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,780
spotlight opening in Canberra top news

428
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,330
is not related to comfy con I'm so ready

429
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:56,740
for it um what do you sacrifice when

430
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,030
making the time to establish a

431
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,630
conference is it worth it sleeping yes

432
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,350
oh excuse me it's allergies guys I

433
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,780
promise

434
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,210
sleeping yeah sleep and yes it's worth

435
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,720
it I don't think I made that much of a

436
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,120
sacrifice no I don't think we do do that

437
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,040
like really if any everyone was like wow

438
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,960
this is so professionally done honestly

439
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,200
honestly I was working that last two

440
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,720
weeks I think it was more than that but

441
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,170
I think lice we we learnt from other

442
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,420
conferences yes and then we can't have

443
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,580
just emulated them and had an easier job

444
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,870
because we weren't doing it in a

445
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,490
physical location with physical yeah I

446
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,800
think the physical location and the fact

447
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,400
that we didn't handle any merch oh yeah

448
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,400
we didn't have printing we didn't have

449
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,350
shirt t-shirts to give out you didn't

450
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,450
have tickets as badges or vendors or

451
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,450
sponsors apart from our singular sponsor

452
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,420
and a lot of that is where the headache

453
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,540
of event organizing it really comes in

454
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,690
yes yeah so it was mostly purely kind of

455
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,940
these are the paper submissions like

456
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,430
this is having a spreadsheet the running

457
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:15,610
yeah we have one spreadsheet but

458
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,960
everyone was sort of really good because

459
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,310
when we said like you can have it

460
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,330
whenever you want and you don't have to

461
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,680
go anywhere to do it it just became so

462
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,930
much easier

463
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,180
[Music]

464
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,370
I think the most stressful piece of it

465
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,190
was just the day's itself like they like

466
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,280
I don't know if you guys saw but like I

467
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,260
think we looked really exhausted at the

468
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,320
end there was all the times that you

469
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,760
forgot to press me you oh that was

470
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,500
that's the reason why yeah not that I

471
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,280
just can't use technology

472
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,080
it was just tiring it was retiring it

473
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,220
behind the scenes it was just us which

474
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,560
it won't be the next comfy con which

475
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,910
would be really nice so we were doing

476
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,680
the emceeing and then all the

477
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,970
coordination in the background as well

478
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,340
as the official speakers were ready in

479
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,840
on time and that they were in the other

480
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,450
room you know to practice we could hear

481
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,730
then that they were in the actual

482
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,210
webinar and one says also we have no CFP

483
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,070
we just accepted anyone I mean that's

484
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,910
kind of dirty

485
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,120
yes and though we didn't accept everyone

486
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,890
there was a review process because we

487
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:23,950
don't was there was that one accepted

488
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,700
for reasons that will not be divulged we

489
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,290
did review everything basically and we

490
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,780
thought like everything was cool like

491
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,550
and I think that's shown from like

492
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,440
nobody said that any particular talk

493
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,840
didn't fit in or they said you know no

494
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,270
talk was particularly relevant like we

495
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,680
had this good breadth and variety of

496
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,570
different things yeah I was so I think

497
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,800
that was probably the best part of

498
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,120
pompey con for me was the the range and

499
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,410
collection of speakers that actually

500
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,090
submitted we had first time speakers and

501
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,670
then we have unique is that you know

502
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,310
very experienced names you recognized

503
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,230
yeah names you don't recognize kind of

504
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,250
thing and they all sort of blended

505
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,860
together nicely yeah it was it was a

506
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,230
really amazing experience actually just

507
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,260
running the CFP and just almost

508
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,840
organically turning it into an amazing

509
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,250
mix of talk so yeah yeah it wasn't it

510
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,160
wasn't too stressful just just think the

511
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,570
other thing was we didn't know if we'd

512
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,210
have enough talks yeah like because we

513
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,310
didn't put a date we didn't put a date

514
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,370
on on the closing of it and then we kind

515
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,630
of had to put a date because we're like

516
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,880
we have no slots left yeah because we

517
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,530
had a whole day because comfortin was

518
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,970
only supposed to be a day yeah I think

519
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,230
it's going to be fraught it was gonna be

520
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,290
the Saturday of that week

521
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,820
and we weren't going to do anything else

522
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,830
and then it became two days and that's

523
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,910
like are we going to extend it to a

524
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,200
third day and I think we had the

525
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,470
beginning sort of a web novice I don't

526
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,780
think we could have lasted through three

527
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,670
days after the second day was really

528
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,540
tiring just being on constantly could

529
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,560
you also ran yet to my side chat panel

530
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,510
as well so not just hosting but there's

531
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,990
also like that yeah actually terms are

532
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,050
probably not gonna do this next yeah

533
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,500
that's what you want earring for yeah

534

let's just leaves into let's discuss

537
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,040

538
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,390
discussing at the time that we had like

539

540

and then there's a gin drinking scotch

541
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,730

542
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,200
there's up the group of us that drink

543
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:43,400

[Laughter]

553
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,210
very different yep

554
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,140

555
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,880

560
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,430
anywhere where is the dog civilized

561
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,230
which dog what are you talking about I

562
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,060
don't know is that we're jumping all on

563
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,810
us

564
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,810
your dog not hasn't arrived yet yes

565
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:54,050
somewhere over the he might be landing

566
00:25:54,050 --> 00:26:00,530
soon he'll be landing in 15 minutes for

567
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,210
context we're in Sydney because we're

568
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,110
getting a dog

569
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,990
so probably should have opened with that

570
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,140
one actually that's why we're all

571
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,310
together because we're in the same

572
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:16,670
location baby dog the baby though for

573
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,780

576
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,670
entirety of the CTA so any complaint

577
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:33,250

578
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,670
okay see I can drink everything by the

579
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,040
way it's good to know Sylvia I'm gonna

580
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,360
ask the question what's your favorites

581
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,270
Sylvia dad joke does anybody have one

582
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,890
that sticks out there all just terrible

583
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,450
I didn't know I'd have to go back

584
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,340
because there are a few actually during

585
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,230
comfy con that I actually kind of

586
00:26:54,230 --> 00:27:00,110
snorted just golden and I just yeah I

587
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,100
don't remember what he says all my jokes

588
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,990
are amazing I'm falsely Silvio will not

589
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,460
be joining us this time because he's a

590
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,670
he's a prior engagement I don't know I

591
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:17,900
think he could still do a yeah but like

592
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:27,650
you want to piss off Carly what do you

593
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,800
mean that's not an excuse it totally be

594
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,110
focused income for the wedding look we

595
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:39,240
did live streaming yes/no live streaming

596
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,359
[Music]

597
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,870
and like a switch to the wedding will be

598
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,670
in the console and waiting for it to not

599
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,740
collapse yeah that's fair

600
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,830
was there any more questions no unless I

601
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,450

somebody else maybe if Benzies wants to

655
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,140
run a rocket League competition he is

656
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,620
more than odd there's money to raid

657
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,840
right I was yeah I'd do a destination

658
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,880
charade but unfortunately yeah that's

659
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,200
that becomes the problem of like we

660
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,020
can't be organizing this stuff again

661
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,150
but yeah destiny to raid would be fun

662
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,390
was that civilized and that was that was

663
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:28,360
hoodie pony and civilized animal

664
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,470
crossing Fight Club I don't know but

665
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,450
maybe maybe in one of the company called

666
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,340
locations we could do some kind of dance

667
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,790
dance you know interlude delegation you

668
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,590
need a game maker to grip all that out

669
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,600
oh yeah that sounds like a box is one

670
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,670
thing we we didn't talk about there is

671

it's not a it's not a huge amount of

677
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,380
work it's literally just a lot of work

678
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,000
because it was just three of us doing it

679
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,980
before volunteering is not mandatory

680
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,360
unless required the term you're looking

681
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,530
for is voluntold

682
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,210
volunteers are there for a number of

683
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,740
things I think I've put up volunteers

684
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,780
for speaker wrangling are you talking to

685
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,980

686
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,060
right place and their equipment works

687
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,710
moderation on the discord chat MC if

688

anybody wants to MC or run panels and

689
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,010
then yet other there's an other category

690
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,690
which is like I don't really know what I

691
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,400
want to do but I want to help or if you

692
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,930
think of a role that we haven't

693
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,060
mentioned that you would like to do so

694
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,360

gaming or something like yeah let us

696
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,110
know and we can see if it's something

697
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,550
that can be kind of worked

698
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,350
MC hacks a lot no Sophia shouldn't see

699
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,480
here's 20 women Silvia you bought the

700
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,910
podcaster what are you doing she just

701
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,960
bought the coax Allah yeah I know that's

702
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,430
what I'm saying it's all the same but

703
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,980
he's gonna be at Mooseheads next weekend

704
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:13,610
like DJ I've heard family's head chief

705
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,680
clown off some video editing yes video

706
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,510
the thing would be something comfy

707
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,410
it's like crashed my computer so many

708
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:28,190
times because it's just like chunk of

709
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,410
footage it's not like Nate talks it's

710
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,200
the whole YouTube save it saves it is 8

711
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,910
hours of footage and even though it's

712
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:39,260
only 720p yeah we'll be doing if we're

713
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,390
using a different hosting service we're

714
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,980
different streaming service next time it

715
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,570
might be bigger yes so the plan is we're

716
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,780
using a stream yard so theoretically

717
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,570
might be bigger yeah better quality so

718
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,890
we're hoping we all have better call

719
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,390
which will have better quality than what

720
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,650
you're seeing right now because I just

721
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,470
looked at it I look like trash yeah it

722
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,520
wasn't linked right quality yeah yeah

723
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:06,770
yeah yeah like music no yeah I know I

724
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,570
think Bex mentioned last time what would

725
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,659
be cool if we you know if there was any

726
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:13,100
local bands or something or people in

727
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,280
bands that wanted to our music we'd be

728
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,000
king too you know if you've got music

729
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,570
that you want to share as a an interlude

730
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,909
or something like that we be keen for as

731
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:27,650
long as you're sharing that content ID

732
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,199
and strike our video yeah exactly that's

733
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:35,570
that's all ok like yeah but it strikes

734
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,379
the whole video

735
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:39,859
yeah yeah but if the video is cut then

736
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:42,349
it's not gonna cut it up anyway that's

737
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:44,599
the but yes any if and there's anybody

738
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:47,210
who likes to dabble in video editing or

739
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,699
even just wants to listen to the 8 hours

740
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,710
of footage and find the timestamps of

741
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,569
where the actual video is and it's not

742
00:34:53,569 --> 00:35:00,470
just oh I'll listen to a video and say

743
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:07,009
if they say the word it was like

744
00:35:07,009 --> 00:35:09,069
listening to an hour the chimes

745
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:11,150
successive allies I might like to talk

746
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,150
about your idea for kids just feel free

747
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:19,549
to say yes or no in the nice West yeah

748
00:35:19,549 --> 00:35:22,190
somebody somebody asked for their video

749
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,950
to have no swears because it was being

750
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,140
shown to another audience that yes we're

751
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,390
swearing what's not appropriate so we

752
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,130
just checked to make sure there was no

753
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,869
sorry just a little double check II I

754
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:34,279
don't know I didn't have a plan of what

755
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:36,289
to do if we found one but we just needed

756
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:40,849
to double check oh yeah okay that's fair

757
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:43,910
oh yeah we can be like Firefly where

758
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,319
they don't actually swear they just have

759
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:56,690
like other words what's the word Iike

760
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:02,349
Frank yeah we could have our own like

761
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:08,779
get farted okay so Dan tells me if

762
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:10,700
string yard is 720 but better bit right

763
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,229
so we'll look better but it will just be

764
00:36:12,229 --> 00:36:16,759
720 so we'll wait till you can import a

765
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:18,890
video well why can it like wesker sorry

766
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,210
we'll just run it through OBS or

767
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:24,769
something and then it yeah yes so if

768
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:30,910
there are no other questions then it's

769
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,419
[Music]

770
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:43,549
like has landed I'm a stress eater so

771
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:45,019
even when I try other things I'm

772
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:49,339
stressed for them so yeah I think we've

773
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:50,090
basically covered

774
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:58,760

776
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:04,580

777
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,810

independent as possible yeah yeah like

788
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,190
don't like yes attribution of ideas and

789
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,040

them is it open source I guess there's

797
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,790
more the question like my example would

798
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,710
be the Velociraptor talk is something

799
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,090
thing along that nature is perfectly

800
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,670
fine well as well like the Raspberry Pi

801
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,360
one we're showcasing a product in like

802
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,380
you know it's a bit of hardware that you

803
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,450
can like it was only for the souls

804
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,250

806
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:36,410
you're coming to us with a nothing that

807
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,970
requires you to enter into a contract

808
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,220
for an extended period of time don't

809
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,510
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars

810
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,790
yes yes because we don't have that money

811
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,350
and I'm sure most people that what's

812
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,530
