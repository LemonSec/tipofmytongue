1
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,429
all right so good morning everyone

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,490
thank you for that amazing introduction

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,320
hope everyone is feeling nice and

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:16,680
caffeinated awake for this 9:00 a.m.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,448
talk so I'm Emily Schechter I am a

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,939
product manager on the Chrome browser

7
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,640
security team and today I'm going to

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,410
talk about the trouble with URLs which i

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,980
think is a really important usability

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,980
usable security problem so let's start

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,710
with a thought exercise imagine that

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,469
you're living in a small town in India

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,370
or Indonesia and like most other people

14
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,530
in your town

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,550
you're coming online for the first time

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,219
on a mobile device so this might be your

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,809
first experience with computers right it

18
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,360
doesn't involve an introductory

19
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,879
computing class doesn't involve document

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,600
and document editing it doesn't involve

21
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,390
a desktop computer it involves a grid of

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,829
logos and brand names and you start to

23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,960
get comfortable with this grid of apps

24
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:08,790
right it's pretty easy to understand

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,530
there's Facebook there's Google now

26
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,000
let's say you start browsing the web and

27
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,580
you start navigating around to some

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,330
websites and on the web we're

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,429
representing identity with URLs so do

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,439
you think that as a user in a town in

31
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,020
India you would be able to understand

32
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,899
just from the URL who's publishing these

33
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,149
sites do you think that you would even

34
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,040
look at the URL or would you just depend

35
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,720
on the website content itself to give

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:39,329
you a sense for who owns the site and

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,158
let's say maybe you're a model security

38
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,048
conscious user of the web just like

39
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,869
everyone in this room right and so you

40
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,490
do look at URLs all the time to make

41
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,070
sure that you're on the site you think

42
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,949
you're on but now there are new

43
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,258
top-level domains coming out right so

44
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,890
can you tell which one of these is the

45
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,290
real Google blog site and can you tell

46
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:06,420
which one of these is the authoritative

47
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:09,509
site for Google experiments but URLs are

48
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,959
great for many reasons - which is why we

49
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:14,220
heavily depend on them on the web

50
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,470
they're really great for sending

51
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,960
links to really specific things right

52
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:22,410
here we get a hint that this is gonna be

53
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,210
a product from Amazon and you can copy

54
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,579
and paste them easily to share with

55
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,010
friends right and of course in security

56
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,930
land URLs are our last line of defense

57
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,739
against spoofing attacks if all else

58
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:37,100
fails so we've started to call this

59
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,290
problem the you our elephant in the room

60
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,269
URLs are not working well but we heavily

61
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,910
depend on them for all sorts of use

62
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,990
cases and we show them a lot in our most

63
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:51,480
visible UIs and many applications so in

64
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,810
the chrome team we've started to discuss

65
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,119
what URLs are used for and which of

66
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,250
these use cases they actually succeed at

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,410
and we've started to brainstorm

68
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,680
alternatives that might better solve

69
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,910
some of these requirements and keep in

70
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,830
mind here that we're not actually

71
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,630
talking about changing things are

72
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,610
happening under the hood of Chrome or

73
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,230
web browsers

74
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,240
we're not like talking about dismantling

75
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,619
the Empire DNS or anything like this

76
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,220
we're really just talking about how

77
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,530
these things appear in our UI so in this

78
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,170
talk I'll go through four functions of

79
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,570
URLs functions that they're supposed to

80
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,208
have and then for each of these I'll

81
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,820
talk about how well URLs are actually

82
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,380
achieving those goals and then I'll give

83
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,940
you some ideas for what might better

84
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:42,060
solve some of those requirements so

85
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,910
here's a breakdown of URLs starting from

86
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,160
the left we have the scheme then the

87
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:51,570
host then the path and the whole thing

88
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:54,209
is the URL so this scheme is supposed to

89
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,670
represent connection security right so

90
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:00,090
here it says HTTPS so we know the

91
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,589
connection is secure great and the next

92
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,530
piece is the host which is supposed to

93
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,480
tell us about site identity so in this

94
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,190
case we know we're talking to the New

95
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,209
York Times and that's pretty

96
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:14,609
straightforward cool and finally we have

97
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,320
the path which might tell us some useful

98
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,060
information about the structure of the

99
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,430
web site as well as the content of the

100
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,140
page so here for example we know this is

101
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,240
going to be an extremely intriguing

102
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,610
article about the looming digital

103
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,870
meltdown right and we know the article

104
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,270
was published in early

105
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,220
January of this year and maybe we know

106
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,620
that the New York time website also is

107
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,199
actually organized according to date and

108
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,560
then according to section so this is

109
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,270
great and the whole URL itself is

110
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,520
supposed to be useful for sharing

111
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,198
content right so I can just copy and

112
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,120
paste it to my friends to send them the

113
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,010
school article I can just send my

114
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,040
friends some nice TV download that I

115
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,419
found of Game of Thrones whatever and

116
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,360
it's supposed to be great for navigating

117
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:59,190
to write so if I hear maybe geico.com on

118
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,270
the radio I can just input the URL and

119
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:05,940
get there but our URLs actually

120
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:09,060
achieving any of these goals let's take

121
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:14,250
a look so first let's start with the

122
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:17,699
scheme so for many years we've suspected

123
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,410
that just showing the string HTTP is not

124
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,500
enough to communicate that a site is

125
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:25,440
secure so we've shown this lock icon in

126
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:29,340
some form over the years next to HTTPS

127
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,620
sites and then a few years ago we did

128
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,239
some research on the chrome team which

129
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,229
showed that the icon itself really

130
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,910
wasn't working right we saw the example

131
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:41,669
the icon sometimes people think it's

132
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,680
like a green purse so now we show these

133
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:45,299
human readable strings that help

134
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,760
additionaly communicate connection

135
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,070
security so we added the secure string

136
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,440
and it's translated into other languages

137
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:56,550
when chrome is used in other languages

138
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,229
so this is great and now since this

139
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,599
communicates the security of the site

140
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:03,599
we're currently working on hiding the

141
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:06,030
HTTP scheme so that we're not showing

142
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:09,090
syntax that isn't actually useful to

143
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:12,448
users right so this is gonna roll out in

144
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:14,909
an upcoming version of Chrome and we're

145
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:17,820
doing the same thing for non secure HTTP

146
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,460
so the top image here shows what our

147
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:23,250
icon for all HTTP sites used to look

148
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,799
like and this was a problem because the

149
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,800
scheme HTTP doesn't communicate at all

150
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,560
the lack of security in on secure sites

151
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,400
right so we added the non secure string

152
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,469
in certain circumstances and the change

153
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,960
required a slow rollout over many years

154
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:41,460
because we thought that introducing this

155
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,159
string right away

156
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,349
could cause harm because when users see

157
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,389
warnings too many times they get what's

158
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,949
called warning fatigue so they stop

159
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:51,930
paying attention to warnings right and

160
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,970
we didn't want to induce morning fatigue

161
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,699
and also we just generally didn't want

162
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,660
the internet to seem like a scary place

163
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,190
we don't want people to be afraid of

164
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,740
using the web we don't want them to stop

165
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,500
using the web but the good news is that

166
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,880
now enough sites are HTTPS so we've

167
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,830
finally gotten to a place where we're

168
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,930
going to mark all HTTP sites as not

169
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,539
secure and this is coming out in version

170
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:15,660
68 of calm which is rolling out this

171
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:17,610
July in just a few months so we consider

172
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,370
this a success story right we took non

173
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,050
readable information and URLs and we did

174
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,300
something else to make it usable and

175
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,470
informative the scheme was supposed to

176
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,509
be telling people about connection

177
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,520
security and it wasn't so we replace it

178
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:31,199
with more understandable UI that did

179
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,650
solve that requirement and then we

180
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:38,430
removed the non readable you our UI okay

181
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:40,919
great so now let's move on to the end to

182
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,349
the path which in this case is pretty

183
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,880
useful right like I said it tells us

184
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:48,090
about the content of the page it tells

185
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:51,180
us about the structure of the site but

186
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,638
unfortunately many URL paths are really

187
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,370
not useful at all for example Google

188
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,380
Docs URLs right and some may argue that

189
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,650
this is actually a problem for security

190
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:04,110
reasons because non readable syntax

191
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,539
might make people ignore other more

192
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,400
critical pieces of the URL and I'll

193
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,990
actually talk later in this talk about

194
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,989
some research where we tested this

195
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,360
hypothesis but regardless of this

196
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,310
possible security issue I think that

197
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,289
this is a problem for just usability and

198
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,900
simplicity reasons right we should

199
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:27,659
strive to only show information that's

200
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:29,698
actually informative to humans so some

201
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:32,130
pieces of the paths actually are useful

202
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,870
to some people right like the New York

203
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,549
Times example those paths that show

204
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,310
useful information about the structure

205
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,809
of the site content of the page but I

206
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,279
think there actually could be more

207
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:44,699
usable ways to show this information

208
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,800
when it is useful for example if you can

209
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,680
see here this is actually showing the

210
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,599
google.com search results page and what

211
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,849
they're doing here in green is they're

212
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,960
breaking down the path of arrows to

213
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,830
actually help people

214
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,500
understand the structure of the site but

215
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,510
unfortunately the reality is that most

216
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,550
developers just aren't making paths that

217
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,500
are that useful and right now the

218
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,810
browser doesn't have a great way to

219
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,630
parse and show a useful path versus a

220
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,760
non useful one but the fact that

221
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,460
browsers need to accommodate both of

222
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,740
these scenarios useful and non useful

223
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,940
paths actually is a key reason why this

224
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,740
is a pretty complex problem okay so

225
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,770
we've talked about the problems with the

226
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,180
scheme and with the path so now let's

227
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:33,180
zoom out a little bit and look at the

228
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,130
whole URL itself which is supposed to be

229
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:39,060
useful for sharing and for navigating

230
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:41,790
and the fact that the URL is supposed to

231
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,900
be useful for navigating is actually a

232
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:48,329
key reason why this problem is so hard

233
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,680
because the the URL display service in

234
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,260
Chrome we're calling this the omnibox

235
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,880
needs to be both read and write right

236
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,260
people need to be able to read URLs and

237
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,320
they also need to be able to type into

238
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,780
it and that's complex so to explain what

239
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,630
I mean let's take a look at some of

240
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:08,069
those right aspects to see why writing

241
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:10,650
URLs is so problematic so unfortunately

242
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,350
typos often send you nowhere to the

243
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:15,150
wrong place entirely right and if you

244
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,220
were coming online for the first time if

245
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,560
you didn't really understand the

246
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,310
internet you might not understand why

247
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,650
this is happening and does anyone have

248
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:29,849
the patience to type in whole URLs by

249
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:31,560
hand so I remember back in 2016 I was

250
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,960
listening to Hillary Clinton give a talk

251
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,689
and I remember at one point she turns to

252
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,690
the camera and goes to learn more go to

253
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:47,490
www.petland.com /a issues forward slash

254
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,950
disability - rights right and this is

255
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,480
ridiculous like there's no way I'm

256
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,370
remembering this whole thing and what if

257
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,130
I don't know how to spend spell Hillary

258
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,830
or disability and this gets even worse

259
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,710
there are numbers in the URL right let's

260
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,430
say I hear a radio ad for 1-800 contacts

261
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,830
com

262
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,510
how am I supposed to know if any of the

263
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,130
numbers are actually spelled out with

264
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,460
words how am I supposed to know if

265
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,640
there's a

266
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:14,430
- in between 1 and 800 right so URLs are

267
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:18,180
actually a really bad way for navigating

268
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:20,250
for that reason and typing in new URLs

269
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,709
on mobile keyboards especially is really

270
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,110
hard right and this gets worse in new

271
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:28,350
situations that we need to accommodate

272
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:31,080
for like VR where text entry is even

273
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,810
more awkward right like I'm never going

274
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,790
to be able to enter www Hillary Clinton

275
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:39,380
comm forward slash issues forward slash

276
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:42,569
disability - writes on this thing and

277
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,340
copying and pasting URLs on mobile often

278
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:48,710
requires tricky highlighting and

279
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:52,050
scrolling or less discoverable patterns

280
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:54,240
ok so there might be a better way to

281
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,040
share content right there's been an

282
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,630
explosion of these share buttons and

283
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,150
apps which i think is actually a much

284
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:03,270
more useable way to share content than

285
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,980
copying and pasting URLs and so

286
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,439
something that's cool here is that the

287
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,180
URL is still the underlying transport of

288
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,930
information right it's just not being

289
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:14,189
exposed to the user in raw form so you

290
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,229
might think of this in the same way that

291
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,840
users see rendered markup right even

292
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,640
when it's HTML underneath here it's

293
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:25,110
still the URL underneath but it's a much

294
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:27,840
more intuitive UI flow on top ok so

295
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,250
we've talked about the scheme we've

296
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,770
talked about the path and we've talked

297
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:34,290
about the whole URL so now let's move on

298
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:38,189
to the host right which is supposed to

299
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:39,990
tell us about site identity so here in

300
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,450
this example we're talking to the New

301
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:45,060
York Times maybe we've just trained

302
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,750
ourselves to ignore that www sub-domain

303
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,949
and all as well right but unfortunately

304
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:52,170
they're actually turn out to be a lot of

305
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:56,040
circumstances where this really does not

306
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:58,860
work so well so here are five of them

307
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:02,579
I'll go through these five problems so

308
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,350
let's start with confusing syntax so

309
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:07,350
let's say you're you're reading this URL

310
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,580
from left to right as most people do if

311
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,770
you're reading the English language

312
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,900
right so you might not actually know if

313
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:15,540
this is coming from google.com or not

314
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:18,569
right it might be pretty hard to tell so

315
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:21,180
about a year ago we hypothesize on the

316
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:23,600
chrome team that visually emphasizing in

317
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,770
we're in pieces of the URL and visually

318
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,380
de-emphasizing less important pieces of

319
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:31,290
the URL might actually help users read

320
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:35,640
URLs and therefore identify suspicious

321
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:38,339
pages based on the euro their URL so

322
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,650
these were some of the some of the UI

323
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,540
treatments that we wanted to test right

324
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:46,620
the first thing up here is how we

325
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:49,260
display URLs today the second one has

326
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:52,230
kind of these left-hand subdomains

327
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,700
grayed out so we were hypothesizing if

328
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,640
it would actually help if we grayed out

329
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,930
subdomains like in the second picture

330
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,000
the third picture there we've removed

331
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,189
the entire path and we just tested dot

332
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,320
dot dot so we were hypothesizing that it

333
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:08,040
might help if we've removed extraneous

334
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,070
information the fourth picture there is

335
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:14,130
not showing up well on the projector but

336
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:16,200
the subdomains and the paths are sort of

337
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:19,980
super dim they're they're very visually

338
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,140
de-emphasized and finally you know we we

339
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,170
hypothesized that it might help if we

340
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:27,000
bolded just this top level domain plus

341
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,130
one we call this the effective top-level

342
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,630
domain plus one which is just the most

343
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,450
important information when you're

344
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:35,070
communicating side entity and so we did

345
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,350
research where we showed users this

346
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,970
screenshot with those five different

347
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,950
URLs at the top and then we asked them

348
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,570
some questions about how comfortable

349
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:45,690
they would feel logging into the page

350
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,760
and unfortunately we found no

351
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,250
significant differences across any of

352
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,620
the options right across every option

353
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,080
over half of the respondents didn't even

354
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,730
notice the fishy URL at all and those

355
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,110
who did notice the URL tended to say

356
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,560
that they trusted it because it was

357
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:03,600
Google so unfortunately we really

358
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,150
haven't yet figured out a way to make

359
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,780
these multiple subdomains tricky URLs

360
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:13,430
less tricky and even if we did about

361
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,300
half of people wouldn't notice anyway

362
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:19,199
all right let's talk about another

363
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,420
problem which is brand matching so when

364
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,600
registering a domain site owners don't

365
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,400
necessarily know that we're expecting it

366
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,840
to be used for site identity right so

367
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,550
they might not register a domain that

368
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,740
actually matches the brand of the site

369
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:34,319
this is a perfectly okay thing to do

370
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,830
right here in the case of the Wall

371
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,180
Street

372
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:40,710
they're serving it from Dow Jones calm

373
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:44,400
but it's not a great way to match sort

374
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:46,830
of site identity what if you don't speak

375
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,590
English right this situation becomes

376
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:52,140
even worse because domain name pieces

377
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:58,050
like maps and translate might not

378
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:59,699
actually mean anything to you and going

379
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,979
back to our example from the beginning

380
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,220
of the talk right for those of you that

381
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:09,270
are still wondering the real Google blog

382
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,520
is actually at blog Google and we also

383
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,710
are serving some smaller domains some

384
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,510
smaller blogs on the Google plug domain

385
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:20,220
like the security blog is on security

386
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:21,870
Google Blog comm and also experiments

387
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,520
that with Google comm is actually the

388
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,860
real site for Google experiments so now

389
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,199
you know but you'll probably not

390
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,660
remember but the point here is that with

391
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,000
these new top-level domains it becomes

392
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,130
impossible for us to expect even expert

393
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,530
users to be able to tell site identities

394
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:43,010
just from URLs and finally

395
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:45,030
internationalized domain names so

396
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,560
internationalized domain names

397
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,850
we call these ID ends for short and

398
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,699
they're actually really awesome because

399
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:53,100
they allow us to create URLs in other

400
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,750
languages which makes the web much more

401
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,130
friendly to people who don't speak

402
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,620
English right and it makes the web great

403
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,390
for people all over the world but it

404
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:04,109
then opens up this whole can of worms

405
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:05,790
for site eyes on any reasons it's really

406
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:07,649
opening the door for domain spoofs

407
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,180
because it can make a spoof site appear

408
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:13,050
and distinguishable from another site

409
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:14,910
that's being spoofed so most web

410
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,589
browsers have a set of rules to defend

411
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,839
against ID and spoofs where we show

412
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,129
what's called puny code in the case

413
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,359
where we think that there's an ID and

414
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,050
spoof happening

415
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,879
puny code looks like this right and I

416
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,800
was thinking about this and you know I

417
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,830
would actually consider this a pretty

418
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,919
weak defensive move right it's kind of

419
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:36,840
like this right instead of showing a URL

420
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,790
that is kind of misleading to some

421
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,520
people we're showing this string that is

422
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,290
literally meaningless to everyone right

423
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,060
and a large number of people aren't

424
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,770
going to look at the URL anyway or

425
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,090
understand that what we're trying to

426
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,429
convey here is

427
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,678
this is a defense against a domain spoof

428
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:56,070
so I definitely consider this an area

429
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,620
for improvement but my larger point here

430
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:02,370
is that showing host names is not a good

431
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:04,049
way to convey site identity okay so if

432
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,330
you're kind of depressed by that long

433
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:10,110
list of problems now let's talk about

434
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:14,279
some solutions so some of you are

435
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:15,658
probably saying to yourself Emily we've

436
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,809
seen some of your other talks and we

437
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:20,580
know that you know lots about HTTPS let

438
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:22,980
me tell you about this thing which can

439
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:27,620
map the domain to the identity of the

440
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:30,330
site right it solves your problem so

441
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:33,539
easy indeed Maps domains to legal

442
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,730
identities but the issue is that legal

443
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:39,629
identities are not the same as brand

444
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:43,620
names here mint.com right it's owned by

445
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:45,750
into it so it's there they're not the

446
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,510
same thing right and you also probably

447
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,130
saw this fun site set up by Anne Carroll

448
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:53,549
right it was going around the internet

449
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,500
in December 2017 and it maps to the

450
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:58,139
stripe ink that was incorporated in

451
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,240
Kentucky but unfortunately the stripe

452
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,549
ink that you know about was incorporated

453
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,250
in Delaware which makes these two stripe

454
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:09,450
inks totally separate legal identities

455
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:11,309
right and all of this ultimately depends

456
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,169
on the user looking at the URL bar and

457
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,740
noticing the lack of a warning which

458
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:19,679
they are not going to do so the

459
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,419
conclusion here is that Evie is not and

460
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,039
can never be a Silver Bullet

461
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:25,770
anti-spoofing or anti-phishing tool

462
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,870
right we as the browser makers we could

463
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,668
decide to change this UI right we could

464
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:32,219
decide to show warnings whenever a site

465
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,440
wasn't using validated Evie but these

466
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,480
examples show that even if we did do

467
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,799
this Evie would it be a good defense

468
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,750
against phishing attacks

469
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:42,559
because it can be overcome by some

470
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:46,950
moderately motivated attacker

471
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:49,320
so HTTPS solved network based attacks

472
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,630
right it allows us to be confident that

473
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,090
an attacker in the middle cannot view or

474
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,010
modify traffic it allows us to verify

475
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,620
that the site in question is really that

476
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:00,450
host but it does not allow us to

477
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,620
validate that the hosting question has

478
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,630
anything to do with

479
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,629
brand or product associated with that

480
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,640
host so we need to get these two

481
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:13,620
concepts separated in our minds and we

482
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,960
need to stop mixing them up so as we

483
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:19,080
make HTTP cheaper and more automated

484
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,300
more phishing sites will be HTTPS and

485
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,699
I'm here to say that that's okay and

486
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,590
that's expected the reason that's okay

487
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,090
is because phishing and man in the

488
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,389
middle attacks are two separate problems

489
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:32,939
that we need to solve separately and any

490
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,309
solution that depends on humans making a

491
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,690
judgment call about URLs will ultimately

492
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:40,410
not work to solve either of them but for

493
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,720
those of you that are wondering

494
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:45,660
specifically about the chrome UI that

495
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,750
says secure and arguing that it makes

496
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,429
fishing more effective you might be

497
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,890
happy to learn that we do want to get

498
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:55,890
rid of this UI but it's ultimately for

499
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:57,750
kind of a different reason we want to

500
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:00,210
get to a place where we're only warning

501
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:03,480
users when there is a problem like on an

502
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,890
HTTP site or on a phishing site and we

503
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,710
want to get to a place where we never

504
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,690
have to show positive UI for an HTTPS

505
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,540
site because it's just the expected

506
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:14,640
default and so this will look like this

507
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,559
second image here right you'll notice

508
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,320
there's no lock icon there's no secure

509
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,420
string there's no HTTPS it's just

510
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:27,090
google.com and the default expectation

511
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:29,370
is that it's secure so ultimately URLs

512
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:32,280
do not do a good job at solving phishing

513
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:34,620
and therefore technology that's

514
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,070
dependent on users making judgment about

515
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,989
URLs are unable to solve phishing so we

516
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:43,340
need to lean into systems that actually

517
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:46,650
are designed to use ibly solve phishing

518
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:49,260
so with systems like u2f and security

519
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,300
keys and password managers the code is

520
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,129
making the decision not the human and

521
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,500
that's what makes these better defenses

522
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:58,260
so when you think about it password

523
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,110
managers actually can become a phishing

524
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,150
solution if we improve their usability

525
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,428
and precision and adoption to the point

526
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,679
where manually inputting a password

527
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:09,300
becomes such a foreign concept that we

528
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,380
can start warning people when the

529
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:15,000
password manager doesn't trigger and

530
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,110
with systems like Google

531
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,730
Safe Browsing anti-phishing

532
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:22,409
infrastructure we using Chrome so Google

533
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,060
Safe Browsing is a system that's built

534
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:26,280
to look for phishing and malware and

535
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:28,530
social engineering so that clients can

536
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,820
show warnings on these sites and for

537
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,250
those who aren't familiar with Safe

538
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,350
Browsing the list and the API is there

539
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,960
free and publicly available and they

540
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:39,240
also flag you know not just fishing but

541
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,010
also social engineering so that apps and

542
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,860
sites can provide actionable warnings

543
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:46,379
that users will respond to and then

544
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,840
these these warnings these full-page

545
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,110
interstitials do measurably stop people

546
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,720
from getting to badness

547
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:56,790
but even if we solve phishing and even

548
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,340
if we solve social engineering there's

549
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:02,730
still this class of websites that urls

550
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,649
currently are best protected for and

551
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:07,590
these are sites that I'm calling non

552
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:10,110
canonical information sites so here's

553
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:12,179
two examples these two sites are not

554
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:13,800
fishing they're not spoofing they're not

555
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,350
social engineering so we're not going to

556
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,810
show a Safe Browsing warning but

557
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,040
technical users might be able to tell

558
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:22,590
that they're not the canonical

559
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,899
information about gmail signups right

560
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:27,540
and non-technical users who don't

561
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,890
understand URLs or maybe are coming

562
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,270
online for the first time they might not

563
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:34,230
actually be able to glean this

564
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:36,960
information so instead we need to try to

565
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,790
convey any signal that we as technical

566
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,580
security people are getting from the URL

567
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,080
in an understandable way and I admit

568
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,389
that I don't know how we should try to

569
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,399
do this yet but you know we've started

570
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,320
to brainstorm heuristics to detect this

571
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,900
as well as some potential UIs that we

572
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:57,210
might show but it's early days and it's

573
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:58,590
a challenging problem so in this talk I

574
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:01,050
went through the different pieces of the

575
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:04,080
URL and I talked about what use cases

576
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:06,300
each piece of the URL has and how

577
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,040
contrary to what you might believe URLs

578
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,470
really are not doing well at solving

579
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,180
these use cases and I talked about some

580
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:16,470
solutions that might solve these use

581
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:18,870
cases a little bit better so it's our

582
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,670
duty as usable security problem solvers

583
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:23,580
to deal with the your elephant in the

584
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:25,950
room instead of trying to emphasize user

585
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:28,299
education to examine the URL as a

586
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,279
security measure and instead of can

587
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:32,679
canoeing to build systems like Eevee

588
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:35,019
that rely on humans understanding URLs

589
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,909
we need to focus on creating systems

590
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:39,489
that are more usable and less brittle

591
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:41,169
and if we keep doing research on

592
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:42,879
experiments and stay focused on

593
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:45,489
usability for the average Internet user

594
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:48,039
I think that we can come up with some

595
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:50,979
ways to solve each use case of URLs even

596
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:53,080
better so if you have any questions or

597
00:24:50,979 --> 00:24:57,460
ideas I'd be really excited to talk to

598
00:24:53,080 --> 00:25:05,529
you and I can take questions now

599
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:05,529
[Applause]

600
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:13,850
yeah I think I so the question is how

601
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:18,320
have linked link shorteners helped or

602
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:20,810
harmed URLs in this space I think that

603
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,909
link Shorter's link shorteners are just

604
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:26,659
sort of continuing to exacerbate the

605
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:29,300
problem of you know URLs becoming even

606
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,250
more even less understandable and like

607
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,340
less useful for our anti-phishing

608
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:38,000
mechanism again as I mentioned like the

609
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:39,379
reality is that people don't understand

610
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,610
phishing they don't understand that the

611
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,960
URL is supposed to be a phishing

612
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,419
mechanism and they're not gonna look at

613
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,600
it anyway so I think it's just sort of

614
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:51,950
continuing to make the problem worse but

615
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:54,050
yeah yeah so the question was have you

616
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,090
looked at what Safari does so so far he

617
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,899
does two things off the top of my head

618
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,840
that I think are particularly

619
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,880
interesting one is I believe they kind

620
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,060
of hide the path all the time they also

621
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,010
show the the Evy cert if it's there as

622
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,560
kind of the main domain name without

623
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:12,920
showing the rest of the URL but one

624
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:15,379
thing that Safari does not do is they

625
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,390
don't allow editing of the URL from the

626
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:21,440
first interaction it's kind of this non

627
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:23,000
editable label and in chrome as I

628
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,800
mentioned one of the important things

629
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,450
about the the chrome omnibox is that

630
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,240
it's both read and write like you can

631
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:32,030
type directly into the URL and so I

632
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,400
think we would have to change our model

633
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:37,730
entirely if we wanted to move toward the

634
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,590
Safari model and we we sort of care

635
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:42,500
deeply about the ability for people to

636
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:45,080
to write right from their URL bar but I

637
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:47,110
do come in Safari on their how they've

638
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,340
moved toward this model of simplicity

639
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,679
I'm not sure I agree with their

640
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,870
perspective on evie being you know the

641
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,320
main thing in the URL bar but yeah it's

642
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:58,370
a it's an interesting example yeah I

643
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,750
think this is a really interesting

644
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,909
question so the question is how

645
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,550
important is it to have a consistent

646
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:07,430
experience across browsers and are you

647
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:10,399
working with other browser vendors to

648
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:12,250
make the UI consistent so to answer

649
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,170
yours the piece of your second question

650
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:17,420
we try as hard as we can to sort of

651
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:19,820
publish our research that we do in

652
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,690
papers and to like talk about the UI

653
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,879
work that we're going

654
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:25,160
to do a long period of time before it

655
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,320
actually rolls out you know so that

656
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,900
other browser vendors other applications

657
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,760
etc can take advantage of this you know

658
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:35,420
and ideally make things consistent but

659
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:38,540
ultimately I think that if we all sort

660
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:40,250
of agree on the general shape of where

661
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,990
things are going like for example that

662
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,220
there should be no positive security

663
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,350
indicators and we should only show

664
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,120
negative security indicators that really

665
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:51,350
show a warning it doesn't really matter

666
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,879
what shape or form those actually do you

667
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,230
know I don't think that you know

668
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,550
certainly some people use a lot of

669
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:58,220
different browsers a lot of different

670
00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:00,590
apps but ultimately I don't think that

671
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,960
people will say like oh chrome was

672
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,760
showing a green lock and like edge was

673
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,170
shoving like a green shield so I'm not

674
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,090
sure which one of these they mean right

675
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,740
like people are gonna be warned by a

676
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,720
warning and otherwise they're not gonna

677
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,250
be warned so I'm I I don't think it's

678
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,680
not important for the indicators to be

679
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,680
exactly the same yes
