1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:08,309
so I probably worked harder on this talk

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,480
than anyone I've given so be kind and be

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:15,480
gentle and your reviews also I learned

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,650
in doing this talk you shouldn't you

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,109
know you should plan ahead and you

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,849
should prepare but not too far so I got

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,250
everything done a little ahead of time

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,689
so I added a whole lot of pictures so

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,509
sorry about that but I found them

10
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,519
enjoyable and I got up to 96 slides so

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,140
yesterday I made it an even 100 so we

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,180
have a little material to cover but I

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,989
promise there the slides are posted so

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,879
you can grab them at your leisure there

15
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,839
is a lot of text so I'm not gonna walk

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,899
through everything but yeah so there's a

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,730
lot there so basically my history and

18
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,149
what I'm currently doing is I kind of

19
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,288
sit in but in that joint between

20
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:53,460
security and development right that's

21
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,289
where I'm most comfortable that's where

22
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,469
I've lived for a long time I do a bunch

23
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,910
of stuff with OWASP and yeah these are

24
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,890
my opinions so I have a couple projects

25
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,280
app sensor and then one that you'll hear

26
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,460
about in a little bit called mana so

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,710
yeah Jim is great Neil J Ron sponsors

28
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,429
everybody thank you so here's what we're

29
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,649
gonna do today

30
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,170
an honest retrospective so I'm not gonna

31
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,850
lie to you I may not tell you every

32
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,409
specific little terrible thing that I

33
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,360
did but I'm gonna try to give you an

34
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:25,680
honest look at what it was like trying

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,180
to start a program with the intention

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,040
that you can take some of this data and

37
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,570
go home and do something about it right

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,610
like you may not apply all of these

39
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,149
these are essentially my lessons learned

40
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,579
and my opinion about what I learned from

41
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,100
going through this process you may come

42
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,589
to different results but you know this

43
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,419
is kind of my story and part of the

44
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:50,579
reason why I approached it this way is

45
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:53,820
because when he when Neil and Jim asked

46
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,369
me to come talk I have like serious

47
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,500
impostor syndrome going on just looking

48
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,000
at the list of people talking know

49
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,460
exactly what I was going to be able to

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,140
add so you know it's my story right so I

51
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,959
I kind of have to be right in that

52
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,980
context so we're gonna do a little story

53
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,530
Tom so this is how I see my

54
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:19,670
you of myself here for this story time I

55
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:21,290
hope to engender like this vision or

56
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,149
visual for you I don't know if anybody

57
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,530
remembers this but this is the the

58
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,000
safety officer who kind of shot himself

59
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,150
in the foot but it's okay

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,430
right and then he tells everybody in the

61
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,080
crowd it's okay I did it y'all are still

62
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,640
safe right so hopefully you can learn

63
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,790
and take away some of the things that

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,640
I've done in particular context matters

65
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,370
though right because some of you who's

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:50,929
in a shop that has a thousand engineers

67
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:57,379
or more five hundred or more fifty or

68
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:59,599
less okay awesome so right so a thousand

69
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:00,858
or more and 50 or less are wildly

70
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,048
different problem sets right and you're

71
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:07,299
gonna approach them differently so my

72
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:09,890
particular context I got brought in to

73
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:11,660
start app set there was literally no app

74
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:14,569
set program at this company before I got

75
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,099
there I was they had this company had

76
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,190
been acquired they were a start-up and

77
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:21,108
they had been acquired by another

78
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:25,430
startup that has recently been acquired

79
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:27,650
by Oracle so the company that got bought

80
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,480
where I got dropped in they've been

81
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,760
around 15 years but they were kind of

82
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,429
sort of still a start-up they didn't

83
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,989
have any security people on staff but we

84
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,760
have some really intelligent developers

85
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:39,560
and engineers and there are micro

86
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,418
services shop who already had a lot of

87
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,980
infrastructure set up right so CI CD was

88
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:48,560
there there was this DevOps mentality

89
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,078
and program set up that's how they run

90
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,230
things and there's about 350 people of

91
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:55,940
which about 150 or so were engineers and

92
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,459
then the rest are different kind of

93
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:01,099
staff we were bought by a company that

94
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:02,810
had a significantly different makeup

95
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:04,190
right like they've been around about the

96
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,919
same amount of time but they look a lot

97
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:09,470
more traditional their deployment models

98
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:11,060
their operational models are all much

99
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,470
more traditional and so when they bought

100
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,000
this company and they're you know fifty

101
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,079
five hundred people at the time so when

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,120
they bought this company they said hey

103
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,260
you're doing good work and we bought you

104
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,060
so we want to leave you alone and we

105
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,010
don't want to affect your culture right

106
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,330
like our cultural that looks different

107
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,800
and y'all are clearly doing some

108
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,300
something that's working so we want to

109
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,129
want to try to

110
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,020
kind of draw somebody in so they they

111
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:32,180
put me in there I am the security team

112
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,060
and I had worked in both of these types

113
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,800
of environments basically my job was you

114
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,199
know get stuff done make things more

115
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,639
secure so this was kind of my starting

116
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,690
point list of things that I wanted to

117
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,060
accomplish this was to learn the

118
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:47,030
environment embed into the culture and

119
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,970
help translate across companies right so

120
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,289
help explain one to the other this

121
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,879
company had just been bought was

122
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:54,530
terrified because they thought we're

123
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,789
gonna get all this red tape the red tape

124
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,650
company was terrified because they

125
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:59,840
thought well this company doesn't do

126
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,609
security like you know and now we own

127
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,770
them and we've acquired them so it was a

128
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,599
bit of an odd environment you have to

129
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,940
secure everything prep them for

130
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:09,889
compliance which is kind of a big swath

131
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,740
to right over top of a company if you

132
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:15,259
haven't had to deal with compliance it's

133
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,879
a big brush stroke and then how can we

134
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:18,440
take lessons learned from moving in this

135
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,930
fast environment and and push them up

136
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,349
and benefit and here's what you had to

137
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,000
get started we have some tools we have

138
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:28,120
some training stuff that may or may not

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,190
be super applicable and then we have

140
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,219
policies right like so policies that are

141
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:37,009
written to work in that environment that

142
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:38,960
original middle environment so I go in

143
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:40,130
on the first day and I think I've got

144
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,299
this under control right like I've

145
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,210
worked in companies before I've seen

146
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,840
apps act programs work and then the

147
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:49,039
first day was a little bit more you know

148
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,068
I mean like everybody's first day is

149
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,449
this way right but I should clarify when

150
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:55,279
I've worked before I haven't run apps

151
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:58,279
act teams before this is my first go at

152
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,719
it I've seen it happen like I've

153
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:04,430
listened to talks at conferences and

154
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:05,870
stuff I'm good so be humble like any

155
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,729
environment you walk into please be

156
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,020
humble so the first week was when I

157
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:10,789
really started working with architecture

158
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,620
tooling engineers and I started learning

159
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:15,830
a little bit about kind of how things

160
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,879
were worked within that company and you

161
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,409
know a couple of these things

162
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,029
so we'll churn through some slides

163
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:25,129
quickly a couple of these things kind of

164
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:26,750
make you go oh yeah a couple of them

165
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:29,180
like I just didn't understand and I got

166
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:32,449
a little upset about and they made my

167
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,770
made me look a little odd maybe this is

168
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:38,490
a great movie by the way if you haven't

169
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:41,900
seen it so some things make you angry

170
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:45,960
best show of all time by the way and

171
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:48,179
then yeah you just want to crash and cry

172
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,320
so you think about it a little bit over

173
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,550
the first weekend right and you have a

174
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:56,310
little time to digest so it's alright

175
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,990
like everything's gonna be fun right the

176
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,300
business is still operating right like

177
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,130
that's where you have to land apparently

178
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:06,449
even though you think everything's on

179
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:08,610
fire right and honestly some of it is it

180
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:11,729
hasn't been found yet like you you have

181
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,639
that going for you right it's it's okay

182
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:16,620
and honestly they would not be paying

183
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,830
you to do security stuff right like who

184
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,530
I know there's a couple in here who

185
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,960
either works as a developer trying to

186
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,400
write secure things or like in the

187
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,138
security team trying to build actual

188
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,479
applications not like a service provider

189
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:33,780
type okay mmm

190
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,840
third half the audience so yeah so take

191
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,679
a break a little bit take a breath so

192
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,388
what was that trying to do the first

193
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,979
quarter I'm gonna run through this stuff

194
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,289
pretty quickly if you have questions

195
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:45,030
shoot your hand up but I'm trying to get

196
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:49,039
to the end I promise I'd much rather

197
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,039
hear Allison's talk than my own so

198
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:54,690
basically just try to get involved was

199
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,580
the first quarter we had a pretty good

200
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:00,389
base of things to start from but I need

201
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,830
to kind of get embedded in the group and

202
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:04,349
so we did pretty good with introductions

203
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,870
I got onto the team pretty well I made a

204
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:08,639
decent dent in like tech training but

205
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,409
then you realize that like you're not

206
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,580
only training developers as a security

207
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:13,740
person you're also training like

208
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,940
marketing right that's a fundamentally

209
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,940
different thing that you kind of get

210
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,159
used to even though I'm only helping the

211
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,810
trying to help the app SEC program get

212
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:23,219
stood up I have to worry about what

213
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,320
they're doing right because marketing is

214
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,169
standing up sites that contribute to our

215
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,340
overall security posture so I kind of

216
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:31,969
have to worry about what they're doing

217
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,439
right they're posting messages like

218
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,610
where are you storing this customer

219
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,800
material right like I have to worry

220
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:42,539
about lots of these things so I put fail

221
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,339
I'm quite a lot of these things I don't

222
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,420
mean that like their actual failures I

223
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,820
mean I should have been doing them

224
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,680
earlier usually so one of the first

225
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,670
things that I would recommend is

226
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,099
when you go into this environment just

227
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,630
like seek out the people that are useful

228
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,910
right and they're not always that's not

229
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,980
always org chart driven like there are

230
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,839
people that have institutional knowledge

231
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,490
this is really useful people like people

232
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,720
who have been around for 15 years and

233
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,730
the company and they know where all the

234
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,339
bodies are buried like find those people

235
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,630
make friends with them be nice and learn

236
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:13,420
the environment and tooling that will

237
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,980
become more important later on so the

238
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,719
second thing so this is where tech lands

239
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,370
right like first quarter was a little

240
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,550
bit of a shortened quarter I just wanted

241
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,620
to get in so I figured I was gonna have

242
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,880
this thing wrapped up q2 rightly I was

243
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,700
and have the problem solved

244
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,350
because I new tech that was the

245
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,450
environment I came from and I new tech a

246
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,450
new static analysis I I had built one of

247
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,649
these things before right like I can set

248
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,880
one up that should be pretty

249
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:38,170
straightforward even though it wasn't

250
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,149
when I built I should be able to set one

251
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,670
up if I built one and then I was gonna

252
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:44,709
leverage you know zap and dependency

253
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,390
check and do some more training him

254
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:50,640
we've made it a little further on the

255
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:54,550
training so SAS is a little hard

256
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,230
particularly on micro service

257
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,930
environments right so we have many more

258
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,000
services than we have people right if if

259
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,219
that's not your environment that may

260
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,810
break a little bit of stuff but when you

261
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,420
have way more services than you have

262
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,859
people and a team is handling a dozen

263
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,370
services there's you know half a dozen

264
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:14,230
people you have to set all those things

265
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,560
up right like it that you don't get them

266
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,420
for free and we're the word polyglot

267
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,630
right so any language and so your

268
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,430
tooling doesn't necessarily security

269
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,800
totally is it necessary polyglot

270
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:29,589
friendly right particularly if you use

271
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,029
in modern languages is that still

272
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:33,070
awesome but I didn't get to that at all

273
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:34,480
dependency check we did good there's

274
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,430
low-hanging fruit there that's that's

275
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,829
pretty fantastic

276
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,989
Jeremy's talk I made fun of him when he

277
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:42,699
got done I said he must be like cursed

278
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:45,760
because he's stuck with dealing with

279
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:47,380
third-party libraries so I think I

280
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,160
believe in dependency check I believe in

281
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,260
what he was talking about this morning

282
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,699
and that is something that you can help

283
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,449
developers with so please go spend time

284
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:56,910
doing that and we did our item training

285
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:59,620
so here's where failures start to happen

286
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,149
I did not formulate questions that I

287
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,230
wanted to answer right I just went in

288
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:02,740
and started solving stuff that I knew

289
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,010
how to solve

290
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,600
right and you can make progress but like

291
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,790
are you making the progress you mean to

292
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,740
make you're not necessarily solving the

293
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,540
right problems so I should started there

294
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,370
starting an application inventory who

295
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,170
has a great application inventory and

296
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,540
it's confident like they know what's

297
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:22,689
going on

298
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:25,089
awesome so like everybody in security

299
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,529
needs this right and it's at many

300
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:28,600
different layers right it's at the

301
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:32,950
applications themselves it's that you're

302
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:35,920
your hosts your you know bring your own

303
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,990
device all of these things we need to do

304
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,029
better at and like nobody's going after

305
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:43,810
them so at the end of this talk I'm

306
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:45,640
gonna like yell and scream and so if

307
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,439
you're smart and you can build software

308
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,600
like build one of these like make the

309
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,370
right thing like this would contribute a

310
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,830
lot to people like me who are having

311
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,390
solved these problems tools may not be

312
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,920
the right place to start you may get a

313
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,050
lot more lift by just like talking to

314
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,959
people or introducing processes or

315
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,760
whatever see ICD is security string I'm

316
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:06,189
going to talk about this way more later

317
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,630
on but I'll pause for just a second to

318
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:12,820
make something that hopefully rests in

319
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:14,770
your brain the rest of the time I guess

320
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:18,870
it was during Jeremy's talk when he's

321
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:21,100
talking about automatic changes to code

322
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,660
how can you do that how can you have

323
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,560
confidence to do that when you don't

324
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:28,150
have a good testbed so it is my

325
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,089
fundamental belief pretty much

326
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,949
everything that the the good quality

327
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:35,230
security teams that I see are all

328
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,240
depending on unbelievable amounts of

329
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,410
underlying infrastructure and if you

330
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,120
don't have that infrastructure it's

331
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:44,079
gonna make it way harder to do your job

332
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,760
right so see ICD writing tests and like

333
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,890
if you don't have C ICD and you don't

334
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,839
have unit tests and integration tests

335
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,880
it's gonna be really hard to be

336
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,959
successful right so maybe you invest

337
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,089
your time and trying to get your team's

338
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,099
to do those you know basic hygiene and

339
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:58,540
it gets the additional lift that oh by

340
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,329
the way the engineers actually love that

341
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:04,480
so I told gene this my talk is basically

342
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,579
a worse version of what he said so I

343
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,850
agree wholeheartedly with everything he

344
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:11,089
was saying and and

345
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:14,180
you know so I got a lot of lift here

346
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:17,420
from CICE third-party libraries is

347
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,069
rotten fruit okay so I'm gonna move a

348
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,870
little faster and skip a lot of this so

349
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:23,569
credential storage we had a solve right

350
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:26,300
hard-coded passwords hard courted text

351
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:28,009
whatever plain text passwords we needed

352
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,380
to solve this we looked around we picked

353
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:31,639
hash court vault the only reason I

354
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,439
mentioned that product is because I'm

355
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:34,940
going to talk about it later but there's

356
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,310
lots of tools out here that solve this

357
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,930
thing so we picked this it worked great

358
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,579
operationally in our environment that

359
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,109
was a big factor right a lot of times

360
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:44,300
security tries to push solutions on

361
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,920
people that make no sense in the

362
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,719
environment right you just pick

363
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,729
something and drop it in and go ye shall

364
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,970
that is not a good way to make friends

365
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:55,790
with people I promise dynamic analysis

366
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,410
what I did here was I found somebody in

367
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,089
this building of the champions later I

368
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,560
found somebody in QA who was interested

369
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,449
in security and was getting kind of

370
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,729
bored and wanted to make a job change so

371
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:06,439
he said hey if I kick into this will you

372
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,720
train me on some security stuff like

373
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,430
sweet so he already knew the environment

374
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,250
he knew how selenium ran in the group

375
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:15,439
and I gave him you know hours of extra

376
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,959
one-on-one security training and he gave

377
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:20,420
me zap integration and just solved that

378
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:22,550
problem for me like it just went away so

379
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,889
that was fantastic right so find people

380
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,810
that you that you can use their this

381
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:29,569
went on with security champions I

382
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,768
started noticing as I did training so as

383
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,029
I look across the room like there's a

384
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,920
lot of heads that are doing this number

385
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:35,990
right but there's six that are going

386
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,160
right and that's kind of what you get

387
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,779
when you do a lot of training unless

388
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,110
you're GM and everybody's on the edge of

389
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:44,660
the sea but those six are important

390
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,829
right because usually they're the ones

391
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,550
that you're gonna that are gonna care

392
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:48,469
about the stuff that you're talking

393
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,839
about so like grab those six afterwards

394
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,519
pull them in and go hey is there other

395
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:57,350
stuff that you want to hear about and so

396
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:58,699
that was pretty beneficial and then a

397
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,939
couple people in the room here actually

398
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:04,370
we noticed that the existing SDLC policy

399
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:07,099
that existed worked it was really a

400
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,319
standards document it said this is the

401
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,990
way that we run our business and and we

402
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:14,479
run our SDLC and it didn't say these are

403
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,010
the controls we want to have and you go

404
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,240
implement them in a specific way but so

405
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,069
we had to do some work at the corporate

406
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,730
level to kind of rewrite that policy and

407
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:21,469
met turn

408
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:24,680
into an actual policy and then build a

409
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:28,100
standard so yeah I explained all that

410
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,160
stuff so I'm gonna skip down so lessons

411
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,709
learned pick operational good

412
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,389
operationally compatible tools I'm a big

413
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,739
believer in open source it helps you

414
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:39,380
contribute back to the community I'll

415
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,260
beat on that a little later policies do

416
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,060
matter to an extent depends on your

417
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,550
environment that's a contextual thing

418
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:52,430
the policies can matter particularly at

419
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:54,589
scale and and then here like just reach

420
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,760
out to people who have solved problems

421
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:59,600
like there's a lot of very smart people

422
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,760
in this room and and you know in lots of

423
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,589
other places and it turns out like most

424
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,290
people are relatively nice there are

425
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:07,459
some people that are not but if you go

426
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,019
to somebody you say hey look you're

427
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:11,060
really smart I would like to ask you

428
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:12,769
some questions that it kind of works

429
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,569
right like people will respond and

430
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:18,680
they'll answer you and like people that

431
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:20,600
you really look up to and respect for

432
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,430
specific things and who have deep

433
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,100
knowledge in a specific area they'll

434
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:28,160
talk to you about that thing in our

435
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,290
environment besom is a good community

436
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,959
and it's just basically all these people

437
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,149
that build apps tech programs and have

438
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,920
for years and it's just this environment

439
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:38,510
of people that I can call right so

440
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,250
there's other ones be Sims kind of a

441
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,380
buy-in community but that was the one

442
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,810
that kind of blew my mind when I got

443
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,790
around there and then please share your

444
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,529
security knowledge which I didn't do so

445
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:52,939
great at first but I'm trying to do

446
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:55,579
better now so metrics so these are the

447
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,889
next things we we tried to try to hit so

448
00:16:55,579 --> 00:17:00,410
a couple things here threat modeling and

449
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:02,660
tracking attack surface so threat

450
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,428
modeling was a big deal I probably

451
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,230
should have done this earlier but if

452
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:08,059
you're not doing threat modeling you

453
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,220
should right that's kind of a base

454
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:13,270
statement but I'm just gonna gonna make

455
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,620
that assumption the problem is is nobody

456
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,609
heard or knew what the word threat

457
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,399
modeling was when I came in the door

458
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:23,000
like it was a foreign concept they were

459
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,319
you know much closer to the we do agile

460
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,510
development which means we don't have to

461
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,149
worry about design you know like that's

462
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,470
not real software development so threat

463
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,500
modeling was kind of throwing a kink in

464
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,179
there

465
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,799
and so we wanted to start something

466
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,750
simple so we tried to approach it there

467
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,500
and then lots of microservices so who

468
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:42,780
does microservices and who is

469
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,049
comfortable in that of those half-dozen

470
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:49,678
a yellow can you tell me like what your

471
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:52,470
attack surface looks like you and you

472
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,700
must run in the cloud yeah fully if

473
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,200
you're nodding your head yes I'm

474
00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:04,260
assuming your answer is we run in the

475
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:05,820
cloud yes absolutely absolutely no so if

476
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,070
you are interested in this topic I'm not

477
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,879
gonna ramble here but I did do a talk

478
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,689
about micro server security and

479
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,330
specifically what I learned from going

480
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:29,400
through that and I think it had some

481
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:31,470
useful pull out points yeah yeah so we

482
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,929
took a really simple thing and my

483
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,730
criterion was I want the developers to

484
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:37,110
draw a picture and I want them to come

485
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,960
up with a list of issues at the end

486
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:41,969
right so you can certainly go much much

487
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,820
much deeper in my environment that was

488
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:47,309
good enough right again context matters

489
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:52,668
I'm not building financial services

490
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:56,418
applications right I'm building customer

491
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:59,429
everything's behind a paid account and

492
00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:01,830
it's not a cannot a open consumer app so

493
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:03,360
there's it's a little different threat

494
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,760
model than everybody else but yeah

495
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,889
basically we get a picture and a list of

496
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,890
threats go ahead sorry

497
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:24,928
if they didn't have oh so how did I

498
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:27,450
introduce the concept yep good question

499
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:29,519
so the first step was training everybody

500
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,459
and kind of giving this overview of this

501
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,950
is what I expect and so I said I kind of

502
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:36,389
gave a quick primer on this is threat

503
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,830
modeling in our environment this is what

504
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:40,258
we're gonna do and we took you know kind

505
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,699
of a basic stride model and said this is

506
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:43,769
what threat modeling is I spent 30

507
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,989
minutes walking through with a you know

508
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:48,209
small groups of people said this is kind

509
00:19:45,989 --> 00:19:49,829
of this is your picture your design

510
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:52,469
boxes that you're putting up there to

511
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:53,729
get like you know arc approval this is

512
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:54,959
what it should look like active threat

513
00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:56,879
modeling these are the extra bits of

514
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:58,559
metadata that I won't and then I will

515
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:59,609
work with you so everybody that came

516
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,408
through threat modeling they have to

517
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:04,379
come through me to do it the first

518
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:06,329
couple times and we'd spend 30 minutes

519
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:09,178
or an hour you know kind of going

520
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:10,829
through so and then I built some example

521
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:24,329
threat models to give them templates to

522
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:27,539
work from yes so we don't use any

523
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:29,668
specific tooling again we're not doing

524
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:31,349
extensive threat modeling we don't use

525
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:33,629
any specific tooling but basically what

526
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:35,339
we do is I give them a library of things

527
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:37,949
that I say you need to worry about these

528
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:39,690
things if you're doing if you you know

529
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,639
we've got services that aren't exposed

530
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:44,579
to the front end we got services that

531
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:47,369
are API on the side API on that side or

532
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:49,889
they both talk to Kafka right so but we

533
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:51,059
have buckets of services that this one

534
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:53,339
if you squint your kind of looks like

535
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:55,529
that one so I kind of said for this

536
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:57,029
class of service that you're building

537
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:58,349
for this class these are kind of the

538
00:20:57,029 --> 00:21:03,119
buckets of things you want to worry

539
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:04,079
about so tracking attack surface so this

540
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:05,668
is something I would recommend to

541
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,349
everybody I think Dan Cornell did a talk

542
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:10,950
about something kind of sort of similar

543
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:12,389
to this a while back but you know like

544
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,859
when you start up your program and you

545
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:16,199
get your routes like if you're building

546
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:18,299
a web app or something or you know Jer

547
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,009
PC or something it'll expose and it'll

548
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,418
say you know like if you start your

549
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:24,929
spring boot app it'll say here's your

550
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:26,080
routes right well if you can write

551
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:28,930
static analysis you

552
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,730
can kind of get this information too so

553
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,800
what we did was in CSE D we have a

554
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,970
little tool and I had a couple of the

555
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,530
developers who were interested in this

556
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,360
they they worked on their little thing

557
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,920
so we built that sport for a couple

558
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,490
frameworks and essentially it just spits

559
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:45,220
out like a text file that's you know

560
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,990
list of routes sorted and unique and

561
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,000
that gets stored in a file and then we

562
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,700
just diff those over time so every time

563
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,940
a change happens like if I if I can see

564
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,160
this much attack surface was added like

565
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,170
this thing went from 40 routes to now it

566
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,170
has 45 like that's a big change that I

567
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:04,270
probably need to go look at or if if

568
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,620
these route you know if we've got a pin

569
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,850
test coming up or something I can kind

570
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,739
of say to somebody you need to go check

571
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,590
out this specific thing because this is

572
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,850
new right like this is different and you

573
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,230
can hope that the developers are gonna

574
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,969
give you that but there's a lot of lift

575
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,710
that you can get from little things like

576
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,300
this right so you can take the UNIX

577
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,500
model little small things and you can

578
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:26,050
compose them together and get a lot of

579
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:30,130
overall benefit yes a measuring and

580
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:31,810
communicating is important the the thing

581
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,330
that I learned with threat modeling I

582
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:36,100
had been doing it for years but for pure

583
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,929
developers like I had been on the one

584
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,030
always responsible for doing it and I

585
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,350
was a security and developer the benefit

586
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,600
I got for the developers who'd never

587
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,610
really been security people was they can

588
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,379
like get the stuff off their chest that

589
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,729
they're really worried about almost

590
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,860
every session I would walk in and

591
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,510
somebody would go I want to write this

592
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,399
down like we haven't even started in the

593
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,350
conversation yet like what do you you

594
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,240
know and and but really it gave them an

595
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,469
opportunity this is the context that

596
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,120
gives them an opportunity to kind of get

597
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,770
things off their chest and just asking

598
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,300
them that question now is really

599
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:06,100
important what are you worried about in

600
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,840
your application because we can go

601
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,370
through this list but I may never get to

602
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,100
that thing they've got the domain

603
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:15,840
knowledge so alright we're halfway done

604
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,840
how are we doing yes sir

605
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:25,240
yes oh sorry about that to everybody

606
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:31,040
so that was in the context of metrics

607
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,170
which I didn't really talk about but at

608
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,580
the time like now we measure a few more

609
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,059
things but at the time we were looking

610
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,409
for

611
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:38,629
how many projects were going through

612
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:40,130
certain processes how many so how many

613
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,590
projects have SAS set up how many

614
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:45,520
projects are in this particular so we've

615
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:47,629
we've gone through a CI system

616
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,429
transition right so we went from one

617
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,900
platform to another how many are on the

618
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:52,340
old platform how many are on the new

619
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,690
right so the high level program metrics

620
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:58,909
of which ones are like we have a lot of

621
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,340
services I have a couple that are that I

622
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:03,340
know are important that I just can't get

623
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,418
skipped and then I have a bunch that I'm

624
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,189
you know what I mean like they're kind

625
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:08,390
of they may be more important or may not

626
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,240
be and at this point I didn't know what

627
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,679
they were so it was really for me the

628
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,970
the metrics I was trying to collect at

629
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:16,130
that point we're more about tracking

630
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:20,600
which ones I might have I covered which

631
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:23,690
ones have a not and how can I know what

632
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,110
to worry about right moving into this

633
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:29,750
role I started worrying a lot more so

634
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:31,490
get your tomes ready

635
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,440
also for threat modeling people like

636
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,910
playing the attacker right like even if

637
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:41,860
security people it makes them feel like

638
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:41,860
security yes sir yep

639
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:57,639
yeah yeah so yeah so Sue's app is

640
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,669
awesome it can do quite a lot of stuff

641
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,530
it's I am so I should clarify I've never

642
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:06,070
been a pen tester which wouldn't made me

643
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:07,720
a little wary of it but I called Simon

644
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,100
up he's a really nice guy and he said on

645
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,400
the phone with me in the QA guy that I

646
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:13,990
said for a couple hours actually on a

647
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,130
couple of occasions and kind of walked

648
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,940
us through and said well you can do this

649
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:20,680
and you can do this and you can so we

650
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,240
went after the important bits of the

651
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,030
application right so we do not have

652
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,400
dynamic testing just canned as part of

653
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:29,860
all micro services that is actually on

654
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,510
the docket for this year so I realized

655
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,830
that's not an easy problem to solve but

656
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,840
there was a couple of important things

657
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:36,370
that we knew were really important they

658
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,230
already had good coverage and they had

659
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,989
selenium test coverage either being

660
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,820
api's or web front-ends so we already

661
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:45,280
had good test coverage and zaps plug in

662
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,300
selenium plugin works pretty well we

663
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:50,020
just had to figure out how to get the

664
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,760
hook and connect them right so I thought

665
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,820
like I was gonna push a button and zap

666
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,110
was just gonna solve that problem but

667
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,429
you know obviously a lot of people are

668
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,780
still struggling struggling with that

669
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,030
and and so are we

670
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:06,520
so API security testing is one of the

671
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:13,570
things this year am I done

672
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:15,460
Oh 52 I'm half way alright so I'm gonna

673
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:18,700
try to run faster alright so how have we

674
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,800
done the big wins I think were in the

675
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,200
first half first year right like I got

676
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,000
involved we had a decent champions core

677
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,770
team I think which was pretty good

678
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,340
compliance I didn't hardly do much at

679
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:32,350
all and the basics were there right like

680
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,870
the basic things that took me from I'm

681
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,550
terrified to a little more confident

682
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:38,679
they weren't there but we were still for

683
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,760
long ways off and we hadn't really up

684
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,000
streamed much at all

685
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,680
so yeah so we got acquired importantly

686
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,060
in this quarter

687
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,850
and we were looking at this app

688
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:53,260
deployment tool so Mike was talking

689
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:56,240
about kubernetes we did not go with

690
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:58,760
kubernetes which

691
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,830
for our environment given our deployment

692
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,030
model and our needs we picked a

693
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,810
different one

694
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:08,120
and we kind of built some you know

695
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:10,240
tooling around it but we needed to do

696
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,679
that and we needed to get some security

697
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,710
fixes in place because there was some

698
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,150
like persons going and deploying which

699
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,770
is always terrifying when you have lots

700
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:21,080
of services going and deployments

701
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,340
happening pretty frequently we were

702
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,129
looking at we were starting to look

703
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:27,230
at containers at that point and then I

704
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:29,180
wanted to solve runtime intelligence so

705
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,530
again I'm not gonna spend a lot of time

706
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,750
talking about it but I do have a broadly

707
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:34,730
called absence are at a wasp that thinks

708
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:39,890
about this thing about this issue of

709
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:41,330
runtime intelligence and so we also

710
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:43,430
wanted to kind of do some integration

711
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:45,620
with other people another one of the

712
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,970
things that I firmly believe is that you

713
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,110
can we can get a lot of intelligence

714
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:52,760
from our apps that we're just not doing

715
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:56,060
today right so app deployment tool we

716
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:59,330
had really great tooling people I think

717
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:03,440
Mike in the Q&A at the end yesterday you

718
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:06,080
were saying if secure defaults right if

719
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,760
you don't default to secure like your

720
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,970
your hose because nobody's gonna opt you

721
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,710
okay like if it works and it's insecure

722
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,110
they're just gonna keep working with it

723
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:16,490
being insecure because it works

724
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,469
especially if they flip that switch and

725
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:21,920
it doesn't work so start with security

726
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:23,830
and so we did that and we were trying to

727
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:29,270
build up some of the base infrastructure

728
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:33,530
we looked at containers and we did have

729
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:34,730
a lot of luck with with container

730
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:36,830
security I did a bunch of research

731
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,240
obviously does it Aaron I'm gonna

732
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:41,750
butcher his name gratifi Ori

733
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,980
close grata for you worried okay thank

734
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,380
you

735
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:47,390
so his is you know treat is on the

736
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,880
subject is phenomenal but there's a lot

737
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:52,610
of good papers out now but basically I

738
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,050
studied that for like weeks right trying

739
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,570
to trying to grok and understand all of

740
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:58,220
it and then went back to our team and

741
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,780
luckily because it was Greenfield I was

742
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,780
able to go in and say look this is the

743
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,740
way we're gonna do it and here's all the

744
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,600
security features we're gonna have

745
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,590
turned on turned up and since we were

746
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,389
doing docker they had a lot of stuff

747
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:13,500
enabled thanks to

748
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:14,970
diogo and the team there however with

749
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,770
our deployment tool and some of the open

750
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,360
source ones the integration was not

751
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,559
quite there at this point in time so

752
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,178
some of those features that were like

753
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,440
nice to turn on like the deployment tool

754
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:25,429
couldn't get to them because the

755
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,960
integration wasn't done yet

756
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:29,490
for runtime intelligence I kind of got

757
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,710
the idea deployed into the people's

758
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,440
minds this is an idea that kind of takes

759
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:36,030
people's brains to turn on before they

760
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,770
actually see the value there I didn't do

761
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:39,480
such a great job getting that done the

762
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:44,400
first time

763
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:47,039
so for vault this was part of this came

764
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,260
into and I'll link to things here in

765
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,360
just a second we reused vault as part of

766
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,679
our operational deployment and it turns

767
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,879
out to be really useful in a lot of

768
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:56,789
different contexts fault

769
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,799
is really good at a bunch of things and

770
00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:00,750
it has kind of it's starting to get

771
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,940
feature bloat and in some respects but

772
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:06,740
it's got a lot of helpful things that

773
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,740
are not just store this secure thing

774
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,168
availability for those who have

775
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,760
forgotten is actually part of what

776
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:13,799
security is supposed to be doing we

777
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,000
forget that a lot of times but when

778
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,440
you're trying to run software like

779
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,570
having it available it's a pretty

780
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,530
important feature so you know this is

781
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,149
something that when you when you're

782
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:26,250
doing security engineering you're trying

783
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:27,750
to get stuff in there like turning the

784
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,299
thing off is not OK

785
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,919
right like you can't that that's not

786
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:33,150
that's a non-starter and you can't do

787
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,770
that so when we were talking about

788
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,059
deployments we had to think through this

789
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,129
a little more heavily than you might

790
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:39,720
normally because this was the thing that

791
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,090
is pushing all of our code and turning

792
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,480
it up and turn it on so a way to think

793
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:47,220
about that I do think that this app SEC

794
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,260
OPSEC thing is an area that we don't

795
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,179
really look at enough so meaning the

796
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,908
feedback loop so how many people look

797
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:56,159
through like how many people take there

798
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:59,520
how many people have web logs stored in

799
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,890
some cluster right like hopefully you do

800
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,929
so you're siphoning that data off how

801
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:06,240
many people take that data and make

802
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:07,830
decisions about how you run you know

803
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,220
secure your applications based on that

804
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:13,470
data all right ok so that's fantastic

805
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,200
that's more hands than have ever been up

806
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:18,179
in any room I've ever been in so that's

807
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,190
a really simple example but we have all

808
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:22,169
this signal that we just ignore and we

809
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,820
never like take the operational stuff

810
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:25,019
back into the app sack program and I

811
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,269
think that's an area where we can get a

812
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:31,049
lot of lift so we should think about

813
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:34,110
that so these are two blog posts about

814
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:37,830
what we did with fault it's it's pretty

815
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:39,779
interesting and again I didn't do most

816
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,370
of this work other really smart people

817
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:44,129
did but it's really interesting as a use

818
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:45,709
case on how to use the right tool for

819
00:31:44,129 --> 00:31:48,269
the right job in the right environment

820
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:49,889
and it's pretty pretty clever we get a

821
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:56,039
lot of security benefits and operational

822
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:57,990
benefits so which ones don't talk about

823
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,899
so basically core security libraries and

824
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:02,519
source code attestation core security

825
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:04,500
libraries are a big deal if you're

826
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,840
letting people just like raw use the

827
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,669
api's that they want they're gonna use

828
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,139
them wrong we've seen that over and over

829
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:12,080
and over again today right like the talk

830
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:15,899
before me was just like screaming that

831
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,240
and Alex's talk where he was saying you

832
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:20,158
know we kind of put this shim layer here

833
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,389
to make it easy for people to do the

834
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,250
right thing that's kind of the route

835
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:24,750
that you want to go it also gives you

836
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:28,879
the opportunity to squash whole bug

837
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:31,080
classes so Christophe Kern from Google

838
00:32:28,879 --> 00:32:32,610
there's a paper and there's a really

839
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,009
good talk where he talks about how

840
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,149
Google went about killing off sequel

841
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:39,960
injection and cross-site scripting

842
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:42,199
inside the organization and it's it's a

843
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,879
phenomenal talk in in and of itself but

844
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,710
you know kind of a it's a little bit pie

845
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:48,360
in the sky for most of us because you

846
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,429
know the way they did that was dealing

847
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,990
with they rewrote the drivers and most

848
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:53,789
of us don't have the option to like

849
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:56,789
rewrite our database driver right like

850
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:58,980
but they did and and I think he said 11

851
00:32:56,789 --> 00:33:02,820
man months they just squashed signal

852
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:05,220
injection right across all of them like

853
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,080
that's phenomenal and none of us I don't

854
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,340
think or I don't say none of us a few of

855
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,289
us think that way about solving problems

856
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,769
but if we really did that's how we

857
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:14,970
should be going about doing stuff so

858
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:16,529
source code at a station this is a cool

859
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:19,139
project basically where we wanted to

860
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:21,299
verify from commit to the actual running

861
00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:23,428
system that we could verify who did what

862
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:25,080
what systems it went through you know so

863
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:26,940
this is a bunch of the kind of security

864
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,289
stuff that we all do but you can see

865
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,840
that pipeline all the way through so

866
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:32,158
that was pretty fun you have a lot of

867
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,779
integration work the audit log is

868
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,179
powerful I think alex is tall queries

869
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:37,889
today about vetting logs and what

870
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:43,679
information you can get off from that is

871
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:45,359
pretty good hooks are obviously really

872
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,789
good integration points I really wish I

873
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,408
knew that beforehand I feel felt like a

874
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:50,969
dummy when I came to that conclusion but

875
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:53,519
it is it is a really good thing

876
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:55,499
all right last couple of things a

877
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,509
mutable infrastructure I was kind of

878
00:33:55,499 --> 00:34:00,599
late late to the game on this one and

879
00:33:57,509 --> 00:34:02,129
then compliance fast and slow checks so

880
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:03,779
the idea here is immutable if fro like

881
00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:07,069
infer that you can just blow away and

882
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:09,418
bring back up as is right like there's

883
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:11,549
Diogo Monica I think has a talk on

884
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:13,078
reverse uptime it covers most of these

885
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:15,989
concepts so it's really good if you go

886
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:17,549
want to go read that fast and slow

887
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:19,199
checks this was something we have

888
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:21,329
learned the hard way so fast checks

889
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,219
being little quick things that we can

890
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:24,960
just verify like you're not doing this

891
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,368
ridiculous thing right or you're

892
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,139
following our company's policy on this

893
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:30,450
thing but you're slow checks are gonna

894
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:32,520
be like the tools that take a long time

895
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:33,899
to run right like your dynamic scanning

896
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,389
tools you can't run that as part of the

897
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:37,918
build in most organizations right you

898
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:39,720
might be able to pull it off but usually

899
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,029
not so if you take that fast approach

900
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,529
and just you can actually block commits

901
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:45,239
as many things you can put in there that

902
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:47,668
are like tenable for the development

903
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:50,549
team that kind of pushes you back to

904
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,899
right like in other words in the

905
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:54,929
development environment is the best

906
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:56,759
place to stop it after that like see I

907
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:58,470
blocking is the best place to stop it

908
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,980
after that is like coming around end

909
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,480
around

910
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,130
you know after security team has to

911
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,270
detect it and so forth and then

912
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,890
obviously if it's deployed in production

913
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:07,109
and it's an incident it's kind of the

914
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:11,609
worst option so we did pretty good on

915
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:16,160
this I think compliance kind of sucks

916
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:16,160
but I think everybody probably knew that

917
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:21,299
for the Fast and Slow checks the really

918
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,799
useful thing was creating minimum

919
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:24,839
assertions and then raising the bar so

920
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:26,819
like if you literally can only say all

921
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:28,319
of our apps don't have this one issue

922
00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:30,150
like that's better than what you were

923
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:32,430
yesterday even if you have like one line

924
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:35,640
that says everybody doesn't have this

925
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:37,399
problem right so deserialization we

926
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,069
don't have d serialization problems

927
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:44,520
awesome right like if you can solve that

928
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:46,490
that's fantastic and

929
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,900
I think we're right here near the end

930
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:52,049
the app portfolio this was another

931
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,490
metrics thing so this is this this would

932
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,350
be a call to somebody please fix this

933
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,540
problem for me so I don't have to this

934
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:59,190
is a really complex area how do I know

935
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,259
everything that I want and there's like

936
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:07,010
no great tool support out there for it

937
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:10,350
at least not open source and or free so

938
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:12,390
I didn't mention this sorry

939
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,470
when refreshing the SDLC we went back

940
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:17,100
through and started talking about some

941
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:19,620
things and it came up that I didn't do a

942
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,759
good job of talking about privacy in the

943
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,259
beginning I was thinking more about

944
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,660
security and privacy actually matters

945
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,030
and people people get really passionate

946
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,830
about it so it's a good place to kind of

947
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,910
get wins and get people to understand

948
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:35,340
that you care about their issues so

949
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:37,890
that's good all right so we did a lot of

950
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:42,770
compliance prep last year so that was a

951
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:42,770
lot of work okay

952
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:49,529
alright so what are we gonna do now

953
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:51,120
someone try to buzz through this stuff

954
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:53,010
we're pretty close to the end of the

955
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:57,060
yammering okay so I'm not gonna read all

956
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:59,340
these things but these are basically my

957
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,259
my longer list of lessons learned and

958
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,600
you can go read these on a slide if you

959
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,940
particularly want to just a couple of

960
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:09,299
real things I think you should say no

961
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:13,680
rarely I think dev in his talk he said

962
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,400
get to the yes right solve for yes very

963
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,710
good

964
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,480
so I think that healthy security teams

965
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,610
this is kind of the the mantra that I

966
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,170
keep hearing repeated like try to help

967
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:25,620
your development team solve the problem

968
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:27,690
don't just go in and say no right

969
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,460
because anybody can do that and it's not

970
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,470
really particularly creative not really

971
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,850
helpful and it gives you the benefit

972
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,259
that when you do actually have to say no

973
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,860
it's meaningful people know that you're

974
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:41,760
not trying to be a jerk and then knowing

975
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:43,380
that you're your you should stay humble

976
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,080
because security is not the literally

977
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,460
the only concern that everybody has and

978
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,619
then

979
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,180
one thing that was kind of caught me off

980
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,410
guard is people really like talking

981
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,328
about security because they're seeing

982
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,740
the stuff in the news now so I try to

983
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:58,049
recommend like just general life

984
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:00,508
security stuff to people so you know I

985
00:37:58,049 --> 00:38:02,400
recommend to our developers hey use

986
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:03,630
signal right like that's not a

987
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,309
particularly thing that I need to solve

988
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,779
inside my company but it does help

989
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:08,700
people have this connection to you where

990
00:38:06,779 --> 00:38:12,630
you're talking about security there's

991
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,950
lots of things in process that you can

992
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:18,720
you can get there

993
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:24,019
I would I would argue for try to do your

994
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:27,029
best to build based on data and not just

995
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:28,529
whims of your mind I actually collect

996
00:38:27,029 --> 00:38:30,029
the data that you're doing and see how

997
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:35,249
you can improve the process over time

998
00:38:30,029 --> 00:38:37,529
and then you know requirements

999
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:39,509
architecture design and code like try to

1000
00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:40,890
solve as far left as you can you have to

1001
00:38:39,509 --> 00:38:42,660
affect that stuff if you're just solving

1002
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:45,960
into the code you're done like you've

1003
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:48,598
lost for technology there's quite a lot

1004
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,819
of things and I'm not gonna run through

1005
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,499
all of them so some homework so

1006
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:55,079
everybody has stuff to do on their

1007
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:56,549
flight back go read and/or watch all of

1008
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:59,519
these things I think they're very smart

1009
00:38:56,549 --> 00:39:03,839
a lot smarter people and they said it

1010
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:05,279
way better than I will but let's see

1011
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,660
where was it this last one here an

1012
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:10,410
abling product security with culture in

1013
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:16,308
cloud a lot of similar things to what I

1014
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:18,089
said this is the team from Netflix yep

1015
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:21,960
so does everybody know what this I

1016
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:23,308
believe is yes no it's a fantastic like

1017
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,099
older series that they've kind of

1018
00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:27,720
resurrected Edward Armero it was

1019
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:29,519
basically taking famous people and

1020
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,160
asking them to do little short write-ups

1021
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,109
of things that they to their core

1022
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,019
believe and it's interesting the types

1023
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:38,880
of things that so just as a hobby it's

1024
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:40,618
something fun to do so what are the core

1025
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,269
things that I will leave about a sec I

1026
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:46,859
don't really think you can do security

1027
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:49,499
well as a run a program if you don't

1028
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:51,410
understand the language of the engineers

1029
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:54,180
that you're working with right like that

1030
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:55,410
may be blasphemous to some people but I

1031
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,210
just don't think you're gonna be

1032
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:59,940
effective if you just stand on the

1033
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:01,920
outside and say well look I can pop this

1034
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:05,640
like you have to be able to get to where

1035
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,170
they are the these are open for

1036
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:15,660
discussion from Yale by the way this is

1037
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:18,900
not you know be pushing I don't think

1038
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:20,759
that I don't think it is reasonable to

1039
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,640
expect a security team to scale with an

1040
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,260
organization effectively right we're

1041
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,730
what's the numbers one to two hundred

1042
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,140
one hundred two hundred and twenty

1043
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:29,670
something like that one scary person two

1044
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,620
hundred twenty developers across the

1045
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,150
industry and a lot of companies don't

1046
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:36,540
have security people it's zero to

1047
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:37,740
whatever that number is so moving

1048
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,930
towards the champions model I think

1049
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:42,299
makes the most sense and helps you scale

1050
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:44,250
and it helps you just like have a

1051
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,470
network that's gonna constantly bring

1052
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,910
information back to you we should spend

1053
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,799
more time on detection and response not

1054
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,450
just prevention hopefully everybody's

1055
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,170
reached this point now but we are not

1056
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,580
good enough

1057
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:55,680
to get it right the first time we're

1058
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,430
never gonna block everything and oh by

1059
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,919
the way you get a lot of good

1060
00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:01,200
intelligence by doing detection and

1061
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,620
response certain solutions actually

1062
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,149
matter more so look at those and here's

1063
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,339
a couple of examples obviously these may

1064
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,680
or may not apply in your scenario but

1065
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:12,630
there are some solutions here that exist

1066
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,890
maybe in your environment they're a

1067
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,300
little different but I think they're

1068
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:19,080
gonna matter more than other solutions

1069
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:21,810
right and you can't protect what you

1070
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:25,049
don't know about so just a little bit

1071
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:27,210
further so similar to Jeremy I'm gonna

1072
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:28,950
give a call to action so do something

1073
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:32,220
right like everybody in here is

1074
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:34,259
intelligent do something not everybody

1075
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,759
has a huge team I was an army of one for

1076
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:39,810
a while I've grown the team a little bit

1077
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,910
but not of us all have that but most are

1078
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:43,529
all of us use some sort of open source

1079
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:45,990
so you should be able to contribute back

1080
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,790
some of you can do it at work right some

1081
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:50,910
of you are doing that at work and that's

1082
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:53,330
fantastic and phenomenal awesome but

1083
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:56,700
most of us can do it from home

1084
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:58,020
there's a lot of benefits to that so in

1085
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,609
that regard this is my small

1086
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:04,580
contribution so this came from a year

1087
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:09,050
and a half ago conversation with Jim

1088
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:12,330
after JavaOne we were both like

1089
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:13,890
dog-tired and we ran into each other and

1090
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:16,049
like we're gonna go back and take a nap

1091
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:18,930
and as most conversations with Jim do

1092
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:21,570
three hours later we had this plan for

1093
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:25,589
something and I spent last year year and

1094
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:26,970
a half trying to make something work so

1095
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:31,800
you you shouldn't be able to read this

1096
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:35,580
but this is some code and so this is the

1097
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,410
fix for that code and that fix is one

1098
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:41,009
thing right so can anybody tell me what

1099
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:52,350
the wrong problem is here what's the

1100
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:56,760
problem that's right so right exactly

1101
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:59,880
so if admin equals true is not your

1102
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,680
friend right because they're in and I

1103
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,840
wrote a static analyzer where we ran it

1104
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,339
as a SAS tool we found lots of things

1105
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:09,150
with this thing and there were a lot of

1106
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:11,970
them if admin equals true so what's

1107
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:15,060
happening here is Java will treat that

1108
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:16,200
first one always evaluated the true the

1109
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,370
second one is actually the way you

1110
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,779
should have written it in the first

1111
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:26,100
place so basically in case it wasn't

1112
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:27,690
obvious sorry this was some code that I

1113
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,819
wrote and contributed that had this

1114
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:32,070
problem and this was an automated bot

1115
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:35,040
that so there's like a github plug-in

1116
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:37,230
that exists out there now that you can

1117
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,480
install on your app and it will go find

1118
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:41,520
this like one thing right this is all it

1119
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,050
does right now it's free alpha pre P

1120
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,330
alpha is there like a term for that

1121
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:47,190
element not good

1122
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:49,710
but anyway so it solves this one thing

1123
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:54,350
in an automated fashion so the basic

1124
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:56,520
idea behind mana is that you've got

1125
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:58,380
basically a platform that lets you write

1126
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,750
these little plugins and and the idea is

1127
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,400
that if you can solve one problem right

1128
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:03,660
like if I could solve this problem for

1129
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,940
the whole internet that would make me

1130
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,830
feel warm and fuzzy right so if you can

1131
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,300
solve one problem and contribute one

1132
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:12,630
plug-in think of the impact you can have

1133
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,950
right so we all I think do have

1134
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:15,870
something useful to contribute

1135
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:18,419
so there's Doc's and talks and scripts

1136
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:21,180
and code and organizational type things

1137
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:25,860
and lots of things that people are

1138
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:27,589
putting out from work so

1139
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:31,290
but I do believe that you can actually

1140
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:34,580
do something so please do something so

1141
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:37,500
this is the yeah it's there's one rule

1142
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:40,410
but it actually worked one time I'm sure

1143
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:43,290
of it because I saw it happen and when I

1144
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:45,359
typed it and like got the email on my

1145
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:47,490
phone the notification that like the PR

1146
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,380
had been submitted it was like 2:00 in

1147
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:51,299
the morning and I lost my mind I was

1148
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:56,010
dancing around upstairs was my wife up

1149
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:57,930
it wasn't it was awesome so it is hard

1150
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:00,600
to say goodbye but that's all I have so

1151
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:03,450
my favorite slide of the night do we

1152
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:14,600
have questions I grew up like in

1153
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:14,600
wrassling go away thank you yep

1154
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,420
so the question is what did I mean by

1155
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,579
application inventory but I mean by

1156
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:31,690
application inventory is I as a program

1157
00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:36,279
owner we have you know let's say 150

1158
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:39,789
developers 175 200 I don't know how many

1159
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:42,460
microservices right how do I know where

1160
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:44,319
those things are right and when you get

1161
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:47,019
to the point of somebody who had you

1162
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,720
know we were bought by Oracle when you

1163
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:52,029
get the scale of Oracle like not

1164
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:56,140
everybody has the Google mono repo right

1165
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:59,349
like people have different CI or

1166
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:01,180
different VCS systems in different

1167
00:45:59,349 --> 00:46:02,859
places that you don't know about some of

1168
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,660
them are in the clouds I'm an on-prem

1169
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:06,730
like they're all over the sink in place

1170
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:08,649
you you you have to connect to all these

1171
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,390
places just to find out what you own

1172
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:13,180
right like you

1173
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:14,319
Paley's Hughley from Adobe this was in a

1174
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,910
slightly different context that he was

1175
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,069
talking about just websites and he said

1176
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:21,609
when he wrote he took some open-source

1177
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:23,500
data and looked at how many websites

1178
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:26,890
they owned and his understanding and

1179
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:29,049
he's not on he's not an unintelligent

1180
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:30,490
person right he's very smart his and

1181
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:32,140
he's been there forever and his

1182
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:34,328
knowledge of how many websites they own

1183
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,680
more than doubled when he went out and

1184
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:37,509
started doing some research right so

1185
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,710
like he had run this program for years

1186
00:46:37,509 --> 00:46:39,880
and years and years but because of the

1187
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:42,039
acquisitions and the growth you just

1188
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:45,009
didn't know so in my specific case what

1189
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:46,839
I mean is we run a lot of code inside we

1190
00:46:45,009 --> 00:46:49,240
build a lot of applications like when a

1191
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:51,670
new application stands up your options

1192
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,500
are let people have freedom to build

1193
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:55,390
applications as they go or like send

1194
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,519
them through some onerous process to

1195
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:59,019
register an application right like and

1196
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:00,160
and those are two opposite ends of

1197
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:02,379
spectrum and there's things in the

1198
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,509
middle but if I want to give people more

1199
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,829
freedom or I have to live with it

1200
00:47:04,509 --> 00:47:07,599
because of legacy reasons how do I know

1201
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:10,359
where stuff is and how do I know how

1202
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:12,279
many applications we even have right so

1203
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:13,538
that and and then collecting metadata

1204
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:15,519
like how many records does this

1205
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:18,369
application manage what's the cost per

1206
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:20,709
record if there's a breach like you know

1207
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:22,779
all the things that you worry about and

1208
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:25,210
want to know about who do I call if like

1209
00:47:22,779 --> 00:47:28,380
this application goes down like basic

1210
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:28,380
basic info like that

1211
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:33,399
oh yeah okay

1212
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:52,270
right

1213
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,940
sure so first of all I don't come from

1214
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,310
pentest backgrounds so some of this is

1215
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,200
probably ignorant but we did have a bug

1216
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:07,220
bounty actually it was a private book

1217
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:11,240
bounty

1218
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:13,509
and I would characterize it as wildly

1219
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,069
unsuccessful maybe it's that fair

1220
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:19,310
essentially we went in and said go to

1221
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:21,910
town right and we knew a whole bunch of

1222
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:24,200
problems that we had so like the first

1223
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:25,670
week like they were out of money I

1224
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,120
wasn't there when it started by the way

1225
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:31,100
I don't think I would approved it but it

1226
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:35,870
was kind of with that idea show me

1227
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:37,460
what's out there but I think bug

1228
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:38,690
bounties are really useful but I think

1229
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,940
industry has kind of come to the

1230
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:42,920
conclusion that if you know you have a

1231
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:44,150
pile of problems starting with a bug

1232
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,540
bounty may not be the right place to

1233
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:49,610
start right like if you know you have

1234
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:51,770
these tractable things that that you're

1235
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,120
already aware of like just sticking it

1236
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:56,030
out there when you know you've got 50

1237
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:59,720
XSS that you know you can throw a rock

1238
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:01,610
and hit one unless you just say XSS

1239
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,100
doesn't pay out I don't know that you

1240
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:07,430
know so we did find some useful bugs in

1241
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:09,230
there but the scope was limited to the

1242
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:12,290
applications we knew about right there

1243
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:15,500
was no go discover our stuff but we we

1244
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:16,759
do get some nice security researchers

1245
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,380
that still find stuff for us even though

1246
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,030
we don't have a bounty anymore or its

1247
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:22,580
own Paul's for right now but I'm

1248
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:24,350
probably unqualified to document and to

1249
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:26,330
be honest and there's a lot smarter

1250
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:31,450
people that that have talked about it

1251
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:34,509
sir all right Jim's kicking me out so

1252
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:34,509
thank you
