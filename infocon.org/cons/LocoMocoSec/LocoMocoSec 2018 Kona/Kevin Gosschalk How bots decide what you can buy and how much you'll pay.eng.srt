1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,410
thank you very much so now we have a few

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,480
students in the room so I thought I

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,960
guess I would start with a bit of how I

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,809
got into this industry and kind of what

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,890
we're working on so my background is in

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,720
engineering as most of ours is slight

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,500
tweak from that I actually studied games

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,130
interactive entertainment at university

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,060
I somehow ended up working at a research

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,159
institution called the Institute of

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,980
Health and biomedical innovation in

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,809
Australia I am Australian as well and I

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,680
ended up helping them figure out a

14
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,989
technique to help map early markers and

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,809
diabetes so we actually had this camera

16
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,980
that had a 500 times magnification and

17
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,680
we were looking at the back of the eye

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,089
and there's a nerve plexus in the eye

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,399
and it turns out that if you have

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,899
diabetes the nerve plexus breaks down

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,430
but they didn't have an easy way to kind

22
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,260
of figure out how like map that scene

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,460
out so I helped them come up with a

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,750
technique to do that and I helped them

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,239
co-author a paper on that which is

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,689
completely random and completely aside

27
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,360
to it's a security of course and then

28
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,000
the next thing I did was I built out an

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,439
interactive entertainment platform for

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,780
people with intellectual disabilities

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,479
for a group in Australia there and I got

32
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,250
some government funding and a few other

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,298
things and we ended up commercializing

34
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,909
this technology it was very well

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,100
received and we actually built out a

36
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,040
system it's like a 3 by 2 meter floor

37
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,490
surface and we had a projected screen on

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,720
it and then we would use these cameras

39
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,339
and these cameras were built by a

40
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,650
company called primeSense

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,479
so what they are is their depth sensing

42
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,820
cameras so effectively they shoot out an

43
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,590
IR grid and then that information gets

44
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,329
reflected back to the computer and you

45
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,380
can use that to figure out a whole bunch

46
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:51,210
of stuff the company primeSense

47
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,890
about six months into us working on this

48
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,470
project was acquired by a company called

49
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,360
Apple and that technology is now the

50
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,350
exact camera that is used in the iPhone

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,570
10 so the technology there was also used

52
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,189
in the first Xbox Kinect so the company

53
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,648
that was bought was actually the first

54
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,560
Xbox Kinect the Xbox one came out and

55
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,180
Microsoft actually had to re-engineer

56
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,530
the depth sensing technology without

57
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,190
infringing on all the patents that now

58
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:22,830
Apple owned of course and I have a video

59
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:25,020
of what that technology looks like so as

60
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,000
these kids are moving what we actually

61
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,560
so what I actually design was the

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,150
ability to determine how far away they

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,620
were from the camera and how high they

64
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,600
were off the ground and this had

65
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,600
unlimited touch there was no concept of

66
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,950
like multi-touch or limitations and you

67
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,620
know we had a patent and a few other

68
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,739
things on this technology and

69
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,510
effectively

70
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,520
you know those twenty-something

71
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,980
educational games that we came up with

72
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,830
this is kind of the concept of dodgeball

73
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:53,310
but Dodds the bomb and if you step on a

74
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,260
bomb well it explodes and there's like

75
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,300
like a pong type style game and this is

76
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,260
all just simply using two of those

77
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,000
cameras in an array looking at different

78
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,500
signals from the machine some so I've

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,380
learnt quite a lot about image

80
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,010
recognition and machine identification

81
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,470
from from this this is kind of like that

82
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:16,769
game where yeah you know anyway I

83
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:23,640
digress so back to security so my topic

84
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:26,400
is talking about FS so there's obviously

85
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,559
we all fly I lived in Australia for most

86
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,049
of my life until recently moving to San

87
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:39,060
Francisco and oh no I think it's my leg

88
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:42,840
that's not a good sign and there's a bit

89
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,340
of an issue in this industry so this

90
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,959
isn't exactly what flying looks like

91
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,820
when I fly anymore it used to look like

92
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:53,250
this nowadays the kind of Golden Age of

93
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,650
the golden era of flying like this it's

94
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,690
kind of going right you know there's

95
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,660
super tight margins now so we pay you

96
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,340
know we pay end up paying more and we

97
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,060
end up getting a lot less I know that my

98
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,280
flights are very crammed comparatively

99
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,299
and profit margins are super thin so

100
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,370
they have to do everything in their

101
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,350
power to kind of RAM in as many people

102
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,560
as they can in these planes and go from

103
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,149
there it's a very competitive space so

104
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,519
you know there's all these kind of

105
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,260
opportunities to buy good deals and you

106
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,010
know maybe you want to fly to Beijing

107
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,080
and then

108
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,580
there's an ads like a 70-mile flats when

109
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,380
you click it and well guess what it's

110
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,930
sold out it's unfortunate so then you go

111
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,000
look on you know Skyscanner or one of

112
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,140
those other products and turns out none

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,450
of the flights are even close to the

114
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,520
price that was advertised on this ad

115
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,870
banner which is kind of curious given

116
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,349
that you know they were just advertising

117
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,510
this so air fares have kind of only been

118
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,550
going up in prices and I always miss

119
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,760
these deals I don't know about all of

120
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:58,440
you it's kind of strange so why is this

121
00:04:50,760 --> 00:05:00,810
happening well this guy the new

122
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,880
highwayman of today they no longer kind

123
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,410
of I guess playing with our credit cards

124
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,480
that they buy off the dark web well

125
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,520
they're still doing that as well but

126
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,910
they also now work for pretty major

127
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,250
companies such as competitive airlines

128
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:18,350
and effort a gregarious who have some

129
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:21,180
interesting approaches to business where

130
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,700
say I'm an airline I saw my seats for

131
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,320
$600 and the competitive airline has

132
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,640
seats on that same flight and they're

133
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,409
available for $300

134
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,990
well of course everyone's gonna go buy

135
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,520
the cheaper flights which impacts my

136
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,940
business and that's not something I want

137
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,789
so I hire old mate here to go and write

138
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,710
some software that basically limits the

139
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,980
ability for people to actually buy those

140
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,900
seats so suddenly there's 300 oval seats

141
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:49,650
they are no longer available which is

142
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,870
which is quite a problem so we have an

143
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,960
example of a company we were working

144
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:58,080
with called Hong Kong Express and they

145
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,270
had an issue where their seats for

146
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,190
vanishing right so they know this is an

147
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,039
actual airline they have pretty serious

148
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,170
costs and they had this problem with all

149
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,090
of the seats were getting blocked up and

150
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:11,730
reserved but then they were not

151
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,799
transacting and this is a core a core

152
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,360
function of you know how they sell seats

153
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,400
they basically hold the transaction

154
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:23,460
where you complete the process so what

155
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,250
was happening was BOTS were effectively

156
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:29,190
being used by competitors to go through

157
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,680
the process of booking a seat and then

158
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,660
just holding it and then that means okay

159
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,110
so now we as humans when we want to buy

160
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,730
a seat we have to go and buy the

161
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,900
better tipsy because the cheaper seats

162
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:45,260
are no longer available unfortunately

163
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,280
for us the process is pretty simple

164
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,960
really

165
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,809
so effectively the bot goes through the

166
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,729
process of checkout just like we would

167
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,410
it goes to the end there's a few ways

168
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,850
they can do it to block the seat so

169
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,350
either they can use a credit card that

170
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,390
will eventually bounce so doesn't have

171
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,790
to be a valid credit card or they can

172
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,680
use something like a PayPal type option

173
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,930
or a payment redirection method there's

174
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,300
a range of different options and what it

175
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,920
does as we've all used them you go to

176
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,260
use it it takes you off the website

177
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,730
to finish the transaction on PayPal comm

178
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,800
and that redirects you back to the

179
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,980
website to say look yep we've finished

180
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,420
the transaction but of course they're

181
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,040
not completing the transactions they're

182
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,130
just doing this and then they're doing

183
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,120
this in you know huge volumes to the

184
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,650
point where there's over a hundred

185
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,870
thousand bees operating every minute

186
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:33,650
bots just going through this process and

187
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,330
reserving these seats they do this on

188
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,310
both web they do this on mobile they do

189
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,479
in a whole different ways and they're

190
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:44,180
doing it in a pretty sophisticated

191
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:46,850
fashion so these bots have been able to

192
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:50,300
kind of bypass typical bot mitigation

193
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,860
techniques my parcel bought defenses and

194
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,620
it kind of got to the situation where

195
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,020
the airline actually couldn't pin down

196
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,510
or block the attacker so what was

197
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,770
happening was and you know effectively

198
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,780
if you go to the website when this

199
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,580
attack is ongoing you'll search and

200
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,770
nothing will be available for like 7

201
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,150
days in advance or in some cases weeks

202
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,039
in advance so they'll actually not just

203
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,929
block out the seats on one day or one

204
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,510
time or one air flight they'll actually

205
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,550
do it to every flight on every day on

206
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,200
every single time and all this is

207
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,460
happening in parallel right so they just

208
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,960
had a bot that's just able to do this

209
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,489
across the entire website and just

210
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,630
completely eliminate the airline from

211
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:28,640
how to sell things quite problematic so

212
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:33,620
how did they do this

213
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:35,150
I pees you know laughs can block by an

214
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,580
IP address this is a pretty common

215
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,169
technique this might work for kind of

216
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,640
basic attacks where someone's just

217
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,740
attacking from a certain country or a

218
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,390
certain block of IP addresses it's

219
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,340
actually pretty easy to get around IP

220
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,290
mitigation stuff I think most of us

221
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,730
would be pretty familiar with that every

222
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,260
request being made from

223
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,300
these attackers was through a proxy that

224
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,089
effectively had an unlimited number of

225
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,620
IP every single request was unique IP

226
00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:00,170
address they never reused an IP address

227
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:05,000
at all during attack so hundreds to

228
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:07,760
millions of IPs you can actually buy IP

229
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,139
addresses and pay for it in gigabytes as

230
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,730
opposed to paying for it by the number

231
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:13,459
of IPs so there's like websites you can

232
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:16,550
just go to Illuminati I oh they sell

233
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:19,099
them readily available so there's huge

234
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,959
businesses around this we actually ended

235
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,050
up tracing back a bunch of their IP

236
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,449
addresses to IOT devices so this is

237
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,649
probably familiar with the mirai botnet

238
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:29,510
which happened a couple of years ago

239
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:32,300
where effectively what someone figured

240
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:34,970
out was if we take the 60 most common

241
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,709
passwords for the default credentials is

242
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,949
like admin password or password password

243
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:42,199
or admin admin you can actually take

244
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:44,839
over IOT devices like philips light

245
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:46,370
bulbs that people have you know in their

246
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,709
house so they can change the lights when

247
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:51,829
they're at work this is the kind of

248
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:53,479
problems with the IOT space so we found

249
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:54,979
out that light bulbs will quite

250
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,970
literally attacking this website which

251
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:03,829
was interesting as a concept but that's

252
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:05,779
what was happening they the next thing

253
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:07,699
they could do is okay so let's say we

254
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:08,779
can't block them by IP sure let's block

255
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:10,099
them by something else let's use

256
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:11,600
fingerprinting techniques right so

257
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,889
fingerprinting is quite one though now

258
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,019
there's a lot of open source libraries

259
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:17,029
you can use to detect by I think of it

260
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:18,440
and this is what a typical fingerprint

261
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:20,540
looks like so it's made up of things

262
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,339
like user agent which is typically not

263
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,050
used too often because the bots will

264
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:25,670
obviously change its user agent quite

265
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,560
frequently but then there's all these

266
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:30,889
other things that people assume well

267
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,689
maybe don't assume but utilize far more

268
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:34,339
than they should things like time zone

269
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,970
the number of plugins the browser has

270
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:37,100
installed

271
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,540
like is there plug-ins there for you

272
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,620
know is this a bot does it have plugins

273
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:44,240
equal zero the language the country the

274
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,769
fonts that are installed so they'll keep

275
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,870
a hash of all your fonts and I use that

276
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:51,260
to track you you can create a pretty

277
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:53,029
pretty pretty good fingerprint hash but

278
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,310
you can also easily change that hash by

279
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:58,130
just manipulating any slash all of these

280
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,979
values like your screen resolution IU

281
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,520
iPhone and do you have touch support

282
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,810
right and do

283
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,610
you have touch support how many touch

284
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,810
IDs do you support is it ten if it's not

285
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,480
ten then you know mattering because

286
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:12,569
every iPhone supports ten and then

287
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,250
there's things like WebGL support audio

288
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,980
support all these kind of things right

289
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,960
so of course the bot was getting around

290
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,690
these detections as well by simply going

291
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,280
in and overriding what the browser said

292
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,360
it had so there's a few ways you can do

293
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,209
this

294
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,530
chromium nowadays is probably the most

295
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,210
popular way to do it which is

296
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,860
effectively just Chrome you can run it

297
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,200
completely headless now and it can run

298
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,090
JavaScript entirely runs JavaScript like

299
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,240
a real Chrome browser which is of course

300
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:41,100
the majority of the Internet's usage and

301
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,050
then you can pair it with something like

302
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,330
you know selenium or a few other tools

303
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:48,000
and you can use that to overwrite the

304
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,860
default behavior of what chromium looks

305
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,410
like so if you start trying to

306
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,840
fingerprint you know the chromium had

307
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:57,209
this browser they can actually start

308
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,470
injecting JavaScript that overwrites the

309
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,630
things you're looking to fingerprint

310
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,240
like does it have you know webdriver

311
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:05,820
equals true we can quite easily get

312
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,590
around that by injecting a prototype of

313
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,480
your the function that returns that

314
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,850
value before it even starts running the

315
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,560
code we actually found in some cases

316
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,420
that people were just custom compiling

317
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,000
their own versions of browsers because

318
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,290
chromium is open-source and would

319
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,840
actually just eliminate the Telltale's

320
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,849
that were actually built into it so that

321
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,530
makes it very difficult to even tell if

322
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,080
anything but a real legitimate Chrome

323
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:31,310
browser and then you know there was a

324
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:35,610
there was a hacker news thread of course

325
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:36,989
where someone said this was quite

326
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,060
popular on how can use it's quite

327
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:42,720
recently too well they could detect

328
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:44,339
headless Chrome because the user agent

329
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,350
was helpers chrome of course we know we

330
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,780
can change that did it have web

331
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:53,310
webdriver true well of course we can set

332
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:55,110
that to false dot chrome apparently only

333
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,030
exists in legitimate versions of Chrome

334
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,260
and of course we can set that to true in

335
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,829
this case I believe it actually is

336
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:03,569
expecting just a string but even if it's

337
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,660
an object we can actually enumerate and

338
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,520
add in values to it permissions you know

339
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,900
all of these kind of examples and get in

340
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,280
plugins equals zero and then of course

341
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,380
there was an article that said look yep

342
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,709
okay great so we can change that by

343
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,600
doing selenium change

344
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,820
have this you know change the head right

345
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,120
so now we no longer have had this in the

346
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:25,070
user-agent and then we can you know fix

347
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,680
the languages and plug an issue by just

348
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,390
simply going through and defining the

349
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,640
concept of languages and set the

350
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,050
language to whatever we want to be and

351
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,970
then likewise the same thing with

352
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,859
plugins so suddenly now this headless

353
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,880
browser is returning values that only of

354
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,660
legitimate browsers should be out

355
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:44,840
returned so that apparently fooled that

356
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,880
problem so effectively they can get

357
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,590
around detection techniques as well and

358
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,590
there's you know phantom J s is kind of

359
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,970
an older browser automated browser which

360
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,220
has a lot of other issues

361
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,440
chromium I think is significantly better

362
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,360
for attacking because it looks like a

363
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,520
real chrome it doesn't have all the the

364
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,530
quirks of what phantom J s does which

365
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,069
you know runs errors incorrectly and all

366
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,770
kinds of stuff

367
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:09,500
we've even actually found an attacker

368
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:11,090
that just used a chrome plug-in so you

369
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,830
can actually download plugins from the

370
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,900
Chrome App Store that actually scrape

371
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,850
websites and they can actually use

372
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,010
proxies so that they get around like IP

373
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,500
checks but they'll run it and manipulate

374
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,000
your browser just using a chrome plug-in

375
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,290
that you can just download so there's

376
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,830
like web scraping plugins they'd let

377
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:30,560
downloaded LinkedIn lists apparently

378
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:33,020
Google is okay with that other

379
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,420
techniques so we found that they were

380
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,740
kind of simulating the entire user

381
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,469
experience of someone that would

382
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,130
actually go through and buy a ticket by

383
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,650
seat Mirada

384
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,810
and this meant that effectively they had

385
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,860
a JavaScript running bought that would

386
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,780
go through the process of actually

387
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,700
entering text so that it appeared to be

388
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,990
human and then it would click search it

389
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,280
would wait and then it would get the

390
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,440
next page and it would fill out the

391
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,420
information and then it would wait get

392
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,340
to the next page and it did all this to

393
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,110
avoid what is effectively biometric

394
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,760
detection it's like oh it's browsing too

395
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:05,300
quickly so we can look and stop it based

396
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,040
on that you can also of course randomize

397
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:11,569
and fool these systems pretty easily as

398
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:14,150
well and in other cases we've seen the

399
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,070
ability to bypass native app device

400
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,020
checks so Google now provides a library

401
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,910
called safety net which allows you to

402
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,189
verify if a device is actually real or

403
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,069
not again Android is open source so what

404
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:27,140
people did was they wrote their own

405
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:29,360
versions of Android that said true to

406
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,730
that check but in fact we're emulations

407
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,430
and then of course the other topic is

408
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,899
capture right so you know we work in a

409
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,760
capture space and we've kind of been

410
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:39,220
looking at other players in this space

411
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,450
that were probably familiar with

412
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,029
recapture I would say is probably you

413
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:46,640
know the most used bot defense

414
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:49,220
technology in existence probably by far

415
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,769
it's used by blogs websites it's free

416
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:55,490
that helps it's typically what people

417
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:57,769
turn to for kind of mitigation the first

418
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,170
iteration of recapture as we all loved

419
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:01,940
is these text solutions where what they

420
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,410
were doing was one of the words was a

421
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,329
security word which they were generating

422
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,890
server-side which is that one with a

423
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:08,569
black dot behind it and the other word

424
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,640
was coming actually from a book or a

425
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:13,040
newspaper or something and people were

426
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,760
helping them transcribe information this

427
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,370
is the cool idea

428
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,019
very googling problem is this is a very

429
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,670
commercial problem there's huge

430
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:22,100
commercial value in being able to take

431
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:24,079
you know photo of text convert it to

432
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,760
metadata so of course what happened was

433
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:29,060
software called optical character

434
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:31,160
recognition came out and you know very

435
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,989
big companies including Google himself

436
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,300
invested a huge amount of money in

437
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,890
improving that quality of that software

438
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,529
to the point where Google actually came

439
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:41,329
out a few years ago and said they can

440
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:45,260
now solve their hardest versions of

441
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:46,880
recapture with 99.5% accuracy which of

442
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,610
course not even humans are even close to

443
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,279
we were actually told by a big a major

444
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:55,339
ticketing company that the first attempt

445
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:57,890
of these recaptures 35% of people got

446
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:00,949
wrong and this is a big big ticketing

447
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,360
platform right so they they gave up with

448
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:05,089
that they throw it out and they came out

449
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,549
with V I am NOT a robot this is check

450
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,409
box solution so what they did here and

451
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:10,760
there was a white paper a black hat a

452
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,160
couple years ago that actually explained

453
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,109
how these techniques work and to get the

454
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,350
check box they actually moved from

455
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:20,059
recapture net to Google calm on the API

456
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,549
so now they were on the route Google

457
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,959
calmed in space and they did that so

458
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:26,990
they could get access to the first party

459
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,419
cookies on google.com so effectively

460
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,710
what it turned out was that if you don't

461
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:33,320
have a cookie you get a challenge

462
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,270
because you're not even apparently if

463
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,159
you do have a cookie they check a few

464
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,929
things primarily they check one thing

465
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,400
which is the age of that cookie so that

466
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:41,780
cookie is less than nine days old

467
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,040
you'll still get a challenge but if the

468
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,020
cookie is greater than nine days old

469
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,120
they'll start giving you no challenges

470
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,460
there was actually in the paper they

471
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,530
they spun up 150,000 BOTS that went to

472
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,090
google.com grabbed a cookie and waited

473
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,740
nine days and they let them all through

474
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,629
even if they changed the IP address and

475
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:00,200
user agent from the origin of when that

476
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:03,080
cookie came out there's so so CloudFlare

477
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,150
quite famously use this against people

478
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,470
using tor browser I'm sure some of us

479
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,660
have used 12 browser and I've come

480
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,550
across across this situation there's a

481
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,730
plug-in for 12 browser called cloud hole

482
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:15,500
which swaps google.com cookies between

483
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,330
people so that they can basically brute

484
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,240
force and get around having to solve the

485
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:23,540
visual challenge but more interestingly

486
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,640
is the the challenge itself so once

487
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,930
again Google kind of came about this

488
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,340
from the approach of how do we get

489
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,110
people to help us do something at

490
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,550
massive scale is really valuable to us

491
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,770
but we can potentially use for a

492
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,270
security challenge so I mean we've all

493
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,410
seen them so in this case it's select

494
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,220
all the images would pick up trucks

495
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:41,300
maybe you've seen street sign versions

496
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,590
but again this is a commercial problem

497
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,690
right so there's readily available

498
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,850
software and huge companies working on

499
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,130
the problem on the concept of how do we

500
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,810
take a photo and figure out from that

501
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,010
photo what's the information inside it

502
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,720
look at the upload an image to Facebook

503
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,280
I think most of us start doing that

504
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,170
nowadays but if you upload an image to

505
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,520
Facebook and say the Eiffel Tower is in

506
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,630
the background it knows you're at the

507
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,930
Eiffel Tower without even you have an

508
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:04,280
associate location data that same

509
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,620
software can be used to completely

510
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,510
bypass reCAPTCHA because of course

511
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,399
they're just photos so we used Amazon

512
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,590
recognition for this example where you

513
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,600
can just scrape the photos base64 encode

514
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,129
them send them to the API it returns to

515
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,610
you a list of labels and a nice JSON

516
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:23,030
formatted formation and you can get

517
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:24,530
through it there's also of course the

518
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:28,010
more nefarious people on the internet

519
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:30,410
who you know commercializing the concept

520
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,660
of bypassing this technology so there's

521
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:36,710
a product called X evil it's a Russian

522
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:38,270
piece of software of course that breaks

523
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:42,230
captures so it's a spammer tool it's

524
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:44,810
$400 it's not too much you can solve

525
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,760
arithmetic which is great struggle with

526
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,409
that noise unlimited noise whatever that

527
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,240
means

528
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:54,440
it's fonts unlimited that's great

529
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,450
awesome and it is backed by the most

530
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,820
state-of-the-art neural network

531
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:02,300
mmm interesting so what does this mean

532
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,460
so we got this software and we points it

533
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,379
at a reCAPTCHA and we spun up a whole

534
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,820
bunch of instances and it doesn't

535
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,350
connect to the internet at all so this

536
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,389
is just a piece of software that runs

537
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,949
locally so there's no like call out to

538
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,290
like you know human solving sweatshops

539
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:19,580
or any of that sort of stuff which is

540
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:22,280
another thing and what it does is it has

541
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,510
a pre trained library of what all the

542
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,850
different questions re-captured

543
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:30,350
challenges you with and it can just go

544
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:33,080
through and solve them completely

545
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:34,969
offline completely unassisted and this

546
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,939
is only $400 and it has a greater than

547
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,890
95% solve rate from what we found they

548
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:44,870
add they advertise 90 to 100% so that

549
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:46,340
seemed about correct which this probably

550
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:50,600
should give you some good examples as to

551
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:53,919
why I of course BOTS can get around this

552
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,919
technology as well it's enough of that

553
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:04,250
all right so and then of course you know

554
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,510
we've we were all kind of familiar with

555
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,920
a high level of each of these things

556
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,540
people have done entire talks too

557
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,660
dedicated to each of those one topics

558
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:13,010
I'm just giving a high-level example you

559
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,020
know we've we've heard about this

560
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:17,650
concept of you know someone taking

561
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,700
inventory from a website using software

562
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,950
probably in different verticals more

563
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,809
often than is right so the ticketing

564
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,370
space is quite famous for this problem

565
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:27,260
where people are using BOTS to buy

566
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:29,149
tickets and then resell a month party

567
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,000
websites we were actually told by a

568
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:34,940
major ticketing reselling company sorry

569
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,100
no no reselling a first party ticketing

570
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,660
company but if they eliminated bots it

571
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,919
would go from three minutes to selling

572
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,420
out to six hours

573
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,160
it was just humans buying those tickets

574
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,750
so it's crazy right I mean that's how

575
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,360
fast bots are basically just getting in

576
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,550
there and doing it and so why are they

577
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,050
doing that well because they can make

578
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:55,580
quite a lot of money by marking up the

579
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:56,870
prices right there's once again readily

580
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,620
available software that you can go and

581
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:02,419
buy $900 this one $990 is a bit more

582
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,500
expensive than the CAPTCHAs holding

583
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,120
service but Ursula has captured

584
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,670
capabilities built-in so maybe that's

585
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,409
why but effectively what you do is you

586
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,000
tell it what tickets you want to buy and

587
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,620
from which member you would like to

588
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,900
purchase them from they support all the

589
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:18,620
major leading platforms and they have

590
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:20,450
great support I've been told as well but

591
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,189
effectively they then go through and it

592
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,050
looks terrible ugly software but it

593
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,580
works and it does effectively the same

594
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,500
technique so it goes through and

595
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:31,280
emulates what a real humans should do

596
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,840
and you can you can even buy it so that

597
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,790
they sell posts on their infrastructure

598
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,139
so you can just pay for like

599
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,850
infrastructure as opposed to buying the

600
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:41,059
software directly some interesting

601
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,439
business models and then you know

602
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,120
there's a whole bunch of other different

603
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,920
use cases that we also know about right

604
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,559
so ecommerce and if you try to buy the

605
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,120
the nests or the steps at some point

606
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,300
recently that was also bought out

607
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,620
entirely by bots Thanks shoes yep we'll

608
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,230
talk about that in a second and gift

609
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,659
cards are interesting as well so I found

610
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,900
this script on paste bin the best place

611
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:05,030
to find vulnerabilities and it's very

612
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,550
sophisticated this is this actually

613
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:11,290
works on leading

614
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:13,850
retool our website I won't say who and

615
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,040
effectively all it does is it literally

616
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,230
brute forces their gift card like check

617
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,730
balance process it's very simple right I

618
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,710
mean that's just that's all it does but

619
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,150
of course this is powered by a bot that

620
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,640
does all those other things right so it

621
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,960
skips fingerprints has unique IDs but

622
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,360
then they've just got this at the front

623
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,179
and it's just brute forcing the the

624
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,010
checking of and takes a long time

625
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:39,050
granted but you know if you can get one

626
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:41,210
you get $500 $50 $100 and typically what

627
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,200
retailers do is they have the cards when

628
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,460
they're sitting on the shelf

629
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,870
they don't activate it so that's why you

630
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,790
have to activate them when they're

631
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,739
activated and until someone spends it

632
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,570
you can actually check the gift balance

633
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,710
and if it comes back saying yes there's

634
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,240
a gift balance well guess what you've

635
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:57,559
got a valid gift card and you can use

636
00:23:53,240 --> 00:24:01,910
that to go buy something so that's a

637
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:08,330
problem sneaker BOTS so there's a video

638
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:09,890
for this but there's a a bot and they

639
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:14,620
made a video to demonstrate how it works

640
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:16,730
and it's actually yeah so it's actually

641
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:19,219
Kanye West who made this software

642
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,910
apparently and he helps the the hacker

643
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,620
and the hoodie to go on his journey of

644
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:28,100
buying shoes problem is you know he is

645
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:30,439
this innocent child is going a lining up

646
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,570
as we all do and you know you can never

647
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,030
buy the shoes it's really upsetting so

648
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,889
the kid then tries to you know try and

649
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:39,470
hack through it was very violent sorry

650
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:41,480
he then tries to hack the website by

651
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,710
using multiple computers at once I'm

652
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,300
sure we've all done this with tickets

653
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,679
when we try and buy them right I was

654
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:49,040
like oh that's not working either the

655
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,630
inventory sold out or no forbidden and

656
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:55,000
Kanye West comes to save the day which

657
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:58,460
is great and there's a piece of software

658
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,900
this is too long anyway eventually the

659
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,530
moral of the story is if you cheat you

660
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,530
can get the shoes

661
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:08,380
this is this is the software yeah they

662
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:11,500
said don't don't pay inflated resold

663
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:13,809
prices guess what all their customers do

664
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,990
with the software they buy shoes and

665
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:18,370
then resell them that's fine now they

666
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,779
don't have any issues with this they

667
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:23,889
even have a term for it's called copping

668
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:25,659
apparently I learned so much ten

669
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,679
thousand testimonials there's all kinds

670
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:29,919
of cool stuff you can find on the

671
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:31,990
Internet they actually have an

672
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,179
estimation of the resale value of their

673
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,200
shoes because they know the markup price

674
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:36,250
even though they're saying oh you don't

675
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,630
have to worry about that you won't get

676
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,890
resold shoes you can afford the legit

677
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,840
ones because you use our software it

678
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:44,289
bypasses all these different websites

679
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,840
like Nike right and as you can see this

680
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:47,980
one person who couldn't get his one pair

681
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,600
of shoes at the store ended up buying

682
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,850
you know like twelve or whatever so he

683
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,389
thing can resell them for instead of two

684
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,340
hundred bucks

685
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,539
try a thousand right so there's huge

686
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,399
markups they make on these because

687
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:58,000
they're limited edition and everyone

688
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:59,379
goes nuts

689
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,880
this software's only three hundred

690
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,039
twenty-five dollars so that's actually a

691
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,190
pretty good investment may have forty

692
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,200
five specialists constantly updating

693
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,940
this software it's a lot of a lot of

694
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,950
people that you have to somehow figure

695
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,210
out how to write software that they

696
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,830
can't reverse engineer which is

697
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,169
significantly easier than writing sets

698
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:20,470
up where to block them right so that's a

699
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:23,730
problem Pokemon go we're all familiar

700
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:26,409
with Pokemon go I think this game

701
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:28,000
Biodesign is actually super flawed to

702
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:30,159
stop cheaters because it actually trusts

703
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,720
client-side information and obviously as

704
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,570
we've learned earlier today doing that

705
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,909
is a bad thing they trust GPS data

706
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,590
coming from the end user they trust

707
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:40,899
where the users clicking and interacting

708
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:43,270
with the UI you know typical game like

709
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:45,279
an MMO all of that information all done

710
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,720
server-side or in the case of Pokemon go

711
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,970
they decide it will trust the client

712
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,270
what could go wrong the first person to

713
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:54,010
level forty was about so that's great

714
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:56,559
there's a there's a a pretty big

715
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,908
subreddit called Pokemon go dev I think

716
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,080
where they're effectively just going

717
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:00,760
through I'm figuring out every time they

718
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,029
release a patch how to reverse engineer

719
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:06,399
the patch so their BOTS can still work

720
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:08,500
the most popular repo that I could find

721
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:10,899
had 300 plus contributors that were

722
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:14,500
helping them improve the software aka

723
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:16,350
break Pokemon go and I think a big issue

724
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,760
as to why people gave up is because they

725
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,199
couldn't win in the gym medals because

726
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,910
well guess what all the people that are

727
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,309
one of the gyms of bots that are playing

728
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,970
like 24/7 around the clock and they're

729
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:29,460
just high-level better items bla bla bla

730
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:30,809
we actually found this was actually

731
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,460
quite interesting so the attackers here

732
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:34,710
are so motivated because well game is

733
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,780
game as a motivated people less

734
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:39,600
nefarious than buying shoes and tickets

735
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,559
maybe that they actually were the ones

736
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,240
what we found

737
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:47,730
they were bypassing safety net by

738
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,110
writing their own versions of Android so

739
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:51,690
that it basically looked like it was

740
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:53,428
real Android and well no it wasn't it

741
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,900
was a bought because they came out

742
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:57,059
Google came out and said look we've

743
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,159
solved this problem we can check every

744
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:01,860
phone we can see we can confirm if an

745
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,210
Android phone is a real phone or an

746
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,289
emulated a piece of software and if it's

747
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,299
a real phone of course you know you

748
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:09,450
can't really scale very effectively to

749
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:13,470
write software on it but that was within

750
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:15,270
a month broken and then one other topic

751
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:19,530
I wanted to bring up which kind of

752
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:21,360
creeped me out was people using the

753
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,129
deceased registry you can actually get

754
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,229
access to it there's a I think it's

755
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,580
called master def file or something I

756
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:28,799
don't know that's kind of a weird name

757
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,559
for it it's actually a government thing

758
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,240
that everyone that has a social security

759
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,158
number which is most Americans I don't

760
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,070
thankfully I'm not an American so I'm

761
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:40,890
safe everyone that dies actually is

762
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:42,539
listed in that record and it was

763
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,010
actually leaked a couple of years ago so

764
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:46,190
there was a leaked list of everyone

765
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,390
that's dead which is a bit morbid and

766
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,620
the other way you can get access to the

767
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,820
information is if you know people's

768
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,500
social security numbers

769
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:57,899
that'd be interesting if that

770
00:28:52,500 --> 00:29:01,620
information ever leaked Equifax so

771
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:04,100
someone on Twitter posted about the net

772
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:07,860
neutrality net neutrality issue that

773
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:09,840
happened and effectively they found out

774
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,209
their mother who died a few years ago

775
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,000
she should be in 71 she made a few

776
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,520
comments pro net neutrality which is

777
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,570
interesting considering she was dead so

778
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,520
what they were doing is they're actually

779
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,439
scraping the lists of the deceased and

780
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,600
then they were using that list to then

781
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,870
write software that would then go and

782
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,699
write and comment and positively in

783
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,939
favor of net neutrality in all the

784
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,629
different

785
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:35,789
States so that's probably something that

786
00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:37,500
people haven't heard about much but that

787
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:38,730
happens as well and then you know

788
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,419
there's a whole range of other more

789
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:44,309
commonly known situations like we all

790
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:46,950
know about that fake accounts fake

791
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:48,960
ratings perspective in the case of you

792
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,669
know ticketing website or reach how it

793
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,470
is selling shoes I'm not really that

794
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:54,720
motivated to stop the attackers because

795
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,919
they still make their money there's

796
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,149
actually quite a lot of government

797
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,590
legislation that's now coming in and

798
00:29:57,149 --> 00:30:00,059
starting to mandate that they put a bit

799
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:02,908
of effort into it and then the other

800
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:04,769
thing is you know if you have BOTS

801
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:08,279
creating accounts and if you're a big

802
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:10,259
website and your shareholders are like

803
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:12,149
well your growth is great well guess

804
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:17,100
what that growth is probably largely

805
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:19,739
BOTS in a lot of cases it's a lot so if

806
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,969
they suddenly stop the bots well that

807
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,350
growth numbers gonna go down that's not

808
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,120
gonna look good so there's some weird

809
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:26,009
conflicts of interest on the defenders

810
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,199
side in some cases other cases is very

811
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:30,029
clear if you're an airline or you know

812
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,220
gift cards where it's actual fraud and

813
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:34,049
you're losing a LeMat they're very

814
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:37,980
motivated to put effort into preventing

815
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:39,299
that and you know of course how do we

816
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,600
solve these problems if it's impossible

817
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:45,090
to well you focus it's dead-on instead

818
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,799
on assuming you can verify that it's a

819
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:49,529
human or not focus on things that the

820
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,480
bots can't get around or can't fake like

821
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:53,250
you know limiting things like payment

822
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,960
redirection options or don't give them a

823
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:58,289
timeout in some cases under high volumes

824
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,210
of attacks you could perhaps do it by a

825
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,679
user account ID something that they have

826
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,179
to log into and create maybe it has to

827
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,389
be linked to a credit card or something

828
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:08,669
like that instead obviously a PayPal ID

829
00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:10,049
would make more sense so each user email

830
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:12,059
has a list of and of course you can buy

831
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:16,590
them on the dock web too so yeah it's

832
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:18,899
kind of kind of questionable limiting by

833
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,519
concurrent sessions by IP I mean it can

834
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:22,350
work if the attack is basic and

835
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,850
simplistic it'll be effective but you

836
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:26,250
know if it's a major sophisticated

837
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,620
attack not so much and then the other

838
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,799
thing you can do is design systems to be

839
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,820
anti friendly to bots so I think

840
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,250
something like snapchat is a good

841
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,720
example where you can't really use a bot

842
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,129
to go in and do much damage

843
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,600
you can't chat to other people unless

844
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:42,870
you add them in and they have to accept

845
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,010
you it's kind of designed to be

846
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,500
something that doesn't really work very

847
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:48,780
effectively for a bot unlike something

848
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,400
like you know aim which you could just

849
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,200
spam anyone you wanted which of course

850
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,000
was then a huge target for BOTS and then

851
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,130
everyone left name because you'd have an

852
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,590
account you just get spammed so that is

853
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:03,720
the end of my topic happy to answer any

854
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:05,399
questions also we brought Tim Tams from

855
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,380
Australia so highly recommend you have

856
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,830
one there not a biscuit and there not a

857
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,220
cookie

858
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:12,720
they're kind of like a wafer thing good

859
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,360
cat maybe it's kind of hard to describe

860
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,830
because we don't have the term biscuit

861
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,320
we call them scones and Australia it's

862
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:26,270
very confusing and we also brought

863
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:26,270
Vegemite anyone have any questions

864
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:40,550
of course it's illegal but you can't

865
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,780
determine who's attacking you right if

866
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,970
they do their job correctly it's

867
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:46,520
impossible to trace back we see the

868
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:50,000
issue largely in the Asian region more

869
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,680
than the US region Richard Branson at

870
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,600
one point mentioned that some of his

871
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,670
competitors were doing things in line of

872
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,909
what I described as well so we know it

873
00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:00,140
happens in like the UK but you know what

874
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,460
can you do if you can't find the

875
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,260
attacker I mean that would be great

876
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,790
but like you know ticketing websites

877
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,140
aren't shutting down ticketing attacks

878
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,520
because guess what they can't sue people

879
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,940
that they don't know who really is doing

880
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,940
the attacks

881
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,810
this is this is a fair comment but I

882
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:31,780
don't work at Google so no unfortunately

883
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:32,860
I don't know yep I'm sure there's

884
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:42,250
alternatives out there if you search

885
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:46,679
there uh we can talk about that after if

886
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:48,980
you would like okay any other questions

887
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:57,809
nope okay all right thanks everyone

888
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:57,809
[Applause]
