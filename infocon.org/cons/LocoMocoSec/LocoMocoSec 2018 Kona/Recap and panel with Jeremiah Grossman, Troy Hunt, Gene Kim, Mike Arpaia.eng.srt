1
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:10,920
all right how's everybody feeling today

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,990
awesome excellent so if you like to hear

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,340
I like I think this might be my first

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,839
security conference ever where I can

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,060
wear like jeans and a t-shirt and I feel

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,470
comfortable it's gonna night you usually

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,090
have to wear like a suit and things like

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,640
that and look respectable and

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,140
presentable but this is loco moco sec

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,390
where we get to do it our way we get to

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,340
learn stuff and we get to interact with

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,890
really cool people who are clearly

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,750
passionate about what they do and we've

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,969
had a lot of good content on a fantastic

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,530
speakers throughout the day and what I

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,950
want what we wanted to do for this

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,480
particular panel and it's given

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,860
opportunity because these gentlemen here

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,110
and I'll introduce them briefly have

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,860
done some amazing work in their careers

21
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,480
and it's work that's worth diving into a

22
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,100
little bit that we can get some lessons

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,828
learned and gives you an opportunity to

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,050
peer more into like what motivated them

25
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,989
what challenges there they are they ran

26
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,419
into and and really learn from these

27
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,459
guys so I've been fortunate enough to

28
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,500
done some cool things here but I've also

29
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,669
looked up to these guys a lot because

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,010
they've done some really amazing things

31
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,930
and to put a lot of software time into

32
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:17,549
the world so what we who we have here is

33
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:20,880
Jean Kim Jim Kim is career goes way way

34
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,830
back probably predates even mine Jean

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,960
Kim was the primary developer and

36
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,789
creator of tripwire for those that don't

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,350
know tripwire so imagine that we get to

38
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,570
have Jean Kim on stage and is also a

39
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,158
published author we'll give them an

40
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,869
opportunity to go dive more into about

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,409
what tripwire is does and everything

42
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,110
like that

43
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,689
we have Troy hunt who is a very famous

44
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,520
have I been poned a web site and all the

45
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,779
other cool I'm forgetting the name of

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:54,929
the platform patrons plural site there

49
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,059
we go all the content on Pluralsight

50
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,240
sorry yeah you know you kind of educate

51
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,369
everybody in AB SEC and we have mark our

presentation on Oscar II so on that's

54
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,060
all gonna say for the moment I'll ask

55
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,609
these guys some questions but if I guess

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,550
Troy you get the mic please tell us

57
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,880
exactly

58
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,490
what happened pwned is and like why you

59
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,920
started it alright so my my elevator

60
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,080
pitch so have I been pounds a data

61
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,790
breach aggregation platform so when

62
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,480
there's a data breach like I mentioned

63
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,640
this morning

64
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,489
LinkedIn Dropbox Ashley Madison and

65
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,640
about our 270 others when the data is

66
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,290
distributed publicly I locate it very

67
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,269
often through sources that provide it

68
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,890
because they support the project hey

69
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,690
Greg ate it so I extract the email

70
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,250
addresses out of it it all goes up

71
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,560
online into a whole bunch of cloud

72
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,390
storage magic and people can then come

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,400
along search it and say where was I

74
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,410
exposed and there's about just under

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,500
five billion separate accounts in the

76
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,500
system at the moment that the thing got

77
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:01,960
so I call it accounts in so far as I

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,299
have personally twelve accounts now with

79
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,630
that one email address it's been in 12

80
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,240
different breaches not Ashley Madison so

81
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,859
it's been on a bunch of different places

82
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,210
and then I guess there's a whole bunch

83
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,340
of other stuff it does but in terms of

84
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,500
scale it's it's anywhere from a hundred

85
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,750
thousand people a day through to I

86
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:23,020
looked at today and I 111,000 the last

87
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:33,040
six hours so is very surprisingly

88
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:37,750
popular yeah G cool yeah my name is Mike

89
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,630
not Marc but it's actually more common

90
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,610
than you would expect

91
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,430
so OS curry if you saw the talk earlier

92
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:48,610
if not queries and operating system

93
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,680
instrumentation tool and it allows you

94
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,239
to articulate facts about operating

95
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,180
systems and sequel and then use that

96
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,030
concept to generate interesting logs

97
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,459
about your environments on that one why

98
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,070
that problem like why did that problem

99
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,450
need to be solved operating system

100
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,430
intrusion detection yeah why did Oscar a

101
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,799
need to be built like what why did like

102
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,959
yeah so I mean I've been working on host

103
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,190
intrusion detection for a bit and OS

104
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,380
Cori specifically I went to Facebook and

105
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:19,010
Facebook had like not-so-great intrusion

106
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,380
detection on Mac

107
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,599
like nothing in production so we really

108
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,330
wanted to improve intrusion detection on

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,820
Mac OS as well as add it in production

110
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,950
and we looked around and trying to use a

111
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,700
lot of existing tools like OS second

112
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:36,110
tripwire and Google Gore and stuff like

113
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,640
that and none of them like checked all

114
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,620
the boxes that we need and I kind of

115
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,770
articulated what those boxes were in the

116
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:49,730
original talk when we open sourced it at

117
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:53,599
security scale and 2014 yeah by the way

118
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:55,070
I loved that last talk on CAPTCHAs and I

119
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,080
just loved the background of like how he

120
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,270
got there and I just I think what I

121
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,409
would love I mean I have a I have three

122
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,330
kids I have a ten-year-old and to

123
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,980
eight-year-olds and and I want them to

124
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,409
see that talk because yeah the

125
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,000
serendipitous journey like what it takes

126
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,370
to get dragged into interesting problems

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,110
so I guess my equivalent would be I was

128
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:17,720
a I was in a science fair in high school

129
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,580
and I got picked up to join Sun

130
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,650
Microsystems in 1986 so as a sophomore

131
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,659
in high school I get to work halftime as

132
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:28,429
a filesystem QA engineer and a system

133
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:29,990
administrator and that eventually it was

134
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,480
around the time of the Internet Morris

135
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,710
worm and so I was reading all the papers

136
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,330
on it and the name that kept on coming

137
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,430
up over and over again was gene Stafford

138
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,620
at Purdue University so I knew I wanted

139
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,870
to go there but turned out it was the

140
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,210
only college I was accepted to but I

141
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,710
wish I had known where Purdue University

142
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,830
was because it's in the cornfields of

143
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,299
Indiana and I think had I known exactly

144
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,919
what I was signing up for maybe I

145
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,910
wouldn't have gone to produce but anyway

146
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,770
it turned out to be the best thing for

147
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,290
me and so that that was something I

148
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:02,450
wrote as a undergraduate independent

149
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:04,490
study project in 91 and after I got

150
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,159
fired for the from the pretty University

151
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,110
computing Center I needed a job and so I

152
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,000
ended up working for a Spafford as an

153
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,220
undergraduate student and that why'd it

154
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,500
became one was widely security tools for

155
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:21,760
UNIX and the other thing I'll share mine

156
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,100
in my 13 years of trip are from 97 to

157
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,570
2010 I mean it was so fun because where

158
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,130
I got to start this kind of study of

159
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,840
high performers and and so I'm so

160
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,100
grateful for the trip our experience and

161
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,419
how it allowed me to actually do this

162
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,400
thing kind of on the side

163
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:36,979
for commercial purposes but you know

164
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,690
it's certainly been my every passion you

165
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,120
know long since if left tripwire

166
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,500
so why tripwire why didn't at the least

167
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,880
at the time why did that need to be

168
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,230
solved what was that era oh yeah oh so

169
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,060
the Morris worm right the big problem

170
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:51,590
was it's amazing to think about the

171
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:53,270
statistics I think I have this right the

172
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,760
internet Morris worm was the first

173
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:59,030
widespread you know thing of malware

174
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,400
where 6000 servers were taken down 6000

175
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,630
that was the hen percent of all and

176
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,219
that's actually a huge number because

177
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:08,630
that was a sin of all the servers on

178
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:10,010
line number Z or does magnitude higher

179
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,930
and so the big problem was like why'd it

180
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,520
take so much effort to detect and

181
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:19,669
correct for the problem right for all

182
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:21,109
these files that were changed all right

183
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:25,280
so let's let's start with some of the

184
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:27,740
more easy ones are you some like these

185
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,419
are all very successful projects did you

186
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,430
have any idea that they're gonna be this

187
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:32,900
successful when you started is this what

188
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:39,650
you imagined they would be or is it

189
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:42,109
mostly like for you no I mean for me

190
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,210
with ever been poned like my when I

191
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,770
started out I had downtime when I was

192
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,440
traveling for work and I just remember

193
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,419
like I had a couple of evenings free in

194
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,350
a hotel room in the Philippines and I

195
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:53,539
was like oh this would be a good idea

196
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,310
you know like I'll give this a go and in

197
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,830
fact my motivation for hello in pound

198
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,390
was was partly because I was seeing some

199
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,250
really interesting behaviors in terms of

200
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,289
account reuse so I was analyzing data

201
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,760
breaches and going hey look at this so

202
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,380
this guy has the same password on this

203
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,080
site in that site wow that's amazing

204
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,760
isn't this interesting I wonder if these

205
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,469
people know that they've been in

206
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,020
multiple data breaches and this was like

207
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:17,330
half my motivation and then the other

208
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,530
half of the motivation was I really want

209
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,120
to play with some cool as your

210
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:23,599
technology and build some stuff on the

211
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,250
cloud this seems like a good excuse this

212
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,250
was just like scratching the geek itch

213
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,410
and you know to this day like a big part

214
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,479
of what I enjoy doing about it is doing

215
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:35,150
things like building it to the scale

216
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,010
it's at today for a cost of a couple of

217
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:40,699
cups of coffee a day like this is kind

218
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:43,968
of the the geeky fun objective so that

219
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,750
was always my goal and then and I almost

220
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,250
wonder if the success of it as part

221
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,200
because that was the only goal that

222
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,280
wasn't like how can I go out and make

223
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,960
something that would just make a

224
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,339
shitload of money and I will do that

225
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,510
from day one I don't think it would have

226
00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:00,750
done what it's done if that was the

227
00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:04,500
objective so I am surprised jean-marc

228
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:07,980
same question yeah so OS query actually

229
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,420
wasn't the first post intrusion

230
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,950
detection system that I wrote an open

231
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,099
sourced and the first one was like

232
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:17,130
miserably unsuccessful so I definitely

233
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,050
like had higher expectations for I

234
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:23,100
worried but it is like OS queries now

235
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,599
the most starred security software on

236
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,540
all of github you know for whatever that

237
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,370
metric is worth and yeah I mean it

238
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:35,010
totally is outpace my expectations for

239
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:38,460
sure you know I think the advice I would

240
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:40,170
give my kids right is that early in

241
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,090
one's career right one doesn't actually

242
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,560
have a worthy problem I write this up

243
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:47,130
maybe I'm the exception

244
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,300
right but that means like so the short

245
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,620
of not having an exciting project to

246
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,089
work on do you go work for someone who

247
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,550
actually does have an exciting project

248
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:55,080
work on and you know it's amazing when

249
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,329
you can get that sort of overlap of you

250
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,630
know someone needs tenure which is

251
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:05,660
actually reliant upon you know a ton of

252
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:08,730
motivated desperate graduate students

253
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:13,770
and I think it what has changed right is

254
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:15,540
that what it takes so technology enables

255
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,310
to build so much as so little these days

256
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,560
right I mean it's just you can get

257
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,449
something spun up in Heroku and you know

258
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,400
a couple minutes wears you know to do

259
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,530
anything of scale before you even you

260
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,819
know 20 years ago was like a substantial

261
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,740
effort you actually did need millions of

262
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:33,440
dollars just to get engineers let alone

263
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:37,850
you know to actually ship something but

264
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:41,570
anyway it sure is easy these days

265
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:43,920
something I'm just constantly in awe of

266
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,510
this question here so you know a lot of

267
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,250
us are going to try to you know probably

268
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,630
some of the people in the honest you are

269
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,130
going to try to build you know whether

270
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,560
they know it or not you know large scale

271
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,820
projects that might be wildly successful

272
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,119
when they end when they encounter those

273
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,990
efforts in contexts of yours what what

274
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,000
if anything surprised you

275
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,620
you would not have expected at the start

276
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,230
like what was the most surprising thing

277
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,959
you ran into that you like you know what

278
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:10,440
good matter otherwise I'll surprise I

279
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,439
was popular

280
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,950
honestly late to this day that that kind

281
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,910
of surprised me you know my motives

282
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,350
might have been a little bit different

283
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,180
as well I think like I said if I had a

284
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,470
set out with the commercial objective

285
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,109
and I had have done any sort of

286
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,630
objective kind of analysis of who would

287
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,120
use this maybe maybe I wouldn't be but

288
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,680
for me I was just surprised at the

289
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,330
adoption rate I think like I said before

290
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,420
it was largely due to the fact that was

291
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,860
available for free as I touched on the

292
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,410
keynote as well one of the things that

293
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,020
sort of surprised me is using the word

294
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:44,370
pwned which is I'm sure some people

295
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,720
probably hate it but using that scene to

296
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,520
generate a sense of interest in

297
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,500
curiosity that I never would have had

298
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,970
before and I never called it that

299
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,110
because of that frankly one of the

300
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,899
reasons I called it that is because I

301
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:58,330
could get the domain name and I could

302
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:01,660
get like the dot-com version that I you

303
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:03,370
so you know that sort of a couple of the

304
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,050
things I think that stick out in the

305
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,670
front of my mind about surprising and

306
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,959
probably the only other thing and this

307
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,089
sort of goes to the point about how much

308
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:12,699
you can do on cloud today I'm surprised

309
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:14,980
that I've been able to build something

310
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,660
of the scale that it is without actually

311
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,220
having to spend a lot of money like it

312
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,680
is literally still in the hundreds of

313
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:24,690
dollars a month to support that at scale

314
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,689
and that's I think that's pretty insane

315
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,690
what's what surprised you about the

316
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,700
project something that yeah you wouldn't

317
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:35,020
expect it at the start other than like

318
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:37,060
it became popular something that was

319
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,279
surprising I think so like I said when I

320
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,689
worked at at sea I worked on this host

321
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,850
intrusion detection system which we

322
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,680
actually internally called chip yarn so

323
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,649
it's super funny too you know at seize a

324
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,209
crafts I yarn should be on ship wire so

325
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:53,110
it's super funny to be on Sage regime

326
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:54,910
but when we open sourced when we open

327
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,709
sourced rip yarn we called it Midas Mac

328
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,120
intrusion detection analysis system

329
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:01,569
which you know best part was the name

330
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,730
and we didn't think we liked the way

331
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,890
that this piece of software was extended

332
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,810
was via modules and you know these

333
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,970
modules were in Python and we had a

334
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,800
bunch of them at Etsy

335
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,180
and we didn't open-source them because

336
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,430
that was our like you know hashtag

337
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,888
special sauce when we open source it it

338
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,969
was not it was not very popular because

339
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:20,399
it would there was no way that

340
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,350
organizations could take this platform

341
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,930
and use it and like immediately get

342
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,819
value and I guess that like shouldn't

343
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,290
have been surprising but it was pretty

344
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:32,128
surprising to me because like I thought

345
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,930
the platform was like sufficient for

346
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:36,180
people to kind of start building their

347
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,888
own thing but that was definitely

348
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,300
something that we really tried to

349
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:42,000
address with those query that really

350
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,089
made it successful was that you know by

351
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,379
using sequel to articulate facts about

352
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:47,910
operating systems that you want to

353
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:50,009
instrument it allowed us like we can

354
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:53,009
give away all of the tables we can give

355
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:54,660
away all of the I would say like we were

356
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,790
able to give away the answers to the

357
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,889
questions without giving away the

358
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:02,550
questions that we were asking so because

359
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:04,769
OS query has a launch D table on Mac OS

360
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:08,160
doesn't tell you anything about the like

361
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:10,079
how Facebook analyzes launch D data it

362
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,449
just gives you the raw capability so

363
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,149
kind of like decoupling OPSEC from

364
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:16,620
capability and still producing a

365
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:19,139
valuable piece of open source security

366
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,000
software that like coming to that

367
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,740
conclusion was like initially surprising

368
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,370
but like in retrospect it seems somewhat

369
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:29,009
obvious yeah I would actually like

370
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:31,680
fences my biggest learning you know when

371
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:33,809
I was at triple for 13 years in some

372
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,309
ways biggest embarrassment is the fact I

373
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:38,610
got kind of further and further away

374
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:41,819
from the technology and into operations

375
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:44,220
listen to ITIL across population studies

376
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:48,089
you know compliance you know how you

377
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:50,819
build compliance requirements and you

378
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:53,160
know I thought it was and so that meant

379
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:55,410
that like my last bit of production code

380
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,379
contribution was probably around 2010

381
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:00,480
yeah in my head that made total sense I

382
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:03,360
thought that was my highest best use of

383
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,709
me but I think what my learning was and

384
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,139
hopefully should be relevant to every

385
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:09,388
person in information security is that

386
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,980
you know to do great things you know

387
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:13,730
reliant on technology you have to have a

388
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,070
great technology organization right and

389
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,459
you know I think you can't do that

390
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:23,510
without being close to the technology

391
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:25,130
and so I guess for I got my graduate

392
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:28,730
degree in composite design I was telling

393
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:32,000
someone did not this earlier today yeah

394
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,829
right that even though I was formally

395
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,180
trained in that you know I

396
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:37,959
self-identified mostly as an office

397
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:41,209
person you know to some degree security

398
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:42,469
but then at some time the last two years

399
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:44,569
something flipped is like I really

400
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,610
self-identify as a developer right it's

401
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,199
it's never been so much fun to build

402
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,470
things and I've been having so much fun

403
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:54,859
today just my language of choice now is

404
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:58,850
closure and closure script exists on the

405
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:00,829
JVM or JavaScript and you know just it's

406
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,300
never been so fun you know to be

407
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:05,300
building things and it's never been

408
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:08,089
easier cheaper to do it and and so I

409
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,990
think the implication for security

410
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:15,680
professionals is there's a comment from

411
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:17,269
the one presented and JavaScript you

412
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,620
know she said you know to to opine on

413
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:20,480
frameworks he actually be have to be

414
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,399
familiar with the frameworks and the

415
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,079
idioms and so forth like oh my gosh yeah

416
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,579
right I mean in some ways we have to be

417
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,019
experts in the things that we're

418
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:28,699
supposed to be contributing to and

419
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,529
ideally we should be contributing as

420
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:32,510
fellow engineers not as some sort of

421
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:33,949
compliance person at the end I reckon

422
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,120
you know who's a you know shaking her

423
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:38,930
finger saying you do know these things

424
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,040
wrong so just one last question before

425
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,779
we open it up to you guys to ask

426
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,329
questions of these guys and give you

427
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:46,730
that opportunity what would be one thing

428
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:49,010
you would recommend to those those here

429
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,750
that are perhaps looking to follow in

430
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,149
similar footsteps to build their own own

431
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,069
super cool project to solve their own

432
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:56,690
major problem that they're seeing you

433
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:57,920
know whatever happens to be you know the

434
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,300
scratch the edge something that's

435
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,329
personal interesting what would you

436
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,069
recommend you know a lesson learned I

437
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:05,510
would actually see this almost goes into

438
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:07,069
sort of the thing of engineering

439
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:10,579
greatness right that you need to create

440
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:12,559
technical practices you know cultural

441
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:14,869
norms architect and so forth but the

442
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,819
thing that I'm become very fascinated

443
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:18,139
about is the success of those projects

444
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:19,909
right what actually causes certain

445
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,829
github projects that get all those great

446
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,140
stars and I think one of the working

447
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,030
theories we have is that it's about know

448
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,140
how easy it is to make a contribution

449
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,780
there's nothing more frustrating puttin

450
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,520
a pull request only need to have no one

451
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,740
ever looked at it and just get parked

452
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,270
there for you know years right I think

453
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,590
the ones that really the working theory

454
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,000
is that you know the ones that succeed

455
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,280
are the ones where you can make a

456
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,660
contribution you get thanked right and

457
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,980
that creates a positive feedback loop so

458
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,330
you know if you are working on one of

459
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,630
these open-source projects right make it

460
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:49,879
as easy for possible as you know to

461
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,830
contribute and you know whether its

462
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,540
content whether its documentation and so

463
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:58,970
forth and I think there's a lot of

464
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,139
reasons to believe that how quickly just

465
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,000
like the lead time into production is a

466
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,580
leading metric it's like the lead time

467
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,830
for some ability desire to contribute to

468
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:10,879
actually being in the repo is probably

469
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:13,820
an indicator of project success I think

470
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,920
for me on reflection probably one of the

471
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,840
the best things I did was I had a really

472
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,750
simple Minimum Viable Product like my

473
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,980
MVP was there's a text box on a page and

474
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,210
you enter an email address it'll come

475
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,430
back and tell you stuff like it did

476
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,200
really really simple stuff but i eated

477
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,150
really quickly on this oscillate that

478
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,920
went there and a few weeks later okay

479
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,690
now as an API and then a few weeks later

480
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,660
now there's a domain search ability and

481
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,220
I just feel that in this industry and I

482
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,830
think back to sort of my corporate time

483
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,960
as well we spend so much time trying to

484
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,280
get everything just right and I suspect

485
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,080
some security professionals we do that a

486
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,060
lot as well you know like let's let's

487
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,129
set a really really high minimum bar and

488
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,629
some are in there there's a healthy

489
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,040
balance between trying to have enough

490
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,690
features and enough security and

491
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,850
actually trying to deliver working

492
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,650
software and I think if we can get

493
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,750
working software out there much easier

494
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,640
even if it's a limited subset that that

495
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,170
gives us the opportunity to get traction

496
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,950
and grow the thing and then to add to it

497
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:08,780
over time I would say the thing I would

498
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,330
love to see in open source security

499
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:16,690
software is I mean using examples so um

500
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,689
so does anyone remember the wire lurker

501
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,260
malware on Mac OS it doesn't really

502
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,050
matter there was a piece of malware

503
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,850
called wire Locker on Mac OS few like a

504
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,159
year or so good several years ago

505
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:30,469
actually and Palo Alto Networks found it

506
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,720
and they wrote this Python script that

507
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,020
you would run you know

508
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:37,990
Python detect wire lurker dot py and it

509
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,820
would like print a line and it would be

510
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,070
like it would print like eight lines and

511
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:45,850
one of them might say hey like you're

512
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:48,129
infected with wire lurker and like that

513
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,020
in my opinion wasn't I think the

514
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,789
research was great but I don't think

515
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,639
that was a really compelling piece of

516
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:57,760
open-source software because the people

517
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,340
there like the audience for that kind of

518
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,169
capability are organizations you know

519
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:05,020
organizations care about whether or not

520
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:07,419
devices are infected and that like piece

521
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:10,480
of software wasn't necessarily super you

522
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:12,309
can't like deploy that run it like look

523
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,630
for this string in the output like

524
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:15,760
that's not a great way to like

525
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,789
production alized this detection

526
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,059
capability so I would just encourage you

527
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:24,129
to like reason about the intended

528
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:25,720
audience of what you're going to create

529
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,870
and reason about how like those

530
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,580
individuals like to deploy software in

531
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,280
their environment and how they can get

532
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:36,399
signal most effectively and stuff like

533
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,399
that and if possible you know that like

534
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,620
instead of like writing this like new

535
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,080
tool they could have added a like a

536
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,030
piece of public Intel to OS query or

537
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,600
like added an open IOC or something like

538
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:51,190
that that perhaps organizations with

539
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,020
existing installations for intrusion

540
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:56,169
detection could have just you know

541
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:58,150
ingested that Intel or something so just

542
00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:00,549
reason about how your audience is going

543
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,590
to consume you're creating and make it

544
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:03,820
as effective and simple for them as

545
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:08,260
possible to integrate into their

546
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,520
environment so opportunity for you guys

547
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,350
to ask questions of these guys just

548
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,658
raise your hand I'm calling you what

549
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,840
questions might you want to ask of these

550
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:15,840
guys

551
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,690
in fact the one the fun conversation I'm

552
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,570
looking forward to continue with dr.

553
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,190
batch earlier today we are you know just

554
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:37,649
we were reflecting the talks that we

555
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,740
heard and you know I think my primary

556
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:42,180
reactions like yes Tom purify and all

557
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,730
these things are absolutely great but I

558
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,290
never want to type those I want to type

559
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,570
those words I'm with a compiler to do it

560
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,700
for me I mean I think one of the things

561
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,899
I it's the hardest thing ever have done

562
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,610
was actually learn a functional

563
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,710
programming language like closure and

564
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:58,020
what I found was that and it really took

565
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,430
me like sixty hours of reading before I

566
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,379
could write my first line of code I mean

567
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,900
it's a lisp language I've never learned

568
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,610
lists before but what I learned and

569
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,260
doing that was that wow there's a whole

570
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,080
category of errors I don't make anymore

571
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:14,879
just because you know mutating state is

572
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:16,740
just so treacherous and I think that's

573
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,180
informing this reactions like holy cow I

574
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,710
actually don't want to be running

575
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,940
JavaScript right it's like give me a

576
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,800
language where all these things are

577
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,390
taking care of for me so like a

578
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:28,050
convenience has to win right it's like

579
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:29,160
it can't be I now self identifying the

580
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,919
developers I know don't give me all

581
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,150
these rules just put it into the library

582
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,130
to the framework put it into the

583
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,590
language right so I don't make these

584
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,360
mistakes I can personally speak to

585
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,100
attest that they're you know ninety

586
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,479
percent of the errors I make are now

587
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,669
impossible if you use kind of a

588
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:49,650
functional programming style if mutation

589
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:51,300
is not allowed is it's that be if I

590
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,470
would put that out to use like the man

591
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,180
wouldn't be great to actually have this

592
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,650
integrated into typescript or something

593
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:59,010
where you know the compile is actually

594
00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:01,440
protecting you I think we often lose

595
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,030
track of the convenience side of things

596
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,860
in security and I'll give you a really

597
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,960
good example I write something in

598
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,280
September about iPhone 10 and face ID

599
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,540
you know and it look there's gonna be

600
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,030
biometrics and it's gonna be easy to

601
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,800
unlock your phone and it's a little bit

602
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,420
different for me being in Australia and

603
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,919
having a large American audience because

604
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,930
there's a lot of like social things that

605
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,000
are different and I kept hearing from

606
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,800
security and privacy people in the u.s.

607
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,540
they said you should never use

608
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,620
biometrics because the cops can force

609
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,389
you to unlock your device of its

610
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,479
biometrics but they can't if you've got

611
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,020
a pin and as I probed away it is

612
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,180
discussed

613
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:35,100
you realize how absurd it gets I had

614
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,780
some person say well what if you're

615
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,100
driving along in the car and the cops

616
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,960
see you and they don't like you and they

617
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,730
shoot your friend and then they come

618
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,350
over and you've been videoing as they

619
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,700
shoot their friend and they come over

620
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,379
and say can you please unlock the phone

621
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,180
for us so that we can erase the evidence

622
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,500
of you videoing the friend and they can

623
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,170
do that if you've got biometrics but not

624
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,110
if you've got a pin and I'm like they're

625
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,730
just going to shoot you to like or are

626
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:00,300
they going to take your phone and smash

627
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:02,490
it and this it we just tend to get so

628
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,740
myopic and people say to me as well I go

629
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,000
well what if you're traveling to America

630
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,430
will you take your phone with you

631
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,900
because border could stop you and and

632
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,820
force you to unlock it you know would

633
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,500
you unlock it if they demanded it and

634
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,700
I'm going look if I'm an Australian and

635
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,110
I've come to the other side of the world

636
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,030
and I'm jet-lagged I'm here for an

637
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,679
important conference or something and it

638
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,030
is literally the difference between open

639
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,470
your phone and we can look at it or

640
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,940
don't and then you're going to have a

641
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,870
permanent record of having been rejected

642
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,060
from the country and you're never gonna

643
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:30,300
be allowed in again what do you think

644
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:31,590
I'm gonna do so I just find that a lot

645
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,050
of the arguments to get very very

646
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:36,000
security centric it just totally

647
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,190
detached from reality as well so there's

648
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,440
there's got to be balanced there with

649
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:42,480
the the caveat that I understand that

650
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,160
there are particular groups of people

651
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,630
that are going to be massively higher

652
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,400
targets for certain reasons and it's

653
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,140
gonna differ a little bit for them but

654
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,460
for the most of us we tend to sort of

655
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,850
lose track a little bit of what the

656
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:56,280
practical risks are yeah I think when it

657
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:58,800
comes to engineering you have to make

658
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:01,410
the convenient thing the secure thing in

659
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,389
order for it to be a can an effective

660
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:06,300
security mechanism like for example when

661
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:08,780
Facebook introduced xhp there were a lot

662
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:11,159
of like built-in cross-site scripting

663
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,300
protections and you know for example I

664
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,240
collide

665
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,450
you know we write software the for a

666
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,640
series of businesses we're like a b2b

667
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:23,340
endpoint company and we started off with

668
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,260
this multi-tenant application where like

669
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,820
the application is dealing with tenancy

670
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:29,090
and this resulted in like a somewhat

671
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,340
insecure application as well as a

672
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:34,409
complex application so we invested in

673
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,149
writing some tooling that allows us to

674
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,200
really easily like completely remove

675
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,840
tenancy from the application and

676
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,220
the reason about it as an infrastructure

677
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,709
concern so that it's just like

678
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,960
architects really impossible for there

679
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,870
to be some for there to be like

680
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,490
intermingling of data and so like the

681
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,050
application is simpler and the

682
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,690
application is more secure and like

683
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:57,610
these are the these kinds of things I

684
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:01,840
think are the best security mechanisms

685
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:04,030
in modern and June maybe just one thing

686
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,129
I want to share with you is that one of

687
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:10,450
my observations is that so many security

688
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:12,430
practitioners a lot of them that I've

689
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:15,730
been studying have now might become

690
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:16,990
engineering managers and meaning that so

691
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,670
that problem like they don't have the

692
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:21,640
authority to you know ask someone to

693
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,660
change something because they asked you

694
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,730
know they're actually leading teams

695
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:27,610
allison miller is now leading

696
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:31,450
engineering team dr. badass i think

697
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:33,280
maybe the you know the right path for

698
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,560
people who are you know have such an

699
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,690
interest in like changing the state of

700
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,370
how we develop software and do it more

701
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:41,020
securely may be the path of actually

702
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,489
they're gonna own Devon ops right and

703
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,940
not because and their unique skill is

704
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:47,620
how to you know make these architectural

705
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,820
decisions that actually get end up not

706
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,659
just good for security but you know

707
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:56,639
great for you know dev QA and ops -

708
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,640
thank you yes

709
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,289
yeah by the way great question in fact

710
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,090
let me first say that the last two years

711
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:46,559
has changed me is that I have become

712
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,699
like the anti full-stack developer I

713
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,678
want to live in my perfect little

714
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,360
functional programming world right

715
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,190
ideally not even had to deal with input

716
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,449
outputs or you know whatever the last

717
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,779
thing I want to do is deal with logging

718
00:27:54,450 --> 00:28:01,139
scheduling right I appreciate it but I

719
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:05,490
don't want to do it I think what I said

720
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:07,889
more precisely was instead of what you

721
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,450
want to do what we want to do is enable

722
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:11,879
developers to get stuff done without

723
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,889
having to open up tickets so in some

724
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:15,209
ways we can stick in there you know they

725
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:17,699
can stay in their universe but they can

726
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,679
rely on you know logging configuration

727
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,049
infrastructure all to be done

728
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,909
self-service and what it does is

729
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:31,110
radically change the way that teams work

730
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:32,940
and it's there's a woman named charity

731
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:35,668
majors she's a former DBA she was

732
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,379
acquired by Facebook and you know it

733
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:40,110
turns out like when you use platforms

734
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:42,389
whether it's kubernetes or hosted

735
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:44,189
graphite or you know whatever you

736
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:45,899
actually do a lot of you're actually

737
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,519
making a lot of sacrifices you can't

738
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:49,168
actually inspect those services those

739
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,240
platforms don't actually care about you

740
00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:52,379
they will rate limit you they will make

741
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,539
sure that you don't take down everybody

742
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:56,519
else right and yet you know in the

743
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:58,590
perfect and most people never go back to

744
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:00,539
having to manage on databases or manage

745
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:02,189
their own whatever right so I mean I

746
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:04,259
think the value of having those

747
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:08,940
platforms I think it's really difficult

748
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:10,350
overstate so one thing I also I thought

749
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,120
this is really interesting in jeans talk

750
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,289
as well and I wanted to comment on it I

751
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,469
and I meant to talk to Jean about it

752
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:18,149
afterwards but the thing that I don't

753
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,720
want people to take away from the story

754
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:24,689
of sprouter at Etsy is that that just

755
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,480
like there was a there was a design and

756
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:29,549
architecture that like created it was a

757
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,470
leaky abstraction you know like there

758
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:33,690
were two teams there was a third project

759
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:35,820
now there were three teams and like they

760
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:39,059
weren't decoupled well so I don't think

761
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,830
the solution to this is you know Monell

762
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,600
with everything or create one team

763
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:47,039
because that Facebook for example this

764
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:49,309
abstraction was graph QL and this allows

765
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,179
front-end developers to be productive

766
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:55,600
without needing to involve back-end

767
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:58,419
developers but but it's not that like

768
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,969
it's it's it's not that the like

769
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:03,610
objective of trying to decouple some of

770
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:05,940
the more advanced data access patterns

771
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:09,219
from front-end development is a bad

772
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:11,710
objective it's that the architecture of

773
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,360
the approach at Etsy was flawed and

774
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:16,899
that's why I loved like you know Jean

775
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,340
talked about sprouter and how it had

776
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,899
these problems and then the next slide

777
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,129
is about architecture and how you should

778
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:22,449
focus on architecture and the

779
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:25,449
implications that that has in

780
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:27,490
development of your organization so yeah

781
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,919
I think this the the the conclusion to

782
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,539
take there is not necessarily that you

783
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,769
know minimize the number of teams it's

784
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:38,460
that allow teams to be a lot like to be

785
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:38,460
decoupled in their productivity

786
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,928
oh yeah okay great and so I think right

787
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,279
I mean I think kind of the massively

788
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:04,159
over simplified that the model used to

789
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:06,470
be I'm gonna put in my application for a

790
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,480
security review and then you know I'm

791
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:11,269
gonna wait a month or two right now you

792
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,980
get the big PDF file and I think the the

793
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:15,320
model is more looking like all right you

794
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,419
can do a security scan on demand it's

795
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,309
gonna be integrated into this continuous

796
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:20,630
integration pipeline or not doesn't

797
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:25,700
matter right this is amazing Twitter

798
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:27,470
story from Matata Collins and Justin I

799
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,120
mean they didn't even integrate into the

800
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,830
CI pipeline but the fact that developers

801
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,539
could do it on demand without asking

802
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:35,960
someone to do it radically change

803
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:37,610
behaviors and the outcomes and I think

804
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,620
that the work now looks more like hey

805
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,418
I'm gonna pair with you I can pair with

806
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,549
you right to help developers do things

807
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:47,179
securely we're gonna train developers on

808
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:49,639
mass you know we're gonna do design

809
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:51,919
reviews alongside the sprints I mean so

810
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:53,779
I think it it means that we're part of a

811
00:31:51,919 --> 00:32:00,139
team as opposed to serve like some sort

812
00:31:53,779 --> 00:32:03,309
of distant approval body right I guess

813
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:03,309
Oleg you get the last question

814
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:36,810
yeah so I think that was my conclusion

815
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,000
from the Mario presentation right it's

816
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:41,070
like you know what is the OL that the in

817
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,480
fact of the famous Facebook transfer you

818
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:47,490
know that the turning point arguably

819
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,350
right is was I fit around 2008 2009 in

820
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,630
the ops engineering team there was this

821
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,429
rule that yeah if you're having a

822
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,170
meeting you can't have your laptop open

823
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,730
unless you have a live site incident

824
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,350
going on right then and there was this

825
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,880
one famous meeting where no one would

826
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,620
close their laptops like all 14 people

827
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,610
had the laptop open fighting 14

828
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:08,370
different incidents right and like the

829
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:14,490
the lore goes that that was when was it

830
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:16,469
Chuck sure Peter can cross to Chuck

831
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:18,720
Rossi or somebody right now they'd said

832
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:20,250
all right from now on every dev manager

833
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,290
every architect is gonna be put on page

834
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,150
rotation to share the pain and so they

835
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:25,110
can see the downstream effects of you

836
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:27,450
know the stuff that they're putting into

837
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,560
production and like I can't remember I

838
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,590
think within three to six months

839
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,220
suddenly like the number of like seven

840
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,830
outages

841
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,270
you know like disappeared so I would say

842
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:38,040
the same thing for security right it's

843
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:40,200
like if everyone knows that I'm gonna

844
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,330
personally pay the price of you know

845
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,790
Vaughn's that I put into production you

846
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:57,419
know suddenly all the incentives are

847
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:58,860
working the same way my writings and

848
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,270
latest talks it's all about alignment of

849
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,129
incentives I think many of our

850
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,570
technological problems we have solutions

851
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,160
for them but you have to get the right

852
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,929
people that can make an impact

853
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,850
incentivize to do the right thing at the

854
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:10,860
right time in many areas we don't have

855
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:14,639
that so I love the incentives comments

856
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:16,139
just personal thing for me so with that

857
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,490
we're gonna close off the panel and

858
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,200
