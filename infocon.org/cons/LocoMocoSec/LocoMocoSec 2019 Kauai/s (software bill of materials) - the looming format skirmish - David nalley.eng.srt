1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:31,230
a quarter of a century now which seems

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,050
like a really long time and I feel

3
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,880
really old when I say that I run the

4
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,190
infrastructure team at the Apache

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,309
Software Foundation so seven full-time

6
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,870
employees report up in which is really

7
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:47,849
strange because I'm a volunteer at the

8
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:49,709
ASF I am I've been on the board for the

9
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,320
Apache Software Foundation for the

10
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,260
Fedora project and been involved in a

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,989
number of other communities in the

12
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,269
open-source ecosystem and thankfully

13
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,099
today blackberry since we pay checks

14
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,860
every couple of weeks to work on open

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,390
source for them if you want to heckle me

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,159
you're free to heckle me here in the

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,960
audience or you can also heckle me on

18
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:16,560
Twitter and you'll see my Twitter ID

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,699
there so why don't we care about s bomb

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,430
why do we care about the format's and

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,710
you know does this really matter why are

22
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,869
we spending time sitting inside a room

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,689
that's relatively dark compared to the

24
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:34,350
wonderful outside talking about lists of

25
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,539
software there is a lot of regulation

26
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,570
that's coming around it whether that's

27
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,229
in the finance sector or the healthcare

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,939
industry there is some regulation that's

29
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,490
going to be applied that is going to be

30
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,320
inevitable and that is something that we

31
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,929
really haven't seen heretofore

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,880
in either an open source are in

33
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,470
commercial software is that you've

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,070
essentially got to be accountable for

35
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,420
the software that you're including

36
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,449
governments around the world are

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,610
realizing kind of the mass of the

38
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,890
problem that they're dealing with so

39
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,290
it's not just that we've got

40
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,880
we've got people who are shipping

41
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,950
software that solves problems for us

42
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,880
we've also got people who are shipping

43
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,959
software that causes problems for us and

44
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,030
governments are figuring this out and

45
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,900
they're realizing that they either need

46
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,450
to deal with it

47
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,670
and so they they stand up programs like

48
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,709
FedRAMP where you have to have a process

49
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,420
that has some maturity so that you're

50
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:34,840
not causing problems when they give you

51
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:37,089
money and also it has an impact on the

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,060
private sector which of course you know

53
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,670
they're supposed to be safeguarding and

54
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,120
it might be important for someone to

55
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,280
know what software is actually running

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,700
there were days when you could ship a

57
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,640
black box and the the customers would

58
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,890
accept that and those days are by and

59
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,019
large gone as a matter of fact you'll

60
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,850
see now that customers are probably

61
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,190
scanning your software with the same

62
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,660
tools that you're scanning with the

63
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,640
number of customers who will take your

64
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,680
product put it through black duct to

65
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,660
figure out what are you actually

66
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,959
including is actually becoming pretty

67
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:16,390
common so when we talk about this there

68
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,090
there's you know this desire to know

69
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:21,429
what's running but as a sysadmin I would

70
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:25,900
tell you that the Ops guys have always

71
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:27,880
cared about this and and so I say it's a

72
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,510
skirmish maybe it's been going on long

73
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,340
enough that it's really a war and we've

74
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,290
always been at war with Eastasia it's

75
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,280
always been a conflict of what formats

76
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,780
going to win out it's always been a

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,600
conflict about what tools we use

78
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:48,519
so just for historical purposes I want

79
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,920
to look back we used to have this right

80
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:55,630
so you want to install some software and

81
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:58,298
and I'm a Linux guy by trade so you know

82
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,950
we have this great manifest stuff here's

83
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:03,459
the software here's what it does here's

84
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:05,738
version here's build number here's

85
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:08,290
there's even going to be a link to the

86
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:11,049
build scripts that are included there we

87
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:14,170
included all of that as a matter of fact

88
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:16,000
if you had really old sis admins

89
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:19,149
particularly the ones with great beards

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,470
and I am only great beardless because I

91
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:26,679
don't have a beard you know they would

92
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:31,270
they would insist that you don't bundle

93
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:34,180
dependencies that you don't that you

94
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,070
don't include software without fully

95
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,810
putting it through this process and then

96
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,969
that made things like oh I need to see

97
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,880
what security updates are available well

98
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,070
no problem I'll query what packages have

99
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,810
updates that are available because I can

100
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:51,820
hopefully trust my operating system

101
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:54,880
vendor or maybe I need to do this in a

102
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:57,010
different in a different format so we

103
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,659
can do this with devs - or you can do

104
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:05,050
this on Windows but in the end packages

105
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,130
did not win this war there's a number of

106
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,340
problems there first

107
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,770
I blame developers and and in particular

108
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,280
I'll go out and say the Ruby folks have

109
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,840
made this super complicated but they

110
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,429
weren't they weren't really the original

111
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,039
cause because at least they used a

112
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:25,120
package manager the folks who would take

113
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:28,810
code and then basically copy it into

114
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:32,229
their source code including five six

115
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:35,260
seven other projects inside their one

116
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:37,330
package destroyed this and because we

117
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,880
didn't have a way of enforcing this and

118
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:43,240
because it wasn't Universal when you

119
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,010
needed both Windows Linux maybe Solaris

120
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,890
and AIX in the same environment

121
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,900
we lost control of what software was

122
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,820
there

123
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:55,739
we've also though increased velocity and

124
00:05:51,820 --> 00:06:00,460
and I said I blame the Ruby folks ruby

125
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:04,180
made such fast progress and you could go

126
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:07,330
from one week you're packaged working

127
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,800
with a stated dependency and that

128
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,870
dependency completely breaking your

129
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:16,470
product in a week so that velocity has

130
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:19,720
has changed the way that that we have to

131
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,940
include software and you'll see folks

132
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,830
there are even folks two weeks ago on

133
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,529
Hacker News who were complaining about

134
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:28,690
the guidelines around packaging software

135
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:31,150
for Debian because it was so strict and

136
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:35,409
so hard to to actually get software that

137
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:37,359
was shippable and and

138
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:39,069
we had every platform using something

139
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,550
different right

140
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:45,459
so packages ended up not being the right

141
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,649
format for us to track what software was

142
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:51,039
on our machine even though you'll still

143
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:54,339
find some places that do this well so

144
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:57,878
let's talk about today's software Bill

145
00:06:54,339 --> 00:07:00,399
of Materials format and see what you

146
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,169
know the folks who are who are the real

147
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,759
players today when we're trying to

148
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:05,669
figure out what software is running on a

149
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,610
given device or in a given environment

150
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:11,739
so we'll start with Swift and it is

151
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,419
software identification there's actually

152
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:15,518
an ISO standard it's like someone

153
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:18,429
thought about this in advance and ready

154
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,829
to standard but it in many ways it was

155
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:24,399
not targeted with the viewpoint of

156
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:25,899
creating an s bomb and it certainly

157
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,809
wasn't created with the viewpoint of

158
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:31,509
managing things like security instead

159
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:35,499
this was really focused on licensing and

160
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:37,959
entitlements and that is the that's kind

161
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:40,300
of where it originated it has a sister

162
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:46,240
ISO standard that literally is called

163
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:48,550
software entitlements nonprofit group

164
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,249
has formed around that called tag vault

165
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,869
and they're trying to set up

166
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:53,559
normalization if this sounds a little

167
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:56,439
familiar

168
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:58,719
you know this legacy goes back a little

169
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:02,649
bit and we'll talk about some of the

170
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,989
predecessors to Swift but you know this

171
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:08,829
has been around for a while and people

172
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:13,209
have been trying to build this out the

173
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:14,889
problems though is when you look at some

174
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:17,349
of the tooling what does the tooling do

175
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:19,749
goes back and looks at those rpms and

176
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:21,519
Deb's and says hey tell me about the

177
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:25,149
software that's included in this and

178
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:27,939
I'll I'll create a set of tags and we'll

179
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:31,569
be able to describe the software the

180
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:35,050
Linux tool does that via via packages

181
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:36,699
and that's great that may work for

182
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,438
containers unless you build your

183
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:40,448
containers by installing all of your dev

184
00:08:38,438 --> 00:08:42,490
tools pulling down your source code

185
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:45,209
building and not including that in a

186
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,209
package itself

187
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,770
maybe that maybe that tool will work in

188
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,950
some places but we get back to that

189
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:57,060
problem of do I have to manually a test

190
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:59,350
manually scan each package to do this

191
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,300
there are some other tools that are

192
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,680
available to members of tag vault so you

193
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,859
actually have to join pay some money

194
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,349
upfront to to join tag vault and they'll

195
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:13,180
provide you with a number of tools

196
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:16,180
either at cost or for a nominal fee and

197
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,770
if you actually want to validate your

198
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,370
bill of materials that you generated

199
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:25,449
with Swift you can do that with with a

200
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,740
tool that NIST has available but you

201
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:31,540
know this isn't perfect

202
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:34,570
right so the in many ways when you talk

203
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:38,079
about generating one of these Swit tags

204
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,880
for your software they soon in the

205
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,920
documentation that you have one thing

206
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,080
and that thing doesn't really have that

207
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,439
many dependencies and that's how it was

208
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,110
originally it was assumed that the

209
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,120
creator of the software was going to

210
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,580
apply a swig tag and then we would have

211
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,120
this domino effect when it was included

212
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,440
by other folks and that hasn't taken off

213
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,320
as a matter of fact the open-source

214
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,620
community seems pretty put off by having

215
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,730
to pay 178 Swiss francs to read the

216
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:11,890
standard and you know because so many of

217
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,440
the folks involved in open source are

218
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:17,590
individuals they also don't want to go

219
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:23,080
join tech volt and get access to their

220
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:25,120
tools that said it's an ISO standard and

221
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,770
we all love ISO standards because it's

222
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,990
something we can actually go in point to

223
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,510
and say hey we've achieved this let me

224
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,850
check that box off we can put it in our

225
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:38,080
marketing literature our sales guys love

226
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:41,680
that and very large customers and Govs

227
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,880
will specify hey we really need to be

228
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,280
able to see what's in there please

229
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:54,100
follow this please follow this standard

230
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:58,670
there's also Perl and Perl is the exact

231
00:10:54,100 --> 00:11:02,120
opposite of the software

232
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:05,310
language that it shares a name with

233
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,030
right so there's very little option it's

234
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,770
very simple it's very easy to generate

235
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:13,380
but again we're focused on packages and

236
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:16,560
repositories but this is seeing a bit of

237
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:19,290
groundswell and support so here's some

238
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,770
examples right so I'm going to pull

239
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:27,449
fubar from NPM and I'm going to pull

240
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:33,870
this version or I'm going to pull a

241
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:36,650
github URL and a specific hash or again

242
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:39,930
a specific version from nougat and

243
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:42,240
that's going to inform you know

244
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,520
basically what's in the package and I'm

245
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,960
doing that by looking at dependencies

246
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:51,090
generally so we'll we'll look at we'll

247
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,890
look at your maven pom file and we'll

248
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,780
figure out dependencies and transitive

249
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:59,130
dependencies and then we'll generate

250
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:02,130
basically a list like this one of the

251
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:04,470
problems though with Perl is it doesn't

252
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,790
handle tonton packaged software so there

253
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,490
are a number of elements and you can

254
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:10,530
have this being software from github or

255
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,200
from get lab or anywhere else that you

256
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:15,600
choose and you can pull that as a hash

257
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,200
but otherwise it you know it's expecting

258
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,850
you to have something in an RPM an NPM

259
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,940
jar file that you've got from maven

260
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,110
central and that you're going to be

261
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,810
specifying it from that package and

262
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,730
there's a lot of software out there both

263
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:33,180
legacy and today that just doesn't

264
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:35,700
conform to that there's also only seven

265
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,680
elements in the spec and and I love the

266
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,960
fact that it's so simple but I also

267
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,939
dislike the fact that it doesn't give us

268
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,520
enough complexity to deal with all of

269
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:49,560
the problems that people have promised

270
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:51,569
us BOM is going to solve for us so when

271
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,369
we you look at the current spec for Perl

272
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:57,690
there are only two elements that are

273
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:59,550
required the name and the type so I can

274
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:04,470
tell you that I've got an RPM of OpenSSL

275
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:06,300
and that is technically a complete Perl

276
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:09,490
descriptor of software that's installed

277
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:12,339
not version not how it's used

278
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,400
not how it was built or where it came

279
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,400
from

280
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:22,480
and then there's sp DX and this is you

281
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,010
know one of the other large players in

282
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,140
this current conversation around this

283
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,210
bomb and there does this work group

284
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,800
which is a very loosely defined work

285
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:33,070
group because it's not part of a real

286
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,689
standards org they've got a freely

287
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,230
available standard that's published

288
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:40,330
under a Creative Commons license and

289
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:43,150
they also did not start out with solving

290
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:45,460
the s-bahn problem is there as their

291
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,220
purpose instead they were trying to deal

292
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,050
with license compliance because for a

293
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,540
number of companies especially those who

294
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,520
ship a lot of open-source dealing with

295
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,020
license compliance issues is a big deal

296
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,550
because they don't want to be like Best

297
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,699
Buy and have to give up a ton of TVs

298
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:04,599
that contain open source and not be able

299
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:06,760
to sell those but again it this is

300
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,460
designed around software vendors who

301
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:16,689
need to describe the consume software

302
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:20,339
and there's nice tools they work to

303
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:24,790
varying degrees you can use Blackduck to

304
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:28,660
produce an SPD X list of software you

305
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:30,670
can use fossil adji to do the same and

306
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,640
there's some other tools that are coming

307
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,439
out of other groups to basically produce

308
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,319
this bill of materials based on what

309
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,630
they find in your software but they

310
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,520
would all produce different lists with

311
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:48,130
different degrees of of depth there's

312
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:51,069
some there's also a few other things

313
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,660
there's CPE there are people who say hey

314
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,580
we're just going to manage all of this

315
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,910
with package coordinates you know

316
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:01,150
Maven's fine doing or dot apache dot

317
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,680
struts you know we can tell you that

318
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,449
you've got struts we can tell you what

319
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,280
version you have all of the information

320
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:11,080
that you need cyclone DX has a

321
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,600
relatively robust tool set but they

322
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,480
don't have a whole lot of adoption and

323
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,480
and they basically are one of the few

324
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,750
folks championing their own format and

325
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,970
instead of tooling and then

326
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:31,360
platform and enumeration how many folks

327
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:36,160
remember CPE okay so CPE was a standard

328
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,290
that predates Swit and basically they

329
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:43,420
were looking how to describe and how to

330
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:45,880
enumerate all the facets of a system so

331
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,880
let's start with who produced it

332
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,720
Red Hat what packages are on it what

333
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:57,150
version and creating a dictionary that

334
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,150
you could then describe any given system

335
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:03,310
the there is some talk of

336
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,930
interoperability and I don't personally

337
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:07,689
hold a lot of faith in this because I

338
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,489
don't trust that we can have a perfect

339
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:12,580
one-to-one interoperability between

340
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:15,910
these two but both SP DX and swig have

341
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,800
said that they're going to to provide

342
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:21,430
interoperability so that you can read

343
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:24,030
and process each other standard with

344
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:28,959
their own tools maybe that'll happen

345
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:32,770
it's today a promise if you're still

346
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:36,400
using CPE and and I hope that's not true

347
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:38,710
most folks here NIST has some guidelines

348
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,900
and guidance on how to basically convert

349
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:44,080
that to Swit and give you some

350
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:47,530
interoperability there but there's still

351
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:52,150
a lot of problems right and the biggest

352
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:56,800
problem is naming so I participate in

353
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:59,530
the a Kazi open source workgroup and so

354
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,770
we're comparing product security list of

355
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:04,959
software that causes us problems in open

356
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:07,750
source and that we want to make sure has

357
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,900
a lot of focus and so we're you know

358
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,609
companies large companies are coming

359
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,439
putting their lists from basically

360
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:15,849
product security investigations and

361
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:20,050
product security vulnerabilities that

362
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:21,639
are reported in and we're starting to

363
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,990
look and say hey alright let's figure

364
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:28,329
out what is common between all of us

365
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:30,250
with 10 companies there were five

366
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:34,000
different names for the Apache web

367
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:36,280
server no one was able to agree on that

368
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,660
so if you go to query hey am i running

369
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:42,160
httpd well no obviously not you're

370
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,530
running one of these for other names for

371
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:49,360
Apache because Debian calls it

372
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:50,800
Apache too and other folks call it

373
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,969
Apache and people will call it the

374
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:57,490
Apache web server and there is no common

375
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,320
language that we can use to really

376
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:04,500
define that you've got the web server

377
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:07,510
present and this is a simple example

378
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:10,390
imagine this expanded out now there's

379
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:13,810
some solutions there but this is a

380
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:16,000
common problem do you have open SSL what

381
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:18,460
about if you're running Red Hat

382
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,760
Enterprise Linux and they tell you a

383
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,790
specific version that you have and that

384
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,430
version the version number at least is

385
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:29,200
still vulnerable you've still got this

386
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:32,500
naming problem where we have these

387
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,940
pieces of discrete software that may be

388
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,560
the same or may be different and we

389
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,170
don't have a great way of comparing them

390
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:43,810
between not with any of the current

391
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:51,520
tools that that are in place the reality

392
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:53,610
to me fills very shoehorn and the

393
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,960
question is what do you want out of

394
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,209
software Bill of Materials if you're

395
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,280
looking for it to solve all of your

396
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,290
security problems none of these are

397
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,600
going to do it if you're looking for it

398
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:08,649
to give you an inventory maybe it does

399
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:13,449
it with with some with some work on your

400
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:16,540
part but frankly the s-bahn effort has

401
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:19,420
not yet gotten to the point where we are

402
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:22,330
able to concretely define what problem

403
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,590
as bomb is going to solve every person

404
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,659
that you talk to about this has a

405
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,280
different answer and that is reflected

406
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,890
in the format's that are out there

407
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,990
available to us and for better or worse

408
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,270
none have one mindshare which means

409
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:38,980
you've again got this problem that we

410
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:41,110
had decades ago if you have questions

411
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,530
I'm happy to take them thanks for

412
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,929
listening

413
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,600
again you can heckle me and feel free to

414
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:48,930
reach out at any of these addresses

415
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,929
thanks very much

416
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:59,790
yeah so I thought me I'm I'm having to

417
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:01,809
run through some content here because

418
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,430
he's telling me I've got three minutes

419
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:10,300
left

420
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:11,980
I appreciate the challenge right I mean

421
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,770
if I'm going to if I'm going to come to

422
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:19,300
Hawaii I should should definitely be up

423
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:22,750
for it right so you know I talk about s

424
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:27,970
bomb being subjective and I think this

425
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:30,850
is really my pessimism coming in I don't

426
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:33,370
think it'll be any surprise that you

427
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,770
will find that customers are proactively

428
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,110
asking you about security

429
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,760
vulnerabilities in your products now

430
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:45,129
hopefully you will have an understanding

431
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:47,200
that hey I included open SSL and that

432
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,990
open SSL version was vulnerable people

433
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,050
are going to be asking me and that's

434
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,790
fine that's great

435
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:56,830
hopefully you've got a prepared response

436
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:59,470
you can go back to them and say yes that

437
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,790
version of open SSL is vulnerable we're

438
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,640
not using it in the way that's

439
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,470
vulnerable this is not a concern at some

440
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,320
future date we will be upgrading so that

441
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:12,520
your scanners will not report this false

442
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,899
positive the reality is is that s bombs

443
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,780
going to make that problem much worse

444
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,820
right so instead of them being able to

445
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,340
turn on Blackduck and go through the

446
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,649
hoops of of actually querying what

447
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,360
software you have in there you're going

448
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,030
to be providing them a document you may

449
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,040
be mandated by regulation or contract to

450
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:32,470
provide them a document that lists all

451
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:36,040
of the open source so you should expect

452
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:37,960
that the number of people who are going

453
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:42,309
to be asking you those questions it's

454
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:44,980
going to go up when we look at number of

455
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:48,160
open source vulnerabilities and compare

456
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,050
that to what actually translates into

457
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,350
vulnerabilities I'd love to hear what

458
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:55,178
Microsoft's numbers are on this but you

459
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:58,000
know I'm guessing that you're looking at

460
00:21:55,179 --> 00:22:00,780
30 to 40 percent may actually result in

461
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,520
a real vulnerability

462
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,639
having seen numbers from from a number

463
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:08,610
of companies you know not the fact that

464
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,800
an open-source library that you use is

465
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,840
actually vulnerable to something doesn't

466
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,919
mean that your product that uses that is

467
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,179
vulnerable heartbleed for instance

468
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,320
single function call if you weren't

469
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,780
using that function call

470
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,300
you weren't vulnerable but how do you

471
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:27,540
figure that out so I think s bomb is

472
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,700
going to generate a lot more a lot more

473
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,080
work and we haven't figured out how to

474
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,540
deal with that we haven't figured out

475
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,250
how to describe this is the software

476
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,480
that we're using this is how we're using

477
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:41,340
it and I could tell you just by querying

478
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,490
whether we're vulnerable to that

479
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:48,139
particular aspect or I can test it out

480
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:51,570
and so there's a lot of pushback from

481
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,920
software vendors who don't want to give

482
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:57,300
this away and don't want to incur the

483
00:22:52,920 --> 00:23:00,740
extra work but one of the bad realities

484
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:03,180
that you'll also see is that people also

485
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:07,170
don't have any idea what software is

486
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:11,570
running in their system and I mean this

487
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:15,450
as the vendor who ships software right

488
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:17,389
when I look so I work on an open source

489
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:21,570
at blackberry when I look at some of the

490
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:24,840
BlackBerry packages I look at a thousand

491
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:27,840
plus open source components in a single

492
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,639
product there is nobody on that

493
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,169
development team who understands that

494
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:36,240
full scope they can't that's just not

495
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,980
maintainable by a single person in their

496
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,470
mind they're going to have to be tools

497
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,270
and s BOM may be one of the tools that

498
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,250
solves that problem for us but we're

499
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:47,070
going to have to have tools that that

500
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:49,380
solve the what's here but then getting

501
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,629
from what's here to sharing that with

502
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,420
the world to being able to manage that

503
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,920
we haven't figured out yet and frankly I

504
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,990
don't think there's a lot of folks who

505
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,380
have a plan on the other side you have

506
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:03,110
consumers who don't trust at all what

507
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,520
these people are shipping out because

508
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,639
they shipped me a medical device that

509
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,020
shut down my hospital because it had a

510
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,240
vulnerable version of struts in it and

511
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,899
they took down the entire Hospital

512
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,470
Network

513
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:19,268
well now I don't trust that vendor and

514
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,980
the vendor may or may not tell me that

515
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:23,799
I'm vulnerable can I believe what

516
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,919
they're actually telling me and so what

517
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:29,580
we actually have is a lack of trust and

518
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:35,679
we're trying to use s bomb as a

519
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:38,019
relationship salvation and we've got to

520
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,059
figure out how we can from a technical

521
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:44,830
aspect actually declare what's on the

522
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:46,840
system because that is important the BOF

523
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:49,658
HS of the world want to know what's in

524
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,418
the system and at the same time not

525
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:57,669
necessarily turn that into constant

526
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:59,559
panic about what is you know the sky's

527
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:02,820
falling because you included open SSL

528
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:05,950
and there's now a new vulnerability I

529
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:08,678
don't think that any of the s bomb camps

530
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:10,539
have one mindshare yet and thankfully we

531
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:13,330
don't have a whole lot of regulation in

532
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:15,759
place yet but I think it's going to be

533
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:18,009
important for product security folks and

534
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:20,529
security folks in general to be part of

535
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:23,440
that conversation but realize that this

536
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:24,700
is not a panacea people expect that this

537
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,009
is going to solve all of their problems

538
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,940
and they don't realize it's just a

539
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:31,750
different set of problems they're going

540
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:39,070
to end up dealing with I'm afraid can

541
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:41,889
you use a package lock file can you yeah

542
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:49,000
so the problem becomes one of adoption

543
00:25:41,889 --> 00:25:51,340
again and I assume this is and whoever

544
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,320
asked this are you talking about in

545
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:56,289
terms of dealing with the constant

546
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:59,230
upgrade churn and and not being able to

547
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:01,899
state this trying to look at this was

548
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:04,200
recently tell me the context in which

549
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:04,199
you're asking

550
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:21,639
is it okay if I repeat it yeah so he was

551
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,110
talking about you have a web app with

552
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,960
all the dependencies and transient

553
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,459
dependencies and you have hashes for all

554
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,860
of those and is that useful

555
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,360
I think it's greatly useful the question

556
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,459
is can you apply that to every

557
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,439
environment because we've apparently

558
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:39,600
decided to boil the ocean with s mom and

559
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,190
there are people who are talking about

560
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,500
I've got an IOT device and I need to

561
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,600
know if that's vulnerable I've got a car

562
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,940
that's connected to the Internet or

563
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:53,939
maybe not I also need to know what the

564
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:59,050
the what the software is in that so

565
00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:00,970
maybe I I told you this is going to be a

566
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:03,610
pessimistic talk if I had the solutions

567
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:09,330
to solve all the world's problems I'd be

568
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:14,099
a much richer man thanks very much folks

569
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:14,099
[Applause]
