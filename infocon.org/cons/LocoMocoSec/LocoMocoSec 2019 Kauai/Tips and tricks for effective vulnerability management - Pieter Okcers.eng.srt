1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,009
all right thanks everyone I'm thrilled

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,290
to be up here and share the stage so to

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:10,170
speak with such an esteemed speaker

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:13,590
lineup also thrilled to be in quiet for

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,570
the first time and you know at a product

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,509
security focused conference I mean what

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,250
an opportunity we have and just you know

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,430
it occurred to me not too long ago that

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,720
like you know every team I'm sure is

10
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,460
resource constrained to some extent

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,130
you'd always love to be able to do more

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,900
with what you have and to have an

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,480
opportunity like this to share best

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,699
practices you know that was a fantastic

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,559
premiere on on what a knapsack you know

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,390
training program looks like and we've

17
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,890
heard from others you know about open

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,200
source security I mean this is just an

19
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,570
incredible opportunity to take and just

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,390
try to you know not reinvent the wheel

21
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,399
but apply best practices so really

22
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,320
thanks for those that organized this

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,270
great event

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,649
just a full confession right up front

25
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,539
you know this is going to be a bit on

26
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,059
the fluffy or end of the spectrum I'm

27
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,320
gonna use words like culture and I'm

28
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,300
gonna introduce a term that I haven't

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,000
heard yet but it was important to us in

30
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,580
our journey called governance certainly

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,189
you know relationships are a big part of

32
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,439
what my team does what we try to build

33
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:17,419
on because in general what we're trying

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,589
to do on the P cert team is to get

35
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,380
engineers developers to do work that

36
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,259
don't necessarily want to do and we've

37
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,119
found through our journey different

38
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,150
levers at our disposal where we can

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,530
really drive our security agenda and and

40
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,990
partner pretty well with engineering

41
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,970
teams you know for and in particular you

42
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,619
know for those in the Ville Management

43
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,880
space where if you are responsible for

44
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:47,040
the remediation of vulnerabilities

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,229
either detected through tooling through

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,649
your bug bounty through third parties

47
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,329
what have you open source you know I'm

48
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,430
hoping to share with you some of the the

49
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,919
recipe that we've designed and we've

50
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,259
either created or tapped into that

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,820
really helps us to achieve that goal and

52
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,070
in particular what we've been able to

53
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,810
achieve over the past roughly two years

54
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:12,540
is a rough 50 percent decline in the

55
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,590
overall Volm backlog that we had an 80%

56
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,670
decline

57
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:21,540
in the average age of ulnar abilities so

58
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:24,030
pretty excited to share a story just to

59
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,690
set the context a little bit more you

60
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,180
know I work for Adobe we build tools for

61
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:32,940
creatives for people that are you know

62
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,280
digital marketing pros and our customers

63
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,560
expect in our tools to work and to be

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,569
available when they need them now our

65
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,030
customers also expect to have a secure

66
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,920
experience while using them and you know

67
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,680
there can be you know a bit of a

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,119
resource conflict there when the same

69
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,010
developers the same engineering

70
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,530
workforce is both building tools and

71
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,679
supporting the services that you need to

72
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,349
run your business and you're also laying

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,090
on them you know security work and and

74
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,340
making sure that they're taking tackling

75
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,170
the technical security debt and this

76
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,910
story is really about how we've been

77
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:11,040
able to to reconcile those two

78
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:12,690
conflicting and competing forces so with

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,900
that said just a little bit more about

80
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:19,019
myself I like to use this image because

81
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,870
I think it quickly and viscerally tells

82
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,359
the story of what my team does so we are

83
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,760
the connective tissue so to speak

84
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:30,540
between the external security community

85
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,010
and Adobe's engineering workforce you

86
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,739
know we are the ones that are actually

87
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,850
on the front line receiving either you

88
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,269
know reports through a bug bounty

89
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,010
reports directly to our mailbox you know

90
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,260
my team is the team that springs into

91
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,989
action when something really gnarly

92
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,450
comes in and you know we take a lot of

93
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,769
pride in the relationships that we've

94
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,380
been able to build with the external

95
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,319
security community I feel like they've

96
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,220
grown to depend on us and can rely on us

97
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:01,230
to get the job done and in particular to

98
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:05,609
make sure that we are responding with

99
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:08,578
the kind of intensity and and with the

100
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:10,980
right kind of urgency when you know

101
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:14,630
commensurate with the risk posed to our

102
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,630
customers and to our environment

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,539
one more word you know about the

104
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,909
partnership with the security community

105
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:23,070
we really feel that this is a this is a

106
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,260
force multiplier for us and it really

107
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,819
helps us achieve the other goals that

108
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,599
you students see up there

109
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:32,340
that my team is responsible for okay so

110
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:35,370
let's get into a little bit more about

111
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,679
the meat of my talk so you can see here

112
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,930
a graph and this is the average age of

113
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,870
vulnerabilities over time and I'm gonna

114
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:46,770
point out one key milestone here that

115
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:50,310
you can see in roughly March timeframe

116
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:53,669
of 2015 we decided to move quite a bit

117
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:57,509
of our work over to the hacker ones form

118
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:59,400
disclosure program or platform and you

119
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:02,310
know from that point onwards we really

120
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,710
experienced a fairly dramatic rise

121
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,300
year-on-year of the number of

122
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,539
vulnerabilities coming into our p cert

123
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:13,139
program and as you can imagine you keep

124
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:14,669
your resources you know static and you

125
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,289
know dump a whole bunch of more work on

126
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:19,979
the front end you know you're gonna have

127
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:22,259
less capacity to handle the backlog that

128
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:25,289
grows over time so that's the challenge

129
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:29,909
that we found ourselves into and and you

130
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:33,080
know roughly fall of 2018 we we decided

131
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:35,250
to implement a more robust mature

132
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,180
remediation framework that really helped

133
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,789
us to pretty dramatically take care of

134
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,349
our backlog and from that from that

135
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:46,680
point forward we've been in pretty good

136
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:48,779
shape so the the real what I'm trying to

137
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,630
drive out is you know I'm gonna go into

138
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:55,409
what exactly changed what recipe that we

139
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:58,020
implemented to actually make that work

140
00:05:55,409 --> 00:06:02,940
so another point of full disclosure I'm

141
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:06,359
a total sugar holic I'm in a sometimes

142
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:09,270
recovery stage more often in you know a

143
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,020
binge phase so I definitely had sugar on

144
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:16,289
the mind as I was creating these slides

145
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:20,219
but you know to me the the metaphor of a

146
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:22,800
good homemade from scratch chocolate

147
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:24,539
chip cookie really kind of continued to

148
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,789
resonate with me as I was building these

149
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:29,930
slides and thinking through what our

150
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:32,310
recipe really was comprised of over time

151
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:36,839
because you know if you think about it

152
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,949
to run a good internal vulnerable you've

153
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:41,639
got to have the writing

154
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:43,979
in the right proportions under the right

155
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,030
conditions and for the right amount of

156
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,460
time

157
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,498
and in order to get the kind of outcome

158
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,688
that you're really hoping to achieve and

159
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:53,900
so I'm gonna go into each one of these

160
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:55,889
drill down it into each one of these

161
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:00,270
individual ingredients so you can kind

162
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:03,090
of follow me with on our journey okay

163
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,438
starting off with culture we've heard a

164
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,479
lot about culture so I'm not going to

165
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:10,379
rehash a lot of what you've already

166
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,000
heard but I also am pretty encouraged

167
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:14,250
because you know the fact that you've

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,719
heard this word and in other words I'm

169
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,590
going to talk about so often means

170
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:21,319
clearly we're on the right track and you

171
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:25,500
know the more I think about what

172
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:28,669
properties that define a good mature

173
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:32,550
security culture you know things like is

174
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:35,549
the message that security is part of the

175
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,990
customer experience is that kind of

176
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,580
message is that something that's coming

177
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,009
down from the top that's being

178
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,008
reiterated you know as often as can be

179
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:45,029
and really permeating the organization

180
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:46,919
you know that's something that we're

181
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:49,979
fortunate to have an Adobe and you know

182
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,930
it's really helped us in our mission and

183
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:55,169
and again that's a to me that's a pretty

184
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,899
important you know element of amateur

185
00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:02,490
security culture

186
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:04,639
I liked the leaf's kind of reference to

187
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,560
the fact that security is embedded in

188
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,439
some company's performance review plans

189
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,089
and I think that's a very important

190
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:15,419
innovation that should be continuously

191
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:17,219
adopted I feel like you got to be a

192
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,529
little careful because you wouldn't want

193
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:22,889
to you know punish a developer for

194
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:25,050
introducing a bug in in software because

195
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,460
that could have unintended consequences

196
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,099
but you know there are certainly things

197
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:33,838
that you can measure like attendance at

198
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:36,029
apps app sect training or how compliant

199
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,070
you know individuals are with existing

200
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:39,689
security policies you know things like

201
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,279
that or how responsive they are when

202
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,680
incident response comes knocking on

203
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,079
their door yeah those are all measurable

204
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,670
things that could very well be included

205
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,739
in a performance review plan so I think

206
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,760
that's important and certainly

207
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,660
demonstrates you know another

208
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,290
wrong on the maturity ladder security

209
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,100
training

210
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:03,160
oh so another another thought you know

211
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,350
when it comes to security culture is how

212
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,779
do individuals in the engineering

213
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,389
workforce really view security within

214
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:12,730
the organization you know is this a

215
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:15,639
function that is largely a checkbox

216
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:18,040
exercise that they're just they have to

217
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:22,389
engage with just to get the code out the

218
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,519
door or or are your engineers looking to

219
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:26,800
your security team to really provide

220
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,110
value and to really help course-correct

221
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,359
when necessary and help be problem

222
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,620
solvers you know these are all elements

223
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,050
of a good mature security culture and

224
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,510
you know I won't I think Ryan earlier

225
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,310
did an amazing job of describing you

226
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,079
know what a security champion is I think

227
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,779
we've heard a lot about security culture

228
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:49,410
so I'm not going to go too deep

229
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:52,540
reiterating a lot of that now governance

230
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,910
so I think if I had to choose one

231
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,430
ingredient that really helped us more

232
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:00,160
than any other it would be governance

233
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:03,399
and before I go into it I'm gonna define

234
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,500
the term you know that that appeals to

235
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,079
me the most and and basically corporate

236
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,949
governance is essentially a framework or

237
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,729
a path that can help ensure that

238
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:15,130
disagreements that occur within the

239
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:18,550
organization are resolved at the right

240
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:22,300
level and and this is important because

241
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:24,069
you know absent that you can be stymied

242
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,139
you know when one group wants another

243
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:28,209
you know group's resources or whatever

244
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:30,760
you can't come to some kind of

245
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:32,680
resolution then you know work grinds to

246
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,410
a halt or you're gonna have you know

247
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,079
risky imbalances occurring and in the

248
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,779
security context you know what this

249
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,839
means is when you have this fundamental

250
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:46,180
conflict between how you're spending

251
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,470
expensive engineering resources and in

252
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,849
particular or if you're going to spend

253
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,730
all of your time and energy

254
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:54,190
shipping new features providing that

255
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,680
support for the new app that you're that

256
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,170
your customers really hoping for and no

257
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,390
time tackling technical security that

258
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:05,019
you know you're gonna have longer term

259
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,680
problems and so you know I submit to you

260
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:07,930
that you

261
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,959
really need to uplevel in a systematic

262
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:13,359
way the decisions you know when it comes

263
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,730
time to scheduling work within an

264
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,070
individual team Sprint's and if you can

265
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,800
up level that to a more strategic level

266
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:23,500
in the organization that has the benefit

267
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,649
of you know real-world risk to customers

268
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,270
and the longer-term view you're gonna be

269
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:30,339
in a much much better place and

270
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:33,939
certainly that's largely what we

271
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:35,800
benefited from and then because if you

272
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,680
can't do that and if you're always stuck

273
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,529
at the engineering the frontline

274
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,880
engineering manager who has you know

275
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:46,390
milestones that they have to hit

276
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,010
performance you know uh that's you know

277
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,020
focused on their performance plan and

278
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,660
did they hit their milestones then

279
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,980
you're always going to be your concerns

280
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:59,020
from a security team are always going to

281
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:02,140
be overridden by that and you know

282
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,970
importantly you know as a organization

283
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,339
that manages the vulnerability

284
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,220
remediation process you need to be able

285
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:11,350
to tap into this governance framework

286
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:14,440
you need to be able to inject the risk

287
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:18,130
that you see from your perspective at

288
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,570
the executive level in my next slide I'm

289
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,390
going to show you kind of what that

290
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,060
looks like practically speaking but in

291
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:27,459
general what you're looking to do is

292
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:29,650
identify the risk that you see injected

293
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:32,319
into this corporate governance framework

294
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:34,380
that can then you know go up level after

295
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,180
level after level and to a point where

296
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,860
you know decisions regarding how to

297
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,680
spend those expensive engineering

298
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,080
resources are made in the best interest

299
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:50,949
of your customers of the company of the

300
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:53,110
brand etc okay as promised this is yeah

301
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,750
this is kind of this is basically a

302
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:59,560
sanitized version of a dashboard that we

303
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:02,940
present to our CCO on a monthly basis we

304
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,020
found that you know this is a simplified

305
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,209
tabular format

306
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,180
you don't we didn't we intentionally

307
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:12,160
don't have a lot of graphs in here

308
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,540
because we want just the data to speak

309
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,030
for itself

310
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,800
and as you can see as you make your way

311
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,959
from left to right and you start with

312
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,050
year the number of issues that have been

313
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:25,690
reported in the velocity the number of

314
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:28,329
unresolved and then you start to have a

315
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,700
bit of a matrix as to the severity of

316
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:33,070
those findings that have come in and you

317
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,010
can use colors to kind of call out the

318
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:38,530
risk in particular and then you know

319
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:41,140
over you know we've got a tabular format

320
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,839
here and you know in those individual

321
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,760
tabs you can see we can drill down and

322
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,950
answer any questions that come up and

323
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,380
this is important because this really

324
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,640
provides the executive audience with the

325
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,570
ammunition they need to go to business

326
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:57,880
owners to really make those fundamental

327
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:00,310
investment decisions that maybe are a

328
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:05,620
bit out of balance and this was really

329
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:08,500
helpful for us okay just a touch on

330
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,540
policy you know I'm I don't put too much

331
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,910
stock to be perfectly honest in in

332
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:16,030
corporate policy but I do feel like it's

333
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:20,980
an important important vehicle to define

334
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:23,140
terms to showcase commitment from

335
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,290
leadership that have you know hopefully

336
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:28,960
bought in to policy it's an important

337
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:31,150
backstop for you when you go to teams

338
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,350
that don't necessarily you know want to

339
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,110
comply with what you're what you're

340
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:39,130
asking them to do but it's not a

341
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:42,340
motivator in and of itself and for that

342
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:45,910
reason we put a lot of stock and a lot

343
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,770
of effort into relationships and you

344
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,130
know Ryan's talked earlier on security

345
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,030
culture

346
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:54,250
sorry security champions that was that

347
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56,020
was beautiful I'm not gonna reiterate a

348
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,640
lot of what he said but you know we have

349
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,400
the same kind of philosophy it's like

350
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,140
you know how do you build up individuals

351
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,850
within the organizations that you're

352
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,920
dealing with within the individual

353
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:09,360
engineering teams to really represent

354
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,650
you and because they're privy to

355
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,110
you know these decisions that are being

356
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:17,170
made on you know when to schedule work

357
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:20,080
how far out and you know they can really

358
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:22,990
be your advocate internally can really

359
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,580
drive your security agenda and we really

360
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,620
treat our Sukie our security champions

361
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,220
as extensions of the central security

362
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,379
team

363
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:33,759
they're a really big part of what we're

364
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:36,009
trying to do and not to reiterate a

365
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,170
whole lot but you know you you certainly

366
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:40,959
want to you know you know make the job

367
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:43,329
cool it shouldn't just be a second hat

368
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,670
that someone has to wear but it's it

369
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:49,029
should be you know more of a prestigious

370
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:51,910
you know you'll honor to wear that

371
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:53,920
security champion hat I know you know

372
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,800
there's there's been a lot of work on

373
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,878
building up that reputation of a

374
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,430
security champion and we're very

375
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:04,860
selective on who can actually wear that

376
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,859
hat and it's paid dividends for us

377
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:12,660
process again not going to drill too

378
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:15,220
much down on process but but in general

379
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,910
the way I think about you know the

380
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,439
tenets of a really good security process

381
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,980
you know it's important to be cut both

382
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:27,599
consistent and flexible at the same time

383
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:30,759
and you get consistency on things like

384
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,370
how you triage an incoming vulnerability

385
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:36,850
you know your how you assess the

386
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:39,129
severity how you are interacting with

387
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,779
external parties you know these are all

388
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:46,509
should be consistent should be

389
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:49,389
dependable to be repeatable but you need

390
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:52,120
to be also to exercise flexibility when

391
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:54,399
you're actually dealing with individual

392
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,110
product teams special snowflakes teams

393
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,110
that have designed their own unique

394
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:01,569
nuanced workflows acquisitions that may

395
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,179
have a completely different development

396
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:07,270
workflow than you do or that others team

397
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:09,130
other teams do so it is incumbent on on

398
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:12,189
you the security team to kind of adapt

399
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:16,150
and be flexible when attempting to

400
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:18,069
inject work into their pipelines it's

401
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:21,390
also important to be scalable you know

402
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:23,709
can you can you ingest can you absorb

403
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:26,409
dozens or potentially hundreds of

404
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,510
vulnerably submissions at the same time

405
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:33,549
and by extension can your engineering

406
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:35,740
team handle you know that volume so a

407
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:37,360
couple of questions and I would just

408
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,390
pose when you're thinking about through

409
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,330
process you know have

410
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,910
you have you educated your stakeholders

411
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:47,460
on what this looks like what it's for

412
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:51,150
the definitions that you're using you

413
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,430
know things of that nature and you know

414
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,890
lastly I would encourage you know

415
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:58,580
everyone as you mature your process to

416
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:01,050
train your team and don't forget about

417
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,760
internal but external stakeholders I'm

418
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:07,320
thinking like your internal legal

419
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:12,990
counsel PR marketing you know things of

420
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:15,480
that nature customer support so in this

421
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:18,660
sense communication so in particular

422
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:22,230
what I'm talking about is you know how

423
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:25,380
to optimally inform an engineering team

424
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:28,710
a developer as to what's coming in to

425
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,050
you what's what's been found and you

426
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,400
know in my experience over time we've

427
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,710
been able to mature what that

428
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,150
communication vehicle looks like and in

429
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,990
general what you're trying to do is to

430
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,700
clearly convey the problem the context

431
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:46,250
the remediation that you're expecting

432
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:48,780
the time to fix and the consequences if

433
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:52,110
if you're not getting the compliance

434
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:55,560
you're looking for and just one small

435
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:57,360
note on on consequences you know we've

436
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,879
heard it over and over again how

437
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,340
important relationships are and you know

438
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,700
I would just reiterate we have we've

439
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:09,139
intentionally attempted to pose

440
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:12,330
ourselves more as partners as opposed to

441
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:14,610
combatants you know when a team comes

442
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,780
back to us and says we're not gonna be

443
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,699
able to do this we know the resources

444
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,700
one or two much you know we're under

445
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,980
pressure to do XYZ you know my response

446
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,620
is typically at least at first

447
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:29,310
how can I help you what do you need for

448
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:32,010
me you know how can I can I raise this

449
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:34,409
you know above the level at which you're

450
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:40,740
experiencing friction you know look to

451
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:42,240
partner first and foremost tooling you

452
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,850
know I'm not going to go too much on

453
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,120
tooling but in general you know what we

454
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:52,050
found works for us is you know as I

455
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,800
mentioned before we we moved quite a bit

456
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,649
of our

457
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,260
take two hacker ones program we've also

458
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,600
used bugcrowd in the past but in general

459
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,910
what that has allowed us to do is to

460
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,219
focus more on the backend the

461
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,020
remediation of vulnerabilities as

462
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,880
opposed to you know having a lot of

463
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,100
challenging conversations on the front

464
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,580
end that soaks up a lot of time and

465
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,469
effort in particular the triage as a

466
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:20,340
service that's been beneficial to us

467
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:24,540
helped us really absorb quite a bit of

468
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,639
you know the upfront load of course

469
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:30,629
internal ticketing systems are critical

470
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:33,540
to scale and you know we've been able to

471
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:36,390
develop a lot of plumbing to fetch you

472
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,790
know tickets to auto-create and to you

473
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:41,340
know basically from from the moment a

474
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:45,030
owner ability is is triaged and

475
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,500
validated the the whole ticketing aspect

476
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,720
has largely been automated so that

477
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,400
you're injecting work directly and the

478
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,320
team's backlog without a whole lot of

479
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,620
interaction that's been really helpful

480
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,770
for us to scale and then last but not

481
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:03,030
least it's also very important as i ated

482
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:05,280
as i identified earlier for governance

483
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:08,790
to work for you you've got to be able to

484
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,600
present that data in a clear easily

485
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:15,139
understood framework to you know the

486
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,310
people that can really you know make

487
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:23,670
progress for you so at the executive

488
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:26,760
level and last but not least actually

489
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:28,470
i'm on my last slide automation so

490
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,950
automation is certainly a core

491
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:34,320
competency and has becomes more so to

492
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:39,200
the security team over time you're

493
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,200
seeing this pretty dramatic complexify

494
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:50,250
entrench eventually invest in i would

495
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:52,820
caution against automating too soon it's

496
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:57,630
very important to have you know a robust

497
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:59,659
immature recipe or framework that you

498
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:02,700
can depend on and that's been tested

499
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:06,419
before injecting automation into the

500
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:08,940
into the workflow one last thought so

501
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:12,299
it's you know automation is not a

502
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:15,869
substitute for a team that's comprised

503
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:18,989
of you know individuals with empathy and

504
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:21,269
tact that are that can not only build

505
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:23,279
those relations relationships throughout

506
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:25,710
the organization but have the technical

507
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,720
chops to be able to you know defend you

508
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,759
know why it is that you know such and

509
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,489
such a finding is you know critical and

510
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,019
and why it's important for them to

511
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:36,289
remediate within a certain period of

512
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,289
time

513
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,669
yeah and it's tempting it's tempting to

514
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,918
build tools and fancy workflows but in

515
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:47,970
the end it's really the people that

516
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:50,220
count and with that I'm actually done it

517
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,419
burned through pretty quickly so I'm

518
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,480
happy to take your questions at this

519
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,480
point

520
00:22:54,250 --> 00:23:02,260
[Applause]

521
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,870
okay let me take a look at these

522
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,030
questions so what do you do about

523
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,800
developers don't want to take the

524
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:15,790
training I think that was the last

525
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:17,590
question do you collect any metrics to

526
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:19,360
specifically track the success oh that

527
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,090
was also last one so I guess I don't

528
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,770
have any questions but you know Jim had

529
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:28,919
a question about Flash in the evolution

530
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:32,740
of flash you know yeah so I mean it's

531
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,510
we've declared end of life 2020 and I

532
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,130
think you know we've seen a pretty

533
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,190
significant

534
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:41,080
you know decline in overall usage

535
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,550
development has largely as a largely

536
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,800
dried up as well so I feel like it's

537
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:47,760
it's well on its way to deprecation at

538
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,760
this point Thanks
