1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,719
a little bit about that backstory that

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,520
we got and that is one of the best

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,529
introductions I've ever had

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,469
product security obviously very very

5
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:12,030
important to blackberry I don't think

6
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,009
it's a secret we were one of the

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,870
earliest adopters of having a product

8
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,720
security team I'll go into a timeline a

9
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,070
little bit here but along with Microsoft

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,220
is very important to us

11
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,260
you know a few key reasons why there's

12
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,479
no rule book product security is

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,470
basically getting up every morning

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,330
figuring out what's happening to you in

15
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:36,660
your future and then figuring out how to

16
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:39,420
drive the company for adoption so why do

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,209
we care a lot of you probably still

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,469
remember blackberry is a handset maker

19
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,059
we're not a handset maker anymore we

20
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,120
haven't been a handset maker for quite a

21
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,120
long time I love this graphic because it

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,839
shows a lot about where blackberry

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,160
products actually are currently I

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,690
doesn't go by where I figure out

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,578
blackberries and something that I didn't

26
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,480
know they were in before so if you go to

27
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,710
a restaurant and you go to the soda

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,140
machine where you get to pick your

29
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,850
flavor and it picks your syrup you no

30
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,409
need to pick sprite with cherry or

31
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,820
strawberry or whatever that actually

32
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,439
blackberries in that machine that's Q

33
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,809
and X running that I know who knew right

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,850
so it's all these really odd places I

35
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,619
find myself trying to be a defender in

36
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,740
how do you defend something like that

37
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,810
it's it it is very it is very

38
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,369
eye-opening when you sit back and you

39
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,439
think about all the places that we've

40
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,040
become from you know the early days of

41
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:36,389
making handsets we are an end-user

42
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:40,619
products we are an OS vendor we are an

43
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,689
SDK vendor someone is incorporating our

44
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,280
technology and employing it all over the

45
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,919
deploying it all over the place and when

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,119
they deploy it offline it's one thing

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,740
but when someone's deploying it into a

48
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,509
nuclear reactor that's a completely

49
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,220
another story so we have kind of the

50
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,770
long spectrum of what we need to worry

51
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,149
about for product security and what is

52
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,369
product security operations that's

53
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,930
actually a question I get asked from the

54
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,909
bigger company is wanting to know kind

55
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,619
of what my role is a blackberry with a

56
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,000
curious eye saying okay so what does a

57
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,300
head of product security operations do

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,459
it's a great question so I have the

59
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,140
communications team I have our tools

60
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,180
team which builds custom tool

61
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,459
for defending all of these different

62
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,740
things that were in I have the incident

63
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,110
response team and then I have all the

64
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,220
programs so the open source office that

65
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,960
we've stood up at blackberry

66
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,100
some of the compliance and the

67
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,870
governance pieces that we're working

68
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:32,489
forward right now with product security

69
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:34,290
as it as it evolves so a little bit of a

70
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,020
historical view and what does a product

71
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,190
security actually do this is a fun

72
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,590
little timeline and this is not a

73
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,880
scientific process putting these dates

74
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,740
together so please don't look up at this

75
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,510
timeline and think well you know 2005

76
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,970
that's not correct but you know think

77
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,260
about this for a second it's 2019 and

78
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:54,540
back in 2005 product security issues and

79
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,829
response was a PR problem I know I was

80
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,040
talking to Katie yesterday and I think

81
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,110
it's about 2002 really when Microsoft

82
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,299
was at the point where when there was a

83
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,040
vulnerability report the PR team got it

84
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,570
they were more worried about controlling

85
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,179
the public noise about it and they were

86
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,549
actually fixing the software so it's

87
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,650
2019 you guys that's not a lot of time

88
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,440
since then right and then it was about

89
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,970
2006 2008 or so when we really figured

90
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,609
out that product security could cause

91
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,859
catastrophic damage to a company if you

92
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,810
had a breach or you had a vulnerability

93
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,670
a malware just really started to get

94
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,830
really important right about then you

95
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,230
can actually tie that back to monetary

96
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,330
damage in a company so really that's ten

97
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,500
years ago we are not I mean that's not a

98
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:38,100
lot of time in the big scheme of things

99
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:41,340
and around 2010 or so we started seeing

100
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,079
companies change and go WOW ok maybe we

101
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,160
need to start looking at remediating

102
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,930
some of these vulnerabilities in our

103
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,310
software and maybe we need help to do

104
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,320
that right so we have the bug bounty

105
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,140
where it was kind of born and and it was

106
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,150
ok to start saying ok my software's

107
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,309
flawed and I need help in order to fix

108
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,230
it that that is a really huge leap from

109
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,500
a PR problem 5 years before that right

110
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,869
and then in 2014 or so not far after

111
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,820
that we started having media coverage

112
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,350
around naming vulnerabilities right not

113
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,540
only did we look at paying for

114
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,430
vulnerability patching our

115
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,620
vulnerabilities in general but we looked

116
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,060
at oh my gosh now it has a name and in a

117
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,100
marketing campaign right we have

118
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,690
heartbleed and we have all these these

119
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,539
things and write about this interesting

120
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,240
timeframe in 2014 not even 5 years ago

121
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:25,250
which totally still blows my mind we

122
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,130
started looking at

123
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,080
the dynamic shift between a single

124
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,630
vulnerability being reported to it

125
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,840
actually costing companies money whether

126
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:38,210
or not it was exploitable that was a

127
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,890
huge turning point for blackberry when I

128
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,989
stood up in front of my SLT and gave

129
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:45,140
them reasons and data points to say it

130
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,880
doesn't matter you may or may not be

131
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,669
impacted by this vulnerability but guess

132
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,600
what it doesn't matter because if the

133
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,790
media thinks you are

134
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,500
and the press thinks you are and you

135
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,000
don't do a good job and you're your

136
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,620
incident response programs and you don't

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,510
put programs together to defend yourself

138
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,610
guess what you're still gonna pay for it

139
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,830
whether or not I can get up in front of

140
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,570
the press and say in fact we are not

141
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,669
vulnerable to this if I can't get there

142
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,130
it doesn't matter because the media

143
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,660
piece will just make it so anyway right

144
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,130
and who doesn't want to take blackberry

145
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,960
down right everybody the security brand

146
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,370
that's the security brand there were a

147
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,039
lot of companies for a long time that

148
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,300
would have liked to have seen us not be

149
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,820
blackberry anymore let's put it that way

150
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,160
so here we are to 2019 it brings us

151
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,320
about here and where I am right now the

152
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,120
main thing that I'm focused on probably

153
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,230
this year and probably next year and

154
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,790
we'll go into this a little bit more

155
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,300
here a few in a few minutes

156
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:38,180
standards and policy what you have seen

157
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:41,360
in the last probably two or three or

158
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,160
four years in the IT side of customers

159
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,590
looking at networks and holding people

160
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,720
accountable to ISO standards since data

161
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,669
standards and to all those fun words

162
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,620
you've heard is now happening to

163
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:53,299
software and if you don't think it's

164
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,470
happening you're crazy because it

165
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,520
completely and absolutely is so I'm

166
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,950
gonna talk a little bit about what

167
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,229
product security currently does in the

168
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,580
sdlc it I mean this is not nobody's

169
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:07,280
gonna look at this and disagree with me

170
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,479
this is a bit of a relationship piece

171
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,489
that I've had to build over the years

172
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,169
and what I've really realized is all

173
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,030
these great things that I'm doing to

174
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:15,140
secure the SDLC I'm working on the

175
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,210
architecture and the hardening

176
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,500
requirements in the beginning we're

177
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,049
going around you doing some threat

178
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,790
modeling and design review we're doing

179
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,620
some education on how to build better

180
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,390
more secure software with all of our

181
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,280
fund data that we have from a cert right

182
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,620
we're doing security testing and code

183
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,030
review we're doing release guidance and

184
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,310
response we look at the health of our

185
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,109
software when we release it it's a huge

186
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,639
program we have a blackberry everything

187
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,860
has a gate right every

188
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,509
single thing and where we really

189
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,009
struggled in building the product

190
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,719
security alliance that really helped us

191
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:46,729
over the last five years were

192
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:48,979
relationships because this is really

193
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:50,810
what the dev what the dev teams and what

194
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:52,279
our software vendors felt like we were

195
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,659
actually doing which was in the

196
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,819
beginning we were kind of helping they

197
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:56,389
were like yeah this is hopeful yeah this

198
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,099
is great

199
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:59,990
thanks for that design review and and

200
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:01,009
yes this class of vulnerabilities we

201
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,129
could you know we could totally

202
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,889
remediate this but then what happened is

203
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:08,599
we came to them and started complaining

204
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:10,099
you must fix this vulnerability it is

205
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:12,529
really really really really really bad

206
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:15,529
and you must fix it and our dev teams

207
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:17,060
were like why and then we would say well

208
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:21,199
it's a critical and then they would say

209
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:22,009
so and then we would say okay we're just

210
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,919
gonna wait

211
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,479
we're bleach Ilyn over here we're gonna

212
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:28,039
tell you to patch it it's critical it's

213
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,300
super bad and we're just gonna chill out

214
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:31,310
while you guys go figure out how to

215
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,409
patch that right and then when they did

216
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,300
it we would go tattle to the CSO and we

217
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:38,389
would say you know that's super major

218
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,310
release for that really big product they

219
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:42,379
didn't fix that vulnerability and you

220
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,939
should probably go do that and then

221
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:46,069
guess what we would try to do we would

222
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:48,620
try to get the release and that my

223
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:51,830
friends is not the way to do product

224
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,509
security well that is the weight you can

225
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,219
do it that way but the problem is is

226
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,149
that you're not gonna get very far

227
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:58,039
because you're gonna ruin our

228
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:00,979
relationships before you can you can

229
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:02,509
have a chance to encourage them so you

230
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:03,620
know we need to make friends that's the

231
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:05,330
biggest thing that I can give you is my

232
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,279
takeaway in this role for the last five

233
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,500
years is that if you try and push

234
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,750
product security uphill against your

235
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,399
development team it's not gonna work

236
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,539
because all you're gonna do is end up

237
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,069
getting your seaso in front of the

238
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:18,680
development organization arguing about

239
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:19,969
critical vulnerabilities so again this

240
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,560
is why we're here we need to stay

241
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:23,990
scrappy this is one of the biggest

242
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,000
things where when I get in front of my

243
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,860
SLT I have heard this more times than

244
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,750
one Christine this is what we love about

245
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,909
you guys you're scrappy you just figure

246
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,669
it out right so if we don't run friends

247
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:35,689
and influence people with dev we got to

248
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:39,019
figure out a way to have better

249
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:41,000
relationships so this was about 2014 and

250
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:45,370
15 timeframe when I really sat down and

251
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,350
realized the crux of it doesn't matter

252
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,850
whether or not heartbleed completely

253
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,770
every single piece of your software your

254
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,899
remediating it because it matters

255
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:56,930
your customers think so I had to take

256
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:58,190
that and I had to realize I have to work

257
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,930
with development to get them to

258
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,850
understand more of what we need to do

259
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,349
and less of what they think we're trying

260
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,570
to do which is gave their software which

261
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,830
isn't the point right so here's some of

262
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,570
the things we did back then

263
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,970
friends Jake Coons and I who's actually

264
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,020
here for miss base security we got

265
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,970
together and we thought you know what

266
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,310
there's got to be a way where we can

267
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,750
help communicate to these bigger

268
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,000
companies and to our dev teams

269
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,070
internally how to do product security

270
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,640
together right we all want the same

271
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,890
thing we just can't run and win when

272
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,569
we're at the end of the SDLC telling

273
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,800
them their software has a bunch of older

274
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,690
abilities they didn't patch it ask them

275
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,640
why they did it so we looked at creating

276
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,589
this model this model was really helpful

277
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,620
and again this was presented at blackhat

278
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:40,970
in 2016 and this was a really great

279
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,250
thing for blackberry because what it

280
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:46,070
allowed us to do it allowed us to take

281
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,270
all of those acquisitions you know

282
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:51,490
blackberry went through a period of time

283
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:54,290
where going from the handset vendor to

284
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,430
doing all of those acquisitions we had

285
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,939
to have a way to look at all those

286
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:00,319
companies coming in and say what does

287
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,930
your product security footprint look

288
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,490
like right all those acquisitions from 0

289
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,219
to 100 we're in different places in

290
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,839
their security maturity model some of

291
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,660
them were doing some things some of them

292
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:12,980
were doing other things but overall none

293
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,480
of them were doing everything that we

294
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,930
were already doing so we had to figure

295
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,910
out a way to look at them and say ok you

296
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,560
know whatever company we bought you're

297
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,540
here and we need to help you get up to

298
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,279
five right so this model is really

299
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,510
interesting and and since we released

300
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,070
this model of blackhat it's awesome

301
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,270
we've had tons of companies actually

302
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,880
take this model and this is really

303
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,140
simple at the bottom it's kind of like

304
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,630
level one you're not doing anything

305
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,250
right it's casual chaos something like

306
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,600
heartbleed hits a bunch of your

307
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,190
customers call and they say are you

308
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,140
impacted and you don't know because you

309
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,910
really don't know you scramble and you

310
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,380
call your dev product people and you say

311
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,719
you know are you impacted and they say I

312
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,820
don't know you have a holding statement

313
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,410
with your PR team and we run around with

314
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,740
you know it's pretty much not very much

315
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:56,270
fun right level one on your maturity or

316
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,589
level two and your maturity model should

317
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,589
really be looking at what it looks like

318
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:03,230
to have an instant response process at

319
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:05,299
blackberry we have our product security

320
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,889
team obviously is independent

321
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:08,389
there are distributed models that work

322
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:10,069
very well where you're embedding your

323
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:12,829
instant response people with the product

324
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:14,329
teams that works either way you have an

325
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:15,618
incident response process right so

326
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:17,709
that's kind of the maturity the first

327
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:19,609
step in maturity so in something like

328
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:21,559
you know heartbleed or named

329
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:23,629
vulnerability if that's your your

330
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:25,129
minimum hits you're not scrambling all

331
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:26,809
over the place to figure out you know

332
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:28,789
how do you respond to that you have a

333
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:31,579
process and it's built right

334
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:34,999
level three is really where I think

335
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:36,559
thinks get a lot more expensive but the

336
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:38,029
return on investment is a lot better too

337
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,159
and that's mastering operations and

338
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:41,809
that's a lot of wire where I came in to

339
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,449
help blackberry get to where they are

340
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:47,209
now which is looking at things like you

341
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:49,368
know are you doing a bug bounty or are

342
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:51,079
you at least having some kind of effort

343
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:53,959
to look at vulnerabilities in your

344
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:56,539
software to identify them before your

345
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:59,779
customers find them or before you know

346
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:03,049
they go public that you're impacted that

347
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:05,149
is having a PR process that is having a

348
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:07,728
disclosure process that is having an

349
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:11,239
advisory process all those operational

350
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:13,159
things that take vulnerabilities away

351
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:14,899
from the focus and make it all about

352
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:18,199
building cohesive product security

353
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:20,539
operations that's level 3 level 4 is

354
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:22,069
where I really love this is my favorite

355
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,479
part in level 4 is where you take those

356
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:26,179
operations and you look at automating

357
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:29,239
them so you bring in Jake and and his

358
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:31,389
tool to do to do intelligence feeds into

359
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:33,679
your products space so that you know

360
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:35,239
daily when vulnerabilities are happening

361
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,189
instead of looking at once a release or

362
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:38,899
once a quarter which if you're not

363
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:40,519
looking at anything now that's helpful

364
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:43,459
but once a quarter is not enough

365
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,379
once your GCE release is not enough so

366
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:46,819
you're looking at those things daily I

367
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:49,309
have some stats I'll share in a minute

368
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:51,829
around some of our vulnerability data

369
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:54,289
but when you get to this point it is

370
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:56,118
incredible incredible how much easier it

371
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:57,769
gets when it's automated right and then

372
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:59,269
the ultimate goal of level 5 and it's

373
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:00,949
where we try to get every product at

374
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:02,689
blackberry and you know again some of

375
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:06,258
them come in at different points but you

376
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:07,909
know the smart SDLC yeah you have all

377
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,439
this rich data coming out of your

378
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:12,349
Incident Response piece that you built

379
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:14,179
in level 2 and you mastered it in level

380
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:17,329
3 and now you're automating at level 4

381
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:18,889
build smarter products you know if you

382
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,388
have all that data and you can feed it

383
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:22,549
back into the beginning of the SDLC

384
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:24,319
where it's cheaper your product teams

385
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:26,480
love you because you stop complaining at

386
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:28,279
the end of the SDLC you start helping

387
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,319
them build more secure software and the

388
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,980
most beautiful part is a lot cheaper so

389
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:35,779
it's easier to get money as how I found

390
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,209
so anyway Jake and I presented on this

391
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:42,529
model and it has gone amazingly

392
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:44,508
amazingly well I I will tell you I was

393
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:47,629
very shocked at how many of large

394
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:50,329
companies who shall rename nameless that

395
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:52,040
are nowhere in this model and I am

396
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,988
constantly surprised when they call me

397
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,519
and ask me to come and talk to them

398
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:57,980
about level 3 and I'm thinking to myself

399
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,239
but you're you're so-and-so company you

400
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,829
should probably be telling me how to do

401
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:02,389
this better and they're you know they're

402
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:05,118
comment to me is no we haven't built

403
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:06,290
anything so anyway a little bit of stats

404
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:08,059
around what we do for open source

405
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:12,019
software and you know this isn't typical

406
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:14,059
to mean that it's all open source but

407
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:15,739
open source is the majority of the

408
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:19,579
things that you know obviously we work

409
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:20,869
on so we have over 2300 unique libraries

410
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:22,579
being monitored right now in our

411
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:25,220
incident response team that's crazy to

412
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:28,729
me so can't believe we do that much we

413
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,919
do have multiple versions of each unique

414
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,509
library in products and when we

415
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:34,549
presented this at blackhat and disclosed

416
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:36,739
that we had 63 versions of a saw of an

417
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:39,079
open-source library in one product I it

418
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:41,089
was really funny people were shocked but

419
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,859
then about a week two weeks later I

420
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:45,230
started getting emails where companies

421
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,749
were like oh yeah after that talk I went

422
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,819
back and dug I've got hundreds we

423
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:51,439
thought 60-some was a lot it isn't a lot

424
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:56,419
right that's what I've learned since

425
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:58,189
2016 and 98% of our of our P certs

426
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:59,839
investigations are related to open

427
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:02,329
source libraries we do look at

428
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,910
blackberry offered code but most of it

429
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:06,109
is open source offenders so the main

430
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,139
message here and looking at all this

431
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,689
data is playing a whack-a-mole hairs

432
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:13,309
really hard so if you're using a hundred

433
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:15,319
copies of OpenSSL across your business

434
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:17,149
and that means your business needs to

435
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:18,799
apply it that patch 100 times that's

436
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:22,009
hard right so you really need to go back

437
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,649
to that level four on that pyramid and

438
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:27,189
and work on automation so I'm gonna

439
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:30,679
refresh and I did this yesterday but

440
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:31,520
refreshing some of my 2018 vulnerability

441
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,290
data because I share

442
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,920
every year when I speak on anywhere in

443
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:39,680
the pyramid and 2018 was was real y'all

444
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,290
I'm from Texas so I can say that uh it

445
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,209
was really all it was 2018 was a really

446
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:48,260
hard year for us the numbers I'm gonna

447
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:51,770
show you are from 2017 to 2018 only in a

448
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,930
year which should wow everybody here

449
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,930
because this is crazy we investigated

450
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,339
almost 9,000 vulnerabilities if you knew

451
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,810
how small my team was you would be

452
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,190
completely impressed because that's a

453
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:09,410
lot that's 200% more than we did in 2017

454
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:12,050
we file the 7218 software defects most

455
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,850
of that's automated we part of our

456
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,880
customer to our custom tooling that

457
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,680
we've built we built a feed off of some

458
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,720
of Jake's data from risk-based security

459
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,859
and we automatically file Jerez against

460
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,860
our software which is pretty awesome

461
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,410
only way we could do 7200 18 in the year

462
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:30,470
but the big note there is it's 56% more

463
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:34,640
of what we did the year before we

464
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,140
investigated 900 cases 900 software

465
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,730
vulnerability cases where we couldn't

466
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,130
immediately make a determination so

467
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,540
that's a lot as well and this is the

468
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:45,670
biggest number that actually really

469
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:49,550
shocked me was a 50% increase in

470
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:52,189
customer inquiries and I want to define

471
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,260
to you what a customer inquiry is when

472
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,120
we patch a software vulnerability we

473
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,500
make that information available to CSO

474
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,290
so that they can directly tell the

475
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,690
customer what they need to know 218

476
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,490
inquiries are vulnerabilities we didn't

477
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,870
know about out of all the intelligence

478
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,120
that we watch and could not answer

479
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:10,489
off-the-cuff that's a lot that's for us

480
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:13,458
that is a huge amount and again the big

481
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,319
note is it's 50% more than we're in 2017

482
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:18,580
so that should tell you something so

483
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:20,839
takeaways here are the SDLC us hard

484
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,480
coordinating across large and dispersed

485
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:26,208
development teams really hard and again

486
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,010
there is no rulebook right so what's the

487
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:29,960
future of product security working on

488
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,340
and this is really where we take all of

489
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,170
that fun stuff we just talked about we

490
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,020
looked at on our timeline where we're

491
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:37,280
shifting to in 2019 because this is

492
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,320
where I'm spending most of my time

493
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,670
prepping blackberry for right now and I

494
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,929
know Microsoft is working on similar

495
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,790
things and again kind of why we're

496
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,880
partnering here is this really fun

497
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,670
picture of

498
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,650
of standards and regulation pieces that

499
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,970
are coming now again you look at this

500
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,590
picture and you can see some of these

501
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,720
things and you're like oh yeah suck -

502
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,860
yeah my company's working on that but it

503
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,800
doesn't have anything to do with product

504
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:01,050
security it does now it does as of this

505
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:04,250
year and the biggest reason and I will

506
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:06,389
tell you this why is because again

507
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,860
regulation is coming - software and

508
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,210
software security whether or not you

509
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,510
like it or whether or not you are ready

510
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:14,190
I can tell you that I have spent it is

511
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,750
it's coming it is coming and one of the

512
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,510
reasons why we're here today is because

513
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,220
it is coming I can tell you I've spent a

514
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,780
lot of my last six months talking to

515
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,090
financial companies for blackberry on

516
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,310
behalf of us and I will tell you here

517
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:30,510
I'm going to do my best to sum up in the

518
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:32,820
time that I have left the Y customers

519
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,650
especially in financial and regulated

520
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,800
are looking at software running in their

521
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,990
ecosystem as that you are now a vendor

522
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,970
of my company and you are now in my

523
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,130
network and in my system therefore I am

524
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,560
gonna hold you to all these audits that

525
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,420
I am being held to because you are a

526
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:52,230
third-party vendor now running inside of

527
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:54,870
my network that is absolutely the I mean

528
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,490
you can probably all know I don't even

529
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,020
need to say which financial company that

530
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,850
started with and absolutely they should

531
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,470
start with with this kind of thing

532
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,510
because they're in hot water and they

533
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,640
need to worry about it right but it took

534
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:08,340
me about seven months of working with

535
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,630
them to understand what audits they were

536
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,220
gonna hold this against you and what

537
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,840
that put me is a third-party software

538
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,900
vendor into because I have to help them

539
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,310
pass those audits and I had three

540
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,890
executives looking me dead in the face

541
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,870
and say Kristine you are either gonna

542
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,310
help us pass these audits or you are

543
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,780
gonna hurt us from passing these audits

544
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,879
and if you don't help us we won't buy

545
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,440
your software anymore so I had to take

546
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,200
that back to my c-level and I had to say

547
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,490
guys see all these like you guys are

548
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,050
worried about these on the network side

549
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,900
but guess what this all gonna start

550
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:38,220
impacting everything everything we do so

551
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,500
this is the big project that I'm pushing

552
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,980
forward right now in 2019 for blackberry

553
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:48,030
is how do I get the single thread of all

554
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:50,670
of these there's existing HIPAA gdpr

555
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,590
New York cybersecurity acts the ISO

556
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:57,149
standards were familiar with how do I

557
00:19:52,590 --> 00:20:00,070
look at the new ones in system

558
00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:01,989
system infrastructure and compliance

559
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,120
like FedRAMP and Probie which we're

560
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,799
calling can ramp because it's similar

561
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,928
and then sock to audits right I have to

562
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:09,908
in I have to worry about systems and

563
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,639
infrastructure there and then how do I

564
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:15,429
look at lacking but emerging things like

565
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:17,740
vs bomb right we know that's coming it's

566
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:18,940
gonna be regulated we know it doesn't we

567
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,669
don't know what the picture looks like

568
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:25,049
yet but it is coming and then how do I

569
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:27,580
look at things that are newly enacted

570
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:30,369
like things that California is driving

571
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,110
that are similar to GDP are 2 1 4 3 4

572
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:33,879
for auto obviously we have Q and X and

573
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,799
so that's a big deal but how do I pull

574
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:38,590
the single thread if I look at all these

575
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:41,168
controls its nauseating there's no way

576
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,850
to track this right so what is the

577
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:45,100
single thread to pull it's open source

578
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:47,439
software right if I can't get a handle

579
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:50,350
on open source software for blackberry I

580
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,610
am NOT going to be able to manage any of

581
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,980
this forward momentum for any of these

582
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,049
and that's the message so is the

583
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,340
ecosystem ready I'm going to run out of

584
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:01,299
time so I'll quickly go through the last

585
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,678
part so I just spoke at RSA on something

586
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:04,539
completely different on the software

587
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,039
release process in the pyramid but I

588
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:08,499
asked some really good questions in the

589
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:10,539
polling and this is really this is very

590
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:11,889
fun information so the first question I

591
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:13,269
asked is does your company have a

592
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:15,939
software quality checkpoint before

593
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:18,309
release well you know yes 75% of people

594
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,190
in the room said you know yes I have one

595
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:23,950
so my question was okay so if you're

596
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:27,100
reviewing so you know software releases

597
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:29,440
are you reviewing security debt as part

598
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,809
of that do you know when you ship a gold

599
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,580
candidate to the world and you're not

600
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:35,678
going to update that software for

601
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,408
another nine months do you know what

602
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,899
you're shipping with is it 10 moderates

603
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:43,600
is it 20 criticals is it none have you

604
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,889
even looked so interestingly enough only

605
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,719
10% of those people were actually

606
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:51,699
looking at their one one ability one

607
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,399
chance to reduce their attack surface

608
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,830
that software update that that's their

609
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:58,809
only chance and only 10% and these are

610
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:01,299
big companies you guys I'm telling you

611
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:02,799
y'all this is these companies you'd be

612
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:03,249
crazy you'd be shocked if you knew who

613
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,059
they were

614
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:09,070
so my follow-up question to that was are

615
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,430
you then comfortable with a level of

616
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,980
hope

617
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:15,130
sort of opens of oversight your company

618
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:17,410
has four open-source software whether or

619
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,080
not you are shipping it in a product or

620
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:22,240
you are internally consuming it in your

621
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,949
network inside your company are you

622
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,310
comfortable with the level of oversight

623
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:30,760
your company has into either your attack

624
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:32,320
surface reduction or your attack surface

625
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,300
increase because let's be clear it's one

626
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,429
or two you're doing one or two things

627
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:40,510
you're either increasing that attack

628
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:43,030
surface or you're reducing it and 5% 5%

629
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,520
of big companies are comfortable and

630
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,450
this is a seaso level audience so they

631
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,670
know what they're doing

632
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,110
I was I actually I knew it would be low

633
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,750
but I didn't quite think it would be

634
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,399
that low so here's our takeaways from

635
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,710
all this information right it isn't

636
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,240
about fixing vulnerabilities it's not

637
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,010
about all software being flawed and Jake

638
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,080
that's for you because I know that's one

639
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,120
of the things that makes you cringe it's

640
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,490
not security through obscurity because

641
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,100
it's not it is about security maturity

642
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,090
though it is about us being together

643
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,439
working on some of these common

644
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,270
solutions it's about a tactical level

645
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,900
effort because it's also not enough to

646
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,080
talk about it

647
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:19,030
right so let's be resourceful and

648
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,169
realize that we need friends we need to

649
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,690
start talking about some of these bigger

650
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:25,030
things especially as we go into 2019 and

651
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,650
we look at things like regulation that's

652
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:30,750
coming to product security and software

653
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:34,600
and let's work together and be friends

654
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:37,690
last I will leave you with this is what

655
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:40,959
it costs blackberry to remediate freak

656
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:44,080
and I know that's old it's an old data

657
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,600
sample because I put all of the process

658
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,610
in place to reduce that cost since then

659
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,560
and this is the last slide that I'm

660
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,209
going to share with you quickly so the

661
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,310
benefits of a mature open-source

662
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,110
security system a software system and

663
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,460
operations investment are here if

664
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,990
anybody needs the state of points I've

665
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,820
given them to a lot of really big

666
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:02,500
companies to take back to their c-level

667
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,850
audience to say hey we don't have

668
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,260
product security operations we should

669
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,810
probably look at investing in this right

670
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,820
we saved eighty seven thousand dollars

671
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:12,580
in large media events in a quarter this

672
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,320
isn't a year this is a quarter we filed

673
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,750
four hundred and one percent more

674
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,879
defects against open source in a year so

675
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,590
that's what the investment got us the

676
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,940
cost of supporting open source decreased

677
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,428
62% per prod

678
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,639
and I prove that with data intelligence

679
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:29,889
to defect ratio was 87 percent more

680
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:31,508
efficient so the noise that comes in we

681
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:33,549
were able to actually reduce that down

682
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:35,649
to being 87 percent more efficient with

683
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:37,870
the signal-to-noise ratio which can get

684
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:39,549
overwhelming if it's really noisy our

685
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:42,279
investigation times were 46 percent

686
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:43,570
faster so we took you know data and

687
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:45,669
intelligence and we were able to

688
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:48,009
investigate our casework 46 percent

689
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:50,110
faster and then fixes got to customers

690
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:52,750
the best data point of all we reduced

691
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:54,360
our tax surface down to the customer 12

692
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,460
times faster than we did the year before

693
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,699
so and that's it for me and I will leave

694
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,470
and take questions can you discuss the

695
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,450
origin of the vulnerable to

696
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,879
investigative intro versus external yeah

697
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:08,230
absolutely so one of the things that

698
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:11,158
Blackberry does very heavily is in

699
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:13,750
investing we invest a lot in

700
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,340
intelligence a ton if you haven't met

701
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,580
Jay Coons you need to go talk to Jake

702
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:20,080
Coons he has a product that is amazing

703
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,120
that we get intelligence feeds from

704
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,178
daily and it's CVE data I don't wanna

705
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:29,408
argue about CBE I'm just saying I'm just

706
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:30,789
saying it is you have to realize that

707
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:32,529
when I get up in the morning I have to

708
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:33,940
deal with public versus non-public right

709
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:36,100
and I have to acknowledge it whether or

710
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,750
not I agree with it or not so but Jake

711
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,269
Coons has an absolutely fantastic

712
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,610
intelligence product we built a tool

713
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:44,379
that sucks in his intelligence and kind

714
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:46,658
of spreads it out over our product

715
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:48,370
vertical we do have several other

716
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:51,909
sources that we follow I mean some of

717
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:54,039
this you guys is free you know you can

718
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:56,409
do you know keyword searches you can

719
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:57,940
have that fed into an outlook box if you

720
00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:02,649
want to some of it you just have to be

721
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:04,389
resourceful right so internal reports we

722
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:07,239
do have a research group who does a lot

723
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:12,129
of internal pen testing we process those

724
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:14,529
reports to what does 900 case cases

725
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:16,360
investigated actually means USS impact

726
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:18,159
for each open source vulnerability or

727
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,129
just have the product team take updated

728
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,659
versions available a great question 900

729
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:25,389
cases investigated we investigate

730
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:27,100
everything and we rescore so we don't

731
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:29,258
take CBS s score that comes with the

732
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,240
vulnerability we assess impact against

733
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:34,169
each and every product because you know

734
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:37,590
CBE 2018 2:22 may be impact

735
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:39,299
differently on um then it is on

736
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,730
workspaces it just may be different so

737
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:44,009
we investigate everything against each

738
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:46,859
product score it individually we file it

739
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:48,659
we do use JIRA and then we work with the

740
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:50,519
product teams to track and fix that now

741
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:51,929
the big heavy hitter there is we have a

742
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:54,809
software release gate that I was saying

743
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:56,840
so we have a release process where

744
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:59,820
software does not leave the company

745
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,869
until a certain level Odin threshold of

746
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,869
vulnerabilities have been remediated
