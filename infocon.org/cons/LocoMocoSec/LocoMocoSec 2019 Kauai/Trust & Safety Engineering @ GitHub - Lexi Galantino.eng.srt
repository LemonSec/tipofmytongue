1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,420
hi my name is Lexi I'm a trust and

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:09,480
safety engineer at github I am a dog

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:14,580
enthusiast as Jim said and I am a woman

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,770
on the internet my pronouns are she or

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,750
they today I'm going to talk to you a

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,420
bit about trust and safety engineering

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,160
which is the way my team reviews and

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,670
builds software by the end of this

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,170
presentation I hope to have shown some

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,970
or all of these thoughts into your head

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,830
so that the next time you're building

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,780
something or reviewing something that

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,030
someone else has built you too can

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,320
consider it with user trust and safety

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,690
in mind trust and safety yep

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,670
I actually had the same slide duplicated

17
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,920
that was on purpose so if this is you

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,899
right now this is my managers dog his

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,789
name is scout he's very good if this is

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,649
you right now ready and eager to learn

21
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,199
about trust and safety I hope that by

22
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,840
the end of this presentation this will

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,358
be you too cool for school but not too

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,550
cool for trust and safety and with your

25
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:07,409
very own set of trust and safety goggles

26
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:11,009
or sunglasses on so first I want to talk

27
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,720
about just a background story as a young

28
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,659
woman who is somewhat knowledgeable

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,970
about InfoSec and security I personally

30
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,640
try to keep a pretty tight grip on my

31
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,408
info sack for example my github in

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,000
LinkedIn or pretty public but my twitter

33
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,850
doesn't have my full last name and

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,740
neither does my facebook also everything

35
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,470
that can be set to private pretty much

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,600
is when I first graduated college and

37
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,420
came out to live in San Francisco I was

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,509
completely alone and therefore a bit

39
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,759
more protective of my personal info but

40
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:47,250
I was also alone and kind of lonely and

41
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:49,380
so I for better or worse joined tinder

42
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,970
now I already knew enough not to connect

43
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,798
it with my Facebook not to connect it

44
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,780
with my Instagram because they offer

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,119
that to you and it's not a great idea in

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,770
terms of privacy and not to be too

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,630
specific about where I was living

48
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,310
I was also careful to use profile

49
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,048
pictures on tinder that I did not have

50
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,329
on any other account so that you

51
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,250
couldn't do like a Google image reverse

52
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:12,540
reverse image search to find my other

53
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:14,849
accounts from my tinder photos and so I

54
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,370
in fact I was pretty sure that at least

55
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:20,280
at the time that it was if not

56
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,620
impossible at least really hard to

57
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,040
connect my profile with my other

58
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,550
accounts and my greater online identity

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,200
until I met someone who proved me wrong

60
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,760
I'll save you the full story but the

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,700
piece that I didn't count on the piece I

62
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,440
hadn't protected against was my own alma

63
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,359
mater so my college that I just

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,849
graduated from their student directory

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,120
when I got a message on facebook and was

66
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:47,040
told how the guy had found me I was

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,140
completely shocked that my school would

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,450
have made that information public I know

69
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,040
that I never would have opted into being

70
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,450
included in that directory and also I

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,109
was pretty sure that I had actually

72
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,579
opted out of it

73
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,730
thankfully this particular person meant

74
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,709
me no harm but I lost so much trust in

75
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,690
my university and you know in the world

76
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,670
in general that day that was a really

77
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:12,120
scary day for me as a user and as a

78
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,670
woman and as a person so incidentally

79
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,409
the very next day I started a job at

80
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,329
github where I get to make sure that

81
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:20,190
software at least for github gets

82
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,620
designed with user safety in mind and

83
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,930
with cases like this in mind I'm so

84
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,769
excited to share some of that design

85
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,330
process with you today so first off I

86
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:32,459
want to talk about trust and safety I

87
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,500
realized I haven't defined the term yet

88
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,780
and I want to before I really give a

89
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,340
definition I want to situate our work in

90
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:43,560
a more a wider sort of security stack

91
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,030
hypothetical stack if you will so first

92
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,080
you have the company and so they're sort

93
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,720
of at the lowest part of this

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,000
hypothetical security stack and I think

95
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,010
IT sec from what I've read protects the

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,780
company then you have sort of the

97
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,790
application you have your data you have

98
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,330
the application you have the internet if

99
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,429
you will and then all of these people

100
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,680
InfoSec nets a cap sect project protect

101
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,049
the cut the application all the

102
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,549
interactions that are going on the

103
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,840
interactions between the application and

104
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,549
the data I learned about

105
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,949
sequel injection yesterday etc then if

106
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,048
you have users any users of your

107
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:21,150
application at all or if your if

108
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,070
anything your writing is exposed to the

109
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:24,460
Internet into the public you need

110
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,099
someone protecting your users

111
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,680
well and that's us that's trust in

112
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,330
safety and so my might the point of me

113
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,180
being at this conference and giving this

114
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,039
talk here is to hopefully so that into

115
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,289
the rest of the security stack and help

116
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,729
you sort of widen what you're looking at

117
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:43,630
when you're reviewing things for safety

118
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:46,930
and security so let me define what trust

119
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:49,330
and safety is according to Kenny she and

120
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,220
what the heck is trust and safety trust

121
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,318
and safety is the foundation to enable

122
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,720
unfamiliar or total strangers to treat

123
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,900
each other peacefully and fairly I'm

124
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,759
going to pause here for a second because

125
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,929
this is my first like main idea if

126
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,630
you're gonna take pictures of slides

127
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:08,020
this is a good one just sharing what the

128
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:10,300
field is it is the foundation to enable

129
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,639
all sorts of different folks to interact

130
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,070
with each other peacefully and safely on

131
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,380
the Internet I'm going to teach you how

132
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,539
we do that

133
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,430
so at github particularly our team is

134
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:22,810
called community and safety what you'll

135
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,090
notice is not the same as trust and

136
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,889
safety it's just one more layer so not

137
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,989
only you'll see at the bottom we

138
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:31,060
discourage behavior that is destructive

139
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,860
or threatens personal safety and that's

140
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,419
the trust and safety side but we also

141
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,210
like to do good things and positive

142
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:39,370
things and we empower people to grow

143
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,830
inclusive and healthy communities around

144
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,219
their projects and around their code and

145
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:47,050
stuff like that so this is my team's

146
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:50,560
mission statement and let me show you

147
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,849
this a bit more graphically so here's

148
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,370
our framework when we're thinking about

149
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:55,870
things I'll first introduce this

150
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,909
framework and then go through each of

151
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,960
these ideas in more detail with examples

152
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:01,300
and that's going to be the structure of

153
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,969
the rest of this talk so we first

154
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,800
protect users by identifying and closing

155
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:08,169
out abuse factors I'll expand more on

156
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,870
this but essentially an abuse vector is

157
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,549
just like a security vulnerability

158
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:16,240
accepted it can be used by one user

159
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:19,479
against another to harass stalk spam

160
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,719
vote violate privacy or in any way that

161
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:25,930
it generally just really mean so we hope

162
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:27,580
here too we try to identify these abuse

163
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,199
vectors and do our best to protect our

164
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,960
users against them that that's the most

165
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,110
egregious behavior the the real safety

166
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,180
concerns etc next we want to discourage

167
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,639
bad behavior so that may be behavior

168
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,189
that is

169
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,379
really super egregious I lost my pointer

170
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:44,659
oh that's cool okay that's fine

171
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:50,060
maybe behavior that isn't super

172
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:51,139
egregious but but really just behavior

173
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:56,210
that isn't conducive to a healthy

174
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:58,310
community so often often that behavior

175
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,318
is defined by community norms and in our

176
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,939
case maintained errs we discourage this

177
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,039
by building tools to surface this

178
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:05,840
behavior to maintain errs or the

179
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:08,060
community and the tools for maintained

180
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,039
errs to moderate it we empower

181
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,340
maintained errs to shape the communities

182
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:14,990
they run on our platform finally we want

183
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,369
to encourage good behavior so not only

184
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,979
do we want to protect against the bad

185
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,800
stuff but users behave well sometimes

186
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:23,960
you know and so we want to encourage

187
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,779
that good behavior this is sort of the

188
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,669
most mature or most further along part

189
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,560
of our work and so I'll explain that at

190
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,688
the end talking about the things that we

191
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,580
can do to help sort of thumbs up and and

192
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:38,090
positively reinforce the good behavior

193
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,889
so first I'm going to talk about

194
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:43,099
protecting the things that we do to

195
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:44,990
protect or some of the things as I said

196
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:47,300
we protect users by identifying and

197
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,250
closing out abuse vectors again abuse

198
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,360
vectors are vulnerabilities not just in

199
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,699
the apps X space but also

200
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,000
vulnerabilities to social engineering or

201
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:59,180
more often stalking spamming harassing

202
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,120
violating privacy etc this is really bad

203
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,919
stuff on the internet it's really

204
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,289
negative behavior that can be really

205
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,049
really dangerous especially for our most

206
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:10,789
vulnerable user users women people of

207
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,089
color people with disabilities people

208
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:18,438
that are really in the public eye so we

209
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:20,389
prioritize this work when it comes up so

210
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:23,419
first I have an example here we go

211
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,949
so this is the github profile page I'm

212
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,349
sure many of you have seen it but if you

213
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:31,250
haven't it just it has some info about

214
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:33,439
me and then it has some repos that I

215
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,089
have contributed to or that I have

216
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,130
pinned I think I do have to have

217
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:39,890
contributed but that I've pinned on my

218
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,809
repository or on my profile page so this

219
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,458
is when someone wants to learn about me

220
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:47,949
as a developer they come here

221
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:51,040
hopefully and so and so it

222
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:53,500
this is really my space to to explain

223
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,810
like Who I am as a developer so the

224
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,029
problem we have now closed this but the

225
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:00,010
problem that came up was that originally

226
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:02,260
you could invite anyone you wanted to

227
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,389
one of your repositories and they would

228
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,630
just get added it was not an opt-in

229
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:11,019
process you just said hey I want to

230
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:13,480
invite Scout the dog to my repository

231
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:15,130
and I click that invite button and Scout

232
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,519
the dog is now added to my repository

233
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:21,490
and sometimes if you know the algorithms

234
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:26,290
did their thing my repository would then

235
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:28,240
show up right here so here here's a mock

236
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:32,260
that I did and if you'll notice up in

237
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,740
the top corner someone has an anti

238
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:40,180
Galaxy has invited me to repo called I

239
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:42,220
hate dogs you may be able to extrapolate

240
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:45,699
how someone would say much worse things

241
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,529
than I hate dogs especially on again

242
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:50,410
someone in sort of the public eye or

243
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:52,779
really just anyone so this was actually

244
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,180
used on github people used it to harass

245
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:56,980
other people they invited them to repos

246
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,899
with horrible names and horrible

247
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,579
descriptions and put that information on

248
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,380
their profile such that when other

249
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:04,089
people were sort of looking around or

250
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:08,199
came across their profile it would say

251
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:09,940
that stuff so this is a good time to

252
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:12,790
introduce the idea of consensual

253
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:15,610
software consensual software is

254
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,800
basically asking the users explicit

255
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,390
permission to interact with them or

256
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,269
their data this is another big idea

257
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:25,149
slide this is a framework that was

258
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:28,570
created by danielle leung my manager at

259
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:31,029
github and Lucas Moore and they really

260
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,640
the whole thing is giving the user the

261
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:36,910
option not just to opt out but when and

262
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,860
when possible to opt in so you know we

263
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,540
talked about consent in our daily lives

264
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,750
live in all sorts of interactions and

265
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,779
this is consent in software asking the

266
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:49,930
users explicit permission whenever you

267
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:52,630
can really so what that looks like in

268
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:57,849
this particular example in repository

269
00:10:52,630 --> 00:11:00,130
invites is an invitation and so auntie

270
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,940
galaxy has invited me to collaborate and

271
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,189
now if

272
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,710
use github you get these anti Galaxy has

273
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:09,610
invited me to collaborate on I hate dogs

274
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:14,620
and I get this email and it explicitly

275
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:18,160
says down here what happens if I say yes

276
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:20,650
to that so owners of I hate dogs so

277
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,750
that's going to be anti Galaxy will see

278
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,939
my public profile information certain

279
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,190
activity the country request origin my

280
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,670
IP address like that's that's kind of

281
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:32,830
pertinent and so I can accept the

282
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:38,170
invitation but more importantly I can

283
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:39,820
decline if I want to and so that's

284
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,510
that's really that's one example to

285
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,310
protect so then how do we discourage

286
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:47,260
again the discouraged part of this

287
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,239
framework is just talking about how can

288
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,580
we if it's if its behavior that's not

289
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,140
egregious not absolutely horrible but

290
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,580
just against the community norms that

291
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,439
are set by that usually the maintainer

292
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,450
z' of that repository or organization

293
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,210
how can we discourage that behavior and

294
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:03,010
that usually means building tools that

295
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:07,060
put the power in the hands of the

296
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:08,680
maintainer x' and yeah we did we

297
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,869
discourage bad behavior by building

298
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,420
tools to surface it and moderate it

299
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:16,360
usually to the maintainer x' or or to

300
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:21,790
users so we give you the tools as a user

301
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:25,630
to block people etc so so here's a good

302
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:28,599
example this is again one I made up so

303
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:31,390
so Scout the dog has asked are all dogs

304
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,830
good dogs and and you know I I think a

305
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,900
lot of people think oh and github

306
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,310
they're just talking about code like

307
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:40,900
discussions are never going to be that

308
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:44,349
heated or interesting Oh contraire and

309
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,939
so this is just a fictional example but

310
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,540
Scout has asked I believe all dogs are

311
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,130
good dogs

312
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,839
I think our project on github should

313
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:53,950
reflect this what do other people think

314
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,420
and - the cat who is you know can - the

315
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,880
cat as a cat he's coming in with a

316
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,439
different perspective but but he's

317
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,820
saying like yeah this can gets

318
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,670
complicated but I'd really like to

319
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,950
participate in a good like valid

320
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,030
discussion about it and that's great we

321
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:11,400
definitely don't want to stop anything

322
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:13,949
like that but then this happens

323
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:17,490
so just highlight like visit this is a

324
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:19,230
wonderful wonderful point and and then

325
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,170
and then something went down here

326
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:24,210
something happened where we got 384 hit

327
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,560
on hidden items and we do that when

328
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,960
there's too many comments to load at the

329
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,430
same time and and now all of a sudden we

330
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,710
have all these other people coming in

331
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,930
unix the cat is saying you know you're a

332
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:37,470
bad kitty like what does that have to do

333
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:40,380
with a good discussion on github and and

334
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:44,640
also a thing that we see is in this is

335
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:46,050
actually called dogpiling it's it's

336
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,360
great it's great

337
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,459
it is like other people come in

338
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,980
sometimes people even make new github

339
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:55,650
accounts just to comment and so like

340
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,090
this thread came up on barker and I came

341
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:59,189
to say you're all wrong so you have

342
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:02,400
people who are not even a part of the

343
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:05,160
community not not contributing to this

344
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,660
project coming in and and talking about

345
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,959
things which is sometimes valid and

346
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,130
sometimes really disruptive and and so

347
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,600
this is Scout the dog it's like I just

348
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:17,520
stepped away from my computer and I came

349
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:19,380
back to this like what so oh and then

350
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,530
yeah here's another screenshot that I

351
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:26,220
made from Barker news where someone

352
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:27,449
basically got is is fine with it they're

353
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,070
just really commenting about it and

354
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,080
sometimes that's fine sometimes you're

355
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,810
just talking but other times it can

356
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:37,700
bring in people from other places that

357
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:40,680
are really just there in a dog pile so

358
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,790
so what we have one example of things

359
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,760
that we have for this is temporary

360
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,890
interaction limits so if a maintainer

361
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,710
realizes that like in this case if Scout

362
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,480
the dog realizes that things have really

363
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,250
gotten out of hand and maybe a Scout

364
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,140
still wants to have a good conversation

365
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,030
about it but it's just too heated right

366
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:00,689
now it's blowing up on the internet like

367
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:03,180
now is not the time you can you can do

368
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,220
temporary you can do temporary

369
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,589
interaction limits so this one's for a

370
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,400
24-hour period and you can limit it to

371
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,450
certain people

372
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,250
so here we have limit to existing users

373
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,710
that's to stop what's called sock puppet

374
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:19,050
accounts so that stops people from

375
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:20,220
creating new accounts just to continue

376
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,560
piling on this

377
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,120
shoe users that have recently created

378
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,589
their account will be unable to interact

379
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,210
with this repository

380
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,800
you could also say limited to prior

381
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,630
contributor to say like this is a really

382
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,579
heated topic we just want people who are

383
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:35,070
really in our community and you can do

384
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,750
that for 24 hours if you want and then

385
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,520
you can limit it to repository

386
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,350
collaborators so it's like we really

387
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,850
want people who are just in the inner

388
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,100
sanctum that's probably like maintainer

389
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,660
x' and stuff we just want to lock it and

390
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,160
show it down to everyone else you can

391
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,660
also I don't have a screenshot for it

392
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,160
but you can lock the repo stuff like

393
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,959
that like basically kind of put people

394
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,819
in a timeout and sometimes that's what

395
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:59,250
you need and so that this is what

396
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,080
happens this is in this case the

397
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,690
conversation has been locked and limited

398
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,340
to collaborators and it just it says

399
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:11,070
that so that you don't get more people

400
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:13,020
dogpiling or dogs or cats dogpiling so

401
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,090
that's so that's discouraged and then

402
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:18,480
the final thing that we're able to do

403
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:20,730
luckily once we've sort of kicked out

404
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,040
all the bad behavior or most of it or

405
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,050
some of it is encourage good behavior

406
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,910
and this is where our job is a lot

407
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:32,189
happier so we encourage good online

408
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:34,860
citizenship by highlighting communities

409
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:37,290
and members that perform it well so we

410
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,590
really want to call out happy times I'll

411
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:42,329
let you take pictures of that so this is

412
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,460
the community profile this this was

413
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:46,020
built before I got there but it's been a

414
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,600
lot of fun to work with

415
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:52,319
basically my team did loads and loads of

416
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,170
research on what parts of a like what

417
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,180
what things on github signify a healthy

418
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,370
and happy community or a community that

419
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,989
is growing sustainably and it turns out

420
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,310
is these things it's a description on

421
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,390
the repo a readme a code of conduct a

422
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:10,169
contributing document that says like

423
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:12,780
these this is what people here do a

424
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,580
license issue templates and a pull

425
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,379
request template and so each one of

426
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,810
these is actually an example this is an

427
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,170
example full of examples each one of

428
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:26,339
these is an example of things that we do

429
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:27,990
that when when a when a repo does this

430
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:30,120
or when maintainer z' do this it really

431
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,510
encourages good happy behavior in the

432
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,270
community

433
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,490
so so here on the community profile we

434
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:39,760
show basically how many of these things

435
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:41,200
the repo has this is a screenshot of a

436
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,090
repo that doesn't have that many it only

437
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,890
has a readme so we give some sort of

438
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,620
some credit this is a this is a progress

439
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,690
bar over here but but the rest of them

440
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,760
we don't we don't ding them necessarily

441
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:54,580
for not having it we give them a path

442
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,190
forward so here you can add that you can

443
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:01,629
add a license and we have wizards if you

444
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:03,520
will like adding wizards to basically it

445
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,380
takes you step by step through adding a

446
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,060
license and you fill in required

447
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,800
information like your email address I

448
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,120
think and you can add a license and I

449
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,560
think that's pretty cool we have the

450
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,060
same for a code of conduct because code

451
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,830
of conducts are hard sometimes but

452
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,230
there's a lot of prior art on how to do

453
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:20,409
it so we just like have that on a silver

454
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,640
platter for you yeah and then like

455
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,990
there's some other documents and stuff

456
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,680
and then we have a wizard for issue

457
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:29,170
templates as well and and so here's what

458
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,580
it looks like if someone has one or two

459
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,680
more you have a license in a description

460
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,780
and now this repo looks a little happier

461
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,270
and then here's a repo that has all of

462
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,580
them and it's like yes it has all of

463
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,410
them it has links to each one so you can

464
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,260
go check it out for yourself it's a good

465
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:46,720
time another thing that we have that

466
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,730
encourages good behavior is we call out

467
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,990
to users and issues and pull requests

468
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,270
when it's their first time contributing

469
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,620
to the repository and we say it looks

470
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:55,360
like this is your first time outputting

471
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,949
an issue in this project be sure to

472
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,959
review the contributing guidelines and

473
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:02,860
the code of conduct and so we really

474
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,210
guide people to the tenants of that

475
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,929
healthy community that we already have

476
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:11,460
in place finally this is just an example

477
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:14,110
this is taken from nodejs obviously of

478
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,700
issue templates and so when you have

479
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,530
these like brand new people we

480
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,750
definitely want to welcome new people to

481
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,280
a community or at least communities that

482
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,650
are prepared for that do want to welcome

483
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,389
new people but it's nice to have really

484
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:28,600
clear guidelines so when a new person

485
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:30,960
comes in you can do a bug report a

486
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,040
feature request they want to I think

487
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,620
direct people who just need help with

488
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,649
node to a different repo or if they

489
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:41,020
found a problem you can you can file an

490
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,320
issue there and then we have open or

491
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,908
regular issues these don't

492
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,158
apply to you but it's really just

493
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:48,830
enforcing good behavior encouraging good

494
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:50,779
behavior and helping users giving users

495
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:54,918
basically a happy path to that good

496
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:57,080
behavior and so now I'm gonna close out

497
00:19:54,919 --> 00:20:00,350
the talk with just some like powerpoints

498
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:04,519
huh PowerPoint interesting okay

499
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:07,399
anyway building user safety into the

500
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:09,799
foundation of technology we create it's

501
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:11,840
everyone's responsibility so if you've

502
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:14,179
sown doubt zone back in if you will

503
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,860
please this is everybody's

504
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,320
responsibility whether you're an

505
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:21,320
engineer a designer a product manager a

506
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,509
security person an ops person this is

507
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,240
something that everybody can look out

508
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:27,710
for and speak up if you see something so

509
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,419
maybe like you don't have the cycles to

510
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,860
fix the problem but if you call it out

511
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:33,110
within your company maybe someone else

512
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,549
has the cycles or maybe someone else

513
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,928
really cares about this but they didn't

514
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:38,330
attend this talk so they don't know how

515
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:39,559
yet you can share this I'm really

516
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,970
excited to share the recording of this

517
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:45,139
talk and I'd love to talk more to you

518
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:47,659
about it if you want and this is sort of

519
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:50,029
the negative side any platform or

520
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:51,590
feature can and will be abused I think a

521
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:53,120
lot of people get really surprised when

522
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,189
I say that I work for community and

523
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,139
safety at github because they're like a

524
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,149
github like that's not that's not a

525
00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:02,600
social what like there's there's trolls

526
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:03,860
on github just in source code ha ha ha

527
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,370
ha ha ha

528
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:09,350
you'd be surprised or maybe you wouldn't

529
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,949
but yeah any any platform feature cannon

530
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:15,559
will be abused so I learned in Jim's

531
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:18,200
thing that and basically any user input

532
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:19,820
can is is potentially vulnerable to

533
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,379
cross-site scripting or SQL injection

534
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:26,149
etc any user input that is saved or

535
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:28,789
shown to other users in any way is

536
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:31,008
vulnerable to abuse anytime you can type

537
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:33,559
I hate dogs into a text box you can

538
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:35,509
harass someone with it unfortunately so

539
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:39,590
it's up to you to help protect against

540
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:42,200
that or surface ways to deal with it

541
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,639
once it's happened if you just don't

542
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,120
feel safe on a platform they believe

543
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:50,000
that's the best way to lose users

544
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:52,518
unfortunately and also oh that's a bad

545
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,929
copy-paste the platform may be liable

546
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:59,590
was supposed to be that word

547
00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:01,659
for abuse that it allows so so gdpr is

548
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,820
now out and now there are laws that are

549
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:07,389
saying you can't do bad things with

550
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,830
people's data so and and you know lots

551
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:10,928
of things are coming out about lots of

552
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,249
different companies where abuse is

553
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,289
happening on the platform and now what

554
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:16,299
are we going to do about it this is

555
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:20,859
important this is like protecting your

556
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:22,149
users is important so please do it so

557
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:24,309
then trust and safety in your own work

558
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:26,738
what am I like key takeaway points for

559
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:28,029
you how can you really show this into

560
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:30,279
your own work besides everything else

561
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:33,220
I've said in this presentation basically

562
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:35,230
ask yourself in the beginning how can

563
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:38,080
this feature or software be used to hurt

564
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:40,720
someone I think I think everyone can

565
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,749
sort of develop that gut reaction or

566
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,970
maybe ask around I know people who have

567
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:47,799
experienced bad stuff on the internet

568
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,139
are often very aware of how you could

569
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:53,259
use certain features to hurt other

570
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:56,889
people so it's like valid to ask for

571
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:58,779
help there too and and yet just try to I

572
00:22:56,889 --> 00:23:01,508
mean you all think about of youth about

573
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:04,809
attack vectors it's time to add abuse

574
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:06,399
vectors on to that and then how can we

575
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:07,928
discourage bad behavior in this feature

576
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:09,908
so if there's bad behavior that you're

577
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:11,980
not straight up going to block but like

578
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:13,419
you know it's not gonna be great it's

579
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,940
not gonna really help your platform at

580
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:17,649
all how can you discourage it and then

581
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,320
one more before you take a picture of

582
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:22,809
the slide um how can we encourage good

583
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,939
behavior in this feature so now how can

584
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:27,009
we not only be like no you can't do this

585
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,049
and that and the other thing but but how

586
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:31,269
can we say oh but here's a way to do the

587
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:34,259
right thing because people sometimes

588
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:36,730
actually do want to do the right thing

589
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:38,350
so this is another good picture slide if

590
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,879
you want if you're like me and you have

591
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,799
a really hard time learning from talks

592
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:43,600
because there's a lot coming at you and

593
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:46,570
you want to curl up in bed and read

594
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,168
instead go here these two are the same

595
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,908
link

596
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:51,639
I just noticed people really like bitly

597
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:54,429
so I included it but it's Danielle Liang

598
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:56,049
that's my manager slash recommended

599
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:59,399
readings or if you really want to use

600
00:23:56,049 --> 00:24:01,809
bitly it will just redirect you to there

601
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:03,279
give you a second I can also message

602
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:05,560
this or put it in the slack and stuff

603
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,420
like that

604
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,310
and so thank you so much for listening

605
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,290
to this talk this is your community and

606
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:13,570
safety merit badge that you have now

607
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:17,470
earned through listening to this talk to

608
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:19,960
earn it extra there will be a abuse

609
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:21,910
vectors workshop on Friday given by my

610
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,560
awesome co-worker and you can really

611
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,180
start it's it's you can really start

612
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,100
digging into what our abuse vectors and

613
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,360
how to identify them because that's I

614
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,250
think something that you kind of have to

615
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:36,370
build up but it is totally buildable and

616
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:37,630
finally we're hiring so if any of this

617
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,489
like blew your mind and you're so

618
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:41,980
excited to help protect people on github

619
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:44,920
you can email Danielle at github com

620
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:55,420
that's my manager and for more

621
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:56,740
information thank you so much if the

622
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,300
first question is how are you coping

623
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,920
with missing your dogs while you are

624
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,280
here can you offer me any tips I

625
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,600
actually can I read in in your hotel

626
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,270
rooms there's like a little booklet

627
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,790
thing and of course I read it and so you

628
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:12,520
can go to the Humane Society of kawaii

629
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,990
and take a dog out for the day and you

630
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,250
can just let go around with a dog for

631
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,720
the whole day and then you can adopt

632
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,250
them at the end if you want they said

633
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,240
that they adopt about four dogs a month

634
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:25,150
out of that program so I hope that

635
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:30,370
answered your question can i archive

636
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:32,320
that or just do that no okay oh okay

637
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,239
in the I hate dogs example you still get

638
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,220
an invite notification how do you view

639
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,650
the harassment risk for invites that's a

640
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,540
fantastic question I should have kept my

641
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,430
slides up oh well yeah that's a

642
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:45,100
fantastic point so you do still get an

643
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:47,290
invite you can block the person that's

644
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:50,169
that's our sort of route so if someone

645
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:52,000
is harassing you hopefully you go

646
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,260
hopefully it's one person well I mean

647
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,200
hopefully it's not happening at all but

648
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,879
if it's one person you can block that

649
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,970
person and then you will no longer get

650
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,590
invites from that person unfortunately

651
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:05,920
there are still ways around that but

652
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:08,350
yeah we doing our best and I think you

653
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:11,470
can you can contact us through support

654
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:13,620
and we've we've had some solutions to

655
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,620
that

656
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,320
it's hard to find all security bugs

657
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,330
in-house and I imagine it's the same for

658
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,460
trust and safety do you do you consider

659
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,949
encouraging external folks to report

660
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,870
those via bug bounties yes actually we

661
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:30,140
we participate in the bug bounty program

662
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:32,330
just like the security team does I know

663
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,310
I personally have written several that

664
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:36,139
have come back as bug bounties and it's

665
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:38,030
sad but I appreciate it a lot

666
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,530
so if you notice stuff like this and

667
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:42,889
github I would encourage you to report

668
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:44,899
it to our bug bounty program or other

669
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:48,260
channels that suit you contact us is a

670
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:51,530
good way to and and I'm really thankful

671
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:53,540
to people who do that have any other

672
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:57,250
social platforms like Twitter started

673
00:26:53,540 --> 00:27:01,129
using temporary interaction limits I

674
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:02,990
know that Facebook has take a break from

675
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,120
a person and I was super impressed when

676
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:09,890
I saw that especially like you know if

677
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,360
you won one design or won one use your

678
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:14,540
story that we tried to design for is the

679
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,860
abusive ex and so you know if it's a if

680
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,540
it's an abusive ex you probably want

681
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,280
more than temporary interaction limit

682
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,960
but if it's just an ex and you're like

683
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,370
oh I don't want to walk you because I

684
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,120
don't have to unblock you but like you

685
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:28,610
know you can you can take a break from

686
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,830
that person and that is temporary I'm

687
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:34,129
not sure if Twitter has that I don't

688
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:36,199
know how would you recommend security

689
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:38,480
teams provide self-service guidance to

690
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,010
engineering teams to help them design

691
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,690
new features with this kind of stuff in

692
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:44,000
mind that's a great question and that's

693
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:46,610
one that we at our company are also sort

694
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,620
of wrestling with because our company

695
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:51,740
has now scaled a little bit larger than

696
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:54,530
like we can review every single feature

697
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,570
we do have a formal review process for a

698
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,670
lot for like big features that come out

699
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:00,139
and and unfortunately a lot of it is

700
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,910
like internal marketing where we're like

701
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,560
hey hey we're camps we have this logo

702
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:06,290
and we have Scout please remember us

703
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,510
because you remember the dog like asked

704
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:10,790
us for a review of your feature and so

705
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:13,010
we just did that for Adam just shipped

706
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:15,350
review comments within Adam which is

707
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,879
super cool but but basically the

708
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,709
engineer came to us and they were like

709
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,570
hey can we talk about all the different

710
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,730
ways this can be abused and it was super

711
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,860
productive so I guess that's not really

712
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,520
self-service I think the other thing is

713
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,620
just education

714
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,139
sharing you can share this talk you can

715
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:33,600
share the resources that I shared and

716
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:36,000
and just try to build that culture

717
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,330
within your company which is you know

718
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,130
hard and stuff but um but yeah I think I

719
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,889
think education and lunch and learns or

720
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,760
I gave this talk first to other members

721
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,610
of our company

722
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,160
the octo prentices to just try to sort

723
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,270
of spread the word so training education

724
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:57,120
basically what everyone else has been

725
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:58,860
saying and I think that's it yeah I

726
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,540
think that's it awesome thank you so

727
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:05,219
much

728
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,220
[Applause]
