1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,480
let us talk about bug bounty Botox

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,949
versus natural beauty I have a lot of

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,599
slides and I'm gonna go quickly through

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,700
some of them but I'm gonna tell you

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,290
upfront that all of the studies and all

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,820
the data that I referenced in this talk

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,160
I have a reference slide at the end

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,439
don't panic and I will make the slides

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,970
available at the end so you don't I mean

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,750
you can photograph them all but you

11
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,150
don't have to ok so Who am I you know

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,130
got a great introduction there this is a

13
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,969
Twitter word cloud of the things I find

14
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,980
very important to tweet about by the way

15
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,790
after the luau if anyone wants to do

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,769
karaoke I am down we did some impromptu

17
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,120
karaoke by one of those fire pits last

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,539
night I didn't tell anybody about that

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,879
until now but it happened but yes if

20
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,239
you're curious about my last name it is

21
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:54,180
Greek I am half Native Pacific Islander

22
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,360
and actually I named my company luta

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,899
security that's with a hard T and that

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,090
is a nickname for the island 40 nautical

25
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,010
miles north of Guam where my mother was

26
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,400
born on the map the island is called

27
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,110
rota but the Islanders call it lucha the

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,119
friendliest island you wave to people as

29
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,780
you drive by and most of the island is

30
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:19,110
my family so anyway here you say Aloha

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,270
in in Chamorro which is the language and

32
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,820
the ethnicity of my people on my mom's

33
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,850
side you say half a day so can you say

34
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,899
half a day for me half a day pretty good

35
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,640
yeah that's pretty good

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,579
that's all I can say in tomorrow except

37
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,610
for swears okay so I've done a lot of

38
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,500
these things we're gonna talk about this

39
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,179
is actually how I describe to my family

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,759
what I do a picture is worth a thousand

41
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,700
words and since I'm half Greek when I

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,320
testified before the Senate last year I

43
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,820
had to help them with my last name

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,279
because it was like the fifth or ninth

45
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,169
time they tried to call on me the

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,590
Senators tried calling on me at the uber

47
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,600
data breach you know hearing about how

48
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,079
they misused their bug bounty program

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,630
and paid out some extortionists $100,000

50
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,429
which was 10th out ten times the bug

51
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,549
bounty maximum amount and we'll get into

52
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,099
that a little bit later but the Senators

53
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,870
were having trouble so of course I went

54
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,440
to my go-to after the fifth or seventh

55
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,050
time

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,030
mas horas like a dinosaur and I made

57
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,060
t-rex arms for the Senators so that is

58
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,740
how I taught them how to pronounce my

59
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,920
last and KTM asaurus rex it's super easy

60
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:28,320
now right so okay I'm realizing that I

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,410
cast a large shadow I'm gonna stay here

62
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,810
this is where I will stay so how did we

63
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,210
get here to bug bounty Botox land I mean

64
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,620
I just was introduced as one of the

65
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,720
biggest proponents of some of the

66
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,420
biggest bug bounties in the world what

67
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,070
wasn't mentioned there is I also helped

68
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,510
drive the creation of hack the Pentagon

69
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,640
how many of you heard the hack the

70
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,160
Pentagon first bug bounty program of the

71
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,519
US government and first bug bounty

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,260
program of the military right other

73
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,550
governments had experimented with bug

74
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,459
bounties but certainly this was the

75
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,860
first military sponsored bug bounty of

76
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:07,200
the largest military the world has ever

77
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:09,150
known but we're here because the last 20

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,450
years I have been professionally in the

79
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,270
security industry and I've noticed that

80
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,980
we're pretty good at selling stuff

81
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:19,830
really good it it's a multi-billion

82
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,790
dollar 170 billion dollar industry by

83
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,920
2020 but wait a minute everything's

84
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,109
still broken and some of the fundamental

85
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,700
things like you know it used to be try

86
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,890
to get the vendor to pay attention to

87
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,000
you so that they would create a patch at

88
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,170
all but even when you have a patch

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
applying the patch is still very

90
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,299
inconsistent so it's like that relay

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,709
race of you know security response where

92
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,330
you might hear about a vulnerability or

93
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,250
a potential vulnerability you go through

94
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,360
and you investigate you determine

95
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,400
whether or not it's a vulnerability

96
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,760
whether it's exploitable how severe it

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,010
is

98
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,019
and then you issue a fix or a mitigation

99
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,420
or some combination of both but then

100
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,550
it's that last mile or in Europe last

101
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,890
kilometer of trying to get them to apply

102
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,570
that patch right and still everything's

103
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,518
broken multi-billion dollar industry

104
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,070
really good at selling stuff still

105
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,620
broken because we keep trying to sell

106
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,170
these silver bullets are there rail rows

107
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,000
on Hawaii I don't know because there

108
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,769
aren't any in in the rest of the world

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,358
that I have observed so I don't think

110
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,548
these silver bullets work very well

111
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,370
because it's not actually solving

112
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:25,859
anybody's problem guess why one there

113
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,820
are no werewolves but - everybody's a

114
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,340
little bit different

115
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,140
so let's go ahead and go through some

116
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,780
definitions here I talked about

117
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,090
vulnerability disclosure some people use

118
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,210
that term interchangeably with bug

119
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:42,419
bounties they are not the same thing and

120
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,770
some people use the terms penetration

121
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,890
testing in bug bounties somewhat

122
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,560
interchangeably but also trying to say

123
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:52,289
there's some greater value proposition

124
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,390
of one versus the other so what is

125
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,970
Voland disclosure it is really the

126
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,550
process by which anyone outside your

127
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,890
organization tells you about a potential

128
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,660
vulnerability and you do some

129
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,060
investigation and you come to some

130
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,130
conclusion and then ideally you release

131
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,470
some something about it an advisory

132
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,630
apache ssin they're governed by the

133
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,220
following two standards jorge who's

134
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,440
still in here is a co-editor of these

135
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,380
two standards along with art Manion from

136
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,530
cert CC the oldest running computer

137
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,390
emergency response team in the world and

138
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:27,330
I am and I am also an editor and author

139
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:29,550
of these standards so ISO 29 147 is the

140
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:34,109
Volm disclosure part it's the process of

141
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:36,000
receiving and then ISO 3 0 1 1 3 0 1 1 1

142
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,890
is the process internal to every

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,050
organization that makes that

144
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,419
determination of you know let's do an

145
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,200
investigation let's do an internal

146
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,330
triage and you know deciding the

147
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,430
priority of the fixes maybe you've got

148
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,409
20 critical vulnerabilities what's the

149
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,330
priority of fixing those 20 criticals

150
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,830
right so it's all that internal process

151
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,440
and the creation of the patches and the

152
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,120
mitigations and then the process

153
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,910
basically goes back out to the other

154
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,130
standard ISO 29 147 for the release

155
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:09,750
portion so if you want to think about it

156
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:12,960
in graphics graphic terms ISO 2001 147

157
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:15,330
is the mouth and the other end and ISO 3

158
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,120
0 1 1 1 is the digestive system of

159
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,909
vulnerability management penetration

160
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,070
testing originated about 20 years ago

161
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:26,700
does anyone here remember a company

162
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:30,120
called at stake yes I am not the oldest

163
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,219
person in the room awesome so I grew up

164
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,060
in Boston around the guys who were in

165
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,290
the loft

166
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,750
those guys eventually formed a

167
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,130
consultancy early on in 1999 called at

168
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,870
stake this was one of the first

169
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,480
application penetration testing

170
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,670
companies

171
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,880
and the kinds of arguments that we would

172
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,380
get from organizations where things like

173
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,120
wait you're a bunch of hackers and we're

174
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,940
supposed to pay you to point out our

175
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,220
bugs what if you just hold on to those

176
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,050
bugs how can we trust you will you find

177
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,330
all the bugs how can we guarantee the

178
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,280
code coverage and all that stuff and so

179
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,409
we had to actually work not just as pen

180
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,150
testers but as educators of an entire

181
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,270
industry that no we weren't going to

182
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:10,270
find every single bug we were gonna give

183
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,880
you demonstrable ideas about how secure

184
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,039
you were overall we were gonna tell you

185
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,860
what vulnerabilities we found where we

186
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,560
found them how to fix them and ideas for

187
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:24,220
remediation and also at stake was unique

188
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,870
then and now in that we were pen testers

189
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,610
who wanted you to never make those same

190
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,680
mistakes again so we offered to teach

191
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,140
you how to fish we left behind our tools

192
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,640
we gave training and we did all of this

193
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,650
stuff to basically try and improve the

194
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:40,960
security ecosystem and we were so

195
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:44,460
hopeful I'm gonna say we were young but

196
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,539
no we really were full of hope so the

197
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,430
characteristics of a penetration test is

198
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,050
that consultants themselves are vetted

199
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,550
for skill they're already background

200
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,090
checked you know in terms of employment

201
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:57,160
and whatnot usually having clean

202
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:59,710
backgrounds most most pen test companies

203
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,080
don't hire convicted felons of hacking

204
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,000
some do but most don't and so you have

205
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,280
this assurance sort of built in to

206
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,890
penetration testing there were contracts

207
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,719
there were NDA s and also from a

208
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:14,260
vulnerability investigation flow

209
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,020
perspective you could control the volume

210
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,849
you know of your cases you also could

211
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,370
get a giant report full of hundreds of

212
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,990
bugs and decide the pace at which you

213
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,040
would prioritize and fix those issues

214
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,380
because they're not going to be

215
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,020
disclosed they're under NDA and then

216
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,210
here's the different thing different but

217
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,689
same same but different different very

218
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,669
different bug bounties bug bounties did

219
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,080
not originate when I launched the

220
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,990
Microsoft ones nor did they originate

221
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,300
when Google launched theirs in 2010 they

222
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,870
actually originated back in 1995 anybody

223
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:49,900
remember say it yell it

224
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:52,260
Netscape that's right 1995 so it didn't

225
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,000
really catch on in the mainstream until

226
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,790
Google launched

227
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,210
they're bug bounty in early 2010 anybody

228
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:03,660
remember how much

229
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:07,140
that's right 1337 dollars leet dollars

230
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:10,020
for a bug bounty and how they've evolved

231
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,699
since 2010 to now and where the

232
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,280
shortfalls are in the current market is

233
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,660
what we're going to talk about alright

234
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:21,030
so a lot of people say that you know

235
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,189
this should be easy everyone should be

236
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,810
doing this at least do a full disclosure

237
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:27,450
program even if you're not gonna pay bug

238
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,459
bounties what are you afraid of just

239
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,980
open the front door see what happens

240
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,390
otherwise you know the argument is the

241
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,680
bad guys are testing you anyway and

242
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,800
you're just not getting the report

243
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,380
that's a famous quote about about doing

244
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,839
Vohland disclosure in bug batteries but

245
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,210
what could possibly go wrong well most

246
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,430
people are expecting just white hat

247
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,770
maybe a couple gray hats maybe a little

248
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,910
bit of a flood but not too bad you know

249
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,569
but it's usually something a little

250
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:57,000
closer to this and there are a few

251
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,010
different areas to kind of unpack here

252
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,240
right how do you distinguish friend from

253
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:05,010
foe how do you distribute your incident

254
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,230
response resources when you're trying to

255
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,430
determine is this a real attack or is

256
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,410
this someone just testing and they're

257
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,939
about to tell me what it is that they're

258
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:16,290
doing what about data privacy right

259
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,900
there are protected classes of data

260
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,329
healthcare data PII of various kinds

261
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,880
that have regulatory breached reporting

262
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,770
requirements associated with them right

263
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,070
remember the uber data breach that

264
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:32,670
happened you know it's it was basically

265
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:35,250
where these hackers had found some creds

266
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,750
and then they tried to report it you

267
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,220
know exchange for money they actually

268
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,350
didn't know about the bug bounty program

269
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,850
they were redirected there which was

270
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:45,480
good that's the appropriate thing to do

271
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:48,089
and then what had happened was basically

272
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,400
to prove the severity of what they had

273
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:52,350
found they ended up downloading 57

274
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:56,400
million records that's like a little

275
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:58,350
just a proof of concept right but the

276
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,900
thing was you know with that with that

277
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,390
having happened what what over did

278
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,550
really well during that hearing was they

279
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,850
took full responsibility for making the

280
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,349
wrong call on that one

281
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,329
and I really admire them for doing that

282
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,980
because you know essentially they just

283
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:13,810
said it was the wrong call

284
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,870
we should have reported it as a breach

285
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:19,420
instead we used our bug bounty platform

286
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,130
to effectively you know just pay out an

287
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,079
extortion fee they called it that during

288
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:26,620
during the trial or during it wasn't a

289
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:28,540
trial during the hearing so I think they

290
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,440
did a good job of recognizing and

291
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:34,870
correcting but the damage to the market

292
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,120
perception and the ecosystem may have

293
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,339
already been done right because if you

294
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,199
think about it we're building a

295
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:42,459
defensive market for bugs right

296
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:44,258
everybody knows there's an offense

297
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:45,699
market for bugs people call it the black

298
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:47,740
market it's not really a black market

299
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:49,959
because it's not illegal it's the

300
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,269
offense market because nation states

301
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,060
cyber criminals etc are buying

302
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:57,069
vulnerabilities at high prices in order

303
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,319
to keep them private for as long as

304
00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:01,149
possible keep them unpatched and use

305
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:03,430
them against targets so that's why

306
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:05,230
that's the offense market but we were

307
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,060
trying to grow the defense market we

308
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,970
were trying to make it easier for

309
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,979
individuals anywhere in the world to

310
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:15,339
find vulnerabilities use their skills

311
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,800
and get paid but so one of the things

312
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:19,269
that happened was they were asked to

313
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,199
delete all the data which they did and

314
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:22,720
signed an NDA

315
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,550
and these folks aren't lawyers these

316
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,430
these hackers who had done this so they

317
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,930
thought great we got paid ten times what

318
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,089
we would have gotten paid you know if we

319
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,380
had just done the bounty program and we

320
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:35,170
signed this NDA and we did what they

321
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,589
asked us so we're safe well it doesn't

322
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:41,170
necessarily protect them from being

323
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:45,370
potentially sued by the victims right

324
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:47,649
and in fact it confused them enough that

325
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:51,130
the same hackers who were involved in

326
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:54,130
that uber situation were later indicted

327
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:57,130
for trying the exact same trick on a

328
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:59,350
subsidiary of LinkedIn so they clearly I

329
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,370
don't think I mean I don't know but it

330
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,480
doesn't seem like they would have

331
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,509
maliciously done it they were just

332
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,000
really confused by the way this has

333
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:09,220
played out so thinking about data

334
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,889
privacy distinguishing friend from foe

335
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,569
do NDA's protect your organization from

336
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:15,639
further legal action we saw in the uber

337
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:19,750
data breach it did not and do the NDA's

338
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:21,100
protect the hackers absolutely not so

339
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,040
what is going to

340
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,750
when our machine overlords come and

341
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,880
start finding vulnerabilities in more of

342
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,029
an automated fashion anybody familiar

343
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:34,000
with the DARPA cyber grand challenge

344
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:35,470
okay so before that occurred the DARPA

345
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,149
folks had asked me you know what I

346
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,779
thought about whether or not they should

347
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:42,910
do an AI driven challenge that would

348
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:45,540
find and the quote that made my eyes

349
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:49,480
turn big was what if we could find

350
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,640
10,000 vulnerabilities via AI and I said

351
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,440
you will break every security response

352
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,270
team on earth I will tell you that like

353
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,459
you know essentially and they said well

354
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,350
no no what if we had it also a I

355
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:01,359
automatically patch everything and I

356
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,640
said you know if it were that easy to

357
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,290
auto patch I'm pretty sure we wouldn't

358
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,939
have had you know want to cry et cetera

359
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,439
like this is you know there are app

360
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,690
compat issues backwards compatibility

361
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,010
issues all kinds of things people still

362
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,440
have to test patches in their

363
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:17,260
environments so they basically made the

364
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,990
grand challenge against an artificial

365
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,360
target because otherwise you know it

366
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:27,339
would have been effectively you know

367
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:29,589
inciting a riot of bugs that no security

368
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:31,510
organization on earth today including

369
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:33,790
the biggest one that I've ever heard

370
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:36,040
about Microsoft to be able to digest

371
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:39,040
those I remember once we got 700 crash

372
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,199
dumps from a researcher at cert CC and

373
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,569
just the mechanics of trying to decide

374
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,580
okay do we open one case and then have a

375
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:47,950
bunch of child cases but what if some of

376
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,270
these crashes are you know root cause is

377
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,740
different okay then we were gonna have

378
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,689
to move these cases to make just a I

379
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,970
mean it was a nightmare of logistics

380
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,810
right so that was just 700 from one

381
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:01,450
friendly front one friendly researcher

382
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:03,609
okay so this is a true story I gave a

383
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:06,430
keynote at our be a sec Jake is the

384
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,620
speaker right after me and in Richmond

385
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:12,760
two days before my keynote this happened

386
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:14,560
so this guy had some mental illness

387
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,630
luckily he wasn't hurt and nobody else

388
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,479
was hurt in this incident and mental

389
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:21,250
illness is a really serious issue but we

390
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:26,380
can kind of take a look at this he was

391
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:28,990
tweeting from this armored vehicle that

392
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,390
he had stolen from a base and he drove

393
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,100
it around Richmond

394
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,870
and was eventually apprehended okay I

395
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,870
don't know if we got sound on this but

396
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:41,110
let's give it a go if not oh yeah there

397
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:45,070
we go so this went on for hours this is

398
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:49,540
actually the end of the chase through

399
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:52,690
two days before my keynotes and as you

400
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,339
can see bypassers okay there swear words

401
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,550
people cover your ears if you're just

402
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:58,990
delicate but these people are watching

403
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,609
this armored vehicle now this thing's

404
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:08,980
only going about 40 miles an hour that's

405
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:10,750
like top speed okay but yeah so luckily

406
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,360
it didn't have any weapons this is one

407
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:15,279
of the unarmed vehicles no crashes no

408
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,430
injuries but look at how many real

409
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,980
incident response resources we're tied

410
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,719
up in the investigation eventually he

411
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,600
was tased and everything and nobody was

412
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,279
hurt but he claimed that he had

413
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,010
authorization and he was performing a

414
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:33,130
test he had actually done some InfoSec

415
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,899
stuff as well so a lot of the fears of

416
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,160
organizations when they open up their

417
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:39,430
front door to vulnerability disclosure

418
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,250
is if they've accidentally authorised

419
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:45,640
something that would tie up their real

420
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:47,649
resources or that in fact even if they

421
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,420
didn't authorize it explicitly that

422
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:52,420
someone would claim that they thought

423
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,829
they had authorization so don't the bug

424
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,959
bounty platform's take care of this for

425
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:57,939
you right they're gonna manage this

426
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:00,459
flood they're gonna deduplicate the

427
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,279
issues only cherry-picked real

428
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:05,649
vulnerabilities are gonna come through

429
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:09,849
but isn't that relying on a source of

430
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:11,260
labor that is in fact finite right so

431
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:13,409
when I used to work at Microsoft I was

432
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:16,839
there from 2007 to 2014

433
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:19,809
2007 popular science called a Microsoft

434
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,609
security grunt among the top 10 worst

435
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:23,589
jobs in science we were somewhere

436
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:27,219
between elephant vasectomized

437
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:30,460
and whale feces researcher we were we're

438
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:33,250
in there and we made t-shirts oh yes we

439
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:36,510
did so here's the thing that role is

440
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:39,850
full-time regular employee non contract

441
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:43,059
six-figure paying benefits all of that

442
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,860
stuff we couldn't keep people in that

443
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,750
role

444
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:49,019
for more than 12 to 18 months there's

445
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:51,419
the highest turnover rate why because

446
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:53,490
it's exhausting and if you're actually

447
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:56,640
really good at it you want to end up

448
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:58,740
doing something else right so let's take

449
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,240
a look at the scale a hundred fifty

450
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,299
thousand to two hundred thousand

451
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,820
non-spam email messages a year going

452
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:07,980
into secured at Microsoft now there was

453
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,769
a recent I saw a recent nsrc

454
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,289
presentation I think it was last spring

455
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:14,970
so fairly recent where they actually

456
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:18,149
said that number is the same now this is

457
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:20,639
five years post bug bounty and I'll say

458
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:22,110
why that might be the case because you

459
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:25,080
know for the biggest software company in

460
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,269
the world we sure got a lot of love for

461
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,299
free so one of the executives of

462
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:31,769
Microsoft had sworn publicly said we

463
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:33,600
will never pay for vulnerability

464
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:36,750
information why cuz they were already

465
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,309
getting flooded out okay whale feces

466
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,669
researcher all these that you know

467
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:43,860
elephant vasectomies anyway so even if

468
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:46,049
you can filter everything a bad stuff

469
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:49,408
out there's such a thing as too much

470
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:51,450
chocolate too much of a good thing right

471
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:53,370
so eventually if your process your

472
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:56,309
digestive system for these bugs is

473
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,840
ill-equipped you'll end up having a huge

474
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:59,899
backlog you don't know what to do with

475
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,279
and if you're failing at prioritization

476
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:04,049
well that backlog just gets worse and

477
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,860
eventually someone's gonna catch you

478
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:11,220
with bugs melted all over you anyway so

479
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,949
I do have an entire presentation about

480
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,289
this from this maturity model for

481
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,389
vulnerability coordination which I had

482
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:20,519
created and it's more than just

483
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:22,590
engineering it's more than just having

484
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,240
people who can examine the bugs so if

485
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,519
you want this presentation there's a

486
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,220
reference to it at the very end of the

487
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:31,769
slides and I had given this this one at

488
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:35,309
RSA I forgot what year because it's been

489
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:37,710
a long career anyway the idea here is

490
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:39,029
that organizations should benchmark

491
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,059
their capabilities in not just

492
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:44,100
engineering but communications the

493
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:46,309
organizational support it takes to run

494
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,570
and fund these programs sustainably

495
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:50,129
doing analytics such that you're not

496
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,720
just playing whack a bug but you're

497
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,210
actually seeking to get better and

498
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,550
looking to measure how well are you how

499
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,920
well

500
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:59,860
doing and then looking at incentives

501
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,920
it's not just all about cash though

502
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:06,340
so this is from a different presentation

503
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,840
where I had done some research with MIT

504
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,090
Sloan School in Harvard Kennedy School

505
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,730
on the vulnerability economy and exploit

506
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,399
market and what we found useful was to

507
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,500
use a vulnerability taxonomy not all

508
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,300
bugs are created equal there are some

509
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,330
that are easy to find easy to fix

510
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:24,760
some are easy to find hard to fix the

511
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,399
exploit ability of bugs is different and

512
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,350
also the market dynamics you know some

513
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,680
people will swear to you that if you

514
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:34,600
don't pay a bug bounty then the black

515
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,790
market is going to pay for them now I

516
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,129
highly doubt that there is an offense

517
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,540
market for every bug how many of you

518
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,570
believe there's an offense market for

519
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:46,560
every bug exactly thank you you are all

520
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:51,100
either not listening or very honest

521
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:53,590
so there's also human dynamics right we

522
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,540
need to know why it is that people are

523
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,429
focusing in on certain bugs and this

524
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,830
changes the dynamics and the priorities

525
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:03,010
of any individual book so this will come

526
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,510
up a little bit later a lot of

527
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,070
organizations say you know I really want

528
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,950
to start a bug bounty program because

529
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:10,510
I'm really interested in ants but

530
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,210
actually they start one and all they get

531
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,370
her bees okay there's a deliberate type

532
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:19,030
mismatch in the bugs that are described

533
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:21,550
here often that again ties up their

534
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,960
resources that they wanted to spend

535
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,270
looking for interesting bugs so for

536
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,150
example you know Microsoft would get bug

537
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:30,550
reports for all versions of ie all the

538
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,830
way down you know and as long as that

539
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,240
version was still supported Microsoft

540
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,310
still had to service it but it wasn't

541
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,620
actually telling Microsoft a whole lot

542
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:40,870
about its new security engineering

543
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,659
processes its best efforts right so you

544
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,949
want to hear about bugs and your latest

545
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,540
but maybe you want to hear about bugs

546
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,220
and your most widely deployed which

547
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,270
might not be your latest so there's a

548
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,940
whole bunch of things that an

549
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:53,470
organization can want to hone in on but

550
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,570
if they have Hazard Lee throw the doors

551
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,060
open and kind of say just report these

552
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,980
bugs in the various they might end up

553
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:04,899
with something they didn't really want

554
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:07,330
to spend a lot of cycles on so what does

555
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,559
it get you paying for bugs versus

556
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:12,279
actually becoming

557
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,899
secur right now the majority of bug

558
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:15,249
bounty bugs are cross-site scripting I

559
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,168
believe there was a Google presentation

560
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:19,779
earlier today and that was also the case

561
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:21,159
with with some of their bug data but

562
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:22,600
certainly on the bug bounty platforms

563
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:26,019
they release reports in the majority of

564
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:29,168
cross-site scripting now there are tools

565
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:30,580
that are available to find lots of

566
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:32,950
cross-site scripting bugs not all of

567
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:35,678
them but certainly lots of them so why

568
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:38,529
are organizations choosing to outsource

569
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,539
and replace much of their own security

570
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:42,369
due diligence with this well maybe

571
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:44,169
because they've been told that it's more

572
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:47,918
cost effective than traditional

573
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:50,559
penetration testing but remember we

574
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,259
can't wait until after code is released

575
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:56,529
and after services are online to test

576
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:57,429
for security bugs we as at stake astride

577
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:59,049
to tell people this

578
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,179
you can't pen test your way to security

579
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:04,330
and you certainly can't bug bounty your

580
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:07,029
way to security that is what I call bug

581
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:10,059
bounty Botox you're basically trying to

582
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:11,889
do a veneer of looking like you care

583
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:14,740
about security but are you getting

584
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:16,869
better are you making sound security

585
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,749
investments and are you actually moving

586
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:22,449
it so that you are becoming due diligent

587
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:26,710
or doing your due diligence as opposed

588
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:28,330
to just looking like you're busy so what

589
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:32,590
are some of these myths motivations in

590
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:34,418
this marketplace the myth that bug

591
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,639
bounties are the logical end goal of all

592
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:38,409
Voland disclosure programs but you're

593
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:40,360
not really fully mature until you have a

594
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:42,190
bug bounty program well how many of you

595
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,799
think that it's a good idea to have a

596
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,299
bug bounty program on industrial control

597
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,539
systems that can take down the power

598
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:51,249
grid okay all right wait his hand went

599
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:54,759
up but his thumb went down okay I just

600
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:57,519
don't do this to me I had a heart attack

601
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:59,190
me it was like oh okay

602
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,999
but here's the thing you know it's not

603
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:03,309
necessarily on its own a measure of

604
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:04,929
maturity same thing myth hackers will

605
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,789
only look for bugs and exchange for cash

606
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:08,769
I'm gonna dispel that one with an

607
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:11,769
example in a minute but it's an overall

608
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:13,600
trend right and actually I think I was

609
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:17,200
seeing on Twitter that Charlie Miller

610
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,539
and Chris valasek famous car hackers and

611
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,299
everything who have been working on car

612
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:25,059
security for a long time well they don't

613
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:26,649
do carb of bounties they are highly

614
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:28,509
skilled in this specific area and they

615
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:30,969
have families so they like full-time

616
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:32,889
regular employment and another myth is

617
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,899
that you have to outbid the offense or

618
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:38,289
black market now the fact of the matter

619
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:41,018
is with that is that there's a logical

620
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:43,450
ceiling above which you cannot offer

621
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:48,669
defensive prices does anyone want to

622
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:50,529
guess why that is you're not a

623
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:52,389
nation-state but no it's well it's

624
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:54,129
basically yeah that's part of it that

625
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:55,928
you you're not going to be able to

626
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:58,840
outbid them right they can always go

627
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:00,809
higher I mean if you think about it if

628
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,959
Apple offered a million dollars for

629
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:06,279
every you know iOS jailbreak how many

630
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,590
Apple engineers do you think would be

631
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:10,899
working there at the end of the year

632
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:14,080
right and even if they all stayed

633
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:17,199
because they enjoy job stability how

634
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,600
many new candidates junior candidates

635
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,980
would they be able to recruit if one of

636
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,619
them could hit a million dollar bounty

637
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,090
legit through the defense market so

638
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:27,789
let's look at a particular case study

639
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,470
this particular guy had made a payday of

640
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:32,350
a hundred nineteen thousand dollars and

641
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:34,210
it was kind of a bundle of bug bounties

642
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,009
that were all paid out and I thought it

643
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,509
was great ROI for him because he had

644
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:39,279
admitted that it was about four hours of

645
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:40,539
work he did a little recon you know

646
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,059
earlier than the four hours but it was

647
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:45,669
roughly four hours so great you know

648
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:49,389
great ROI for his time but kind of

649
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:51,070
terrifying ROI for the company like you

650
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:52,418
know I mean the project zero folks

651
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,119
correct me if I'm wrong do not make

652
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:57,429
$29,000 an hour I mean maybe we could

653
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,980
have kept more of the nsrc security

654
00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:00,539
grunts and enroll if they made $29,000

655
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,799
an hour

656
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:04,330
recruited some whale feces researchers

657
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,070
to help out I don't know

658
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,960
but here's the thing I mean you can read

659
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:11,059
through this this dialog and everything

660
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,759
but you know somebody came in and said

661
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:16,370
why would he accept a full-time regular

662
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,230
position inside an organization if he

663
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,489
could get so much more money with bug

664
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,320
bounties and I'm like I'm not saying you

665
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:23,480
would another top researcher did and

666
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,980
then the researcher himself China's back

667
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,169
and he's like actually I was trying to

668
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,779
join them full-time I would prefer that

669
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:32,690
and then you know the guy who had

670
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:34,730
questioned why comes you know comes in

671
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,710
and says look I'm not trying to poke

672
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,909
into your business book but why would

673
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,460
you do that why would you take so much

674
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:44,269
less and here it is because I have a

675
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:45,950
daughter I want to make sure that my

676
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,809
income is stable and she doesn't have to

677
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:50,629
worry about it so even though he's

678
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:52,490
capable of reaping the benefits of this

679
00:26:50,629 --> 00:26:55,490
the of the highest cent of the gig

680
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:58,159
economy he wanted the stability he

681
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:01,519
prefers that and he's been trying for it

682
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,889
for a while ok so back again to the

683
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,600
labor market and the system dynamics how

684
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:08,090
many of you are familiar with a little

685
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,399
bit of light system dynamics well anyway

686
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:14,439
there's complex systems there think of

687
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:14,439
it like multiple levers that can affect

688
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:20,689
multiple levers that can affect any

689
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:22,909
given system we were trying to study is

690
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:25,940
price the most effective lever

691
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:27,500
could we outbid the offense market is

692
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,909
that effective will that move the needle

693
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,769
and the balance for defense

694
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:32,480
the answer is no least effective hardly

695
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:34,580
made a blip because again the offense

696
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,019
market can keep piling on money and then

697
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,168
eventually the defense market would be

698
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:42,470
paying bug hunters more than the CEO

699
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:45,620
which might be cool but also not

700
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:47,750
sustainable so you know that that whole

701
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:50,840
thing was presented at RSA and there's a

702
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:54,860
reference to it later but there's more

703
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:57,709
to the system than money so what does

704
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,750
this market look like one of the labor

705
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:02,029
market papers in which we studied the

706
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:04,039
bug bounty labor market of Facebook's

707
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:07,639
bug bounty program and hacker ones at

708
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:10,309
the time and the data was between 2013

709
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:12,709
and 2015 timeframe that paper had been

710
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:15,590
published as a chapter in an MIT press

711
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:18,169
book on the economics of

712
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:19,908
bug bounties and it got some recent

713
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:22,669
attention because a company called trail

714
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:24,260
of bits did a blog post about it and I

715
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:25,760
think you know hacker ones reaction was

716
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,070
that's not our data or if it is it's old

717
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,870
and then they had a friend published

718
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:32,658
this article so this is these are

719
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:35,149
current hacker one numbers over three

720
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:36,940
hundred thousand hackers about one in

721
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:41,330
ten have found something at all

722
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:43,720
okay that's less of those who have filed

723
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,500
maybe a quarter have received a bounty a

724
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,140
thousand of them have earned five

725
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,940
thousand or more a hundred of them have

726
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:53,029
earned a hundred thousand or more and

727
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:56,120
only two of them are at or approaching a

728
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:58,820
million dollars okay so that actually

729
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,129
this is very simple math you're looking

730
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,529
at point zero three percent of this

731
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:05,510
population now they're independent

732
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:08,779
contractors therefore they're on all the

733
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:10,520
bug bounty platforms they're not really

734
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:12,200
tied to one or the other so you're

735
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,860
sharing probably somewhere between a

736
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:18,110
hundred and a thousand sets of eyeballs

737
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:20,029
so this myth that bug bounties are

738
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:22,939
superior to pen tests because they

739
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:25,220
provide continuous coverage of friendly

740
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,760
hackers well the numbers really don't

741
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,399
lie

742
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,580
and actually the proportion of skilled

743
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,840
labor is smaller now than it was when we

744
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,699
did the original study because there

745
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,820
were fewer than 10,000 hackers signed up

746
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,940
on hacker when we did the original study

747
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:42,918
so what were we hoping for remember we

748
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:45,649
were hoping to create the defense market

749
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:46,940
for bugs to democratize vulnerability

750
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:49,010
hunting to make it so that we could

751
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:52,000
identify talent around the world anyone

752
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:54,500
know about the mathematician ram anujan

753
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,020
natural mathematician had found a

754
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,580
calculus book he was poor in rural india

755
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:01,760
and from that calculus book he started

756
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:04,370
writing to oxford and about mathematics

757
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,960
he eventually was brought over he died a

758
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:08,029
tragic death of like bronchitis or

759
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,850
pneumonia or something like that but he

760
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:12,190
was one of the most prolific

761
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:16,459
mathematicians in modern times and

762
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:18,679
that's who I wanted to find not not

763
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:24,590
happening really so why are we missing

764
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:26,150
you know this whole funnel of Labor well

765
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,889
I think it's because

766
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:32,270
these things have been over marketed

767
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:34,370
right and even the bug mounting

768
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,990
companies themselves are saying that

769
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,120
this business model is not working out

770
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:41,240
for them in the article in which this

771
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:43,429
quote came from you know the the CEO

772
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,140
said that bug bounties are only about a

773
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,760
hundred fifty million dollar market

774
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,950
whereas pen testing is a billion dollar

775
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,490
market so we're just gonna peel off some

776
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,450
of that

777
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:55,490
now remember pen testers are full-time

778
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:58,730
get benefits are highly skilled and

779
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,720
vetted but the expectation is that oh no

780
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,060
we're going to convince them to come

781
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,740
over and be in this gig economy okay

782
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,350
good luck with that but here's the thing

783
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:09,260
the marketing has been working this is

784
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:12,129
Google's search history from 2004 when

785
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:14,780
they first started to modern times and

786
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,310
bug bounties are now more frequently

787
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:20,050
searched for than penetration testing

788
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:22,850
that's called some SEO on steroids so

789
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:24,409
what is the truth bug bounties are not a

790
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,850
replacement for penetration testing they

791
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,370
can be complimentary and they can work

792
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:30,020
out very well alone they don't indicate

793
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,540
security maturity if you haven't done

794
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:35,990
your due diligence and all humans have a

795
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:38,840
mix matrix of emotions and motivations

796
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:40,370
and they change over time I was a

797
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,350
professional hacker for seven years you

798
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:46,510
could not have convinced me to go

799
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:49,310
in-house and yet I joined Microsoft and

800
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:51,379
I joined Microsoft not as a hacker but

801
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:52,310
as a strategist so people change and

802
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,290
what they want to do and what their

803
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,659
attention span is focused on and that

804
00:31:54,290 --> 00:32:00,230
the defense market for bugs can only go

805
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:03,020
so high it's not infinite neither is the

806
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:05,600
labor market so perverse incentives I

807
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:08,900
mentioned Netscape this is what real

808
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,760
Dilbert cartoon artist scott adams had

809
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:14,810
written when netscape announced their

810
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:16,430
bug bounty one of the stats that is

811
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,409
released in some of the bug bounty

812
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:20,150
reports is how much more money you can

813
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:22,280
make as a bug bounty hunter in each

814
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:24,230
individual country compared to the

815
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,240
median salary of the developers so i

816
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:28,580
think it's 16 times median salary in

817
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,330
india where do we outsource software a

818
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:34,580
lot yeah so I can see sister number one

819
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,990
software developer outsource you know

820
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,879
outsourcing a software development in

821
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,770
India sister number two bug bounty

822
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:44,540
hunter I can see no problems with

823
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:47,210
can you okay so this graph on the left

824
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:49,490
is the real graph and the real data that

825
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,110
convinced Internet Explorer to pay for

826
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,780
its own bugs what you're seeing there is

827
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:55,669
the white line hello squiggly line is

828
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:57,920
the number of real bug reports that came

829
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,710
in during the IE 10 beta period and then

830
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,960
there was a huge spike of submissions

831
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:05,930
why because before there was money there

832
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,200
was only recognition if it affected only

833
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:10,730
the beta the latest product and they

834
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,240
fixed it during beta you would get no

835
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,980
bulletin so absolutely we were actually

836
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,960
creating our own perverse incentive and

837
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,280
when I looked at the data I said we can

838
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,440
do traffic shaping if we put a bug

839
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,270
bounty at the beginning of the ie 11

840
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,670
beta period we can offer them

841
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:27,230
recognition a little bit of cash and get

842
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,780
those bugs as early as possible so is

843
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:31,460
win-win all around we got 18 bulletin

844
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,899
clasp vulnerabilities guess how much we

845
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,080
paid total each of them would have been

846
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:37,820
worth six figures on the offense market

847
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:40,000
18 how much do you think you can't

848
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:44,210
answer heart rate kids you probably know

849
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,430
35 anyone higher lower it's like the

850
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:55,190
price is right I don't know what you win

851
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:59,620
but total 65 all right 35 65 going once

852
00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:04,910
one toe - anybody else 100 hundred wait

853
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:06,679
what use it right there no that was a

854
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:09,168
different bug bounty that was to one guy

855
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:14,929
no I'm talking about the 18 bulletin

856
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:18,469
class shoes no no a little over $28,000

857
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:19,340
total right so the hundred thousand

858
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,779
dollars remember I was talking about

859
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,950
perverse incentives and you're like what

860
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,750
are you saying Katie you just paid a

861
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:24,678
hundred thousand dollars to one guy well

862
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,600
this was for something that was

863
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:28,668
sufficiently rare it was new

864
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,739
exploitation techniques it wasn't just

865
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:33,500
what you get at pwned to own right which

866
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:36,799
at the time was the same price a hundred

867
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,139
thousand dollars and phone tone only

868
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,730
happens once a year we made this all

869
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:43,310
year round now the price of this has

870
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:45,409
gone up but it's still sufficiently rare

871
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:47,659
and within sort of the boundaries such

872
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:49,520
that you're not necessarily going to gut

873
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:52,250
your hiring pipeline or you lose your

874
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,560
employees as a result of them wanting to

875
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,699
instead all right fast forward to hack

876
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,640
the Pentagon because I know I gotta wrap

877
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:59,839
it up hack the Pentagon so take a look

878
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,640
at these numbers what I want you to pay

879
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,020
attention to is the total registered we

880
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,290
were hoping for a few hundred we got

881
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,790
1,400 people to come forward and put

882
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:11,300
their social security numbers in a form

883
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:14,150
and pre-register for this now I loved

884
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,700
the paranoia some of my hacker friends

885
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,410
were saying oh yeah like I'm gonna give

886
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:25,970
the government my social security number

887
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:28,970
I'm like I'm like you know you're real

888
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:30,560
smart at finding bugs friend but anyway

889
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,790
they already know and they're like no

890
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,610
but they're gonna one-way ticket to

891
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:36,170
Gitmo so it didn't happen that way but

892
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,300
look at the signal-to-noise it's kind of

893
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,770
horrendous that's that's a pretty

894
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,420
horrendous signal-to-noise also never

895
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:44,330
start a bug bounty program at midnight

896
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:46,130
ouch 13 minutes past midnight

897
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:47,870
lesson learned okay now what happened

898
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,670
after that hack the army was the next

899
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:52,490
one we launched and we also launched the

900
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:55,550
ongoing volunteer program for the entire

901
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:57,700
DoD which was actually more important it

902
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:00,920
was more important to be able to report

903
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,480
anything you saw across any DoD website

904
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,180
whether or not there was money involved

905
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,010
so we have worked out that process made

906
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,500
sure people were ready for it had a

907
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,820
procedure to stood up and we went ahead

908
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,070
and hit launch hack the army now this

909
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,690
was secretary fitting former Secretary

910
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,580
of the army right after this picture was

911
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:19,010
taken so that's kind of like a large

912
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,779
mock-up of what the the challenge coin

913
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,460
token was going to look like he said hey

914
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,660
for the hack the Pentagon challenge

915
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,580
token you know you had some binary

916
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:28,129
around there it said translated to I

917
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:33,830
hacked the Pentagon who we have are say

918
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:36,110
I hacked the army beat Navy and yeah we

919
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:38,330
did and they did actually so I think it

920
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:41,480
was the hackers so look at the numbers

921
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:43,580
now 371 participants and look at that

922
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,290
signal-to-noise so also we started it at

923
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:48,440
like noon that was better

924
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:51,380
so signal-to-noise is better what lever

925
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:55,460
did we use we capped the participation

926
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:56,570
at just around like 400 or something and

927
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,610
that's that's how many people had

928
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:00,710
accepted the invitations so there are

929
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:03,350
other ways to sort of manipulate this to

930
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:05,400
make it bite-sized to make it doable and

931
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:07,259
there are a number of other challenges

932
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,090
are ongoing that happened at the

933
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,580
Pentagon but they're all you know pretty

934
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:14,100
much these chunked in time manageable

935
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:16,350
sessions so how do we have the labor

936
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:19,140
market itself one of the things I said

937
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:21,120
to Congress about what they can do to

938
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:23,400
improve the state of security was the

939
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,500
fact that you know Congress authorizes

940
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,530
funding of American University as many

941
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,910
of the American universities and top ten

942
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,950
computer science programs and US

943
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:34,470
universities don't require security to

944
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,359
graduate at all three of them don't even

945
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:39,600
have the electives if you wanted to take

946
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,910
it so I suggested that they maybe not

947
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,770
fund these colleges and universities

948
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:50,850
unless they pledged to add computer

949
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:52,500
security right but in the end bug

950
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,910
bounties are good for a few things you

951
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,230
can identify unique talent that you

952
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:57,420
might not have seen Raman knew John

953
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,040
might be out there for you but it's

954
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,270
terrible for employee morale if you

955
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,830
haven't thought through your incentives

956
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,570
and terrible for data privacy and

957
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:06,390
security if you haven't thought through

958
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:08,190
what can happen on purpose or even as a

959
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:09,660
hack Siddhant you know who is the

960
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,180
speaker with the apostrophe is in his

961
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,549
name is he still here yes I used to live

962
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,770
on Oh Ferrell Street accidents happen

963
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:20,040
all the time so you need to know what

964
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:23,550
your playbook is there what should you

965
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:25,860
do hack yourself then hack your labor

966
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:27,090
figure out where the balance actually

967
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,410
needs to be shifted where do you

968
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,390
actually need to prioritize investments

969
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,440
for security because you are not going

970
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,080
to get there with bug bounty and

971
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,550
pentesting loan and beware of perverse

972
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,380
incentives if people are telling you

973
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,970
just to go ahead and start and to jack

974
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,700
up the prices guess what you're doing

975
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:44,339
you got a little Botox going on it's not

976
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:46,770
going to help you with what you really

977
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:50,040
need to do you need to work on your

978
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:54,360
inner beauty your inner processes so

979
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:56,520
here are the the principles that we need

980
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:59,130
to live by we've romanticized offense

981
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,350
for too long and the labor market for

982
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,730
offense you know there are many cultures

983
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,870
that have this idea of balance between

984
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,150
creation maintenance and destruction

985
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:09,299
this is just one of them we need to

986
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:12,090
