1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,300
all right everybody thanks for your

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,370
thanks your patience this is the pal

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,529
Hana panel it's kind of like a we're

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,980
done here until we meet again sort of

5
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:14,549
thing in Hawaii here are five of our

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,170
many speakers and one of the things that

7
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,480
I wanted us to bring up here is kind of

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,000
to express my appreciation but also how

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,580
impressed I am so I personally this is a

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,410
well I'm Jeremiah Grossman I'm you know

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,380
I founded white hat security CEO a bit

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,179
discovery and I've been to well over 200

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,430
InfoSec conferences over the last 20

14
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,199
years and many of them obviously gonna

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,630
be applications security I was

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,809
mentioning to the the other of the

17
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,420
organizing team that about our lineup of

18
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,040
speakers and I was hard-pressed I

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,620
actually couldn't think of a single

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,149
conference that would outdo this

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,760
conference in terms of quality of

22
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,300
speakers and content I was just asking

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,680
around and I think everybody was

24
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,690
overwhelmed by the amount of information

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,109
that was thrown at them like it's easy

26
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,370
to get overwhelmed and but we would

27
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,409
rather that feeling that you're

28
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,149
overwhelmed like this is too much good

29
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,040
stuff than like you know going to

30
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,049
another conference and you know for it

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,270
to be too superficial so I think we did

32
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,770
a really good job at bringing the right

33
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,250
people together to talk about the right

34
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,298
concepts it's the intersection of

35
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,549
application security and development

36
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,229
very defensive base which is what we

37
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,420
were going for so I wanted to say a

38
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,130
personal thank you to all the speakers

39
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,799
who agree to come up here that traveled

40
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,179
all the way to come here and to you know

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,230
share their knowledge with us so thank

42
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,650
you very much

43
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:38,660
[Applause]

44
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:41,000
so now that we've been buried in and

45
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,710
content this is our opportunity to get a

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,400
little bit closer to the speakers as far

47
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,600
as what their their core message was so

48
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,740
what I'm going to do is we're gonna ask

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,630
them a couple of questions and then

50
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,830
we'll open up the floor to to you guys

51
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,179
but the first thing I wanted to do is

52
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:58,039
just ask them to introduce themselves

53
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,390
the company that they work for and what

54
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,340
you know the title of the presentation

55
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,230
and generally was about just to refresh

56
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,880
us because I think we had like two dozen

57
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:08,480
presentations that's tough to keep going

58
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,970
so we'll start on the left here hi I'm

59

I am the director of sector my talk was

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,510
on adapting your app SEC I think most of

62
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,660
you heard that this morning and it was

63
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:26,420
focused on how do we adjust our have sec

64
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:31,010
methods and process for the changing

65
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:33,109

68
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,160
with my coworker Fikri we chose not to

69
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:42,650
come up on stage hopefully I'll

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,600
represent his work well here too our

71
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,270
talk was bulletproof shoes which was

72
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,000
about an engineering project that our

73
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:54,080
team worked on to automatically find an

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,170
invalid a at slack tokens in the wild hi

77
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,690
segment and my talk was about delivering

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,300

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,600
bother telling you but basically I talk

84
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,430
a lot about adding how do security

85
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,440
people act within DevOps that's what my

86
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,690
talk was about like ideas of how we

87
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,690
could turn DevOps into that suck-ups

88
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:44,899
late for the party come join us friends

89

92
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:53,260
you we can get at least three more

00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,260
chairs it's called the surprise panel

94
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,070

ice at me so stage skirt it's a serious

99
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,550
it's a serious thing for women we

100
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:46,160
concern about this when we sit on a

101

and safety team my talk was about how to

110
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,090
bring trust and safety into your work

111
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:21,729
especially as security engineers are we

112
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:23,659
doing the big takeaway now hi my name is

113
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,030
Justin yeah

114
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:29,150

calm and we are working on an identity

116
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:34,130
scheme so I'm ensuring that that is hope

117
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:41,300
for the future and my talk was on how

118
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:43,730
not to use or how to use all hi my name

119
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,090
is Derrick I'm from Belgium I run the

120
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:49,790
company pragmatic web security I my talk

121
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,710
was about cookies tokens and api's but

122
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,280
I'm up for talking anything web security

123
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,989
related all right thank you again all of

124
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,020
you for coming and being on stage with

125
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,640
us here when when you're the audience

126
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,140
member and you're presented with a

127
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,820
lineup like this in the amount of

128
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,070
content that you gave us it's a lot of

129
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,690
times a difficult to pull out the

130
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,590
salient points and the takeaways from

131
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:14,120
the presentation so I'm gonna ask one

132
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,609
question and I like for each of you to

133
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,340
answer in turn the first question is

134
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,890
after reviewing or listening to your

135
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,150
presentation or have you bet that you've

136
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,130
presented it

137
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,960
what's the one lesson learn or the most

138
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,000
important lesson learned the one

139
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,099
takeaway you would suggest all of us and

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,700
bring back to our work what's what's the

141
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:37,280
one thing you want us to get bug

142
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,530
bounties nor penetration tests are

143
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,299
equivalent nor are they a sign of

144
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,609
security maturity on their own

145
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,500
you cannot bounty your way to secure nor

146
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:50,480
can you pen test your way to secure you

147
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:52,970
have to build security in so I think

148
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,260
from my presentation I think enabling

149
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,420
your developers to be very

150
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,750
self-sufficient in in both finding and

151
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,670
fixing security Vaughn's is probably the

152
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,170
most important piece of my talk because

153
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,030
I think everything else I talked about

154
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,370
will kind of fall into place if you can

155
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:10,090
get that to work like I said I wish I

156
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:15,080
had a magic button for it but I don't

157
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:18,890
okay I think two themes for me from our

158
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,510
talk one automate all the things that

159
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,120
that's a great takeaway and the other

160
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,710
thing is that like really small seeming

161
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,470
projects can have a lot of value in

162
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,859
terms of security like the idea of

163
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,790
something that invalidates tokens is not

164
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,260
earth-shattering but it's been a really

165
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,140
good improvement for a lot of our users

166
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:41,750
so yeah don't don't be afraid of little

167
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:43,400
ideas I'd say the big takeaways from my

168
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,980
talk are if you're going to ask

169
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,630
developers to spend their time on

170
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,980
something security related make sure

171
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,409
that it's relevant to them when you're

172
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,210
building training and then recognize

173
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,850
people for their work and I'm just gonna

174
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,870
repeat a question that I got from Tanya

175
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,450
which was like how do you recognize

176
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,830
people and I left out a really important

177
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,620
answer that yesterday but I tweeted

178
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,450
about it which is right peer reviews for

179
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,570
people that do really awesome stuff for

180
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:10,550
your team it takes like 15 ish minutes

181
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,440
and that compared to the amount of time

182
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,180
that they spent solving a problem that

183
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,840
you didn't have to solve is like almost

184
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,640
nothing and it makes a big difference so

185
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,429
like be fun so that when people are

186
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,860
risky you can be risky together yeah

187
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:30,500
I think our clouds that guy in the back

188
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:33,110
might hate that but from my talk it was

189
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,539
about how security people if we're gonna

190
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,849
do app sack in a devops environment we

191
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:39,529
have to do DevOps too so we have to

192
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:43,060
change the way we do things or we will

193
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:43,059
be left behind but it's totally doable

194
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,040
the take away from my talk was that it

195
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,390
is everyone's responsibility everyone I

196
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,069
want to clarify who is working at the

197
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,790
company don't put the responsibility on

198
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,620
your users but it is every employees

199
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:00,050
responsibility to help make your

200
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,520
platform secure for all people and that

201
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:06,680
includes the most vulnerable people to

202
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:09,650
online abuse so from for my talk I guess

203
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,829
the lesson learned is or just just doing

204
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:15,380
authors not enough authors a framework

205
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,290
it gives you many options and many

206
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,689
dangerous options look closely what you

207
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,790
need and follow over security advice

208
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:27,010
notice out there and the new security

209
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:29,529
advice that is coming out so hopefully

210
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:32,890
all right now for me it would be that

211
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:35,510
the WEP is a very complicated place

212
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,069
everything hooked in to each other and

213
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,140
there's a lot of dependencies and you

214
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,480
need to be aware of all of these details

215
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,670
to make security decisions because if

216
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,040
you forget a few of them you might

217
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,959
decide something here and open up a hole

218
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,819
over there which is the same with a

219
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:54,050
heart I'm guessing which is also

220
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:55,520
basically a lab protocol so one

221
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,709
interesting takeaway as I was listening

222
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,660
to their answers it's there's a healthy

223
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:02,569
amount of we have to change the way we

224
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,610
develop software a little bit it's our

225
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,959
as the engineering teams do but it seems

226
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,630
like what they're suggesting is we have

227
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:11,239
to change the way we do things and not

228
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,130
expect the world to change around us

229
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,350
we're gonna have to change the way we do

230
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,060
and integrate with everybody else's

231
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,410
business and I think that's a really

232
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,390
important lesson learned because there's

233
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,980
comparable few of us in the industry

234
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,319
there's in tens of thousands of us and

235
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,360
there's millions of them asking the

236
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,459
millions of them to change to suit us so

237
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,339
we don't have to change yeah I don't

238
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:32,359
think that's gonna work so the next

239
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,150
question is and we'll start with it

240
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,460
start at the end so no doubt you've

241
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,290
on the job experience all the time that

242
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,580
you put in that gave rise to your

243
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,219
research that gave rise to your

244
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,350
presentation what's the one thing that

245
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,180
you're doing on the job or in your

246
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:50,029
research that you would continue doing

247
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,839
and what's the one thing that maybe you

248
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:53,150
would have thought would have been a

249
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:58,580
good idea before but you would never do

250
00:10:53,150 --> 00:11:00,319
again related to your talk you're in

251
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:08,930
your research ideally but perhaps not

252
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:10,430
exclusively or active so if you're not

253
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,510
ready if somebody else is ready just

254
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:15,739
jump in we don't to go to any particular

255
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:18,350
order okay I would say the absolute best

256
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,810
thing that I did in my entire career was

257
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,540
join a wasp the open web application

258
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:26,180
security project and then start a

259
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:29,029
project with someone who I greatly

260
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,469
admired I could not believe it when

261
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:32,300
Nicole Becker was like do you wanna

262
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,680
start project with me I'm like you had

263
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,910
me at the fact that you're speaking to

264
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,670
me it was just it was just so so so so

265
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:44,120
amazing I would say though the one thing

266
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,860
that I would not do is I've banged into

267
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,420
different people within the InfoSec

268
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,860
community and I would say that most of

269
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,740
them have been wonderful but some of

270
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,450
them have been like awful in a way that

271
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,560
I didn't know like an adult human could

272
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:59,270
act and so so I would maybe like try to

273
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,920
learn to be less trite I just like

274
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,290
opened my heart like an idiot for

275
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,900
everyone and then I would just like try

276
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,670
harder to like maybe ask other people's

277
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,350
opinions of someone or ask them to

278
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,180
recommend someone as opposed to someone

279
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:19,209
just reaching right out to me and I'm

280
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:21,770
like okay and it's like who's next so so

281
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:24,229
from my perspective I think you know in

282
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,390
my career and in my presentation it just

283
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,810
never stopped talking about it right

284
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:31,939
like I've been a knapsack for a long

285
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,410
freakin time it feels like and I've seen

286
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:37,459
a lot of people come in and go out

287
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:38,719
because it's tiring and you just have to

288
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:41,300
keep talking about it and keep that

289
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,209
passion out on the other hand what I

290
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:48,258
will never do again is be a no guy

291
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:50,929
like like you can say no but don't just

292
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:53,899
be the no guy right like that's why

293
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:56,600
security has a bad name work with those

294
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,939
people to make a process that may work

295
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:03,949
for them instead of just be nope we

296
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:07,849
won't do it alright so thanks for the

297
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:14,300
time to reflect them for me the thing I

298
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:16,279
would definitely keep doing is assuming

299
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,679
that I don't know everything because I

300
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,569
don't know everything I I know a lot

301
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:22,160
about security but even here I've been

302
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:23,839
talking to to Daniel I had a bunch of

303
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,519
questions about what even though I've

304
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,959
been working with a lot for for over

305
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,790
three years now it's like yeah how do

306
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,050
you see this and how do you see that and

307
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,429
it same thing happens in in training

308
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,099
developers ask me like how does that

309
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:35,720
happen I'm like no idea and then if it's

310
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,369
if it's a fairly simple thing we work it

311
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,839
out in class we just look it up and try

312
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:40,850
it out and we see what happens and then

313
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,470
we learn things and sometimes it's a bit

314
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,720
more complex and I honestly don't know

315
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,819
and I figure it out later but there's

316
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,649
always so much learning going on and you

317
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:50,029
see that everywhere and I'm pretty sure

318
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:52,160
the other speakers learned a lot of

319
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,600
things from each other here as well and

320
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,819
that's that's definitely something I

321
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,179
want to keep doing but I don't want to

322
00:13:55,819 --> 00:14:01,490
keep doing is in my careers sometimes

323
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:04,249
you have these trainings that each out

324
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:06,019
of compliance reasons which by itself is

325
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:08,119
not bad but if there's no guidance from

326
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:11,119
the company there's no context no

327
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:13,309
framing honestly that's not a fun way to

328
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:14,660
spend my time because people are just

329
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:16,969
sitting there because they have to be

330
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,709
there they have no idea how this applies

331
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,910
to their job they have no context they

332
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:22,309
don't know what to do with that

333
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,749
information later on and basically

334
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:25,160
you're just wasting everybody's time

335
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:27,110
fortunately it's not that common but

336
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:32,149
sometimes it does happen even though I

337
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:35,240
try to fight it as hard as I can so what

338
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:37,879
I want to keep doing is and it's

339
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,339
something I learned is to look precisely

340
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:42,230
at things because often enough you have

341
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:44,480
many people talking about the same topic

342
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,959
they have completely different views

343
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,309
they they don't even so when you want to

344
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,810
defend against something you need to

345
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:52,400
know which attacked us you know

346
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:55,099
against what you're trying to protect

347
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,990
and most of the time people don't know

348
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,930
that

349
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:01,460
so looking precisely at things you don't

350
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,939
need to do a formal analysis for that

351
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:10,250
but just writing down and clear natural

352
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:12,589
language is helpful enough what I would

353
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,960
not do again and I must admit that and

354
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:17,600
it's something I did I completely

355
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,480
underestimated the complexity for things

356
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,170
such as warth so there are still people

357
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:28,730
saying it's a simple protocol I wouldn't

358
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:31,790
agree it's it's it's really complicated

359
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:34,070
sir but it was so we had this formal

360
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:37,490
model and then we used we were looking

361
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:39,680
for some nice use cases and we only we

362
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,150
did three other things before we took on

363
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,250
oath because because we thought

364
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,860
everybody looked at it already there's

365
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,080
nothing new to find and it's simple and

366
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:53,180
yep turns out it was not that's why

367
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:56,000
you're today so so the thing that I

368
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,370
would say to do where you can and we

369
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,589
learned this in safety and I think it

370
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:04,430
applies to security too is find ways to

371
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:07,970
say yes and find like happy exciting

372
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:11,599
ways to guide both your developers and

373
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:14,060
their users and like down the happy path

374
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,820
sort of so in my talk I talked about

375
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:19,300
ways to encourage good behavior it

376
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:22,190
really helps you sort of shirk the

377
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:25,099
reputation of being the team that always

378
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:27,860
says no so if you can if you can like

379
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:33,110
say a feature comes in and sometimes our

380
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:35,180
team our first reaction is like but we

381
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,130
do that in our private Channel and then

382
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,569
and then we come back to the other team

383
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,160
and we're like okay so we see some

384
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,160
issues but like here's how you might

385
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,230
encourage our users to go down a happy

386
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,310
path and that's a really that's that's

387
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,880
worked out really well for us we've

388
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:51,920
gotten good feedback on that what I what

389
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,170
I've done in the past a few times and

390
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,240
what I've seen other people do and what

391
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:59,360
I really would like us all to stop doing

392
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,900
is especially in online abuse assuming

393
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,420
that if you haven't

394
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:06,209
then it hasn't happened I've gotten

395
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,399
feedback a lot some from this conference

396
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:10,410
some online that like oh oh I haven't

397
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,500
actually seen any abuse in this feature

398
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,540
or in this context like is it is it

399
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,130
actually happening and I've even felt I

400
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,599
mean I consider myself somewhat

401
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,800
knowledgeable on the topic and so when a

402
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,409
new feature comes in I'm like I don't

403
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:25,139
think I'd be a problem until we hear

404
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,730
someone who has experienced that so

405
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,110
turning that into a positive just all

406
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,870
this listening to other people's

407
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:32,969
experiences and assuming or I guess not

408
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:40,469
assuming that if you haven't seen it

409
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:42,450
then it hasn't happened that's what I

410
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:47,130
would not do yeah I would I would not

411
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:48,990
assume that no I assume assume that a

412
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,600
really a quote that I really love is

413
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,679
quote everyone you will ever meet know

414
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,290
something you don't

415
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,679
yeah I think Bill Nye said that that's a

416
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:01,110
really good quality

417
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,900
yeah so I'd say the thing that we're

418
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:07,530
going to continue doing is keep evolving

419
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:09,420
the training like as like kind of our

420
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,940
framework or like library level

421
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,190
protections improve to highlight wins

422
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,750
that our developers have had in the

423
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,700
security space so that they know like

424
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,400
what the latest and greatest things are

425
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,650
to use internally and then one thing

426
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,190
that we should have done better earlier

427
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:27,300
is figure out how to make the training

428
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:35,070
awesome for people that aren't in the

429
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:38,100
office so in terms of what I certainly

430
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:40,290
hope that we'll keep doing at SLAC for

431
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,500
people who are paying attention to the

432
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:45,389
graphs yesterday the token nuclear that

433
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,929
we talked about is not a new thing we've

434
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:50,970
actually been running it since 2016 it's

435
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:53,070
a really early example of a shift we're

436
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,740
making overall as a team moving more

437
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,780
towards proactive security versus

438
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,400
reactive security it's really easy

439
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,860
especially when you have a small team in

440
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,910
a really fast growing organization to

441
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:08,428
only focus on that reactive work I I

442
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,980
think that will continue to move as much

443
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:11,309
stuff into proactive work as we can it's

444
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,899
better

445
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:17,749
for our users it's better for us as a

446
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:20,248
team in its overall choice in terms of

447
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:21,539
what I would not do again there's

448
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:22,950
nothing that comes to mind from the

449
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:26,580
Tokyo nuclear project I think it was a

450
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:28,379
really well-run project overall but just

451
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,019
a general like tying in to my first

452
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:33,090
sentiment of what we would do again

453
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:36,059
something that I learned in my time at

454
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,949
slack when I first joined a year and a

455
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:40,168
half ago we tried to do security review

456
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:45,659
on like almost literally every project

457
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:48,480
and that does not scale it turns out yes

458
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:50,220
so moving forward we're working on being

459
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,070
like a lot more tightly focused having

460
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,809
much more of like a real opera store

461
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,879
when deciding what we're gonna do

462
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:58,470
focused review on so don't try to review

463
00:19:56,879 --> 00:20:04,379
all the things automate all the things

464
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:07,710
don't review all the things in terms of

465
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:10,139
what I will continue to do are things

466
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,360
like working with governments large

467
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:14,309
complex organizations in helping them

468
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,039
understand where they're prioritizing

469
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:20,580
their security investments when it comes

470
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,549
to bug prevention first of all and then

471
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,439
bug discovery ideally on their own

472
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:27,779
before they turn it out to outside users

473
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,789
so the work that I'm doing with the UK

474
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:31,980
government it has been wonderful over

475
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:33,299
the past couple of years we're not doing

476
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,919
a bug bounty and we're not working

477
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:37,679
towards one we're actually building the

478
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,629
internal capacity to handle bugs in a

479
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,119
consistent way across the entire UK

480
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:44,129
government we're onboarding different

481
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:46,649
departments and our next publication

482
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:49,590
together with the UK government will be

483
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:52,139
onboarding guidance that we have used to

484
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:54,389
basically normalize vulnerability

485
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:56,219
response this is kind of the dental

486
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:58,860
hygiene of security and doesn't sound

487
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,960
very sexy not as sexy or alliterative as

488
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,779
a bug bounty but what I wouldn't do

489
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,119
again is allow a government like the

490
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:08,100
Department of Defense say that you know

491
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,769
what it's great that you want us to

492
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,439
build capacity but what we really want

493
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:15,659
is to be able to demonstrate early wins

494
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,059
and success and we believe that the

495
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:20,210
media will want to see big numbers and

496
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:23,759
so we're gonna start with a bug bounty

497
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:24,960
that was probably the mean obviously

498
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,970
when the DoD the

499
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,590
largest military in the world says yeah

500
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,789
that's nice Katie you know you're you've

501
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,949
been helping us for a couple of years

502
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,870
now get ready now let's just go out with

503
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,549
a bug bounty first thing I probably

504
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:38,939
should have put my foot down but I don't

505
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:42,570
exactly know how I would have done that

506
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,250
I mean yeah I put my foot down they put

507
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:46,678
their boot down I think I know you know

508
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,539
who's gonna win that argument but the

509
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,270
fact of the matter is that was a key

510
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:53,970
inflection point in sending almost the

511
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,590
wrong message it normalized relating

512
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,419
with hackers in a positive way and

513
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:00,418
paying hackers for their work which was

514
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:02,220
wonderful but it also normalized these

515
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,860
ideas that you could just skip to the

516
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:08,279
end and that's been quite damaging over

517
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:10,350
the past three years so and then one

518
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:13,830
last thing that I would also have done a

519
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:16,908
lot sooner is be more obvious

520
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:18,149
about that you know need for prep reate

521
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:19,799
preparation

522
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:21,539
it's always been my messaging it's been

523
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,039
consistent since when I worked for a bug

524
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:25,799
bounty company too when I started my own

525
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,990
company but it was too subtle I know

526
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:31,139
it's strange to imagine me being subtle

527
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:33,360
but in fact I was being too subtle and

528
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,520
so now I mean that's why I'm calling it

529
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,158
bug bounty Botox I'm being very very

530
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,139
overt about how I think the model is

531
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,890
flawed the way it's being executed so

532
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:46,380
yeah absolutely I would be much more

533
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:47,730
overt about that and yeah please spread

534
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,390
the word bug bounties aren't for

535
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:52,980
everybody Thanks one of the things I

536
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,440
have to jump jump in on that particular

537
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,470
question is having been in application

538
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,120
security for about 20 years now one of

539
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,679
the things I learned very well is that

540
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,229
there's far too much in this industry

541
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,450
for any one person to learn now or

542
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,440
anytime soon and I've been really

543
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,390
personally trying to push the envelope

544
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,039
learning and teaching other people

545
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:14,460
things that I've learned every single

546
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:17,129
day for the last 20 years and so that is

547
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,380
the only way I found to not only just

548
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:22,260
keep up but even have a chance of

549
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,549
getting ahead and then any time I didn't

550
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,529
know something yeah I could read it

551
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:28,730
online or in a book or a white paper it

552
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:31,740
was just as valuable to know who to ask

553
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:34,080
who are the experts the world-class

554
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,409
experts and some little slice of app

555
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,610
sack or security people like these guys

556
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:41,429
so if you're you know if I

557
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:44,189
know how to build or not build of' as an

558
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:45,900
example somebody is a tweet now or an

559
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,820
email away and I've always found that

560
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,040
the vast majority of the researchers the

561
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,570
experts in this space are incredibly

562
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,980
hospitable they'll answer whatever

563
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,230
questions you have about their

564
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,870
particular research so if anybody feels

565
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:59,460
hesitant about reaching out to an expert

566
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,850
and asking a question about what they've

567
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,280
done

568
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,889
please don't they are waiting for you

569
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,360
you know - you know for people asking

570
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:09,090
questions that show an interest in their

571
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,699
research in Reverse one of the things

572
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:14,220
that uh that impacted me greatly in my

573
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:17,580
career is automatically assuming that

574
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:22,559
the experts have all the answers they

575
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:24,659
don't if they had all the answers

576
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:29,129
everything wouldn't be hacked every

577
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:32,250
single day so there is plenty of room

578
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:34,559
for new concepts new ideas and new ways

579
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,970
of doing things and you know it's fine

580
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,440
you know nine times out of ten your

581
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,520
ideas we're not going to be right

582
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,559
they're not going to be accurate they're

583
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,210
gonna be flawed in some way and people

584
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,860
in this industry are we're gonna be very

585
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,530
quick to point out the flaws in your law

586
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:49,379
and your logic do not be discouraged for

587
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:51,120
one moment you know so it's InfoSec

588
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,429
tends to be a very competitive place in

589
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,830
ideas but over time the best ideas do

590
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:57,840
rise to the top and if you can make the

591
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:00,559
grind you'll do very very well for

592
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,668
yourself and more importantly for others

593
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,500
we can ask continue asking more

594
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:07,169
questions but I wanted to stop there and

595
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,940
see if you guys have questions for these

596
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:10,650
guys if you do just please raise your

597
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,630
hand and then we'll call on you and

598
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:18,299
stand up and please ask a question

599
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:19,410
they're here for you I still have candy

600
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:22,379
okay

601
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:26,640
and stickers so if you ask it yeah

602
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:28,200
you're in please orange t-shirt guy if

603
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,950
you could if you could stand up

604
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,950
introduce yourself

605
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,090
okay.what it's fine though after this

606
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:58,100
you all can tell us what the people in

607
00:25:50,090 --> 00:26:00,770
that end okay I'm Jeffrey Goldberg I

608
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:04,490
lucky if I remember my own name from one

609
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:09,530
password and now after that can I

610
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:13,670
remember my question ah yes the notion

611
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:15,320
of we can't ask or we can't expect all

612
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:19,600
the developers to change we have to

613
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:23,330
adapt to them that's a common theme but

614
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:30,169
also in the notion of pushing very far

615
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:32,449
to the left I like is that also asking

616
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:37,430
developers to change it is you know is

617
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:39,830
you know so I'm wondering whether we're

618
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:42,770
failing to recognize that we are asking

619
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:46,939
developers to change if we want to get

620
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:47,870
as far left as possible definitely it's

621
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,820
a partnership

622
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:52,610
I think Netflix calls it the partnership

623
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:55,010
model actually a thing that the Canadian

624
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,469
government would do at one of the places

625
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,090
I worked we would add an app sect person

626
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,770
to every major software development

627
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,240
project and then that person would

628
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,500
answer all their questions the whole way

629
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,000
through the project so it's like oh you

630
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,710
need a code review maybe I don't know

631
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,870
that but I'm gonna go find the person to

632
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,220
help you do that or oh you need this I

633
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,070
don't know the answer but I will

634
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,660
research it with you and like the first

635
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,679
person that paired with me for that

636
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,420
we're still friends

637
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,250
she made me read a lot of big books

638
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,590
which I felt was mean at first but

639
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,270
eventually so like software developers

640
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:25,189
do you have to change in some of this

641
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:27,050
right like it is their responsibility to

642
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:29,780
write the most secure code that they are

643
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:32,000
capable of writing and then it's our job

644
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,220
I believe as security people to enable

645
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,600
them as best we can to do that right so

646
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,170
giving them tools teaching them how to

647
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,909
use them

648
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,470
making processes they actually work

649
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,870
which I know is easier said than done

650
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,970
does anyone else want to answer I have

651
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:46,189
deep feels on this because I'm largely

652
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:49,070
responsible for moving our security

653
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,560
review process much earlier in the SDLC

654
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,350
than we've done it traditionally and at

655
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,570
100

656
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:56,039
is a change that you are asking

657
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,029
developers to make and it can be a

658
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,830
really hard sell

659
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:00,419
especially if someone has been in a

660
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,639
company a long time they're used to

661
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:05,429
doing you know I get my security review

662
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:07,559
right before I launch like it those

663
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:09,389
people it's a hard sell for them and I

664
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:14,220
think having talked to a lot of people

665
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:16,439
who are in that camp the way that one

666
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,019
way you can sell it any way is to

667
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,639
clarify that this makes it easier for

668
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:21,720
them if it's done earlier because

669
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:23,879
they're gonna have to do it some time

670
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,149
doing it earlier means less work for

671
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,129
them it means their their things gonna

672
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:31,439
ship on time you're not gonna have to

673
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:32,969
block because you will have told them

674
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,769
not to do the bad thing two months ago

675
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,059
instead of telling them right before

676
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:39,080
it's about to go out the door like this

677
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:41,220
has a huge fall and you can't ship and

678
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,399
ultimately making it clear that like

679
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,929
you're trying to reduce the amount of

680
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,580
commitment that they have you're just

681
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:51,629
changing when the commitment happens

682
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:54,330
which is is hard for a lot of people so

683
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:56,250
I think that it's more around framing

684
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,710
that you're asking development

685
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,600
organizations to change as opposed to

686
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,950
individual developers who are coming

687
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,740
into the organization it's tough when

688
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,419
you've got sort of these ossified

689
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,460
developers who have just you know kind

690
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:11,159
of fossilize their ways and everything

691
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,590
in your organization but making things

692
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:15,269
is free for developers if they if they

693
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,939
develop using a certain framework and

694
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:20,730
you've you know you've you banned unsafe

695
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,230
functions or you've changed you know the

696
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,759
development framework to one that's more

697
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:25,769
type safe so they have less of a chance

698
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,230
of making certain types of development

699
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:30,720
errors just naturally we're asking

700
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,580
organizations development organizations

701
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,889
to change and to incorporate the

702
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,000
processes earlier and if we think about

703
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:38,719
it

704
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,580
I mean computer science is the youngest

705
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,409
quote-unquote science we have a chance

706
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,090
to sort of shift this culture and one of

707
00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:46,350
the things I said was educating

708
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,539
developers at the university level

709
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,949
certainly I didn't go to school for

710
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:52,379
computer science I went from a molecular

711
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,090
biology and math but if you do have a

712
00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:56,610
chance to teach them in the university

713
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:58,199
teach them secure coding practices and

714
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,479
there really aren't that many university

715
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,159
programs that are doing that so I think

716
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,710
what we're asking for in the shift left

717
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,980
and shift these things earlier is shift

718
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,169
development organization

719
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:11,980
priorities and shift our educational

720
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:13,450
priorities for developers so I think it

721
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:16,090
comes down to building that relationship

722
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:20,980
and walking with them instead of telling

723
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:23,439
them what to do right and to to kind of

724
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,419
quote a few things that I saw this week

725
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,059
like we need to start writing code

726
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:30,850
ourselves like it it helps speak their

727
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:32,309
language right even if it's a few lambda

728
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:35,049
scripts here and there like they

729
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:37,210
understand that oh you we really do

730
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:39,850
understand what that change means to

731
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,250
them in their process so just building

732
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,750
those relationships and walking with

733
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,679
them instead of you know forcefully

734
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:51,030
pushing them somewhere yeah and I think

735
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,620
to kind of jump off that like I think

736
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:55,450
where Jeremiah was going with like we

737
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,659
need to change is in terms of like the

738
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:01,000
way that we approach problems and

739
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:02,860
recommend solutions instead of using

740
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,330
tools that don't work for developers and

741
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,059
only work for security people if you

742
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,678
need to evaluate tools with like a dual

743
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:12,250
audience like we would be really

744
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,900
hesitant to purchase anything that you

745
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,760
know ultimately could or should be

746
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,890
consumed by a developer without also

747
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,700
running a POC with our development teams

748
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:25,030
and I think that as much as people hate

749
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:26,860
the term Deb psych ops I think that what

750
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:28,540
DevOps you saw like developers and

751
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:31,360
operations people start to cross over

752
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:33,129
more and become more similar and I hope

753
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,899
that we'll see that same thing happen

754
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,730
with dev sack ops where you'll see more

755
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,260
security people and developers start to

756
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,240
kind of converge on like the types of

757
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,590
things that they work on and the way

758
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,080
that they think about things and that

759
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:47,639
includes security people or includes

760
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,990
developers becoming more security minded

761
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:54,190
you really earned your candy good job

762
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:56,260
who's next no sorry who's next over

763
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:58,330
there okay also I have candy for you

764
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:02,930
great

765
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:09,649
yeah Justin I am Justin Collins

766
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:11,810
currently at synopses Katie talked about

767
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:14,570
this I think a little bit but I asked I

768
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:17,659
thought of the question first which is

769
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:20,389
you know there's we're talking a lot how

770
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,770
do we build programs how do we you know

771
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,900
how do we build relationships with

772
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:26,980
developers so we can get security and

773
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:30,560
all these things but I'm thinking about

774
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:32,180
you know as Jeremiah said there's

775
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,220
there's not a lot of security people

776
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,040
compared to number of developers and

777
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:40,120
compared to the number of organizations

778
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:43,220
can we can every organization get a

779
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:45,139
security team with quality folks on it

780
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:48,950
who build this program from scratch it's

781
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:51,590
it seems unlikely so my question is what

782
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:54,080
can we do such that every organization

783
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:56,600
isn't starting at zero for security

784
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,100
especially for app sec but for security

785
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,290
in general is there something we can do

786
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,530
so that if I go and start a company I'm

787
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:04,940
not starting at zero Thanks

788
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:06,950
actually you know when I worked at

789
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,560
Microsoft one of the key things about

790
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:11,750
educating developers on security is

791
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,639
actually deliberately making the

792
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,710
assumption that you've hired the best

793
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,780
developers who know nothing about

794
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:20,870
security and making no assumptions

795
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:23,570
whatsoever that they have anything other

796
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:25,429
than zero experience in security and the

797
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:27,350
reason for that was that you could do

798
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,270
things like banning unsafe functions and

799
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:31,040
some of the stuff I talked about

800
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:33,260
enforcing a secure development life

801
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,850
cycle process from the design phase but

802
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,930
if they weren't adequately trained you

803
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,600
were you were basically not really

804
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:41,840
speaking in terms that they could fully

805
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,120
understand so starting pre STL if you

806
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,790
actually look at the Microsoft STL it

807
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,860
starts with a pre STL phase of education

808
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:51,770
and that's actually how the trustworthy

809
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:54,830
computing you know all stop whole

810
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:57,200
company stopped writing new code and the

811
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:59,480
developers all got put through security

812
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,680
training and that was a radical move but

813
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,870
I mean it was the largest software

814
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,490
company in the world saying we need to

815
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:07,550
start from Ground Zero so I don't think

816
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:09,860
it's I think it's particularly useful to

817
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,259
assume that your developers are going to

818
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,149
come in

819
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,550
some level just assume they're at

820
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:16,560
baseline zero and use your education

821
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,490
programs to make sure that they go

822
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,620
through and step through the

823
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:22,620
fundamentals I mean I was lucky in that

824
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:25,168
when I was a Linux developer 20 years

825
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:27,690
ago I had been assisted min before that

826
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:30,089
and I had been attacked so I had to know

827
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,440
how to attack my systems and I had to

828
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:33,060
know how host hardening and then as a

829
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,240
Linux developer making an operating

830
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:38,219
system I had to know how to lock down

831
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,850
that operating system that we shipped

832
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:44,009
right so I was unusual in that that I

833
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:46,080
had had practical experience that made

834
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,669
me a developer who understood security

835
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,500
and the importance of it but don't make

836
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,940
the assumptions that your developers

837
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,830
have had any other job that would have

838
00:34:50,940 --> 00:35:00,600
put that context into into full play

839
00:34:54,830 --> 00:35:03,240
just one of you one I feel like no all

840
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,400
right so what I think isn't important is

841
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,899
not every organization needs to build

842
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,480
all of that security knowledge in-house

843
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,640
so what I think is really important for

844
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,140
developers is know a baseline of

845
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,690
security so you should they should at

846
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:17,339
least be aware of some of the basics and

847
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,720
how to handle things but they should the

848
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:21,090
most important thing a developer can

849
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,770
learn or any person can learn is to know

850
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:24,870
when they don't know something and we

851
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,490
don't know something you go ask and in a

852
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,870
big organization you have security

853
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:29,549
champions so you can go ask your

854
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:31,830
teammate like hey how can I do this and

855
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:33,390
if they don't know it gets pushed up the

856
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,160
chain until you reach a security team

857
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,990
and if they don't know they should find

858
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,609
someone else who knows but for smaller

859
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:40,560
organizations that's not always feasible

860
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:42,750
but this knowledge is available you have

861
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,430
plenty of people offering all kinds of

862
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,260
security service so what you can do is

863
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,279
if a developer knows like hey I don't

864
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,830
know something if the organization

865
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,090
supports the fact that you don't know we

866
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,740
probably need to know before we

867
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,990
implement this or we're gonna mess it up

868
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,930
so let's go ask let's go find someone

869
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:59,970
who does know and I can imagine not

870
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,620
every developer needs to be an expert to

871
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,930
know all of these intricate details but

872
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,940
they should at least realize hmm if I

873
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:07,680
move this on this diagram to that

874
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,780
components I'm probably changing

875
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,270
something I have no idea what to impact

876
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:15,000
this I should go ask Daniel like hey man

877
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:17,490
I'm doing this is that okay and he's

878
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,710
probably like yeah or no I don't know

879
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,689
and this leads to discussions and that's

880
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,220
essentially that the whole point that

881
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,670
you reach a point where somebody can

882
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,709
give you the

883
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,700
answer and to be honest sometimes nobody

884
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,170
is going to be able to give you the

885
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,270
answer and that's when you start writing

886
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:33,119
best current practices for art and stuff

887
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:35,280
like that and even even with we didn't

888
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,619
have community the experts don't

889
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,880
necessarily agree because everybody has

890
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:40,559
their own different view and you need to

891
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,809
reach a consensus I think you can

892
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,490
corroborate that it's not that simple

893
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:46,230
but pushing it up towards more

894
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,970
knowledgeable people that's in my

895
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,950
opinion the best security reflex you can

896
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:51,660
develop and that's what I do when I

897
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:54,210
don't know something in what everybody

898
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:57,000
else should be doing as well when I

899
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,980
launched my first app sac program so I

900
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,020
was working at a Canadian government

901
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,760
department they didn't have one and I

902
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,109
was actually on the dev team by his

903
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,849
obsessed with security is really

904
00:37:04,109 --> 00:37:07,290
interested with win it and I had hired

905
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,760
hackers to come in and secure code

906
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,170
reviewers and all of this stuff and I

907
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,849
was in charge of her mediation and all

908
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,799
of these things I kept reporting

909
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:15,839
incidents to security and eventually I

910
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:18,000
joined the security team so then I is

911
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,619
the incident manager and then once I had

912
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,780
managed a whole ton of incidents I took

913
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:23,790
them so I love metrics I'm so obsessed

914
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,079
with data and then I broke them into

915
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,790
five different categories and then I

916
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,650
showed them financially how much it cost

917
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,540
all that such incidents we had and I

918
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,069
said I can solve all of these and

919
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,170
they're like you know what there's five

920
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:35,940
months left in your contract fill your

921
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:38,579
boots this is a thing we say in Canada

922
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,170
that means go do it and I just realized

923
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:40,859
like no one's gonna know what that means

924
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,829
okay

925
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:46,619
oh yeah mat that's right Canadians

926
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:48,630
represent but so then the first thing I

927
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:50,849
did was I had a little Lunch and Learn

928
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:53,040
so I made a safe area for them to go

929
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:55,319
smash things and it was like the first

930
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,420
time I did Publix became like everyone

931
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:59,790
and everyone's like hi Tanya they all

932
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,020
know me right I know it's like so

933
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,599
there's this little tool called SAP

934
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,579
we're gonna smash she smashed things and

935
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,410
then I was like I want all of you to

936
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:08,790
just run this on your web apps and like

937
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,190
it's gonna be like a game and then I'd

938
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:13,020
run around and high-five them and we

939
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,210
made like a little graph of like if you

940
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,980
find this if it's public you have to fix

941
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,020
it if you find that if it's like not

942
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,940
public you don't have to and we just

943
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,680
like kept encouraging a relationship

944
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,450
more and more and like I had hated the

945
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,098
security team when I was on the dev team

946
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:28,828
I actually walked up to them and told

947
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:30,420
them to off to their faces once and

948
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:32,500
I'm not a person that does that I was

949
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,810
just like like we had like.we

950
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,849
the election and they've gotten in my

951
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:39,250
way in a big time I'm like nothing stops

952
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:41,140
me I will go around you I was so pissed

953
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:44,290
and though they're my friends still

954
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,940
surprisingly eventually I was all of

955
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:49,240
their bosses so things worked out right

956
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:51,010
but like we had this really bad incident

957
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,149
and we told everyone what it was and I

958
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:54,520
felt so embarrassed to admit

959
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,410
imperfection but that got so many more

960
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,420
developers interested and I just kept

961
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:59,410
like every time we learned a thing I'd

962
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,119
be like I'm gonna have a little lunch

963
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:04,240
and learn guess what everyone I made

964
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,040
cookies and like I do bribes I'm like a

965
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,109
kindergarten teacher just waiting to

966
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,330
happen and like I would just like bring

967
00:39:08,109 --> 00:39:12,040
them in with like honey instead of going

968
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:14,319
and slapping their hands which is what

969
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,509
the previous security leaders had done

970
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,980
and I was like you know if like you're

971
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,660
having this thing can like I come over

972
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,800
can we like it's rat mullet there was

973
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,629
that mean I might gets evil brain

974
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,220
storming we're gonna be like if I was

975
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:27,730
gonna hack this how would I hack it and

976
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:29,560
I just tried to treat everyone as though

977
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:32,590
they were doing the absolute best that

978
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,930
they knew how to do and like with

979
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:37,780
respect and with gentleness and kindness

980
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:38,919
and like I really because that's what I

981
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:42,820
wanted I wanted to help

982
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:45,820
right and then I didn't seem scary and I

983
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,650
wasn't the big bad incident manager and

984
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,359
it's like Oh Tonya is a nerd she's a

985
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:50,920
nerd like us like I'm like oh do you

986
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,509
need help fixing that like let's go do

987
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,670
it and like if someone was excited about

988
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,230
security I'm like you're my guy and I

989
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,550
would like give them a book and do all

990
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,560
these things and we just started this

991
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:01,510
culture of like it's cool it's fun like

992
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,580
the security teams nice we'll bring you

993
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:05,320
cookies and teach you things and like

994
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,000
slowly like and then eventually my

995
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,410
contract was over and I had to leave but

996
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,119
like their security posture went up like

997
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,980
this like they're opening up legacy apps

998
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:14,140
and they're like I smashed the crap at

999
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,270
this Tonya I spent like 20 of this I'm

1000
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:18,400
gonna fix it this week and like just

1001
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:19,930
like when when like I was at my desk and

1002
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,760
I got this email and then I ran across

1003
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,500
the floor and then I high-five this guy

1004
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,390
and then I ran back to my desk and like

1005
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:29,080
the the chief information officer is

1006
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:30,549
like and I was like that is more

1007
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,259
important than you understand dude like

1008
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:34,510
he just he just kicked the crap out of

1009
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:36,849
zap like he found nothing and like he

1010
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:38,570
did this and guys I just keep doing it

1011
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:41,480
so that's one

1012
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,650
perché that you could take thank you the

1013
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,360
question kind of reminded me a

1014
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,770
conversation that had a you know

1015
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:50,090
probably eight ten years ago now with

1016
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:51,980
the sea so over at John Deere and he

1017
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:53,690
they had something like ten thousand

1018
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,130
developers or something like that and it

1019
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:57,020
was at the time where uh if you're from

1020
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:58,970
that Gary McGraw's work on the besa

1021
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,890
model where he'd they studied a

1022
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:02,540
high-performing software security teams

1023
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:05,509
at various companies and they said about

1024
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:07,009
two percent of the two percent of your

1025
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:09,200
development developer pool should be

1026
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:11,390
software security pros so it's doing the

1027
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,830
math with the CSO in my head and I go

1028
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:15,350
okay if you have ten thousand developers

1029
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:17,000
you're gonna need what what's the number

1030
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:19,490
there ten thousand thousand two hundred

1031
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,650
software security people because I have

1032
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:23,149
to hire two hundred software security

1033
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:25,190
people because I'm having trouble even

1034
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:27,680
hiring one in a competitive labor market

1035
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:29,960
like you know you know we're a large

1036
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,460
fortune 500 company but you want us to

1037
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,410
keep peak for timing it's Google on

1038
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,060
Facebook and uber and Salesforce and

1039
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,069
everything like that so he goes that's

1040
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,900
just not gonna happen so what he decided

1041
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,670
to do instead instead of like heavily

1042
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,990
compete in the labor market he decided

1043
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:45,020
to start investing in their own

1044
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:46,189
developers and making the developers and

1045
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,660
converting to them and to software

1046
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,760
security professionals because it was

1047
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,500
really the only way and someone like

1048
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,570
Tanya there is a perfect example of that

1049
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,250
Hargett organization can do that you can

1050
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:57,860
start with one and they start teaching

1051
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:00,980
other developers the core philosophies

1052
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:02,000
of software security and that actually

1053
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,620
works quite well for a number of

1054
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,750
organizations the only challenge that

1055
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,910
they have later down the road is those

1056
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,830
people end up being an extremely high

1057
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:17,410
demand so then you have to also work to

1058
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:17,410
keep them next question please

1059
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,290
well you guys are thinking of a question

1060
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,770
one of the things one of the things that

1061
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:31,279
helps a lot

1062
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:34,280
obviously is leave your arrogance at the

1063
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,020
door and don't think that even obvious

1064
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,050
mistakes are obvious to your audience

1065
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:41,720
and I think I've said it this way before

1066
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:43,640
it's not about calling their baby ugly

1067
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:51,169
it's about saying that it has some

1068
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:54,819
really interesting features right so

1069
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,820
just a little empathy goes a long way

1070
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:00,470
yeah so I think another important area

1071
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,510
of making it so that a company doesn't

1072
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:05,240
need so many security people to do a

1073
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:06,440
good job in security is focusing on

1074
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,419
things that like the language or

1075
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,950
framework level that make mistakes

1076
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,950
really really difficult if not

1077
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:15,290
impossible I can count the number of

1078
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:16,970
times we've had XSS successfully

1079
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:19,340
reported to our bug bounty on one hand

1080
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:21,649
and it's because our developers before

1081
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,910
we had any security people decided to

1082
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:25,670
use react because it was cool and

1083
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:29,180
Facebook was doing it and react makes

1084
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:30,920
XSS really difficult and so we have not

1085
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,390
had an XSS problem we've not had a C

1086
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,120
surf problem we've not had a sequel AI

1087
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:37,609
problem and then developers internally

1088
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:39,830
have written things to protect us from

1089
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:42,050
authorization issues and from SSR F

1090
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:43,610
issues and because a handful of

1091
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:45,350
developers wrote those things now

1092
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:47,570
everyone else just gets to benefit from

1093
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:49,130
that and they have to be like kind of

1094
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:50,780
aware of what those things are but

1095
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:53,030
generally they're pretty safe from

1096
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:55,310
falling into those traps and so I think

1097
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,920
that that's the way that at least app

1098
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:59,810
sec moves forward the fastest is making

1099
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,160
it so that people don't even have to

1100
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:06,290
know what these things are because it's

1101
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:08,770
so hard to make these mistakes what

1102
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:11,770
other questions do we have from you guys

1103
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:11,770
yes

1104
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:30,140
yes the question was is it more

1105
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:32,419
difficult to hire security professionals

1106
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:34,098
or converting developers into security

1107
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,019
professionals I'm just repeating it for

1108
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:37,789
the audience not answering you answer if

1109
00:44:36,019 --> 00:44:39,200
you want to ask me ten years ago I would

1110
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:41,390
have said converting developers but I

1111
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,259
think we've shifted and we've had to

1112
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:49,308
it's definitely hiring a security

1113
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:50,930
focused person probably mostly because

1114
00:44:49,309 --> 00:44:52,369
of the market I mean the markets insane

1115
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:55,308
I mean I was in consulting for how many

1116
00:44:52,369 --> 00:44:57,229
years and the resumes that would come in

1117
00:44:55,309 --> 00:45:00,109
I mean people are job hopping every six

1118
00:44:57,229 --> 00:45:01,460
to nine months and they're they're doing

1119
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:04,999
it because people are throwing

1120
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:07,099
ridiculous sums money at them so at some

1121
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:09,828
point you know we had to make that shift

1122
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:11,359
into all right developers actually

1123
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:12,829
developers are better they're more

1124
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:16,249
passionate they already understand code

1125
00:45:12,829 --> 00:45:19,160
it's very easy to train them in the

1126
00:45:16,249 --> 00:45:21,618
security side if you will I would say

1127
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,569
it's a lot easier to train developers

1128
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:25,759
who are willing to learn about security

1129
00:45:23,569 --> 00:45:28,219
than it is to convert security people

1130
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:30,109
into having understanding of the

1131
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:32,630
realities of development and shipping

1132
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:36,769
stable code absolutely I would say it's

1133
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:39,890
it's easier going that direction I have

1134
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:42,379
a question if you just give me once I

1135
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:44,299
sure so do I want to use that at that

1136
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,469
point here the market dynamic so let's

1137
00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:46,759
take your number one number from your

1138
00:45:45,469 --> 00:45:49,719
presentation I think you said something

1139
00:45:46,759 --> 00:45:52,729
like 23 million developers give or take

1140
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:54,200
if we take Gary McGraw's numbers for how

1141
00:45:52,729 --> 00:45:56,660
many software security people we need in

1142
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:59,569
the world let's say 2% of the 23 million

1143
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:02,239
that's four hundred and sixty thousand

1144
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:03,788
software security people we need look

1145
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:07,160
around the room here how many we got

1146
00:46:03,789 --> 00:46:08,690
pretty okay so now if these companies

1147
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,249
are gonna need to hire software security

1148
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:12,680
people and they do and they are there's

1149
00:46:10,249 --> 00:46:15,828
no way there's just not enough people to

1150
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,749
go around so I don't even know if it's a

1151
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:19,579
choice we're gonna have to invest in the

1152
00:46:17,749 --> 00:46:21,529
developers that already exist for most

1153
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:24,019
organizations because the labor pool is

1154
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:24,630
just not there so great job security for

1155
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:26,669
us salary

1156
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:28,770
we'll go up we'll have great job options

1157
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:30,090
and that will last for a while it's the

1158
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:31,650
companies that need software security

1159
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:36,570
people that are gonna be put in a tough

1160
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:37,650
spot gently what a comment on Leif Leif

1161
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,510
is saying that they've done some

1162
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:40,980
framework work where developers can just

1163
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:44,010
write code with minimal knowledge and

1164
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,690
still do secure I really don't believe

1165
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,970
you leave I think that that's that's

1166
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:50,610
such a marketing like story that I call

1167
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:52,620
 on because the reality is even

1168
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:55,050
with some of the best frameworks we have

1169
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:56,490
in the world today among the sharpest

1170
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:59,400
teams of developers are still writing

1171
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:01,709
balls against these frameworks so so III

1172
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,140
think the opposite is true even with the

1173
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:05,370
best modern frameworks that we have in

1174
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,740
the world today with some of the best

1175
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:10,020
teams tuning them developers without

1176
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:12,540
knowledge make make big mistakes easily

1177
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:15,300
so I really I'm skeptical of what you

1178
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:17,580
have to say and sure and my the second

1179
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:20,460
part of my question is why do developers

1180
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:22,740
using modern frameworks get so many

1181
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,810
problems with them why do we not have

1182
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:27,330
automatic security and modern frameworks

1183
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:30,570
that most developers use today I think

1184
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:31,620
if I the question I was answering I

1185
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:35,220
don't know if this is the one that was

1186
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:39,000
asked was how do you have a reasonably

1187
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:43,379
good like security program with very

1188
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,790
minimal or no security people as that so

1189
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,440
then Jim just made like a flat-out

1190
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:51,120
statement that what you were saying was

1191
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:53,550
 was that was the first part of

1192
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,740
my comment no so I'm kind of I'm at

1193
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:57,510
Justin's question what I'm hearing for

1194
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:59,279
you as a developer could just start

1195
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:02,610
writing code to a certain framework

1196
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,780
without without needing to know security

1197
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,950
that that's the thing that I was

1198
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,890
wracking dude that was the implication

1199
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:10,319
that I heard from that so I would love

1200
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:12,089
to hear more about what and I'd love to

1201
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,190
hear more about what you did to your

1202
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:16,590
frameworks to make them so resilient to

1203
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:19,920
these common security issues and second

1204
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:22,190
is a general question why are the modern

1205
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,570
frameworks at developers using today

1206
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,950
require special knowledge and they just

1207
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:28,250
can't use them and get automatic

1208
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:32,520
security those are my two questions so

1209
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:34,770
yeah the answer is providing is how do

1210
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,870
you move security forward with minimal

1211
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:38,200
security people at a given company and I

1212
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:40,480
think you need to make it as

1213
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,848
as possible by default for developers to

1214
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,710
write secure code and I was given an

1215
00:48:42,849 --> 00:48:48,010
example of react which you know

1216
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:50,950
historically XSS has been in the top 10

1217
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:54,160
forever and even with no security people

1218
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:56,740
at segments in the time that I've been

1219
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,200
there I think we have found like four

1220
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:01,569
instances of XSS did five when we were

1221
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,990
outside sure for goodbye let's go back I

1222
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:08,859
mean still single-digit XSS numbers is

1223
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:10,509
like it's pretty good and it's that was

1224
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:13,390
written by people that for the most part

1225
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:15,040
probably didn't know what XSS was and I

1226
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:17,890
believe that I think that is very

1227
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:22,500
impressive that is very impressive and I

1228
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:24,790
think another example is our SSR our

1229
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,650
protections are something that our SRE

1230
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:29,410
team built at the container level that

1231
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:32,079
inspect all outgoing network traffic and

1232
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:35,129
resolve every domain at the container

1233
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:37,480
level and make the IP connection first

1234
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:39,849
after checking against the blacklist of

1235
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,349
internal IP addresses and then they'll

1236
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:43,780
make the connection to whatever the

1237
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:46,720
domain is over that same IP connection

1238
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:49,720
and so that makes it impossible as far

1239
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,270
as we know for somebody to fall victim

1240
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:54,399
to SSR F or DNS rebinding a segment and

1241
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:55,630
it's something that we talked about in

1242
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,650
our trainings it's something that

1243
00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:03,119
somebody from our SRE team built and now

1244
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:05,260
anybody else who is interacting with

1245
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,240
like host names or IPS that are

1246
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,650
user-provided

1247
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,240
they're still supposed to do some

1248
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:11,890
checking to make sure that that stuff

1249
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,649
isn't taking place but there's also that

1250
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:16,210
safety blanket you know to make sure

1251
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:18,599
that we don't have any problems because

1252
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:20,710
it's something that is as far as we know

1253
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:22,089
something that you can't bypass do you

1254
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:23,560
overwhelming technical nature of your

1255
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:26,589
answer makes me actually believe you now

1256
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,630
so that that's a let me let me know

1257
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:29,799
that's a legit answer can you answer the

1258
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:31,990
second part of my question that I'll

1259
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,970
shut up for real why why was the second

1260
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:36,250
quadrant frameworks in the world today

1261
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:38,439
why do they have why do I not get

1262
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:40,240
automatic security and most frameworks

1263
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,670
that are out there today I mean I think

1264
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,540
like anything that is a complex issue it

1265
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:46,700
takes time I think

1266
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,320
frameworks generally are moving in the

1267
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,660
correct direction and I think that if

1268
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,220
you look at your average framework or

1269
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,629
your average web app that's getting

1270
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,700
built with like the latest tech now

1271
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:57,860
versus five versus ten years ago it's

1272
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,060
like do you think things like how much

1273
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,860
better do you think they are I'd say

1274
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:03,770
probably a lot like I was doing pen

1275
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:06,860
testing five years ago and it's like we

1276
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:09,290
would find XSS on literally every app it

1277
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,580
was like weird if you didn't find XSS or

1278
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:11,000
like you just assumed you missed

1279
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:13,640
something

1280
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:17,120
yeah it's like where's the XSS on this

1281
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,859
app and now you know we just have to

1282
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,810
watch out for like JavaScript your eyes

1283
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:22,040
and dangerously set in their HTML and

1284
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,840
like if you find something other than

1285
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,610
that it's like we're super impressed

1286
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,870
like we would love for you to report

1287
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:29,510
something like that to our bug bounty

1288
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:30,890
because yeah we would have no idea what

1289
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:32,840
that well there's another light so I'll

1290
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:35,890
react areas do you pay well in your bug

1291
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:39,440
bounty here yeah money isn't everything

1292
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:41,270
money isn't everything I'll remember

1293
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,010
that we're negotiating rate with your

1294
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:44,930
company

1295
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:52,610
oh I cost what I cost take it or leave

1296
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:54,379
it anyway so here's but here's a here's

1297
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,690
an answer to your question that takes

1298
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:58,850
our history of our industry into account

1299
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:05,270
I mentioned computer or computer science

1300
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:10,569
is young how old is Google the company

1301
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:14,840
how old is Google 20 1998 yeah

1302
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:17,360
21 Google's old enough to drink now why

1303
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:21,410
do you think we have no code maturity as

1304
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:24,880
an industry come on Google is 21 they

1305
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:29,000
only created Chrome what a decade ago

1306
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:31,820
you know I wrote semantics vulnerability

1307
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,340
disclosure policy in 2005 I wrote

1308
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:36,170
Microsoft's in 2010 when we think about

1309
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,330
all of these frameworks that are coming

1310
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:40,040
into play it's not the first attempt

1311
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:42,799
that the software industry has tried to

1312
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:45,500
make it easier or easier to write secure

1313
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,060
code or hard to write insecure code dude

1314
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:52,010
does anyone is anyone old enough to

1315
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:53,870
remember plan 9 hey all right

1316
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:55,490
these are your drinking buddy by these

1317
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,999
people drinks who wait raise your hands

1318
00:52:55,490 --> 00:53:01,390
again who remembers plan 9

1319
00:52:56,999 --> 00:53:04,058
to two people we are old enough to be

1320
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:06,578
your great grand uncles and sister what

1321
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:09,039
what is plan 9 okay it was it was an

1322
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:11,019
operating system that was designed with

1323
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:14,170
a security model that was supposed to

1324
00:53:11,019 --> 00:53:16,269
actually ensure like actual security

1325
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:18,759
assurance at every layer you know what

1326
00:53:16,269 --> 00:53:20,890
happened to it no one used it not that

1327
00:53:18,759 --> 00:53:23,559
no one used it no one used it because

1328
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:25,808
app developers were like you know how to

1329
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:27,460
write code for this thing it was

1330
00:53:25,809 --> 00:53:29,470
commercially not viable

1331
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:31,210
what's viable commercially is code you

1332
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:33,970
can write fast scripting languages you

1333
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:36,640
can write fast so why have we not solve

1334
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:39,519
this problem because we want stuff fast

1335
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:42,549
and we want more developers to be able

1336
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:44,709
to like fall off into you know a half a

1337
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:46,269
day coding or scripting tutorial on

1338
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:49,210
YouTube and then just suddenly be able

1339
00:53:46,269 --> 00:53:51,488
to write code and let me tell you when

1340
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:54,039
so Jorge talked yesterday is working in

1341
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:56,259
the room still he's probably like scuba

1342
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:58,059
diving now but Jorge was talking for

1343
00:53:56,259 --> 00:54:00,609
Microsoft about the multi-party

1344
00:53:58,059 --> 00:54:02,109
vulnerability coordination that meltdown

1345
00:54:00,609 --> 00:54:04,480
inspector you know had to do

1346
00:54:02,109 --> 00:54:06,578
he mentioned MS VR Microsoft

1347
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,849
vulnerability research I started that

1348
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:11,950
program in 2008 that's that is how long

1349
00:54:09,849 --> 00:54:14,019
Microsoft has had the capacity to

1350
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:15,788
deliberately do multi-party phone

1351
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:17,859
coordination so I'm like giving you the

1352
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:21,759
history answer why haven't we fixed it

1353
00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:24,910
cuz we're all still pretty new it's fun

1354
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:26,499
it's funny when I like your question

1355
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:29,078
there was a pretty funny it so it's

1356
00:54:26,499 --> 00:54:30,609
always historical it's very it's all

1357
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:34,779
we're all very new at this it hasn't

1358
00:54:30,609 --> 00:54:36,910
been that long I mean when I got into

1359
00:54:34,779 --> 00:54:42,730
space web security wasn't a term and

1360
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:45,569
that was long ago I was just gonna say

1361
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:48,249
cuz it's it's really hard I mean

1362
00:54:45,569 --> 00:54:51,009
how long have we been dealing with

1363
00:54:48,249 --> 00:54:54,640
sequel injection right since 98 right

1364
00:54:51,009 --> 00:54:58,180
Christmas day 98 right I mean I think

1365
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:00,279
that's really it's hard you know and and

1366
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:02,410
some of these frameworks like like react

1367
00:55:00,279 --> 00:55:04,359
I mean they're really good at a couple

1368
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:07,029
of things and and didn't even address

1369
00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:10,840
others right so yeah it's it's just hard

1370
00:55:07,029 --> 00:55:12,850
I want to quickly jump in here so

1371
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,950
I kind of agree with the answer that the

1372
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:17,080
framework is not a solution but it helps

1373
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:19,299
a lot so what you have with these

1374
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,190
frameworks is that they reduce the

1375
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,990
amount of mistakes you can make yes you

1376
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:24,490
can still write react code that is

1377
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:26,560
vulnerable to cross-site scripting if

1378
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:28,569
you use things like angular I'm a more

1379
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:30,670
of a fan of angular because they do more

1380
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:32,620
than the other frameworks they go they

1381
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:34,960
not only escape output they also offer

1382
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,560
sanitization out-of-the-box enabled no

1383
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,600
mistakes

1384
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,640
you just do what you're used to do as a

1385
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,589
developer and you have secure code can

1386
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:45,009
you screw it up yes of course you can

1387
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:50,260
but screw it up you'll have to you to

1388
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:51,910
make a mistake you have to you have to

1389
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,650
do specific things you can easily scan

1390
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:55,210
for these specific things the function

1391
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:57,760
and angular to make a mistake is called

1392
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:59,950
bypass security trust HTML as a

1393
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,420
developer they called it everybody's

1394
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:02,950
laughing like our come on that's funny

1395
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:04,480
you know why it's called that way

1396
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:07,120
because an angular one it's called trust

1397
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:09,670
us HTML you find sanitizers on Stack

1398
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:11,350
Overflow using the function trust as a

1399
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:12,880
sanitizer but it doesn't send it as

1400
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:14,770
anything it simply bypasses the

1401
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,630
frameworks protection so now they set

1402
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:18,430
what's called bypass security trust HTML

1403
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:20,650
or dangerous and self enriched email and

1404
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:22,990
react so that if somebody copied basis

1405
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:25,180
you see like whoa what is this if as a

1406
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:27,339
developer the word bypass security

1407
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:28,600
doesn't trigger a bell I'm kind of

1408
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,830
inclined to say you need to find a

1409
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,390
different job I actually tell this to

1410
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:33,310
developers

1411
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:35,290
seriously but developers don't want to

1412
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:37,029
write insecure code they just don't want

1413
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:38,830
to read through all the documentation to

1414
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:40,480
figure out is this okay or not they just

1415
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:43,120
want something they can easily

1416
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,370
understand and a framework but why don't

1417
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,990
the frameworks solved is because the

1418
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:49,299
moment you start solving these things I

1419
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:51,459
notice a lot of these things very

1420
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,860
correct and many people don't like it

1421
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:55,540
because it forces them to follow the

1422
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:57,190
angular way of doing things and that's

1423
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:58,690
not maybe what you're used to doing not

1424
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:00,520
what you like or doesn't fit your

1425
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:02,080
situation and then you have the the

1426
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,600
lighter frameworks react this kind of a

1427
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:06,640
UI library they call it themselves they

1428
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,560
don't do sanitization by default why

1429
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:11,200
because it's out of scope for them they

1430
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:13,720
literally say like we only try to offer

1431
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,580
this part of the the framework or this

1432
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,040
part of the ecosystem and we are fine by

1433
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:19,900
doing them which again implies that the

1434
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:22,970
developer requires some knowledge to

1435
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:24,680
figure out how to do things securely and

1436
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:27,348
that you don't have cross as scripting

1437
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,669
is a plausible that's pretty good but it

1438
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:30,050
also requires some knowledge about a

1439
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:31,579
framework it requires teaching

1440
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:33,410
developers to not misuse this

1441
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:35,210
dangerously set in HTML and stuff like

1442
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:36,828
that but it's it's never gonna be a

1443
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:38,900
total solution I mean the Redux

1444
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:41,300
documentation had across a scripting

1445
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,430
flaw in the actual dogs that was a major

1446
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:45,770
react security problem if you did

1447
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:47,509
server-side rendering because the people

1448
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:49,730
writing that weren't aware of some

1449
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:51,170
specific escaping problem and it

1450
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:52,609
actually cost cross-site scripting so

1451
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:55,280
there's always gonna be these things but

1452
00:57:52,609 --> 00:57:57,859
it's a lot less before that if you're

1453
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,480
building GSP pages you had thousands and

1454
00:57:57,859 --> 00:58:01,190
thousands of outputs and ways to

1455
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:04,369
introduce cross-site scripting and now

1456
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:06,530
in react and angular you f12 Pinner you

1457
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:08,990
have three or four and we can scan for

1458
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:10,220
those and we can educate developers and

1459
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:12,348
there's less they need to know about

1460
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:14,990
these things and that is definitely the

1461
00:58:12,349 --> 00:58:16,280
way forward and that's definitely a big

1462
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:18,410
improvement that we're seeing so yes

1463
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,930
security faults are the solution but

1464
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:23,450
it's gonna take some time to get there

1465
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:25,819
in on a universal scale but I think

1466
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:27,290
we're approving a lot and the fact that

1467
00:58:25,819 --> 00:58:29,420
your application is what more secure

1468
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:31,160
from the get-go is definitely the

1469
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:34,069
example it's that's the way of going

1470
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:35,779
forward absolutely so we are four

1471
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:37,279
minutes from lunch and there's no way

1472
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:42,829
I'm keeping you from that there were two

1473
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:44,810
questions so if we could get one more

1474
00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:46,579
question for the audience I mean for the

1475
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:54,589
audience and the way t-shirts been like

1476
00:58:46,579 --> 00:58:56,540
waving his arm for a really long time so

1477
00:58:54,589 --> 00:58:59,450
kind of related to Justin's question is

1478
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:01,759
somebody who made this transition we're

1479
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:03,828
known for hey we need more some more

1480
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,420
security people also we're known for no

1481
00:59:03,829 --> 00:59:07,280
you don't have five years experience we

1482
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,740
can't hire you oh my god right we are

1483
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,569
all very open I mean as Jeremiah noted

1484
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:14,899
we're all very open to sharing when it

1485
00:59:11,569 --> 00:59:16,730
comes time to hire you and pay you money

1486
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:19,970
it's a different story so I'd like to

1487
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:22,040
hear thoughts anecdotes successes in

1488
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:24,600
this era rina of bringing people in

1489
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:27,210
fostering them how we bill

1490
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:28,500
that talent thank you before we answer

1491
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:31,310
this question which of you is

1492
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:35,280
responsible for hiring other people

1493
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:36,210
Katie right there all right well you're

1494
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,130
you're one of the people that was

1495
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:39,870
quote-unquote hired you know from

1496
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:42,540
internally so please speak from that

1497
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:44,759
perspective um I did it I had a

1498
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:47,460
professional mentor and he advocated for

1499
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,680
me I had more than one man who was like

1500
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:51,570
one of them even said I won't take this

1501
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,879
contract unless time is coming I won't

1502
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:55,770
come and they're just like I'm not going

1503
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,390
unless she's coming too because they

1504
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:58,860
they saw my potential and they knew I

1505
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:00,629
was gonna go with our I've started this

1506
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:02,250
program called mentoring Monday so if

1507
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:03,810
you use a hashtag on Monday and put

1508
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:05,760
mentoring Monday and you take me I will

1509
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:08,520
retweet it every Monday until you find

1510
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,870
someone because I advocate for the

1511
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,670
people that I mentor I have like this

1512
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:13,049
big list of people that I'm like oh

1513

1514
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:17,160
for you and I do all sorts of things

1515
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,630
like that to advocate for people that

1516
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:21,660
are less well-known but who I know are

1517
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:23,220
awesome right and so we so who here's

1518
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:25,379
done their job more than two years in

1519
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:28,049
InfoSec yeah you know enough to be a

1520
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:29,910
mentor and I hope that all of us senior

1521
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:31,530
people will pick someone or some ones

1522
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:38,370
that we can pass this information down

1523
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:41,940
to yeah we need to bridge this gap we

1524
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:44,670
need to before we get on to the one I

1525
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:46,140
just like that one so much if you're in

1526
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:47,850
this space and you have achieved some a

1527
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:50,520
level of success in your career

1528
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:52,170
please take personal responsibility you

1529
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:55,920
owe it to the rest of the community to

1530
01:00:52,170 --> 01:01:00,030
toe other people up that's the only way

1531
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:02,100
I would just add to that that especially

1532
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:03,870
if you're a white dude you can you do

1533
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:07,200
that because here's the thing I'm

1534
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:09,240
constantly asked what are you doing to

1535
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,790
get more women interested in yada yada

1536
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:14,819
and I'm like actually all genders of

1537
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:18,000
humans are born curious some of us are

1538
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:20,130
discouraged from that curiosity and and

1539
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,290
I call it the lady tax when you expect

1540
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:24,570
me to lift up the rest of my also

1541
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:27,000
underrepresented group that takes away

1542
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:30,750
from my primary work so I of course I do

1543
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:34,200
it but white dudes step on up but the

1544
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:36,360
the thing about hiring so I came from a

1545
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,810
non-traditional background in terms of

1546
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,940
even computer science

1547
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:41,400
so I think that built for me as a hiring

1548
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:45,360
manager built a lot of empathy for

1549
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:47,800
looking for people with Drive grit

1550
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:50,050
unspoiled curiosity largely unspoiled

1551
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:52,180
curiosity and the ability to work hard

1552
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:55,090
and learn and giving those folks a shot

1553
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:56,560
I love giving people stretch goals you

1554
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:58,150
know so it's like okay you're interested

1555
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:00,520
in moving into security you don't have

1556
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:02,140
you know all of these things but tell me

1557
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:04,000
about how you solve this problem that

1558
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:06,069
was a security you know related problem

1559
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,140
and you can begin to spot those kinds of

1560
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:10,810
qualities you know in in people the

1561
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:13,330
other big tip is that your HR hiring

1562
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:20,590
processes are probably screening out and

1563
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:23,440
not even letting me see that's HR trying

1564
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:24,940
to they're trying to they're trying to

1565
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,830
get in the way but here's the thing if

1566
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:28,150
you can't because I have an example

1567
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:29,860
where I was trying to hire for a

1568
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:32,290
community manager inside of Microsoft

1569
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:34,210
all the resumes I was getting from

1570
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:39,430
outside candidates that HR was handing

1571
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:42,010
me were feds it was like FBI and I'm

1572
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:45,790
like uh-huh no and I was like can you

1573
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:47,560
stop sending me like law enforcement but

1574
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:49,120
the candidates for this job and they

1575
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:51,250
were like but they have five years of

1576
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:54,730
experience and I was like in arresting

1577
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:56,890
hackers can we not because I'm not the

1578
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:58,600
right candidate so get in with your HR

1579
01:02:56,890 --> 01:03:01,720
department make sure that they are not

1580
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:03,400
accidentally screening out not just you

1581
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,950
know sending you the wrong candidates

1582
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:08,290
completely but screening out ones with

1583
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:09,970
that kind of potential and you know

1584
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:11,500
spend some time talking to them about

1585
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:13,779
what you're really really looking for

1586
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:18,730
and how you are looking for

1587
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:20,500
non-traditional candidates as well just

1588
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:22,480
to say one quick thing one thing that's

1589
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:26,260
really helpful for that is just having a

1590
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,820
list of like optional not even

1591
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:29,860
requirements but just like here's a

1592
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:31,840
bunch of things that people have done

1593
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:33,640
before that made them successful in this

1594
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,050
instead of saying like five years of

1595
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,859
this and three years of this or whatever

1596
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:40,060
it's just like a list of attributes or

1597
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:44,560
experiences that you might have instead

1598
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:46,270
of something that's like a hard list I'm

1599
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:48,549
gonna be off topic if you ask the

1600
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:49,849
question I have your candy for you and I

1601
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:52,339
heard lunches now

1602
01:03:49,849 --> 01:03:55,039
yeah to close up the panel just one for

1603
01:03:52,339 --> 01:03:56,989
myself as a as someone who's literally

1604
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,789
hired hundreds of people for application

1605
01:03:56,989 --> 01:04:00,680
security roles I've actually never been

1606
01:03:58,789 --> 01:04:02,119
able to tell any certification whether

1607
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:04,940
they graduated from college and any

1608
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:06,709
degree any skill and how that correlates

1609
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:08,660
to on-the-job performance there's only

1610
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:10,819
been one thing I've ever been a discern

1611
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:11,959
on what separates people are good from

1612
01:04:10,819 --> 01:04:14,449
the one they're not so good and it's

1613
01:04:11,959 --> 01:04:16,549
grit the ones that will grind it and

1614
01:04:14,449 --> 01:04:19,249
learn and teach other people every

1615
01:04:16,549 --> 01:04:20,569
moment of every single day one thing

1616
01:04:19,249 --> 01:04:22,069
you'll heal me if you're me say

1617
01:04:20,569 --> 01:04:23,449
constantly there's nothing in this space

1618
01:04:22,069 --> 01:04:25,699
especially application security that's

1619
01:04:23,449 --> 01:04:27,619
cerebral II really challenging like

1620
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:29,449
we're not doing crypto here and strange

1621
01:04:27,619 --> 01:04:32,569
things like that we're doing input

1622
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:34,609
validation output filtering prepared

1623
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:36,319
statements right and if you're willing
