1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,760
yeah so Jim gave it away it's just you

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,230
tell them that there are security

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,969
champion and that's the end of it so

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,870
sorry no so just quick a little bit

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,690
about Who I am

6
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,719
Ryan O'Boyle I get lots of fun

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,830
variations on that last name if I wasn't

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,109
in this industry I don't think I would

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:23,038
have any idea why this stuff happens all

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,900
the time but my background I was a pen

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,199
tester for ten years at Fidelity

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,359
Investments where we built up an

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,360
internal pen testing team totally

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,390
focused on app sec back around the turn

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,100
of the century from there I went on to

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,940
very code and started doing security

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,809
research and then over time you know one

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,419
of the things that was interesting about

19
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,399
pen testing that way internally was it

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,280
wasn't just oh we we go after the site

21
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,860
we hand off a report we maybe do a quick

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,020
one hour call a couple weeks later no we

23
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,149
were internal we were expected to work

24
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,770
with the development teams from the time

25
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,870
we told them the problem until they had

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,750
fixed the problem that was part of our

27
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:07,798
responsibility as well so from there I

28
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:10,260
went into severe code to do more product

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,090
security focus and went from research to

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,970
actually running our own internal

31
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,979
product security which you'd think you

32
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,860
know product security at an app set

33
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,320
company it should just be the easiest

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,700
job in the world right no it's not

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,589
there's we still have all the same

36
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,970
problems that everybody out there has

37
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,460
when it comes to dealing with this stuff

38
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,100
and more important than any of that one

39
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,960
time I was walking down the street in

40
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,630
actually Salem Massachusetts and a bird

41
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,460
just landed on me and I took that as a

42
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,770
pretty big compliment so I was mistaken

43
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,759
for a tree once which I thought was

44
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:48,119
pretty cool um and so if David and the

45
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:52,380
last talk brought you brought you down

46
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:54,270
and brought you to a dark space I'm

47
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,250
gonna do my best to bring you out of

48
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,890
there so I'm gonna try something new and

49
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,619
I'm gonna ask you all to actually close

50
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,990
your eyes we're gonna do a quick

51
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,740
visualization okay so take a deep breath

52
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:10,590
in and a deep breath out

53
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:15,030
another deep breath in and deep breath

54
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:20,150
out okay you're you're you're in a dark

55
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:22,680
s bomb forest and in the distance you

56
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,830
think you might hear you know the

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:30,330
howling of a pack of new pivotal

58
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:33,569
vulnerabilities but you see a path you

59
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,760
start walking along that path and you

60
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:38,069
can you can hear birds tweeting InfoSec

61
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,459
birds tweeting in the in the trees above

62
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:44,190
you there's a I think that sounded like

63
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:49,260
the rare red crested drug something

64
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:51,720
about a an OPSEC fail but as you keep

65
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,459
moving down that path it doesn't look

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,930
quite so dark you start to see some

67
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:59,489
fruit on the trees you hear you hear

68
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,580
someone coming through it's not one of

69
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:04,560
those vulns though it's it's a developer

70
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,700
a relatively new developer but they're

71
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,319
coming to you asking hey I heard about

72
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,208
this scanning stuff we're supposed to do

73
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,179
in our pipeline can you help me get that

74
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:17,810
going I want to do that and you keep you

75
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,340
keep moving on you see bigger fruit you

76
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,780
pluck one of those if you're one of

77
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,950
those carnivores we heard about

78
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,340
yesterday it's okay if it's meat

79
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,510
flavored you take a nice big juicy bite

80
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,209
and then you see one of your senior

81
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,798
developers come out and they're they're

82
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,120
not even there to ask you about any you

83
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,829
know to ask something of you they're

84
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,519
saying hey I think I found this

85
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:40,230
privilege escalation and I think I have

86
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,600
a fix for it I just wanted to run it all

87
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,459
past you and they're not part of your

88
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,109
product security team right there just a

89
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:51,299
developer okay so that that's a you can

90
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,190
open your eyes now so all right so

91
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,880
that's the type of journey that we're

92
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:59,130
talking about here of finding ways to

93
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,040
have your representatives from your

94
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,440
development teams participate in your

95
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,660
product security program because how

96
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,489
many of you were alone walking down in

97
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,350
those dark woods you know how many

98
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:14,790
products security teams of like one or

99
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:16,858
two are in here right so that's the

100
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,108
problem is how can you possibly scale

101
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,988
your program when you're talking about

102
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:22,810
one

103
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:26,440
view versus 100 developers or maybe even

104
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:28,900
more and security champions are the way

105
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,719
that we over the past five or six years

106
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,789
have dealt with this problem so what is

107
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,819
a security champion there's a lot of

108
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:39,039
definitions out there some of them are

109
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,780
as Jim said hey guess what your security

110
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,818
champion now and that's about the end of

111
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,679
it some of them are a little more

112
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:45,960
concrete and they'll say that you know a

113
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,419
security champion is someone who's

114
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,370
supposed to work with the product

115
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:55,389
security team or whatever security team

116
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:58,659
to kind of just just get them involved

117
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:02,770
but our definition of my definition is a

118
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:05,770
little bit more more responsibility

119
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,280
involved so we view it as someone who's

120
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,840
a member of one of the product teams and

121
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,090
they don't just they don't just

122
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,198
participate in activities but over time

123
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:18,698
they actually take on some ownership of

124
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:23,590
the security and take on some of that

125
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:27,909
responsibility for their product they're

126
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:30,520
also there in that role there's usually

127
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:32,050
we shoot for at least two on every team

128
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,090
because we want to have that redundancy

129
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,340
people inevitably move around from team

130
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,508
to team people leave the company new

131
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,549
people come in all the time

132
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:41,440
so we try to have that built in

133
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,880
redundancy of at least two for a team

134
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,229
and it's not that we we give them this

135
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,270
role and we give them that

136
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:50,919
responsibility and kind of throw them

137
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:55,330
out to the you know into the dark woods

138
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:57,400
with the wolves but we instead build

139
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,318
this program around supporting them and

140
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,448
training them up and gradually

141
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,669
transitioning them through sort of two

142
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:05,469
phases of what we can expect from them

143
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:07,960
and they become that first level

144
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:10,199
resource to their team but there's

145
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,340
always a role for product security or

146
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:16,150
information security whatever other

147
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:20,948
specialized security teams you have and

148
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:22,690
they're also not just there to to do

149
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:24,430
sort of what we tell them but to figure

150
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,500
out how to incorporate what we're

151
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,330
bringing to them into all of the

152
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,219
development processes and using the

153
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,300
development tools and everything they

154
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:33,449
already know

155
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,490
as part of their day-to-day role and

156
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:41,289
they're also a part of a community or a

157
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:43,210
guild that becomes a resource for them

158
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:44,770
to share experiences to share the

159
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,229
challenges that they're running into and

160
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,150
when we talked to one team about a

161
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:53,169
problem they can share the way they

162
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:55,599
solve that with the rest of the guild in

163
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:58,840
a thing too I'm going to talk about how

164
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:01,599
we have done things but it keep in mind

165
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,068
what your culture is like because that's

166
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,780
going to be the most important thing the

167
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:08,169
same way we're looking at trying to find

168
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:11,440
a way to adapt our product security asks

169
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:13,780
to the development teams it's the same

170
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,460
idea find find the things from this that

171
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,628
resonate with your culture or just think

172
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:22,239
about how you could do something similar

173
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:23,919
with with your environment so starting

174
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,240
off we're gonna seed the program in a

175
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,590
couple ways before we can actually start

176
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,629
giving people this role and asking them

177
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,989
to take on responsibility we need to do

178
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:37,300
some stuff to get ready one of those

179
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,860
things is to get commitment from all of

180
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,159
the different stakeholders in this

181
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:45,069
process so the security team is

182
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:47,159
presumably your team a lot of the stuff

183
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:50,139
we heard yesterday from James and Tonya

184
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:52,569
about the the ways you can modernize

185
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:58,449
your security program and develop that

186
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:59,710
empathy and you know all the things that

187
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:02,819
you can do that we've already been

188
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:07,330
discussed I won't rehash but those are

189
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:08,860
critical in you getting up to speed with

190
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,500
the way development teams are working

191
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,960
now and speed is definitely going to be

192
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,960
one of the biggest asks that they are

193
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,198
gonna want from this and one of the ways

194
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,440
it is win-win because one of the one of

195
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:26,680
the ways you can integrate with them and

196
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,289
improve speed is by finding

197
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,750
opportunities to give security champions

198
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:32,409
responsibilities and get yourself out of

199
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,659
the way

200
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,899
don't let yourself be a bottleneck for

201
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:39,099
anything that doesn't justify you being

202
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:42,549
involved in being the bottleneck and

203
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:44,589
that can be a really a tough thing to do

204
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,949
if you know if you've been in security

205
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:46,620
for a long

206
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,780
you're used to having that sort of

207
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,000
control gatekeeper approach it's a very

208
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,250
different model but then from the

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,650
development team we haven't talked as

210
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,540
much about expectations from them in all

211
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:03,760
of this and really what it comes down to

212
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:05,910
is the expectations of your the quality

213
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,620
and the product that you're shipping

214
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:11,050
doesn't change just because you might be

215
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,020
identifying certain tasks that your

216
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,670
small product security team doesn't do

217
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,920
anymore and that these security

218
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,689
champions do that doesn't mean that the

219
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,640
development team gets the okay to just

220
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,260
say oh well we're not going to do that

221
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,810
so if you're dealing with a big backlog

222
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,610
of you know known findings from some

223
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,869
sort of scan or you know pen test

224
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:33,130
findings or something that you think

225
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:35,500
they can handle themselves they have to

226
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,689
take more responsibility but they don't

227
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,210
get to necessarily just take that and

228
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,130
put it in the backlog and never get to

229
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,860
it they still have to they have to buy

230
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,630
in that they are gonna commit to the

231
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,040
responsibility that goes with security

232
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,680
the same way that they've taken in

233
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,510
responsibility for functionality and a

234
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,880
functional testing for operational

235
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,770
things in the DevOps model security is

236
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,780
just another thing that they're gonna

237
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:03,010
have to step up and take some control -

238
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:04,990
and then third is management and this

239
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,439
this can be sort of people managers or

240
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:11,740
product managers so while the idea is to

241
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,440
have these security champions bring

242
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,210
security into all of the things they're

243
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,190
already doing there is still gonna be

244
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,380
some amount of overhead right they're

245
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,240
still gonna be guild meetings to bring

246
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,840
everybody together they're still gonna

247
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,460
be small amounts of new work that they

248
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,740
have to do as part of their normal

249
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,870
processes and you've got to have a

250
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:35,200
commitment that that's going to be

251
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,310
accounted for and that the security

252
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,380
champions are gonna be able to say oh

253
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:41,800
yes we're gonna take responsibility for

254
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,810
this task but then whatever process they

255
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,280
have is going to continually squeeze

256
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,770
that out and say oh no we don't actually

257
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,170
have time for you to do that similar if

258
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:52,449
you've got goals for those security

259
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,689
champions if you're if your organization

260
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:58,270
is very like goal driven you're gonna

261
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,310
need to find a buy-in

262
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,829
forgetting security champion activities

263
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:08,560
on the Gould's program for the people

264
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:10,420
that are volunteering otherwise it's

265
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,290
it's you can fall into that same trap of

266
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,520
security lags behind and come to too

267
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,760
little too late when it comes to the

268
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:21,130
commitment there so another thing to

269
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:26,470
just to get ready to launch the program

270
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:27,730
is about the culture and at vera code

271
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,130
you know we were pretty lucky that we

272
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:33,100
already had a pretty good culture around

273
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:36,399
this type of thing before we even

274
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,320
started this program we had a series of

275
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,870
like monthly luncheon learns where

276
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,180
people would come in and talk about any

277
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,589
sort of topic it could be you know we

278
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,029
had a presentation about Burning Man

279
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:47,920
from someone who'd been going for years

280
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:50,110
and years we've had people come in and

281
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,029
talk about Helvetica and typography but

282
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,560
then also people would talk about

283
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:55,899
security people might come in and talk

284
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,810
about some some crypto stuff or the

285
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:00,820
latest the latest like big security

286
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,250
breach that was in the news and and

287
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,380
share information about that so once we

288
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:08,230
knew we were gonna launch this program

289
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,850
we made a particular effort to get some

290
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,829
security topics that would be

291
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,709
interesting and engaging for possible

292
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:18,010
security champions onto those agendas to

293
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:20,859
get it out there we also hosted things

294
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,510
like after we had people from the

295
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,760
various security teams or the security

296
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:27,610
research team go out to conferences like

297
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:31,720
wonderful places like this come back and

298
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,800
do like a summary of some of the talks

299
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,240
that they saw that they thought were

300
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,380
really good or really relevant to the

301
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,970
organization for things like so Vegas in

302
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,189
the summer we would tend to have a whole

303
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,660
group of people going we'd come in have

304
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,399
people sign up for lightning rounds

305
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,770
where they would just give like you know

306
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,990
a two or three-minute overview of one of

307
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,449
the talks that they saw and provide

308
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,399
pointers and those were open just like

309
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,800
the luncheon lines those are open to

310
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,079
everybody in the company anybody who is

311
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,870
at all interested in hearing more about

312
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,520
this could come in and hear what was

313
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,370
going on on the security side of things

314
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,110
and then for getting things a little

315
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,360
more hands-on with the people that

316
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,250
really were interested we started doing

317
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,870
open

318
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:17,490
TTFN exercises we started this actually

319
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:20,100
this was around the year that the the

320
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:24,510
first hacky Easter competition launched

321
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:27,120
and that became a really good

322
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:29,010
introductory CTF because there was some

323
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,900
things that were very puzzled driven and

324
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:34,920
other things that were a little bit more

325
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,120
technical and get more into the CTF

326
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,790
stuff you might see at a security

327
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,410
conference and that that sort of gaming

328
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,790
style of it with a scoreboard and

329
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:44,310
everything got a lot of people really

330
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,170
really engaged and involved and that

331
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,959
first year we had something like eight

332
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:52,020
of our developers complete the entire

333
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,080
puzzle set which was just great and then

334
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:58,050
from the momentum there we turned that

335
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,540
into just an ongoing weekly session that

336
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,130
we have every Thursday from 12 to 2 so

337
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,680
we put it at lunchtime to make sure that

338
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,450
teams that are really really hammered

339
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,489
you know during a sprint or something

340
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,410
they do still typically get lunch right

341
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,700
so they can if they want to if they

342
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:14,069
don't need to go decompress some other

343
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,320
way they can come to the CTF session and

344
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,780
it also sort of functions as product

345
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,120
security office hours we invited info

346
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,069
security to join there too so it's a

347
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,440
place to come in learn a bit about the

348
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:28,770
offensive side of stuff which makes the

349
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,470
defensive advice make more sense and

350
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:34,140
it's also a single place every week both

351
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,820
in headquarters and online that they can

352
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,280
come ask any questions they want of

353
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:43,020
product security or network security or

354
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:46,319
any of the security teams so from these

355
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,790
different approaches now if you've got

356
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,500
you've got commitment you've talked to

357
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:52,500
the managers you've talked to the

358
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,360
development managers you've put some

359
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,390
stuff out there in in your culture to

360
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,950
sort of advocate for the fun side of

361
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,290
security and find people that might be

362
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:03,150
interested now you can actually start to

363
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:05,459
build your sort of initial batch of

364
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:08,400
who's gonna be who's going to be a part

365
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,589
of this program and you probably already

366
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,970
have some in mind at this point you

367
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:13,920
might have had some you know in mind

368
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,860
from the very GetGo based on past

369
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,079
experience but the folks that show up to

370
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,820
every single Lunch and Learn they come

371
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,460
to the CTF sessions regularly they

372
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,230
really want to learn about this

373
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,149
they're gonna be a natural fit because

374
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:29,839
of the excitement and the passion that

375
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:32,029
they have for security also from talking

376
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,399
to the managers to shop this around and

377
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:37,790
get buy-in you may hear that there's

378
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,529
some people who are really taking on

379
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,969
some of that responsibility to begin

380
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:42,620
with you know you're probably not

381
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,029
building your security program from

382
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,740
scratch at this point so there's

383
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:49,010
probably already some people who have

384
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,990
been stronger participants in what

385
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:54,140
you've already been doing that would be

386
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:58,190
a natural fit across all those groups

387
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:01,310
though really the I think volunteers are

388
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:04,310
best over the years we've had a mix of

389
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:08,300
people that have been volunteers or

390
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:11,779
people who that have been voluntold the

391
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,939
voluntold will deuce you know we'll do

392
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:15,649
what you asked of them but they're the

393
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,010
ones who they might come to the CTF

394
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:20,209
session a few times but then it kind of

395
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,010
kind of becomes a backburner for them

396
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:24,140
the day-to-day responsibilities they're

397
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,779
still good but they're not they're not

398
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:30,890
going to be as excited about about

399
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:35,630
really advancing their role in in this

400
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:37,209
security capacity again as you're

401
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:41,240
looking at who these like candidates are

402
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:44,839
think about what your ideal candidates

403
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:48,920
look like so we we try whenever possible

404
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:51,080
to pick people that seem like they're an

405
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,630
influencer on the team that would be one

406
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,370
way that that really has been effective

407
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,959
so these are the people that you know

408
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,880
years and years ago we're talking about

409
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,160
docker before anyone else maybe now

410
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,270
they're talking about cuber Nettie's the

411
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,319
best ones right now probably talk about

412
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,660
stuff that I haven't even heard about

413
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,100
yet but those people that are kind of

414
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,360
the Trailblazers right though they're

415
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:11,260
gonna help you through that for us right

416
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:13,659
I can I can bring it all back the

417
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,980
they're out there looking at what's next

418
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,839
if they're a part of this program that

419
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,140
means they can also help you figure out

420
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:27,050
how security figures into whatever is

421
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:28,730
coming next they also may be just really

422
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:31,399
influential on the team based on things

423
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:34,640
as simple as seniority maybe it is that

424
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,520
developer that has been working on that

425
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,290
product for such

426
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,879
time they know all the ins and outs and

427
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:41,550
they're gonna be really influential in

428
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,410
making sure the the security asks get

429
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:47,669
prioritized and don't just wither in the

430
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:49,020
backlog and that that passion even if

431
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,570
there's someone who is pretty new and

432
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:54,420
pretty pretty junior to the team even if

433
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,100
they're really excited about this they

434
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,080
can still be a really good fit in

435
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,679
steering that team towards accomplishing

436
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:06,780
the goals that you're introducing we

437
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:08,640
also we accept security champions from

438
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,330
any role within the team we've got a

439
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,130
variety of teams some are are not quite

440
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:17,100
waterfall but something more in that

441
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,230
realm slowly working their way towards

442
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,909
something more agile two teams that are

443
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,460
doing scrum and scrum band and our

444
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:27,060
cross-functional anyone who's interested

445
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,830
we don't we don't exclude them from the

446
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,510
program based on their role if there's

447
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,870
someone who's not writing code at all

448
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:36,150
but they are focused on the CI CD

449
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,219
pipelines for that team well they're

450
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,440
great there's still security

451
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,140
considerations there and the overall

452
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,940
guild benefits from having that that

453
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,040
variety and having someone who really

454
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,780
knows the build system and can come in

455
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,670
and show you oh well here's here's this

456
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,320
really easy way to get that scan going

457
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,060
or when you're ready to break the build

458
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,980
here's the best way we've found to do

459
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:58,320
that and share that across the rest of

460
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:04,710
the guild but there's also some things

461
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:08,040
to avoid which we try to not accept

462
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,330
anyone until they're established in

463
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,909
their current role so if they're a new

464
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,830
hire or if they have just transferred

465
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,530
from one team to another on a different

466
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:19,409
product line we put sort of a 90-day

467
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:22,020
waiting period on them to say okay we're

468
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,690
we would love to have you we don't want

469
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,460
to overwhelm you with onboarding into

470
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,410
the security champions program and all

471
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,140
the new asks and the training that goes

472
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:33,090
with that until you're established and

473
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,320
sort of performing on the team so we

474
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:38,790
will ask people to hold on for that and

475
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,409
people that aren't overloaded so these

476
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:43,050
qualities I'm describing of like what's

477
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:45,690
a great security champion those are

478
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:47,820
great qualities for anyone on the team

479
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,059
right so those are people that can be a

480
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,590
great fit for

481
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:53,019
their guilds maybe that that your

482
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,699
organization has or they may take on

483
00:19:53,019 --> 00:20:00,490
more responsibility over time for the

484
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:02,620
team and we've seen some people get

485
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:05,169
overloaded when they're the go-to for

486
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,758
everything on the team and they can't

487
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:09,429
handle all of those you know they can't

488
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:11,970
wear all those hats at one so we now try

489
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:14,499
to avoid bringing in people that are

490
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:18,340
likely to do you know are likely to be

491
00:20:14,499 --> 00:20:20,710
in that situation okay so from there now

492
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:24,399
you've you found these champions you've

493
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:27,190
got an idea now of what what can you ask

494
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:30,309
of them so this is this is where you get

495
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:34,990
to actually see some some return on on

496
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:36,759
all this investment you get to maybe you

497
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,529
were at a conference recently and you

498
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:39,999
were thinking a lot about open source

499
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,649
findings and putting together an SCA

500
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:44,619
program because you you know you've got

501
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:47,469
some some debt there or trying to push

502
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:50,168
something new like updating how you're

503
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:52,690
doing your you know CSP you probably

504
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:54,850
have lots and lots of ideas about the

505
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,919
things that you need to do for your

506
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,259
program and the things you would love to

507
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:03,789
get your development teams to work on

508
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:06,610
for you but also think about those asks

509
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:08,470
at sort of two different levels what are

510
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,049
things that you can ask the security

511
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,779
champion to do that are really just

512
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:16,149
about interfacing with the security team

513
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:19,929
and putting some things in place right

514
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:22,059
so SCA for example if you if you know

515
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:23,320
you've got a lot of SCA findings or even

516
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:25,119
earlier than that you don't have any

517
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,619
sort of like SCA scanning in your

518
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,809
pipelines right now but you know you

519
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,689
need that that doesn't take any

520
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:33,399
specialized security knowledge any sort

521
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,200
of junior security champion and what we

522
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:37,658
call sort of the phase one of that role

523
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,720
they can do that they might need some

524
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:42,970
extra instruction and some help from you

525
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,679
but you're not asking them to make any

526
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,119
security decisions at that point you're

527
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,309
just asking them hey can you help get

528
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,320
this tool built into your pipeline

529
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:52,059
hopefully you've done a lot of work to

530
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,428
show them how and give them some

531
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:56,080
examples again that idea of your your

532
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:58,720
team needs to be coding to your team

533
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,908
needs to learn your build systems but

534
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,000
you provide the method there and then

535
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:04,430
they're just

536
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,830
menteng it but then you can also

537
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:11,120
overtime start to introduce these phase

538
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:13,340
two sorts of asks which are are things

539
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,590
that actually do require some level of

540
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,649
security expertise our example of this

541
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:20,990
is security code review despite all of

542
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:23,030
our automated security scanning we still

543
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:26,540
have a process for doing code reviews as

544
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:28,370
part of peer review during Sprint's and

545
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,409
it's something we've been a bottleneck

546
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,389
on because there's so few of us and so

547
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,460
many developers and we can't even

548
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:37,670
properly plan for capacity when it comes

549
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,860
to that work but we built a two day

550
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:42,950
training program for security champions

551
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,889
with a very scoped focus on certain

552
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:47,990
types of security code review that we

553
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:50,240
thought was reasonable for them to do so

554
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:54,470
things like data validation logging

555
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:57,470
error handling topics that are not

556
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,240
unfamiliar to them that with some extra

557
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,490
with some combination of e-learning a

558
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,560
two day training and then an assessment

559
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,300
we had a high level of confidence that

560
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,830
they could look for security

561
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,230
vulnerabilities related to those

562
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,899
controls in their peer reviews they were

563
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:17,270
already doing that's that's the type of

564
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:18,380
sort of Phase two so this is what phase

565
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,700
two is where we see the security

566
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,910
champions is really starting to bear

567
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:25,130
fruit right this is when you can ask

568
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,960
more of them than just sort of being

569
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:31,160
able to copy and paste things and

570
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,230
actually you know that example of a

571
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,910
developer coming to me and saying hey I

572
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,490
think I found a privilege escalation

573
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:39,290
that no one knew about and I think I

574
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,730
have a fix that's a real example that's

575
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:43,370
that's from a security champion that

576
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:45,200
started off just as a dev but after the

577
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:47,719
exposure for a couple years and the

578
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,800
extra training really was maturing into

579
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:54,320
a dev with a strong understanding of

580
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,980
security and the ability to apply that

581
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,429
to everything

582
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:00,980
um the I'd say the only other quick

583
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:02,990
thing I'd say is once once you've got

584
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,690
the program established you're gonna

585
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:10,730
have to do some things to make sure it

586
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:12,530
keeps going rewards gotta have some some

587
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,690
forms of rewarding the security

588
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,430
champions so again that's a very

589
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,320
cultural

590
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:20,240
maybe it can be something as simple as

591
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,950
like stickers or a badge that somehow

592
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,780
like shows that they're a part of that

593
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:29,600
group versus something more tangible

594
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,760
like we offer we offer security training

595
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,370
both internal as well as external we

596
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,129
have our own dedicated budget to send

597
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:39,169
developers out to security conferences

598
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,140
or additional security training we've

599
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:45,950
had one developers start start trying to

600
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,750
do as OCSP but their manager doesn't

601
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,480
have to pay for any of that their

602
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,070
manager has to sign off on oh yes you

603
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,830
can spend the time you can go for two

604
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,730
days - whichever conference that is but

605
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,110
it doesn't come out of their budget

606
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,120
which makes a lot easier for those

607
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:02,570
managers to say yes so that's another

608
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,790
type of reward also creating that

609
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,740
community keeping everybody in touch

610
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:09,200
whether that's you know your company's

611
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:12,380
big on slack or whatever communication

612
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,180
mechanisms the developers are using also

613
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,790
build a community for the security

614
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:24,140
champions to interact in that same in

615
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:27,379
that same environment and monitoring and

616
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:30,170
this I'll stop after this monitoring is

617
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:32,210
important right because we've said we're

618
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:34,790
transferring some responsibilities to

619
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,810
the teams but we're not lowering the bar

620
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:39,560
in that process

621
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:41,600
so for us our approach on how we were

622
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,190
going to - keep an eye on that in

623
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,100
addition to any other metrics and

624
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:48,260
dashboards that we already had we came

625
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,870
up with this internal product security

626
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:53,420
maturity model based on some other

627
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:57,459
maturity models that we had internally

628
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:59,540
and this is so this is an example and

629
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,860
yeah this is a good one for pictures so

630
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,530
as you can zoom in and actually see what

631
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,179
it says but the but we brainstorm we

632
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,790
said okay of all the different things we

633
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:10,700
could ask teams to work on let's pick a

634
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:12,649
small subset and for us that was that

635
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,600
was this it was training security design

636
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,440
secure code review testing and

637
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,290
third-party component

638
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:23,250
and then we started from okay they're

639
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:25,320
doing nothing to to our expert level

640
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:28,170
what do we think someone you know a team

641
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,360
that was like a perfect dev sec ops team

642
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:32,670
what would they be doing in all of these

643
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:36,389
categories and then we tried to fill in

644
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:40,110
achievable milestones from zero to the

645
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:41,970
top there and set up a system to check

646
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:45,179
in with these teams over time and see

647
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,770
are you achieving these but so this was

648
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,510
just one of the new ways that we

649
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,940
introduced in terms of trying to see the

650
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:52,650
impact of this program in addition to

651
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,550
things like flaw counts and findings

652
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:59,930
counts to really see is this achieving

653
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:03,300
what we were asking and then finally

654
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:05,400
reflect and iterate you've got to take

655
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,260
this the same approach that development

656
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,020
uses these days and constantly question

657
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,820
what you're doing and and find where

658
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,280
things aren't working fail fast if

659
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:19,110
something's not working and and find a

660
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:21,210
new a new way forward and make

661
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,199
everything repeatable I wish I had done

662
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,180
that from the very start

663
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,430
right this is what you're trying to get

664
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,220
you a nice organized repeatable sort of

665
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:31,260
process for security champions like

666
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,700
bearing fruit so everything you do with

667
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,790
that first batch if you're starting this

668
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:38,100
fresh make sure you keep all of that to

669
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,600
reuse it for when you have to bring in

670
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,790
the next batch when you get to the point

671
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,780
that you're bringing and in just

672
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:46,020
single-digit you know one here and there

673
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,480
across all the different teams so thank

674
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:53,770
you

675
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:56,690
[Applause]

676
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:58,370
okay so first question have you guys

677
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,870
been able to have this program loop into

678
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:03,409
their feedback and company promotion

679
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:05,540
process we haven't directly tied it into

680
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:08,960
any sort of like promotion process but

681
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:11,090
we have we have incorporated it into the

682
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,090
goals programs for security champions

683
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:16,610
over time and then we have also sort of

684
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:20,090
from there as the development team has

685
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:23,060
changed how they prioritize that focus

686
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:25,280
for developers we have also shifted the

687
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:28,550
way we prioritize the security champions

688
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,200
work is their minimum baseline of

689
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:33,409
knowledge for security champions how do

690
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,880
you establish that baseline we do so we

691
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:37,040
don't we don't look for any sort of

692
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,610
baseline in terms of pre-existing

693
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,590
security knowledge we we put them

694
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:45,080
through some eLearning some classroom

695
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,909
internal instruction the one thing that

696
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,730
we do check in terms of sort of a

697
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:51,710
baseline is we don't and we don't add

698
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:54,740
anyone to the program without talking to

699
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,450
their manager first that's that has been

700
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,840
good both in terms of understanding how

701
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:01,880
that person is performing if you know if

702
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,310
if they were someone that maybe just in

703
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,170
terms of if they're underperforming and

704
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,730
what they're doing right now maybe

705
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:09,140
they're spreading themselves too thin so

706
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:12,230
we'll talk with the manager about that

707
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,330
and say okay maybe they'll be good but

708
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,820
they're they can't do this right now if

709
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,740
the manager has any concerns about in

710
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:25,220
baseline competencies or anything like

711
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:27,950
that we would also be aware of that yeah

712
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,090
that's that's if someone wants to talk

713
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,570
about you learning we could talk about

714
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:34,790
that leader but yeah I think that's all

715
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:38,030
the questions so thank you

716
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:38,030
[Applause]
