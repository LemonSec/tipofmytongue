1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,040
all right thanks everyone for joining

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,810
after lunch I know it's some pretty

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,690
stiff competition with the beach so I

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:14,849
appreciate everyone joining me for a

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,650
presentation so this is my talk a good

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,619
first impression can work wonders if

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,509
that sounds familiar it's a JK Rowling

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,820
quote and I think this is really

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,250
important with developers and I guess

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,449
just people in general but one of the

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,759
themes that I've heard at this

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,780
conference and at apps at California and

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,760
other forward-leaning conferences is how

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,110
important relationship building is with

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,930
developers and within your company

16
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,910
because you need other people to get

17
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,539
stuff done for the security team and so

18
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,980
this is all about a developer's first

19
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,680
impression with the security team at

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,629
segments so I'm gonna just run through

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,180
this Jim already covered this during the

22
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,449
intro but I got my start in security

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:01,230
consulting at red spin from there I got

24
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:03,210
involved with a wasp I eventually moved

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,420
up to the Bay Area and now helped

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,970
organize for the Bay Area aw snapped er

27
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:11,939
after leaving red spin I joined the

28
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,039
sales engineering team at bugcrowd and

29
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,439
helped a bunch of companies get started

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,750
with bug bounties which were a lot less

31
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,189
popular in 2015 than they are now and

32
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,229
now it seems like pretty much everyone

33
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,000
runs one but it's pretty fun to be on

34
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,820
kind of the the frontlines of the bug

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,200
bounty space back then and then about a

36
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,110
year and a half ago I joined the

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,060
internal security team at segment and

38
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:36,240
have been focusing mostly on application

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,820
and product security stuff since then so

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,649
this has broken up into three parts we

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,839
have two different parts of training

42
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,090
think like an attackers part 1 and part

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,259
2 a secure code review and then I'm also

44
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,600
going to talk a little bit about the

45
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,600
ongoing recognition that we try to

46
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,500
provide our developers with so this

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,710
slide will look really familiar

48
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,710
hi Tanya

49
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,720
so I think that most people at this

50
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:09,949
conference understand the importance of

51
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:13,860
shifting left in 2019 building software

52
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:16,079
secure software is just part of having a

53
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,480
good product and developers want to be

54
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,319
associated with a good product and to do

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,179
that the security need the security team

56
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,208
needs to help developers learn about

57
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,610
security so that they can write a high

58
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:31,350
quality product for their customers

59
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,120
we're not helicopter parents we're not

60
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,310
reviewing every PR like we're not pair

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,160
programming with our developers there's

62
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,420
not nearly enough of us to do that but

63
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:46,410
we need to empower them to make good

64
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:48,119
security decisions on their own this is

65
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,459
one of our developers Frances she's

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,800
awesome she presented at a meet up at

67
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,570
our office a few months ago and it was

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,510
all about how security is everybody's

69
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,010
job which we definitely agree with we

70
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,989
want every developer to feel like this

71
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,399
because that makes our jobs a lot easier

72
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:05,040
because we have to do way less work if

73
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,959
they're doing it for us which is great I

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,109
think it's also something that is

75
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,989
becoming part of job requirements so

76
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,880
this is actually a really great article

77
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:18,360
from circle CI it's about their

78
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,310
engineering matrix and it's broken up

79
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,079
into these categories not going to talk

80
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,670
about all these but I just wanted to

81
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:25,500
highlight that under technical skills

82
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,899
security is one of them and it starts

83
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,360
being something that is required for an

84
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,130
e1 developer all the way up through e6

85
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,890
which is the top of their matrix there's

86
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,750
different categories and security is

87
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,309
part of that and it's basically hey

88
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,230
here's what you need to do for security

89
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:45,079
as part of moving up in the organization

90
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,429
so the first part that we talked about

91
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:49,739
for our training is think like an

92
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,290
attacker the high-level overview for

93
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,049
this is we teach our developers how to

94
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,230
use burp suite and find vulnerabilities

95
00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:01,109
the way that bug bounty hunters would or

96
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,310
pentesters would and in many cases this

97
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,070
is the first time that we're meeting

98
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,750
these new segment employees so it's

99
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,519
really important that they have a good

100
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,460
time and they like hanging out with us

101
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,020
because we're not going anywhere

102
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,370
if you do something like this definitely

103
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,100
give you bonus points if you can get

104
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,450
engineering managers and PMS and you

105
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,820
know people that are kind of developer

106
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,010
adjacent in the training I think it

107
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,930
makes it a lot easier to go to PM's and

108
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,640
EMS and say hey we need some of your

109
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,080
team's time to do this stuff if they've

110
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,560
gone through some of the same training

111
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,380
that the engineers have part two is

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,680
secure code review so this is how we

113
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,690
teach developers to think about security

114
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,050
at kind of like the PR level and as

115
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:44,060
they're writing code these are some of

116
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,950
the reviews that we've gotten so don't

117
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,630
just take my word for it that this

118
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,550
training is great the developers

119
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,740
genuinely like taking this training

120
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,050
we've had people that have come from

121
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,730
other places that have done security

122
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,100
training before and everyone has said

123
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,780
that they really like ours so hopefully

124
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,640
this is something that you could take to

125
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,979
your organization and have fun with your

126
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,659
developers as well I think the most

127
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,860
important part of creating training if

128
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,160
you were to pick like one thing to

129
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,270
remember is create relevant content and

130
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,980
for us the way that we've created

131
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,599
relevant content is we've looked through

132
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,479
all of our bug bounties submissions pen

133
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,640
test reports internal findings and we've

134
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,710
looked at the data to see what types of

135
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,599
vulnerabilities are most common and then

136
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,180
all of our examples in our training our

137
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,680
based off of example are based off of

138
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,140
previous vulnerabilities that have

139
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,150
existed in segments so instead of trying

140
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:35,120
to convince a developer about sea surf

141
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:37,549
using some Bank example where you can

142
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,900
transfer funds from this to somewhere

143
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,840
else and the developers like I don't

144
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,460
work at a bank why do I care about this

145
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,020
every single example that they see is

146
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,539
something that will look familiar based

147
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,599
off of their experience using segments

148
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,040
so far we also use this as a time to

149
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,229
introduce the vulnerability rating

150
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,669
taxonomy from bugcrowd this is what we

151
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,800
use to categorize all of our

152
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,479
vulnerabilities and when they get

153
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,280
vulnerability reports from us later

154
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:03,200
they're gonna see a vulnerability

155
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,109
category and a priority and so we like

156
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,780
to introduce the types of data that's

157
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,010
going to be in the vulnerability reports

158
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,739
during this first meeting so that they

159
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:15,860
can be more prepared when they start

160
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,479
fixing stuff later completely unrelated

161
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,520
to training but because I have the stage

162
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,870
I'm going to take a quick detour if

163
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,789
you're running a bug bounty program

164
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,590
seriously consider paying for

165
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,830
anything that provides value instead of

166
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:30,979
just paying for you know unique and

167
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,109
valid submissions our best reports have

168
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,260
all come from people that we've paid for

169
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,360
duplicates or given hints to or built a

170
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,920
relationship with and if you get a

171
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,920
really well-written report that's a

172
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,960
duplicate I would recommend just paying

173
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,790
for it and thanking them and saying like

174
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,289
hey like you know here's some extra help

175
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,440
like we want to help we want you to be

176
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,910
successful if you're thinking about the

177
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,590
money associated with a bug bounty

178
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,610
program on a per bug basis you're

179
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,960
potentially thinking about it wrong I

180
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,880
think you should think of a bug bounty

181
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,159
program as like what is the program

182
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,350
costing you as a whole and what are the

183
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,760
benefits it's providing if you start

184
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,190
thinking about things on like a per bug

185
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,130
basis I don't know if that's the most

186
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,810
fair way to researchers because you're

187
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,310
gonna over analyze how much each

188
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,660
individual bugs worth and you should be

189
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,080
thinking about like how can we make this

190
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,030
program as good as possible so back to

191
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,830
the regular scheduled programming

192
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,349
we used a loss to shop shoe shops

193
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:30,140
awesome if you're running them kind of a

194
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:32,660
modern ish web stack this is similar

195
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:36,020
enough to segments that it's familiar to

196
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:38,810
them we use node we use Express we don't

197
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,060
use angular we use react instead but you

198
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,800
know everything is is pretty much the

199
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,300
same as like what we use for segments so

200
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
it's it's very familiar to them when

201
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,100
they're looking at the technology stack

202
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,630
and then this is the the general way

203
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,800
that we do the training for part one is

204
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,750
we'll talk about a couple different

205
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,000
vulnerability categories through slides

206
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,890
and examples and then we'll have an

207
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,310
interactive training with burp suite and

208
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:04,430
juice shop that matches up with what we

209
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:07,010
just talked about and you know then

210
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,240
we'll just repeat that we found this

211
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,460
works really well because it's a

212
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,010
combination of us showing people things

213
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,500
us saying things and then them actually

214
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,170
doing it for themselves and I think a

215
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,430
lot of people especially technologists

216
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,690
and people that work in the security and

217
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,790
engineering community are pretty

218
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,530
hands-on and so actually doing something

219
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:28,280
is what really cements that knowledge

220
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:29,809
for a lot of people during the hacker

221
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,150
times which is where they're trying to

222
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,010
find vulnerabilities we write

223
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,240
everybody's name up on the board as they

224
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,590
find Bowl

225
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,570
this is from when we went back and

226
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,760
trained all of our existing developers

227
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,040
that had started before us so normally

228
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,990
our class sizes are like four or five

229
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,270
but for two weeks we did training like

230
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,490
back-to-back Tuesdays and Thursdays all

231
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,140
day to Train everybody who had already

232
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:55,040
started and so we kept a running tally

233
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,930
during that but this helps a lot because

234
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,900
it's competition based and so instead of

235
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,270
people just using slack no offense I

236
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,470
love slack but during that training time

237
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,819
we'd prefer people actually find vulms

238
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,810
the competition really helps that

239
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,360
because you don't want to be the only

240
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,739
person that hasn't found anything and

241
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,200
we're there to help people so if you're

242
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,240
getting close and you need a hint or you

243
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,370
know you need an extra explanation we're

244
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,850
going around one-on-one and making sure

245
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:24,860
that everybody is successful as people

246
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,540
find stuff we also add them to our

247
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,480
security leaderboard so this is

248
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,829
something that regardless of you know if

249
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,510
you're a brand new employee if you're on

250
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:35,060
engineering or not everybody can earn

251
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,800
security leaderboard points typically in

252
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,449
engineers first leaderboard points are

253
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,420
during the security training because

254
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:44,090
every flag you find you get a point for

255
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,650
and then as you get points you'll level

256
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,470
up so you'll see like some people are

257
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:51,740
level one some people are level two and

258
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,690
then you'll get these stickers which are

259
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,910
based off of the halo like ranking

260
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,360
stickers so every five levels you'll get

261
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:01,100
a new sticker to add to your laptop

262
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,810
recently our manager he's the one who

263
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,950
actually built the leaderboard he added

264
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,959
this thing so you can now add

265
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,910
leaderboard points via slack which is

266
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,430
super nice because before you had to go

267
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,540
somewhere separate and add points but

268
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:15,229
yeah we wanted to make it as easy as

269
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:17,180
possible to award points and then every

270
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,760
Friday we have a printout of the top

271
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:23,599
five point earners for that week so in

272
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,030
our security slack Channel we have this

273
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,100
and everyone gets to see how many points

274
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:30,079
Roland during that week because Roland

275
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:34,490
earns a lot of points every week he's a

276
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:36,500
good friend for our team the second part

277
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,360
of our training is the secure code

278
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:42,920
review training so this is influenced by

279
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:46,160
the OAuth secure coding cheat sheet we

280
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,380
have a variety of categories we talk

281
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,680
about cross-site scripting broken down

282
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:55,430
sysctl secrets management air handling

283
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,319
SSR f etc this is tailored to our

284
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,449
technologies so again this isn't just

285
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,210
stuff that like we've pulled off the

286
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:05,240
shelf this is something that somebody at

287
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:07,820
segment built so it's all node and react

288
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,520
and it's this isn't stuff that we expect

289
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,960
people to look at on every pull request

290
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,920
but it definitely serves as a reference

291
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,720
for people to go back and look at and so

292
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,240
with this training we also have kind of

293
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,830
a self-service way to surface the

294
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,480
documentation if you want to go and read

295
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,700
all the documentation as a developer

296
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,200
that's totally fine but we also have

297
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,000
something where you can fill out kind of

298
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,210
a short survey and I'll say okay hey

299
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,560
you're you're trying to deal with SSR F

300
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:38,600
here's our guidance around that part two

301
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,680
of the training also has intentionally

302
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,360
vulnerable code that we use as examples

303
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,699
and so this is kind of like a simplified

304
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,110
version of the segment architecture

305
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,750
where we have like react on the front

306
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,100
end and note on the back end and so this

307
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,010
is something that my coworker David

308
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,390
built and it actually runs you can

309
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,160
actually like look at the Hawaiian shirt

310
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:02,150
store if you if you pull down the code

311
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,740
and then this is an example of like what

312
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:06,560
we would we would have the developers

313
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:09,950
look at so can anybody find something

314
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,630
that's wrong with this snippet that's

315
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:16,010
actually the third thing that I was

316
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:18,890
going to point out so yep so you have

317
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,360
what you say was in the URL all right

318
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:23,960
well that was second so I'm totally out

319
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,330
of order the first one is cost and then

320
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,340
the second one is yes the credit card

321
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,960
numbers in the URL and then most

322
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,030
importantly Hawaiian spelled wrong

323
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,620
so this is actually the first time that

324
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,300
this has ever been out of order

325
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,070
usually people actually just guess it in

326
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,740
the order that I I had it up there so

327
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,600
I've got kind of unlucky on that one but

328
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,650
yeah this is a good example of you know

329
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,900
a lot of things that we don't want

330
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,939
people to do this leads to a discussion

331
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,150
about putting sensitive information in

332
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:53,450
post requests and spelling Hawaiian

333
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:57,500
correctly and things like that so this

334
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:59,670
is pretty accessible then on the backend

335
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,490
so this would be the if you go

336
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:04,530
back to slide or three slides this would

337
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:10,560
be server J s so this is like the node

338
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:15,709
side of the house so can anybody see

339
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:18,089
anything here that's that's wrong yep

340
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:21,180
good that was in the right order so yeah

341
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:27,150
there's a secret in source what else is

342
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:32,189
wrong what's wrong with encrypt what's B

343
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:34,860
2a yep exactly so that's basic C for

344
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:38,910
encoding and so this is where we start

345
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,620
to introduce a concept that Netflix

346
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,350
likes to call security judgment and I

347
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,090
like it too so I'm stealing it but we

348
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,310
don't expect developers to necessarily

349
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,530
know that B to a is base64 encoding

350
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,959
right off the bat but we do expect them

351
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:54,420
to see this encrypt thing and at least

352
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,580
dig in a little bit deeper and you know

353
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,500
maybe it's as simple as just googling it

354
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,060
or asking a senior member of your team

355
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,630
or coming and talking to the security

356
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:07,020
team but we it reinforced the concept

357
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,670
that you don't have to be experts in all

358
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,470
of our technologies like we're not

359
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,729
experts in all of our technologies I

360
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,440
Google stuff constantly

361
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,570
you just need to have the right spidey

362
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,250
senses to see when something looks like

363
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,440
it might be a security vulnerability and

364
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,240
dig in and ask the appropriate people

365
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,680
for help like people make mistakes all

366
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,510
the time

367
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,069
security vulnerabilities are just bugs I

368
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,990
think that's another really important

369
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,240
concept to reinforce with developers is

370
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,150
these shouldn't get any more or less

371
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,460
priority than something that is

372
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:38,939
similarly as bad in the like performance

373
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:42,480
or like breaking features for customers

374
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,070
these aren't special in any way they're

375
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,960
just bugs that happen have a security

376
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,060
impact and so you know anybody could

377
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,100
could do something like this hopefully

378
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,569
not at segments but we would want

379
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,570
somebody else to catch this during a PR

380
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,750
we also have this back this other

381
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,930
example this one's a little bit more

382
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,340
complicated and it also mimics segment a

383
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,680
little bit better so we have like a

384
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,560
front-end file that is react and then

385
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,779
the API would be an

386
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,449
like kind of a gateway service and then

387
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:17,310
you'd have a domain service here and

388
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:19,109
then you'd have like some ghost service

389
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,449
in the backend so this is part two of

390
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,939
the example I don't actually have any

391
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:25,410
code snippets from this but we do go

392
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:30,509
through this as well just to have like

393
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:32,999
another example of hands-on stuff so

394
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:34,470
during the the app step training some of

395
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:38,100
the stuff that we really like to focus

396
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,600
on is meet new hires we want them to

397
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,220
know who we are we want to know who they

398
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,189
are we want to let them know hey we have

399
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,779
a team app sect Channel we tell them

400
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:48,449
where we sit in the office we tell them

401
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,639
you know slack us messages throw

402
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:53,609
meetings on our calendars tag us and in

403
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,649
Docs like we're happy to help out we

404
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,509
want them to walk away understanding a

405
00:15:55,649 --> 00:16:01,860
lot of the common vulnerability types at

406
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:04,259
segments we want to teach them security

407
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:07,740
judgment you know maybe most importantly

408
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,999
that like yeah hey just figure out when

409
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,129
something is wrong you don't know it

410
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:14,000
need to know exactly what is wrong we'll

411
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:17,610
help you out we want them to think about

412
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,100
PRS and new ways and most importantly we

413
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,809
want them to have fun because we want

414
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,670
them to think we're fun so that when

415
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:26,009
they do stuff that's risky they come and

416
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:28,410
tell us and we can be risky together

417
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:33,660
because we'll make it less will make it

418
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:36,990
less risky and then at the end of it you

419
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,360
get some stickers here so the first one

420
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:42,809
is I hacked which is like I voted and

421
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,300
then you have this hacker man meme which

422
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:47,160
is used in the training and I don't

423
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,279
people love stickers I'm not a sticker

424
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:53,579
person but yeah people love stickers so

425
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,870
we we give them stickers and then most

426
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,489
importantly you want to highlight wins

427
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,589
in the training so there's a couple

428
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,660
examples in our training that are now in

429
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:03,269
a lot better state than when we started

430
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,619
and so we talked about the old way of

431
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:07,049
doing things we talked about the

432
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:09,178
problems and then we introduced the new

433
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:11,339
easy to use solutions that help keep our

434
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,449
customers safe and we talked about the

435
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,129
old way of doing things because people

436
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,620
are always going to be building new apps

437
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,360
and like making new things at segments

438
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,849
and we don't want them to fall into the

439
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,750
old problems that we've already fixed so

440
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:25,810
a perfect example of this is

441
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,699
see authorization is something that

442
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,980
segment used to have a lot of problems

443
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,470
with because we had permissions model

444
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,780
that wasn't easy to use and our

445
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,250
developers built a new authorization

446
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,080
framework that makes it almost

447
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,590
impossible to make mistakes and so we

448
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,300
talked about in our training okay here's

449
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:45,490
some some issues with authorization that

450
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,560
we've had in the past here's the new way

451
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,870
of doing things just use this new

452
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,450
library or this new service that our

453
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,919
engineers have made and you don't really

454
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,860
have to worry too much about any of

455
00:17:53,920 --> 00:18:00,610
these things another example of this is

456
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:03,159
server side request forgery segment is

457
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:06,729
basically SSR F as a service like we

458
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,230
connect everything in the marketing tech

459
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,870
space so if you have a bunch of data

460
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,760
that's living on one of your servers

461
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:15,909
somewhere or as data that's like coming

462
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,050
from a store or that's in like like

463
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,940
Salesforce or Zendesk

464
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,740
that can flow through segments and then

465
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:24,100
we will send it wherever you tell us -

466
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,900
so like Marketo or Optimizely or you

467
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,580
could even just go like back to Zendesk

468
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,530
or salesforce we have two different 200

469
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,760
different integration partners all of

470
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,560
those are places where you can

471
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,680
potentially be entering like a hostname

472
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,810
or an IP address and so we needed to

473
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,570
come up with a really robust solution

474
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:42,399
for SSR F and so we actually brought one

475
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:47,679
of our developers onto absolute apps Eck

476
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,630
that built this SS RF protections and

477
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,640
they got to showcase what they've been

478
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:54,250
working on and helping make sigmund

479
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,390
safer so these are two of the github

480
00:18:54,250 --> 00:19:00,100
repos that they are open sourcing soon

481
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,870
one of them I think the top one is open

482
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,129
source already and then the bottom one

483
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:07,510
it is going to be open source shortly

484
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,360
it's a pretty cool solution they

485
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,590
basically intercept all the outgoing

486
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,929
traffic at the container level and make

487
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,520
sure that anything that is being

488
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:18,070
resolved is going to an external IP

489
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,170
address and that also stops DNS

490
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,939
rebinding attacks because they make a

491
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:25,270
connection to the IP and then make a

492
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:29,530
connection to the hostname over TLS over

493
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:32,110
that existing IP connection so hopefully

494
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:33,410
bulletproof 2ss RF if not let us know if

495
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,740
a public bug bounty

496
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:38,450
so just wrapping things up analyze the

497
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,670
data you already have this is gonna help

498
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,470
you make the best training possible for

499
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,680
your developers you want to pick stuff

500
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:49,100
that's relevant based off of examples as

501
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:51,740
well as like just types of

502
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,480
vulnerabilities in general you want to

503
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,480
emphasize that vulnerabilities are just

504
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,130
bugs this helps get stuff fixed it helps

505
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,900
developers you know not feel bad about

506
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,610
writing a vulnerability like we don't

507
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,230
want people to feel bad about making

508
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,399
mistakes we want them to tell us that

509
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,310
they've made mistakes and we'll help

510
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,750
them fix them you want to keep things

511
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:11,300
fun and competitive when you're doing

512
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,890
training if people have fun with you the

513
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,060
first time they meet you during training

514
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:18,230
they're probably going to be more likely

515
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:20,629
to ask for help and help help keep your

516
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,610
company safe you want to reward people

517
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,470
for positive security behavior this can

518
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:26,000
come in a lot of forms but figure out a

519
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,700
way to recognize the people that are

520
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,680
providing you a ton of value a lot of

521
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,750
the people that have you know are high

522
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,940
up on the leaderboard they make jokes

523
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,560
and slack of like oh like I'm gonna you

524
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,120
know unseat roll under whoever and it's

525
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,159
like you're not gonna NC rolling but I'm

526
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,260
glad that you're trying to unseat rule

527
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,040
and because that means you're you're

528
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:48,170
helping secure our business then make

529
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,180
yourself available if developers feel

530
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:53,270
like you know you're not somebody that

531
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:55,310
is there to help them out they're just

532
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,990
gonna try to figure stuff out on their

533
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:59,179
own so make sure that they know like hey

534
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:01,700
we have a public slack channel this is

535
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,380
the process for scheduling a design

536
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,360
review or a threat model or you know

537
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,970
however you need help like we're there

538
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,070
and then try to start designing things

539
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,440
to be self-service this is an area that

540
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,639
we're not super good in yet but it's

541
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,280
something that we're thinking about like

542
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:21,170
ways to scale ourselves as like

543
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:23,330
resources and if any of that sounds cool

544
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:26,510
we're hiring so let us know if you want

545
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,820
to come work at segment and do app and

546
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:31,220
cloud sec or whatever else you do

547
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,169
insecurity with us so yeah thanks umm

548
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,300
I'm happy to take questions via slide oh

549
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:42,560
or whatever

550
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:45,389
[Applause]

551
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:50,730
all right what are some good ways to

552
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:52,350
reward good behavior so I think that

553
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,380
showcasing people's work is a really

554
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:56,969
good way to reward good behavior making

555
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,710
sure that people know like hey if I've

556
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:01,410
partnered successfully with something on

557
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:03,300
the security team like I'm gonna get

558
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:07,110
recognized for it I think a good example

559
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:10,139
of this that that we've had is this last

560
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,729
quarter I've been building MFA with one

561
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,320
of our developers so I did most of the

562
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,540
backend stuff and she did most of the

563
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,189
front-end stuff but like during the

564
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,870
launch process and during any of the

565
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,140
events that we've talked about that

566
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:24,000
internally like it's always been a like

567
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,200
security and enterprise core that's the

568
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,620
team she's on it's always been like a

569
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,050
security and end core like joint project

570
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,060
like it isn't something that is just a

571
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,070
security project it's always been

572
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,590
something that both teams have been

573
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:40,590
recognized as participating in I think

574
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:42,179
the stickers are cool I think it's some

575
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,189
of it can just be as easy as like taking

576
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,980
people to lunch like I got a bunch of

577
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:49,380
help building a password strength meter

578
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:51,900
that also uses the have I been poned API

579
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,670
last quarter and that was like the first

580
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,990
front-end stuff I'd ever done and I just

581
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,610
took the people that helped me out a

582
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,320
bunch to lunch

583
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:00,300
I've heard of some companies that have

584
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,530
sent their engineers to trainings I

585
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,680
would love to bring some more engineers

586
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:06,990
from segments loco moco sec next year I

587
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,120
don't know if that is something that

588
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:11,640
will become a reality but I think that's

589
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,689
a great idea so if you can do that for

590
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,200
your engineers I'm sure they would love

591
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:17,700
it oh okay what do you do about

592
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,210
developers that don't want to take

593
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:25,550
training it is not an option

594
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,770
it is part of your onboarding and if you

595
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,690
do not come to training we will keep

596
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,180
adding you to the training invite until

597
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,300
you complete it and probably after the

598
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,310
like first good excuse and then a bad

599
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,740
excuse we would tell your manager that

600
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,210
they need to make you come so we

601
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,520
actually haven't had to deal with this

602
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:45,830
so I don't know if that's the right

603
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,480
answer or not but we've just made

604
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:51,860
everyone do it and they've they've gone

605
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:54,050
so do you collect any metrics to

606
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:57,590
specifically track the success of your

607
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:59,510
security trainings so I would say that

608
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:02,030
metrics in general or another area that

609
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:05,629
like we don't have a super good story

610
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:09,770
around anecdotally like we haven't

611
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:11,150
gotten any XSS findings from our bug

612
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:14,050
bounties since we started doing this

613
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:16,340
training which i think is pretty good

614
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,950
that's kind of a cheater metric because

615
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:22,870
we use react and we really never had

616
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,870
that big of an XSS problem to begin with

617
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:27,199
so yeah we don't really have a super

618
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,630
good answer for that one in terms of

619
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,880
like metrics but any of the stuff that

620
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:34,670
we talked about in training I think is a

621
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,670
good way to publicize what's available

622
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:40,040
and if you tell in engineers like what

623
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,480
available protections there are they

624
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,430
tend to use them at least its segments

625
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,890
and so like another example this is I

626
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:48,650
wrote a library called less unsafe

627
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:50,600
redirects because I probably didn't come

628
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,290
up with every potential redirect bypass

629
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,030
but we hit

630
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,700
least let people know like hey if you do

631
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:57,320
need to do like a redirect parameter

632
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,540
check this out and we've had other

633
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,870
people contribute to that and use it so

634
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:05,030
I don't know anecdotally I think that a

635
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,840
lot of the stuff is working but we don't

636
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,840
have any good metrics
