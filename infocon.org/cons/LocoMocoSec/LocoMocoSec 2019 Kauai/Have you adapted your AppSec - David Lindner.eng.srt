1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,120
so I want to talk today about adapting

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:09,559
app SEC this is me as Jim said I've been

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,969
around for a while I've worked with

4
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:13,709
quite a few people in this field

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,209
yeah don't yell at me for having let's

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,770
and VARs and the same that's actually

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,240
swift someone yelled at me and no that's

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,859
not JavaScript so I'm now at contrast

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,098
security I'm our director of apps sec

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,199
yes we're an application security

11
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,800
software company but we still need app

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,829
SEC for our products and whatever else

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,140
I'm a dad I golf or I tried to golf I'm

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,629
really interested in IOT in mobile so I

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:45,539
kind of do some of that on the side now

16
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:49,680
so that's me in a nutshell so I want to

17
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,149
dig right in right the rules of the game

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,120
have kind of changed you know I've been

19
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,969
an app SEC I still remember I think it

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,500
was 2002 I took an app set course from

21
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,829
Jeff Williams who was Kona the

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,890
co-founders of a wasp so it's been a

23
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,750
while so I've seen it change over the

24
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,119
years but the last year and a half two

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,840
years it's really really changing and

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,850
business is changing right I mean

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,979
business successes is really dependent

28
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,100
on developing great software anymore I

29
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,229
mean there's like 23 million

30
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,880
professional developers in the world

31
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:25,320
that was the last number I saw and and I

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,000
don't know how they determine that but I

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,600
assume that means that these people are

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,090
writing code all day every day right so

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,798
things are changing software is being

36
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,479
built it's great it's huge there's

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,040
billions and billions of lines of code

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,750
and we're building them faster so over

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,540
time we've seen it go from very

40
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,979
monolithic apps who still has these by

41
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,020
the way yeah everyone still does write

42
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,610
to more agile where there's like n tears

43
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,770
and you know maybe you're getting into

44
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,659
some of the VMS and and you know

45
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,429
spinning things up and breaking them

46
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:04,130
down and now this whole DevOps

47
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:07,079
thing microservices containers clouds

48
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,690
it's it's gotten crazy but I mean

49
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,180
honestly most of it is kind of a mix of

50
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,560
these like you like like waggle ops

51
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,300
right like her

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,360
shall fall or something right like I

53
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,480
don't think anyone's truly one or the

54
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:26,069
other of these except for maybe some

55
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,988
really bleeding edge new stuff so what

56
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:29,609
hasn't changed though because in apps

57
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,340
tech like I said it's been around for a

58
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,080
while you know and and things have

59
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,810
changed in development space things have

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:44,670
changed in apps SEC but what has it well

61
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:48,750
Tigers still to go right right so old

62
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,309
things still work right but there are

63
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,730
quite a few things that that really

64
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,760
haven't changed in this space we still

65
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,170
need exact level support hands down

66
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,000
they're the ones paying them up

67
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,190
paychecks they're the ones handed out

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,349
money to make sure that their products

69
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,380
are sold bought and and whatever else

70
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:10,609
right so we need that support and that

71
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,609
won't change over time

72
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:17,040
we still need programs with governance

73
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,530
people process tools right again that's

74
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,489
something that won't change

75
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,170
collaborative relationships we're

76
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,630
getting better at that right and I'll

77
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,690
talk about some of that as I go on that

78
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:31,079
hasn't changed you know specific things

79
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:34,769
to different control areas those still

80
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:36,569
exist right some frameworks some tooling

81
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,299
some whatever else may make them easier

82
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:41,730
but those things are still issues and

83
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,010
things we have to think about the need

84
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,138
for threat models secure design it's

85
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,760
it's almost more imperative now as

86
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,500
disparate as these systems are getting

87
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,500
right with all the different micro

88
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,389
services I mean I've seen I was going to

89
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,310
show you so we just started a bug bounty

90
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:58,049
and I was going to show you the

91
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,299
environment that we set up just for the

92
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,790
bug bounty and it's really simple all it

93
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,859
does is people log into Cognito and it

94
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,138
spins up a docker image running webgoat

95
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,600
and our tool right that sounds simple

96
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,780
but there's like 40 different parts on

97
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,738
this this diagram to that simple process

98
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:19,889
right so it's imperative we start doing

99
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,120
these more because I've had people tell

100
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:22,320
me that we don't need to do threat

101
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,450
modeling we don't need to do secure

102
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,219
design and there is that camp out there

103
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,169
but I'm in the camp that believes that I

104
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,770
think we do

105
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:36,750
and we're still writing code right so

106
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:40,440
security standards who has security

107
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:43,400
standards for app sec can I ask those of

108
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,900
you who didn't raise your hand why not I

109
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,340
like it to be interactive so you know

110
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:57,359
yeah let me throw things at me I don't

111
00:04:47,340 --> 00:05:06,000
care no one there we go all right anyone

112
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:12,090
sure something that developers know to

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,250
use perfect I asked you to something

114
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,138
that developers can look at use

115
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,690
understand like hey for authentication

116
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:22,650
you use this framework you use this tool

117
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,840
set right okay Neal where are you gonna

118
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:28,560
say something

119
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:31,080
yeah it doesn't say no crazy old

120
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,360
standard process Docs that no one wants

121
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,070
to read right but there has to be an

122
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,770
understanding of these different control

123
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:42,449
areas and how developers should approach

124
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:44,430
them in their code right application of

125
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,849
risk categorization I can guarantee you

126
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,469
that no more than 20% of you do this

127
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:53,070
like this this has been the hardest

128
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:55,289
thing to do for organizations as time

129
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,550
has gone on I mean you know some of the

130
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,710
some of the companies that I've worked

131
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,870
overtime they've got three thousand five

132
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,710
thousand different apps where do they

133
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,080
even start

134
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,630
right but we have to i mean wasp has

135
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,130
ASVs right but if you don't know the

136
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,870
risk categorization of your app you're

137
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,479
not sure which path to follow

138
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:16,219
as far as how you assess your apps and

139
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,750
the security posture of that app and

140
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:20,639
secure design principles so I want to

141
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,139
talk about this a little bit does anyone

142
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:28,409
use ghost no one

143
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:29,940
the popular node blogging platform all

144
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:35,560
right so these guys pissed me off so I'm

145
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:38,680
gonna I'm gonna talk about this a bit so

146
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,970
they have a set and this this is all on

147
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,230
their site of five different user roles

148
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,820
and I've got those there right

149
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,130
contributors authors editors

150
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,690
administrators and owners they all have

151
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,580
different things they can do and things

152
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,180
they can't do

153
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:57,580
well my esteemed colleague found that

154
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:01,690
you can easily elevate your privilege in

155
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,430
this system and they have an open bug

156
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,950
bounty so he submitted that to them I

157
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:10,030
think it was July of last year never

158
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:11,680
responded not once to him all he had to

159
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,210
do was embed some JavaScript in an app

160
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,590
and get an admin to preview it so

161
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,820
there's like a CSRF thing and all that

162
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:21,010
going on but it was really easy to do so

163
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:25,090
ghosts response not to Matt was to

164
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:27,310
change their documentation they're not

165
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:33,580
interested in privileged escalation they

166
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:34,840
sell this tool right and they say right

167
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,729
here this is this is the part that's

168
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,859
crazy ghost is a content management

169
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:41,560
system and all users are considered to

170
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:45,550
be privileged and trusted really like

171
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,740
what year is it do we do we create

172
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,330
access control systems and then just say

173
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,050
now with that we don't really need that

174
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:55,780
everyone stressed it anyway so it's

175
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,810
stuff like this like they didn't use

176
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:03,520
secure design principles here right like

177
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:06,389
which ones are they missing here least

178
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,190
privileged is the obvious one right

179
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:10,510
maybe separation of duties I mean that

180
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,940
was the whole point of this is to kind

181
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:17,139
of separate the duties of the different

182
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:18,910
roles of users but obviously they it's

183
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:21,900
oates over their head so if you use it

184
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:24,460
press them on this please their fix is

185
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,888
basically putting it on the users of the

186
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:30,489
system hey you should run the admin

187
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:33,010
interface on a separate domain okay I

188
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,979
mean you should but that shouldn't be

189
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,900
the fix to this and then software

190
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:41,800
integrity like this is becoming more and

191
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:43,689
more of importance with all of the

192
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:48,339
third-party library issues we've seen

193
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,070
right does anyone use Ruby come on Ruby

194
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:51,230
guys

195
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,660
right I know get everyone from github

196
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,000
better raise their hand so there was

197
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:59,449
recently the bootstrap sass ruby gem

198
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,880
issue did people see that and it is so

199
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,970
someone I don't know if they've really

200
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,910
come out and said who or how or what

201
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:11,300
committed this code which basically just

202
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,980
took in a fake HTTP header and eval dit

203
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,449
and I don't know if you know Ruby but

204
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,750
that's just meta programming you can

205
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:21,320
pretty much do everything right and it

206
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:25,820
was committed to an older version of

207
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:28,940
this Jim thankfully I don't know who the

208
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,620
guy is but he called it out when he saw

209
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,020
it committed even though it was an older

210
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:46,190
version but it was something that was

211
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:50,569
downloaded about 1500 times yeah yeah

212
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:52,850
yeah it was it was interesting right so

213
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,650
I mean simple things like that this

214
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,420
stuff is happening right and this can

215
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,730
happen in your code too so we've got to

216
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,199
have some process around how we're

217
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:04,640
determining the integrity of our

218
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,780
software and threat modeling you know no

219
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,910
one likes it it sounds like a

220
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:12,470
four-letter word who does threat

221
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:15,439
modeling that's awesome do you make it

222
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:18,050
fun at least right because if you don't

223
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,590
no one's gonna want to do it like

224
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:23,599
talking Batman terms or something right

225
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:27,320
make it fun make it quick and I'll talk

226
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,490
about some of that as well so those are

227
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,680
the things that haven't really changed

228
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:34,070
in my opinion things that have changed

229
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:37,630
our art patterns right like our

230
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:40,280
architectures are drastically different

231
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,350
development methodologies over time have

232
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,329
changed for sure the speed of

233
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,700
development you know it's it's only

234
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,320
increasing it's crazy how much code

235
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,660
developers can write I think the last

236
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,360
sad I saw is like the average developer

237
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:56,240
writes about 10,000 lines of code a year

238
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,670
I don't know how accurate that is but

239
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,899
that seems fairly fairly accurate to me

240
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,360
need for tooling and automation is

241
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:08,509
only increasing because there's just too

242
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,360
much code new infrastructures and and

243
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:14,660
responsibilities are changing and and

244
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,459
really as a business this is kind of key

245
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,490
right like as a business you're being

246
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:21,949
pushed into writing modern software

247
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:25,040
using these modern architectures right

248
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:28,969
it's not as easy just to stand up an

249
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,349
antiquated Java system anymore right

250
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,449
like where you gonna put it who's gonna

251
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:36,949
host it can can we can we not have

252
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:39,469
deployment parties that last two days

253
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:42,199
right like like things are changing

254
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:45,470
you know agile devops micro services all

255
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:47,868
that stuff but the harsh reality is this

256
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:51,139
is like every year the number one

257
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:53,300
security threat is application code

258
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:55,939
breaches I don't see that changing

259
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,248
anytime soon right I mean the amount of

260
00:11:55,939 --> 00:12:00,618
Cobre writing you know infrastructure is

261
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:02,800
code you know all that good stuff coming

262
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:07,459
in it's not gonna change

263
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,889
but we're still seen as the slowdowns

264
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:12,739
like us security folks right developers

265
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:15,259
like oh you're slowing us down right so

266
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:18,529
72% of developers say you know that's

267
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:20,769
really the slowdown and then what's the

268
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:26,629
big deal on the security exec side right

269
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:28,999
talent shortage so we have some some

270
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:32,899
issues to deal with in this this modern

271
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:35,480
era of development and securing

272
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:38,990
development because developers are being

273
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,230
asked to basically continue speeding up

274
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,579
their process writing more code

275
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,639
delivering almost ten times the amount

276
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:48,319
of code right and we still have to make

277
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:53,509
sure that that code is secure so how are

278
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:57,339
we going to do that it's it's almost an

279
00:12:53,509 --> 00:13:02,929
impossible economic thing right like

280
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:05,779
like we have we have tools we have very

281
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:08,929
teeny budgets right we have some

282
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:11,389
specialized security staff but then

283
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:13,999
we're writing that much more code right

284
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:15,320
I mean this this is real like who's else

285
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:18,740
is seeing this

286
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,660
right we don't have time you know 20

287
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,060
years ago when I started in consulting

288
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,130
it was really easy hey we have this huge

289
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,410
monolithic Java app it's seven million

290
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,810
lines of code can you look at it for six

291
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:32,959
months sure you don't have that anymore

292
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:35,949
right I've got these 300 micro services

293
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,388
written in 17 different languages and

294
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:40,189
how are you going to assess them all oh

295
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:43,009
and by the way I don't really have a

296
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:45,170
proof of concept they just some of them

297
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:47,329
are HTTP some of them are exposed to API

298
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:50,750
gateway and it's like holy crap okay

299
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:53,888
like how are we going to do this so the

300
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:57,500
root of the problem really stems back to

301
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:59,959
we're using an antiquated security model

302
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,839
for trying to secure modern day

303
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:08,000
applications you know we're using the

304
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:09,529
old scan and perimeter based model with

305
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,160
SAS desks

306
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:17,199
you know dynamic scanners laughs all of

307
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:19,790
that stuff and we're having issues right

308
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,399
those tools all that good stuff was

309
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,089
built for kind of the pre cloud era it

310
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,920
really was

311
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:27,410
I'm not saying they're bad tools are

312
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,229
great like everyone should use them you

313
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:34,550
have to use them but we're kind of stuck

314
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:36,980
in this this slump if you will and I

315
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,620
think we need to get over blaming speed

316
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:42,190
right that's that's the easy thing for

317
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:46,930
me oh it's just too fast

318
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,930
well catch up right

319
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:55,040
I mean they're not slowing down they're

320
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,350
not gonna and they're gonna drive right

321
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,199
over us as security folks if we don't

322
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,019
keep up with them right we don't we're

323
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,579
not building moats anymore

324
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:07,279
you know we've got these high-speed

325
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:08,540
airplanes coming at us and you know we

326
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,750
got to figure out how to help secure

327
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:17,800
them so it kind of requires this modern

328
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:21,440
software security model who here can

329
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:27,199
100% accuracy tell me what their

330
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,820
software security posture is or are you

331
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,599
gonna hand me a report from six months

332
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:36,010
ago because someone came in and looked

333
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:40,550
at your code right right most of us

334
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:41,240
cannot and now we don't have slides oh

335
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:47,660
there they are

336
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:49,760
hi cat so this is kind of the the way

337
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,870
that that we're trying to integrate

338
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:56,449
right like security and dev are always

339
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,310
like this we're going in opposite

340
00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:01,040
directions who still has separate

341
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:03,560
tracking systems like here's my security

342
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,050
bugs and this directory over here here's

343
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,219
my software bugs yeah don't be shy I

344
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:13,490
know you do

345
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:15,890
right we're trying to get past that and

346
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:21,170
then process integration like it's not

347
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:22,579
it's not this unicorn right like I mean

348
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,160
your curtains are great don't get me

349
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:27,739
wrong but it's really not right there's

350
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,990
if I could give you an easy button I

351
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,760
would but there is no easy button every

352
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,959
org is working differently they all have

353
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,380
different process they all have

354
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,449
different tools so you know as a product

355
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,490
security person don't go in there

356
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:41,870
thinking everything's gonna be no

357
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,760
rainbows and unicorns because it's not

358
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,589
gonna be right some things are gonna

359
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,360
integrate well some things aren't maybe

360
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:49,690
you'll have to reevaluate what tools

361
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,190
you're using so they do integrate better

362
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,690
but you know don't don't come in there

363
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,050
like oh I'm gonna I'm gonna change the

364
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,860
world

365
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:59,149
I got I got a unicorn here and then this

366
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,600
this is huge

367
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:03,420
right like

368
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,610
I can't tell you the number of times I'm

369
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,990
like seeing the old great gray beard

370
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:09,270
which is kind of like me I guess I'm

371
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,130
gray beard now come in there oh you will

372
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,150
do this all right well I'm just gonna

373
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,459
find a way around it

374
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:17,190
right I have a story it's funny it's

375
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,870
about my first job out of college I had

376
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:24,870
just gotten onto the security team this

377
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:26,489
is 20 some years ago and old old dotnet

378
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:28,550
javo I don't remember what it was it

379
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,770
might have been Java like com+

380
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:34,530
but there were times that this app the

381
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,520
database would get corrupted for who

382
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,550
knows what reason

383
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,800
right so the developers would have to

384
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,990
put in a request through email or

385
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,570
something to our security team and that

386
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,340
would take two days for them to respond

387
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,560
and give them access to go in and fix

388
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:55,050
the prod at abase so what do you think

389
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:57,560
the developers did yeah

390
00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:00,060
they wrote functionality in the app

391
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:04,710
where they could just pass a sequel

392
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:07,020
query in the URL mind you to fix the

393
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,390
database because it happened frequently

394
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,760
and no one could figure out why but

395
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,710
security got in the way and it took too

396
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,530
long it's like this app would be down

397
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:18,150
for two days at a time right the

398
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,560
business said nope figure out a way

399
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,140
around it so the developers did and

400
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,600
they're gonna continue to do that right

401
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:29,580
so we got to be very careful with with

402
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:32,250
gating and then relationships right like

403
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:34,080
I wasn't consulting forever so I

404
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,990
understood that side of the relationship

405
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,770
spectrum right like that relationship

406
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:42,000
with my clients now I'm like internal

407
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:44,790
that's a whole different game for me

408
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,850
right like my relationship building is

409
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:50,070
not only with my DES but with my product

410
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,230
managers right the product managers are

411
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,330
driving everything so if I have a poor

412
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,930
relationship with them you think they're

413
00:18:54,330 --> 00:19:02,909
gonna do anything for me probably not

414
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:05,070
right and then you know earlier I talked

415
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,710
about fret modeling I think there's this

416
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:10,379
this thing of like sprit threat modeling

417
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:14,040
not only like in your dev Sprint's but

418
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:16,740
doing it more quickly right

419
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:22,200
when it comes to threat modeling and and

420
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:24,750
what I mean is gotta hate clowns I don't

421
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,350
even know I like scared looking at every

422
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,430
story should be examined for malfeasance

423
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:32,129
doesn't matter what it is maybe you're

424
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:35,550
only adding some drop down box takes

425
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:38,340
seconds to talk about it and examine

426
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:40,790
that story for malfeasance right and for

427
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:44,040
something that could possibly go wrong

428
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:47,490
with with that and and and some attacker

429
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:49,110
getting after you so then we we've got

430
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,090
this continuous integration which is

431
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,370
important everyone here probably uses it

432
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,169
to some extent right what what what does

433
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,909
this provide us not only from a deaf

434
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:05,790
perspective but from a security

435
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:08,400
perspective one don't be shy yeah I mean

436
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:12,060
it's really for speed right I mean the

437
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,700
old deploy parties who was involved in

438
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,260
those by the way okay you get to come in

439
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,430
tonight and we'll give you a beer but

440
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,870
you get to stay here all night while

441
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:23,880
this deploys and fails and then you got

442
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:27,330
to fix it see I was added to help that

443
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:30,060
issue right like we can continually get

444
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:32,250
those things moving with security we're

445
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,110
like oh we can get into that process run

446
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,320
some tests not just unit tests right we

447
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:40,669
can run security specific tests in our

448
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:45,000
CIS right and then we get into

449
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:46,440
continuous delivery right people get

450
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,800
these look confused there's continuous

451
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:54,650
delivery and continuous deployment can

452
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,649
someone tell me the difference Tanya

453
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:17,500
sure yeah very good I mean sort of so so

454
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:20,960
my answer is continuous delivery is is

455
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,760
basically all of your deploy all of your

456
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,040
builds could go to prod but they don't

457
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,200
necessarily all go to product whereas

458
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,300
continuous deployment is everything just

459
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,370
goes to prod without approvals as Tanya

460
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,860
mentioned right like every bill just

461
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,179
gets pushed to prod I'm not sure how

462
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,360
many people are actually doing the

463
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:40,060
latter there's probably a few but this

464
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:44,360
is another place that we've been able to

465
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:46,550
help inject some security process and

466
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,500
should write like okay we have a build

467
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:50,389
maybe we're running our SAS task tools

468
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:54,020
at this point right so we have a build

469
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:57,050
that succeeds so it is a New York New

470
00:21:54,020 --> 00:22:00,770
Era though right software security is

471
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:05,300
kind of falling behind there aren't

472
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:07,790
really great tools for the distributed

473
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:10,190
systems that we're creating and I say

474
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:15,530
that as a tool vendor right like there's

475
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:17,060
no magical unicorn answer as far as

476
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:21,139
software security goes from a tooling

477
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:24,010
perspective because there's a ton right

478
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,450
I'm sure everyone uses some of these

479
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,730
maybe they use them all she's got

480
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,410
unlimited funds right this isn't nearly

481
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,700
all of them either right these are just

482
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,060
ones that it's like oh I've seen those

483
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:38,080
I've used those and they all work in

484
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:40,730
different places in the process right

485
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:45,230
some may work better in your org some

486
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:47,300
may not but you know setting them up is

487
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:50,380
definitely something that is part of

488
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:53,240
your overall software security program

489
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,700
and then the streamlining piece you know

490
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,680
I kind of talked about this earlier you

491
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,150
know this looks very easy right you have

492
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,070
your IDE you have your code repos you

493
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,870
have your pipeline and you have your

494
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,689
hosting provider which is probably a

495
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,129
cloud

496
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,820
you know some of you may still be on

497
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:11,230
bare metal but the key here is they need

498
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:14,649
to kind of all integrate into that

499
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:17,650
single defect tracker right this defect

500
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:20,290
tracker is where devs work day in and

501
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,820
day out that's how they know what

502
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,770
they're supposed to do over the next

503
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,620
couple of weeks or however long your

504
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:28,540
Sprint's are right so if your security

505
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,909
defects don't get into that defect

506
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:34,510
tracker devs aren't going to pay them

507
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:36,310
any attention right and on the same

508
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,260
respect if they are in the defect

509
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:40,480
tracker they'll be treated just as any

510
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,830
other software security buggers are not

511
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,990
even security but software bug is

512
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,120
treated right and the criticality will

513
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:49,540
be assigned and it just follows the

514
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:52,510
process this is key to make sure that

515
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:54,970
your security debt does not just

516
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:57,550
continue to grow you know in my

517
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:59,050
consulting days I can't tell you the

518
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:01,899
number of times I had clients come to me

519
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:04,870
and say all right I got check marks in

520
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,370
here I ran it and now I have a report

521
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:10,300
and it's in this directory that no one

522
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:11,739
looks at can you help me I mean yes I

523
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,379
can come in and help you and help maybe

524
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,330
vet some of those but you're not

525
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,820
utilizing that investment correctly

526
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:21,429
right like like what's the point oh I

527
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:25,780
have the tool running right but what are

528
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:27,640
you doing with the output right and this

529
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,950
really helps to with all of the people

530
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,840
in the org right your developers are

531
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,750
using that single defect tracker your

532
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,550
managers who have to respond to the see

533
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,140
so when they say hey how many software

534
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,360
security bugs do we have or how many did

535
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,800
we fix over the last sprint they can go

536
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,379
to one single location and they know

537
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,210
exactly how many right security teams

538
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,570
there and your tooling it's all pushing

539
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:56,860
pulling from that single centralized

540
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:58,480
tracking database is that you Kenny you

541
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:02,260
know and this is the hard part this this

542
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,790
is what I'm struggling with and maybe

543
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,770
someone has some insight here because

544
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,389
this this whole internal security

545
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:11,920
product security stuff is pretty new to

546
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:13,660
me but as a security person as a

547
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,540
consultant it's very easy to be like oh

548
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,130
hey these things are bad and throw it

549
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,830
over the window right lay or throw it

550
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,960
over the fence

551
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,649
now as a product security person I'm

552
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,960
like oh crap they're bad but how do I

553
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:30,140
assign risk to that based on these 25

554
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,180
other things right that that are ongoing

555
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:35,240
and maybe there's some revenue at risk

556
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:39,110
right like that's that's definitely at

557
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,870
play right so I I don't have all the

558
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:44,330
answers here but you know coming up with

559
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:46,520
some sort of risk matrix makes sense but

560
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,449
it's not always gonna work just know

561
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,970
that right

562
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:57,530
have at least a baseline whether that's

563
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:59,660
ASVs and have a feel for that but yeah

564
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,010
and then dev sec ops right like I didn't

565
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,930
want to go into this this is a whole

566
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,390
nother topic three or four people have

567
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:08,630
already talked about it right but I

568
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:11,210
think it's very promising to me what it

569
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:13,790
really comes down to and and all the

570
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:16,370
things that I talked about are kind of

571
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:19,460
put putting that security culture out

572
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:21,260
there right like being friends with

573
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,270
people instead of sitting in your little

574
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,750
basement dungeon telling people what to

575
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:28,370
do right understanding how much work it

576
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,880
actually is going to take for someone to

577
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:34,939
make this fix versus this product

578
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,470
enhancement that's going to either bring

579
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,490
in eight million dollars or not if we

580
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,860
don't get it out the door right now

581
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:42,410
right so all of those things start to

582
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,389
get weighed and in and it comes down to

583
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:46,400
that building that security culture and

584
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:50,420
and the relationship building between

585
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:53,830
the different areas so I wanted to talk

586
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:58,550
about how am i doing I'm good how we

587
00:26:53,830 --> 00:27:02,270
ship secure code or at least semi secure

588
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:04,360
code right it's not perfect this is our

589
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:09,860
process these are the tools that we use

590
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:15,169
you know the IDE IntelliJ we have or

591
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:21,409
bitbucket sorry github folks you know it

592
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:24,860
is what it is right so we use bitbucket

593
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:29,210
for our pipeline we use it for our code

594
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:32,399
repos for chat ops who doesn't use slack

595
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:34,170
nowadays right like a slack

596
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,370
you know and I love it like all the

597
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:38,730
integration points are amazing

598
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:42,030
especially for my bug bounty stuff we're

599
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:45,540
building in some burps cans with burb

600
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:49,190
enterprise to to scan all of our our

601
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:53,040
builds and we use JIRA for tracking and

602
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:54,800
we you know this is a shameless plug but

603
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,000
we use our own tool on our own tool it's

604
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,700
contrast on contrast you know but hey

605
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,470
that's not gonna work for everyone um so

606
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,750
it's a pretty simple workflow right I

607
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,880
mean most people probably follow

608
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,910
something similar maybe your tooling is

609
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,290
in a different place you know but I

610
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:13,710
think the key here is it's pretty

611
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:15,600
seamless right we have our developers

612
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,360
working in their IDs they're interacting

613
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,000
with JIRA for their sprints for their

614
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,340
issues we've got contrast running on our

615
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,590
product if there's an issue that issue

616
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,169
is automatically created in JIRA great

617
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:31,199
developers see that it gets assigned out

618
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:33,510
risk levels assigned once they've fixed

619
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,270
it a notification comes to slack and

620
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:38,760
it's automatically then populated back

621
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:42,629
to our tool saying hey it's fixed

622
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:45,860
so like that whole process sounds

623
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:48,320
amazing but it's not easy to set up

624
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,449
doesn't matter what tooling you're using

625
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,860
but I highly suggest find something that

626
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,770
works for you it may not be a hundred

627
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:58,139
percent perfect but it gets you further

628
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,270
down the road right but make sure that

629
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,060
that whole thing that whole process is

630
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,650
as easy as clicking a few buttons to

631
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:08,070
update all your different disparate

632
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:10,080
systems right that's the whole that's

633
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:11,520
the that's the key here you know be

634
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,760
comfortable with whatever tooling you're

635
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,970
using integrate them well and give

636
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,310
developers that ease of push-button

637
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:24,420
fixing because the hard part is writing

638
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:27,810
the code so then maybe if you get to

639
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,580
that point you can have a better feeling

640
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:33,510
for what your current security posture

641
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:36,720
is right because that's really to me the

642
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:39,360
key like working with our compliance

643
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,990
team working with our sales team to be

644
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,459
able to show clients that hey we feel

645
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,370
pretty good about our security posture

646
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,499
and here is why

647
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:49,090
and I'm not just handing them a report

648
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:52,269
from six months ago from a third-party

649
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:54,249
consultancy right I can be like alright

650
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:58,269
this is exactly where we're at today in

651
00:29:54,249 --> 00:30:04,149
printable reports and send it to I think

652
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:05,830
that's kind of the key so this is the

653
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:08,709
slide that I want everyone to take a

654
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:14,139
picture of because it took me forever to

655
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:16,240
put it together Wow you guys listen you

656
00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:21,070
don't really don't have to but so these

657
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:26,049
are in my eyes where I see things going

658
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:28,509
I guess right tools are going to

659
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:29,769
continue to evolve they have to because

660
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:32,289
if they don't they're just gonna get

661
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:35,409
thrown away and we're gonna be up

662
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:37,240
creek you know there is a lot of really

663
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:39,340
smart people there's a lot of really

664
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,399
awesome tool work going on

665
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,549
I mean we've we've been looking at some

666
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,959
serverless

667
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:46,389
tools I don't know if anyone uses them

668
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,789
you know they're they're writing AWS

669
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:50,740
layers that help instrument your your

670
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:52,330
micro services and lambda functions and

671
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,369
things like that there's some pretty

672
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:57,369
awesome things going on and that's only

673
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:59,110
going to continue to evolve heck Amazon

674
00:30:57,369 --> 00:31:02,980
and Microsoft and them they're probably

675
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:05,740
already working on it as well I think a

676
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:09,190
key to this whole stack here is we have

677
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,499
to figure out a way to enable developer

678
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:15,970
self-sufficiency and what I mean by that

679
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:17,499
is we don't have the security people to

680
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,259
continue to find all these these

681
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:23,019
security issues so we need to basically

682
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:24,759
make developer self-sufficient so it's

683
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:30,249
easy for them to find them and fix them

684
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:33,369
right without even maybe doing security

685
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:37,360
specific testing there's tooling out

686
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:40,029
there that does this right today whether

687
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,610
that's building in some SCA tools some I

688
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:45,340
asked tools rasp whatever else but it

689
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:48,248
helps developers basically become

690
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:51,029
security people right because we need it

691
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:53,440
we need it badly

692
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:55,269
open-source risk management obviously is

693
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,149
a huge problem it's not going away it's

694
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:58,899
getting worse I would love for everyone

695
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,789
in this room to

696
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:04,539
continue talking about that and getting

697
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:06,249
together and figuring out how to make it

698
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:08,649
better instead of just saying I'll see

699
00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:13,960
the ease or right I mean really

700
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:16,119
like as a security practitioner we're

701
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,129
really good about saying that's bad and

702
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:21,399
then walking away of course it is but

703
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:26,559
let's fix it like let's find a way to

704
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:29,199
make it better right you know protecting

705
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,820
legacy portfolio stuff is still

706
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,739
important there's still a lot of it I

707
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,139
mean ice-t-- you know in consulting I

708
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:37,659
looked at code that was 20-plus years

709
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:40,570
old so that's not gonna go away so

710
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:42,219
whatever process and tooling we use

711
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:44,589
hopefully it will still work on some of

712
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:48,909
those unless you're still running COBOL

713
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:50,918
and a mainframe this the the optimized

714
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:53,649
penetration testing is interesting right

715
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:57,339
and I'm working on that internally like

716
00:32:53,649 --> 00:32:58,689
I know what our tools are good at so I

717
00:32:57,339 --> 00:33:01,149
don't necessarily want to spend my time

718
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:03,489
and effort looking at those sorts of

719
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:05,498
things like SAS desk I asked all that

720
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:08,080
they've got specific things that they're

721
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:09,759
pretty good at right xs/s most of them

722
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,529
are good at sequel injection most and

723
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:13,659
we're good at and there's a list right

724
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:15,070
so have some comfort level there and

725
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:18,039
then focus on the really hard things

726
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:20,589
like access control issues right have

727
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:23,229
the brains the smart people come in and

728
00:33:20,589 --> 00:33:25,359
look at the specific issues or specific

729
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:27,429
control areas that you you know your

730
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:31,809
tooling and your systems may be lacking

731
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:33,879
right because I as much as I think tools

732
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,950
are gonna evolve I think there's always

733
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:38,859
going to be hard problems that tools

734
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:42,309
can't help with and I may be wrong

735
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:44,379
hopefully prove me wrong and then

736
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:46,359
ensuring that continuous visibility kind

737
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:49,178
of the we know what our security posture

738
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:50,678
is everyone in the company knows what

739
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:54,999
our security posture is everyone knows

740
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:57,700
our setup our tooling and all of that so

741
00:33:54,999 --> 00:34:03,190
this is really kind of abstract in the

742
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:04,719
modern world if you will in my eyes and

743
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:09,399
I think it benefits the whole company

744
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:11,880
right I can't imagine how tough it is

745
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:15,380
being a CIO or C so in this world

746
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:20,190
there's a few in this room I know right

747
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:23,550
answering to everyone but if we follow

748
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:26,030
this this modern-day process we can at

749
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:27,960
least help the sea so the sea levels

750
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:30,120
understand that we're trying to close

751
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:34,260
that security gap and have them sleep

752
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:37,080
better at night right and then the

753
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,420
security team you know every one of us

754
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,949
has been a position where we're working

755
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:43,860
too much because we don't have enough

756
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:46,230
help if we can get a process set up

757
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:49,110
where we're comfortable maybe you know a

758
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:53,250
40-hour week isn't such a bad idea or or

759
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:56,940
less and then the dev team right instead

760
00:34:53,250 --> 00:35:00,030
of being the you must do this and not

761
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:02,900
working well with them let's enable them

762
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:06,810
to work with us right

763
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:09,240
and then ops you know ops a lot of times

764
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:12,750
it gets kind of left in the dust and

765
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,399
they're the last ones we blame but if we

766
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:22,140
get this system set up correctly ops

767
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:23,880
will just be streamlined into it so I

768
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:33,210
ran through that fast because we started

769
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:37,290
late Jim but I know I'm good I was

770
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:45,780
hoping so what did we learn today AB SEC

771
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:48,000
is hard ice is harder fundamentals are

772
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:51,060
still important like let's not forget

773
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,420
them sometimes we forget them because

774
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,310
things are going so fast but if we

775
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:01,680
forget them things are only gonna get

776
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:04,200
worse as time goes on tools help a ton

777
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:10,410
and really are a key to your success as

778
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:11,939
an or as a software security vendor but

779
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,470
we all have our different needs right

780
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,790
like I know what my needs are and

781
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,990
they're they're different than github

782
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,850
sneeze they're different than slacks

783
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:24,149
needs in Microsoft and what-have-you

784
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:26,670
right but we can all create that process

785
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,539
and build relationships like don't be

786
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,339
the person

787
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:34,049
don't be Milton sitting in the basement

788
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:37,109
treyton like be there you know one thing

789
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:39,900
that that I love at contrast is most all

790
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:43,680
of our calls or video chat for for a

791
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:44,970
remote company it's amazing I used to be

792
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,348
kind of against that but I'm like you

793
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,930
know what I like seeing the people I

794
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:50,369
work with and it's it's a lot easier to

795
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:53,339
talk to them when I can actually see

796
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:56,430
them so just a helpful hint of someone

797
00:36:53,339 --> 00:37:01,400
who's been in it for a while so that's

798
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:01,399
it that's me in a nutshell

799
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:17,420
yeah did you have a question Jim I'm

800
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:18,740
putting a tool in a developers hand to

801
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:21,500
help them become a security professional

802
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:23,299
or just become scary literate I think

803
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,460
that's a great goal how long do you

804
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,800
think it takes a developer who's not

805
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,900
been educated napsack once you give them

806
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,670
a tool how long does it take before they

807
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,790
start understanding proper remediation

808
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:38,480
and the subtleties of triage and similar

809
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:40,610
so I guess that's a great question Jim I

810
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,060
guess I wouldn't necessarily give them a

811
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:48,080
tool like I want the process to utilize

812
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:49,370
tools right and then the developer

813
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:54,220
probably uses the output from those

814
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:57,259
tools right how long does it take them a

815
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:59,930
while right like I think you know when

816
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:02,720
it comes to understanding app SEC there

817
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:05,529
is a training component when it comes

818
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,759
down to it that that we have to

819
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,960
definitely use and I know you as a

820
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,100
training event or probably like to hear

821
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,440
that but no it's not but i-i've always

822
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,200
been a proponent of good app SEC

823
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:22,280
training and and I think that's

824
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:24,379
something that needs to continue all

825
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,240
right being back on the customer side of

826
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,770
consulting is there something you wish

827
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,680
you would have done differently as a

828
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:32,680
consultant to help DevOps great question

829
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:40,220
of course my answer is gonna be yes but

830
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:45,350
I know that I never really would have

831
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:47,750
been able to if that makes sense in

832
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:51,529
consulting clients always had pretty

833
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:55,400
specific needs and a lot of times those

834
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:57,350
needs were driven by bodies outside of

835
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,810
something that I could influence like

836
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:05,480
compliance or regulatory bodies or

837
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:07,970
internal process you know thankfully we

838
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,950
were able to find those partners of

839
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:12,770
clients that we could help with these

840
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:14,660
sorts of things and help them evolve

841
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:17,120
their DevOps process and building

842
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:19,870
security into it but frankly they were

843
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,870
few and far between
