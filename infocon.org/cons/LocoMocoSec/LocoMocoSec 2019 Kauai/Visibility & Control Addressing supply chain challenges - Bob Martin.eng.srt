1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,180
so I only have 69 slides so don't worry

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,610
about it

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:11,099
you think I'm kidding

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,230
so we've talked about a lot of things

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:18,630
all day and I want to bring it down to

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:22,949
some other things like software in

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,710
people suffer in vehicles suffer in the

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,689
building it's not just the software on

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,969
your laptop or your phone or your

10
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:35,880
corporate capabilities so one of the

11
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,540
biggest problems is now all of our

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,180
things are connected well that's not new

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,210
but it's not just connected as in

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,450
physically connected it's somebody

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,309
software is doing something and if it

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,440
doesn't do what it's supposed to do

17
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,320
you're not going to get the signal to do

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,780
what you're supposed to do or they

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,690
produce something and it becomes part of

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,270
your systems supply chain so we

21
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,420
basically have a lot of things where

22
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,479
we're dependent on other people other

23
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:11,430
organizations and the question is how do

24
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,439
you gain confidence that they've done

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,140
what they should do I mean within our

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,020
walls we can do things but how do we

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,570
actually communicate to others and how

28
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,280
do others communicate to us so a lot of

29
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:28,829
my work is around that type of problem

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,500
the other thing I found is when I talk

31
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,809
to senior leadership they don't actually

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,270
appreciate how much software their

33
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,630
organization has and I'm not just

34
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:43,530
talking about you know the IT centers

35
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:47,158
I'm so what I tried to do is I talked

36
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:50,090
about my first car my first car had no

37
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,509
software in it other than the driver and

38
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:56,549
it was done with mechanical linkages so

39
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,250
when you hit an accelerator

40
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,439
that's what happened well now there's a

41
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,500
sensor there's a network there's

42
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,289
software there's protocols and hopefully

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,318
it all works well the other thing is

44
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,970
that car had point-to-point wiring for

45
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:16,359
signaling and power well

46
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,280
that's heavy stuff and so they said hey

47
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,070
I can get rid of all that heavy stuff

48
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,500
and old by the way all that heavy stuff

49
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,209
I had to have exactly the right wiring

50
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,160
harness for the right version of the

51
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,050
right vehicle and had to be there at the

52
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,270
right time so they had a lot of

53
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,030
inventory problems so they put in

54
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:36,580
networks and they put things on the

55
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,220
network wherever they wanted they didn't

56
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,080
say hey you know what we're gonna make

57
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,850
that next car better we're gonna put

58
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,590
software everywhere that wasn't what

59
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:49,239
they were trying to do they were just

60
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:53,230
trying to make it more economical make

61
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,690
it less weighty make it more flexible

62
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,670
you know if you don't have to put the

63
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,800
linkage between the pedal and the

64
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,600
throttle in a certain place you can

65
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,090
start moving things around in the engine

66
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,630
compartment so these things weren't

67
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:10,030
motivated by what you know you would say

68
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,010
is oh they wanted more software but

69
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,380
today you have a lot of software in a

70
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,450
car in fact you have a lot of software

71
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,400
and a lot of networks in fact you have

72
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:22,269
even more networks than you think and

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,400
there's gonna be more in near future but

74
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,040
it's not just networks in the car it's

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,640
also external connections how many

76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,720
people remember the low tire pressure

77
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,540
problems we had a couple years ago

78
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,090
well solution to that was to put sensors

79
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,150
in the tires and you're not gonna wire

80
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,280
it into the dashboard you're gonna put a

81
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:46,270
radio in there and you're gonna have a

82
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:51,280
network so there's lots of these so now

83
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:53,260
your attack surface is expanded here's

84
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,300
all your software when do you do an

85
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:59,590
update how do you know you got the right

86
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,700
update who signed who's authorized it do

87
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,220
you do it while you're going down the

88
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,030
highway at 70 mile an hour do it in the

89
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,609
garage

90
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:10,810
take it in for service those are all

91
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:13,420
open questions and we're connecting cars

92
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:17,950
now into other cars into the traffic

93
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:20,168
systems into the roadside systems how do

94
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:23,320
you make sure those are all secured and

95
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:24,799
locked down now I've been talking about

96
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:30,080
vehicles

97
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,330
but vehicles isn't the only vertical

98
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,620
industry that's taking these same

99
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:40,370
motivations so Aeronautics shipping

100
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:42,889
building management health care all of

101
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,069
them I have similar motivations and

102
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:48,680
similar transformations they didn't say

103
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:50,750
hey I'm feeling lucky

104
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,970
let's put software into our core

105
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,699
capabilities they were trying to achieve

106
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:59,180
something and the software came along

107
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:00,380
with it well they don't even understand

108
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,159
what they've done

109
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:06,229
nevermind are they managing it even in

110
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:09,440
our critical infrastructure weapon

111
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:12,919
systems so on one of the big things

112
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,590
that's changed is now you have software

113
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:18,318
that can kill people you have software

114
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:21,818
that can take out half a County because

115
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:26,389
it did something wrong so the idea of

116
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:29,630
how severe a vulnerability is or some

117
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:31,819
hazard has a different scale that most

118
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,490
people who are software developers have

119
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:36,319
no cognizance they have no idea how to

120
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,199
deal with it never mind how to

121
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,449
communicate with people about it so one

122
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,550
of the things I tried to do is not talk

123
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:45,830
about risk because when you talk about

124
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,770
risk it all goes to dollars and somebody

125
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:52,008
tries to sort you know the different

126
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:55,039
dollar impacts but some of these are a

127
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:56,840
little more special than others and so

128
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,479
in my work in the industrial internet

129
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,299
consortium we've been basically talking

130
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:05,719
about quality apps and we focused on

131
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:08,569
five of them so you security is up there

132
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:11,870
but so is safe behavior reliable

133
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:14,389
resilient and upholding privacy and the

134
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,029
reason those five are there is they

135
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,940
interact if you've got a product and

136
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:22,550
it's going to be having requirements in

137
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,560
those five areas and you have five

138
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,719
different teams working on it you're

139
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,169
going to have a disaster you need to

140
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:32,870
actually make them work together so you

141
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:34,758
really have to focus on how much of

142
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,479
something you need of what kind

143
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:41,419
and not just come up with some checklist

144
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,300
that says I need all of us it's really

145
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:46,159
contextual so what we've done in the

146
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,490
industrial internet consortium is we've

147
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:52,129
come up with this diagram so you see the

148
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,199
five capabilities those are kind of

149
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,900
little balloons they may be smaller or

150
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,550
larger for a particular product we've

151
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,388
got this idea of trustworthiness

152
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:04,490
wrapping around him how many of you if I

153
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,650
asked you to go get a trustworthy cab

154
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,610
and while you're walking to the front

155
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:12,710
door to you know get hailed that cab I

156
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,439
asked you to think about a trustworthy

157
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,210
nuclear power control system you

158
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:20,330
wouldn't have any trouble with me using

159
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,609
the word trustworthy both in both even

160
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,370
though one of them you can expect a lot

161
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,849
more data a lot more analytics a lot

162
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:31,550
more rigor and you know the criteria

163
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:33,460
versus you know touchy-feely things so

164
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:37,279
trustworthiness seems to be a very

165
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:40,520
contextual word that a lot of groups can

166
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:43,849
get behind yes I need a trustworthy

167
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,580
product and he has certain constraints

168
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:49,509
depending on what it is how bad the

169
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,490
downside is so it's a very useful thing

170
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:55,699
we've also put the four different kind

171
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:58,879
of impacts everything from environmental

172
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:01,550
disturbances human errors system faults

173
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,229
and attackers because when you talk

174
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,899
about safety security reliability

175
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:08,209
resilience and privacy some of those

176
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:09,770
specialists don't consider some of those

177
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:10,639
other impacts but when you're out in the

178
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,240
physical world

179
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:19,610
all of those are possibly going to ruin

180
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:22,069
your day now if you the industrial

181
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,229
internet consortium is basically trying

182
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:27,610
to take all these different areas and

183
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:29,599
many more and come with one marketplace

184
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,279
traditionally these have been different

185
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,610
markets they've you know had their own

186
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:37,549
supply chain their own group of vendors

187
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:40,430
and and you know maintenance personnel

188
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:42,348
but now that they put software enabled

189
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:44,899
and connected things in them they're

190
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:47,620
actually the same ecosystem they're the

191
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:50,470
same level of

192
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:53,350
problems trouble is each of them is

193
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,990
clueless as what to do so by bringing

194
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:59,170
them together hopefully we can bring you

195
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,870
know some more consistency and sharing

196
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:05,380
of ideas there's another consortium out

197
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:08,070
there called the in industry platform

198
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:11,040
for oh it's out of the German government

199
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,470
they're mostly focused on manufacturing

200
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,530
but if you think about it what do

201
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,120
manufacturers do well they produce the

202
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,980
goods to go into all the other

203
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,920
industries so we work very carefully

204
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,900
very closely with them some people

205
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,709
thought we were actually competitors and

206
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:32,650
know we're collaborators so if you need

207
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:35,650
to you can go look at the architectures

208
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:37,569
that we've both put out there but you

209
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,180
don't have to comply to both if you do

210
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,500
comply to one you're automatically going

211
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,469
to be complying to the other because

212
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,900
we've made them consistent so when you

213
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:50,110
get down to trying to figure out what

214
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:53,829
what requirements should I be trying to

215
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:56,530
meet to be trustworthy for a device one

216
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,960
you want a dashboard that shows them so

217
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:01,240
that as you make choices you know what

218
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,980
the interactions are the other is

219
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,890
there's lots of sources of information

220
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,600
out there for these types of

221
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:10,120
requirements please don't try to apply

222
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,990
any of them verbatim because most of

223
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:18,760
them are not really appropriate for

224
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:22,240
these kinds of devices so how do you go

225
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,370
about choosing those so going to move

226
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,030
away from security for a moment because

227
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:31,420
I don't want an argument but let's get

228
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:33,400
into safety I am NOT an expert and I

229
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,459
stayed here so I wasn't in a Holiday Inn

230
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,800
last night but if I was trying to pick

231
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:42,480
some safety requirements for an

232
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,300
implantable pacemaker maybe I'd try to

233
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,800
do these kinds of things right so

234
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,140
there's some set of requirements whether

235
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,900
these are the right ones or not we can

236
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,750
discuss at the luau here's another type

237
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,970
of implantable medical device it's in a

238
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,390
different area so it may have slightly

239
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,410
different chip

240
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:06,170
requirements sorry and let's go to a

241
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,339
medical environment that you would

242
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,550
actually think there'd be some

243
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:12,620
similarity and requirements for safety

244
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:14,959
well actually there's not there's a

245
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:18,470
little bit of overlap and what we don't

246
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,900
want to do is say oh here's all our bit

247
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:25,310
pieces requirements so let's make a

248
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:27,380
checklist out of it because different

249
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,030
devices are in different environments

250
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,030
and have different failure modes

251
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:35,720
different context really you of an

252
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:36,530
infinite galaxies of requirements could

253
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,780
be unique

254
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,250
of course how do I manage that every

255
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,189
single product has different

256
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,590
requirements every team has different

257
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:49,070
requirements how do I do that well I

258
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:51,290
would look at what the medical world is

259
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,380
done and actually they have families of

260
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:57,380
products so for instance insulin pumps

261
00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:00,590
may be that all of the insulin pump or

262
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:05,600
related technologies have some common

263
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:08,480
requirements how do I represent those

264
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,080
how do I get a repeatable process well

265
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,840
if you looking in the medical device

266
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,370
Assurance cases is the idea so if you're

267
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,740
not familiar with them real quick

268
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:21,140
tutorial here on them but basically it's

269
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,450
a way of organizing what you're doing

270
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,630
why you think you did enough and why you

271
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,920
think you can say you're done so a lot

272
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,790
of different organizations are using

273
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,069
those a lot of different domains

274
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:36,260
basically it's I'm making some big claim

275
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,690
and I break it down into things that I

276
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:41,510
can put evidence against so if I want to

277
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:44,390
say it's remotely safe it's not going to

278
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:47,000
tackle from the external exterior then I

279
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:49,340
would want to say what kinds of remote

280
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,620
attacks vulnerabilities have I

281
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,540
eliminated what kind of tools techniques

282
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,300
and methods have I used to do that

283
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:59,150
collect all that the big part is the

284
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,189
assumptions and prerequisites you're

285
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:04,400
making an argument that this thing is

286
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:06,790
safe but what are the assumptions what

287
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:10,760
is the rest of the system or the other

288
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,670
capabilities doing in your enterprise to

289
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,000
make your

290
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:18,229
sumption is true so you can use it for

291
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,390
figuring out if a Air Wing is ready to

292
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:27,570
do comment this is a UK this is for

293
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:29,640
aircraft and the the key of this here is

294
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,780
you can actually break it into

295
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,189
components and as long as the sub

296
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:38,490
components assumptions and prerequisites

297
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:41,970
are honored and reinforced by the parent

298
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:44,640
system you can compose these and that's

299
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:47,460
something we've not seen in products is

300
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,400
the composability so this is a very

301
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:53,760
interesting and and it looks like it's

302
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:58,199
going to work but I want to go back to

303
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,630
this so all of those automotive things

304
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,700
they just you know carelessly you know

305
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:07,640
brought in technology that they didn't

306
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:12,300
understand well when we think about that

307
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:14,640
as software developers for IT systems we

308
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,949
test our systems on a certain

309
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,160
configuration and then it gets shipped

310
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,920
to run on lots of other configurations

311
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,620
so we're not tracking what versions of

312
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,530
chips what versions of firmware what

313
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,780
versions of the OS what versions of the

314
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:33,089
applications what versions is a source

315
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:36,660
code the libraries the frameworks the

316
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:40,230
compilers language specs yet now we're

317
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:43,469
getting into this ot world and those

318
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,840
things could batter so I think the

319
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:49,170
tolerance for these areas is going to

320
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:52,350
change so the idea here is trying to get

321
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:57,050
a bill materials type of you know

322
00:14:52,350 --> 00:15:00,030
structure on these nevermind services so

323
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:02,819
this little part of it here is actually

324
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,670
what is being talked about for software

325
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,200
build materials

326
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,810
think about the software build materials

327
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,290
is you've got this contractor and the

328
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:15,900
people providing to them but beyond that

329
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:18,420
they have very little visibility into

330
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,280
what they're getting so the idea here is

331
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,280
to try to

332
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:26,819
you know dig away at that obscurity and

333
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:29,790
get some transparency in fact the work

334
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,790
in the NTIA at Department of Commerce is

335
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:35,640
actually talks about market transparency

336
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,740
so we had a lot of talks earlier that

337
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,689
mentioned parts of this what it really

338
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,470
comes down to is you're trying to

339
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:46,440
understand you know the stuff what one

340
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:49,560
group produced is used by another well

341
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:53,730
I'm down at the bottom how do I know I

342
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:56,189
got everything so what I'm offering is

343
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,080
really you need to focus between a

344
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:02,130
particular developer and the particular

345
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:04,710
customer just one leg and I've got a

346
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:08,040
bunch of use cases here that have been

347
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:11,060
put together and the idea here is that a

348
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:15,150
software bill of materials may want to

349
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:17,310
support these kinds of use cases so you

350
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,319
know being able to identify something

351
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,780
that's being you know talked about

352
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:25,140
referred to you're acquiring it you're

353
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:28,280
transferring it the pedigree how was

354
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:32,040
this thing put together the Providence

355
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:35,250
the chain of custody of it so a lot of

356
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:38,699
details in this and this is where we're

357
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,860
trying to be very specific about why how

358
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,850
you would use software bill materials

359
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:47,610
some of these like the license

360
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,350
management and the patch currency the

361
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:52,680
Bill of Materials doesn't have the

362
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:56,430
details about the patches and the

363
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:59,579
licenses some external source has that

364
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:02,310
and you're just mapping it and using it

365
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:05,040
to keep you know well I have this this

366
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:09,179
is I can look up in this resource so

367
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:12,000
there's a lot of confusion and

368
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:14,340
discussion about software bill materials

369
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,130
and we're trying to get it to be a

370
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:20,520
little more succinct because when you

371
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,470
get down to it you want the markets to

372
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:27,240
be able to use this and the way we're

373
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:31,210
doing that and this is sorry between

374
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:35,210
tears across tears in a market

375
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:37,549
if your provider has the ability to give

376
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,950
a software bill materials that's up to

377
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:42,590
your agreement with them it doesn't mean

378
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,330
it's going to be the default the other

379
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,760
thing is a lot of people have talked

380
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:50,928
about software bill materials coming

381
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:53,690
from tools that they apply to code they

382
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:56,480
already have we're talking a lot about

383
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,779
the tools that you use to develop

384
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,779
software and the idea here is that as

385
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:05,960
you develop software the software bill

386
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:09,950
materials comes out of those tools not

387
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:13,250
something that you do on top of the

388
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:15,549
products you already have so when we

389
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,260
when I look at this type of a thing

390
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:22,039
there's certain data fields that have

391
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:24,679
been talked about and the next set of

392
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:27,770
slides here basically say for which use

393
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:31,880
case which of those fields seem to be

394
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:34,639
you know needed so the idea isn't you

395
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,580
know just build a big catalogue of data

396
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,549
fields but rather for different use

397
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:43,760
cases there's things that may or may not

398
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:46,158
be needed and in the interest of time

399
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,629
I'm gonna go right through those so

400
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:53,510
we're actually working trying to come up

401
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:56,120
sorry with a standard that would just be

402
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:58,070
those things so the idea would be that

403
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,959
you could buy tools that could conform

404
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:06,020
to this you could put people on

405
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:08,330
contracts to provide it and I wish I had

406
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,549
more time to talk about this but

407
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:13,340
basically you know if you think about

408
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:17,149
the building trade they had 4,000 years

409
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:20,570
of head start on software there was a

410
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:22,610
king 4,000 years ago who said if a

411
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:25,580
builder builds a building and it falls

412
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,510
and it kills somebody the Builder will

413
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,090
be put to death

414
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,980
that's called accountability we don't

415
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,270
have that in software Jake was talking

416
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:37,220
about it we've been talking about all

417
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:39,470
day in fact in software we we don't it's

418
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,830
all math are you made up you know in

419
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,649
physical things there's Boyle's law

420
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:47,379
you know Planck's constant things are

421
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:50,018
you know not going to change overnight

422
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:51,488
with software you get a new version of

423
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:53,379
compiler a new version of the library

424
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:56,200
the software could work totally

425
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:59,129
different and so you know we got the

426
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:02,830
EULA so I think there's a lot of

427
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:06,070
maturity needed in the building of

428
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:09,249
software and the vetting of it and the

429
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:12,639
due diligence so I'm going to wrap up

430
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:15,509
here you know the bottom line is on the

431
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:19,389
right you have impact to mission and

432
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:21,820
it's not magic how either hazards or

433
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:24,969
attackers get from one end to the other

434
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:27,340
they have to do some type of patterns of

435
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,379
attack through weaknesses but there's a

436
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:34,470
lot of things you can do to mitigate and

437
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:38,080
and you know kind of manage that risk so

438
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:42,309
the question is is there a path through

439
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:45,039
and that's what the job of the

440
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:47,379
development group is to make sure they

441
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,950
understand that possible paths and what

442
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:53,678
they've done to vet it so another way of

443
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,869
looking at is you got threats vectors of

444
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,489
threats weaknesses you can try to

445
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:59,918
eliminate weaknesses you can try to

446
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:02,499
mitigate weaknesses at some point you

447
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,269
decide if I done enough and if I have

448
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:06,009
then you go forward if you haven't done

449
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:08,049
enough then you have to treat it as a

450
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:11,440
vulnerability and then the question is

451
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:13,418
can i patch it or is it something that I

452
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,179
need to actually let go out into the

453
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:19,509
world and then I can try to block it

454
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:22,960
from attack in the infrastructure I can

455
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:25,899
try to alarm for attack but if I'm

456
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,690
working in that kind of ITR enterprise

457
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:31,199
I've got lots of tools that can help me

458
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,909
block from attack or alarm from attack

459
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,049
but if I'm talking about you know

460
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:42,039
automobile or the IOT I'm kind of

461
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:44,830
stopped at that top part of the pyramid

462
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:47,129
I don't have all those other tools you

463
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:49,799
don't have that kind of network

464
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:53,439
infrastructure or bandwidth capabilities

465
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:55,810
so you know there's a bunch of things

466
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,270
out there to help you assess

467
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:02,050
that end of software we've talked about

468
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:04,240
it they're out there and the bottom line

469
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,669
is you want to know which weaknesses are

470
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:11,440
going to have the most impact on your

471
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:13,930
ability to do the the for the software

472
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,780
to do what it's supposed to do and once

473
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:21,970
you have that you can do lots of things

474
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:26,280
but this is what tools are this is black

475
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:29,470
is the tool found the vulnerability

476
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:33,160
bottom line there's a lot of white so

477
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:35,200
what it comes down to is you have lots

478
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,510
of things you can look at to assess the

479
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,970
quality of code for security safety

480
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:42,220
reliability there's lots of different

481
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,800
detection methods you can put against it

482
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,320
whether it's manual or automated but

483
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,020
they all have specific scope they don't

484
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,350
do everything so the question is the

485
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:56,320
things you care about do they do those

486
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:58,149
so if you actually can line that up for

487
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,460
your project that you know you're

488
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,960
getting the right kind of evidence about

489
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,030
the things that would undermine your

490
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,400
system well that can be part of your

491
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,530
assurance case that's how you organize

492
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,010
all of that so I had one more thing I

493
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:16,000
wanted to say is I don't know if you

494
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:20,350
realize that cwe has just got expanded

495
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:26,620
we added a whole bunch of new quality

496
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:31,480
issues basically 137 new reliability

497
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:35,800
performance maintainability weaknesses

498
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:38,560
because a project can fail not just

499
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,480
because of security so the idea is a lot

500
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,399
of the static analysis and dynamic

501
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,020
analysis tools out there find these

502
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,110
things but they had no way of

503
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:50,680
correlating or bringing them together so

504
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:52,750
the title of my talk was supply chain so

505
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,060
I have a couple slides on supply chain

506
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,700
I'd love to talk to you about supply

507
00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:01,840
chain one of the big things about it is

508
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:05,620
it actually has to fit together in your

509
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,750
organization software supply chain is

510
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,110
different than

511
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:13,559
your logistics supply chain and so

512
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:15,600
getting it placed in the right context

513
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:19,289
is something every organization out

514
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,799
there is doing a quick growth and

515
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:24,059
learning on because they just haven't

516
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,190
been able to deal with it

517
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:30,360
so there's some information out there in

518
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:31,830
Capek about supply chain attacks and one

519
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,459
of the last thing I want to talk about

520
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:37,918
is as we do assurance and try to be able

521
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,110
to convince people we can't have

522
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,880
different approaches in different parts

523
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,100
of Industry because every part of

524
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,370
Industry talks with every other part of

525
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:49,439
the industry so we need standards that

526
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:53,580
actually work across the whole landscape

527
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:56,190
and what we hope is that hardware

528
00:24:53,580 --> 00:25:00,389
software services you can actually have

529
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:02,460
assured products so that you can

530
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,880
actually tell people what you've done to

531
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:08,580
vet it before they look at it and with

532
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,490
that this is a paper that cut talks

533
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:15,689
about a lot of that not all of it and I

534
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:17,990
think we're well over but thank you for

535
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,990
your time
