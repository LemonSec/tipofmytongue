1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,319
so yeah I wanted to talk today about

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,600
evolving beyond the vulnerability

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,330
whack-a-mole game I'm sort of a little

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,010
different I guess than a lot of the

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,320
roles in here you know I'm not a

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,178
developer I'm not coding so for all you

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,779
fighting on Twitter about that have at

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,100
it but really what we do we're data

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,100
people we've been dated people for a

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,269
very very long time and we try to arm

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,130
product managers and lots of

12
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,019
organisations with the best data okay

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,278
so I've been doing this for a while

14
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:34,530
usually I look like this up here but I

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,880
learned that if you actually want some

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,620
privacy in your life you grow a beard

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,260
and your hair down and people under the

18
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,760
hell you are they walk right past you so

19
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,129
my new friend back there I was thinking

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,110
about a new shirt maybe like a guy with

21
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,489
a beard a mustache and it says security

22
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,170
through the new security through

23
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,288
obscurity right I think we can make some

24
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,860
money on that maybe but done a lot of

25
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,590
things

26
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,360
old-school OS V DB if you've been there

27
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,920
so we've been been trying to collect

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,420
this stuff for a while a bunch of books

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,629
I think my favorite book isn't the

30
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,159
children's book that I wrote so I meant

31
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,929
to bring some but if you actually want a

32
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,290
copy if it hit me up at some conference

33
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,990
and I'll hook ya so yeah oh here's the

34
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,920
current picture now great alright so

35
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,689
from my standpoint I think everyone does

36
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,770
have some sort of product security

37
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,380
problem right and there were a lot of

38
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,490
themes you know being at the end

39
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,810
presenting a lot of the same themes that

40
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,908
were being talked about over and over

41
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,250
and over right so this is my little

42
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,840
representation of a organization in this

43
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,400
boat sort of going around right we even

44
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,650
heard the iceberg thing a few times

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,920
right so say look everyone has a problem

46
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,299
and you know but the problem is actually

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,950
bigger than they think and when you

48
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,509
start to spend the time and you start to

49
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,820
start to put in the grunt work to figure

50
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,320
out what's going on and maybe what what

51
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
components and libraries and things that

52
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,158
you have right you start to go holy cow

53
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,839
this is bigger but what I will tell you

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,090
is with all the work that we've been

55
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,729
doing on the data side when you really

56
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,079
figure out what the hell's going on

57
00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:00,899
right you might need a bigger boat if

58
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,579
you get my jaws reference right so we're

59
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,960
gonna move past the iceberg one all

60
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,579
right so for me I wholeheartedly and you

61
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,919
can imagine it we're data guys right so

62
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,569
but everyone you talk to tries to define

63
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,440
the problem right whether you tell them

64
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,790
you have a problem

65
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,500
they're trying to sell you on what you

66
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,959
think the problem is or what they think

67
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,210
the problem is I believe without a doubt

68
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,190
that we have a bad data problem without

69
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,020
a doubt and I spend all day long with my

70
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,079
team looking at this stuff and I believe

71
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,170
bad data basically leads us to bagged

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:36,480
product risk management decisions okay

73
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:38,369
so so look you guys know more than me

74
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,890
the dependence upon software now on

75
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,780
other libraries and the growing amount

76
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,880
of publication of new software is just

77
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,800
it's an amazing rate right now and I

78
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,180
just quickly found this to try I was

79
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,220
trying to figure out how many repos are

80
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,810
on github now and what end of last year

81
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,290
was like 100 million and it was growing

82
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,190
it like something crazy the amount of

83
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,829
repos I don't even know what it is now

84
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,970
but it's a ton right so this stuff isn't

85
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,920
going away we're having more and more

86
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,130
software out there we've heard that

87
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,440
quite a bit so from my standpoint one of

88
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,000
the things we focus on a lot is tracking

89
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,600
vulnerabilities right this is this is

90
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,030
what we do

91
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,829
so all software has boner abilities do

92
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,390
we agree with this do we agree

93
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,880
everything is vulnerable still that was

94
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,529
our old OS VDB logo back in the day

95
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,790
right everything is vulnerable and I

96
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,610
feel like we're still in that that

97
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,160
situation right and actually we tracked

98
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,170
over 22,000 unique vulnerabilities last

99
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,180
year it's astounding right we actually

100
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,010
just crossed 200,000 unique

101
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,750
vulnerabilities that we've published and

102
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,549
at some point you sort of go yeah

103
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,440
whatever it's just a number when you

104
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,670
think about how much data that is to get

105
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,770
your head wrapped around and each of

106
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,420
your jobs it's a ton right so

107
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:45,390
everything's everything's vulnerable all

108
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,730
software has vulnerabilities now most

109
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,980
organizations rely on CV and envy D if

110
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,260
you know us we've been bashing on CVE

111
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,399
forever we tried for a really long time

112
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,109
to support CVE

113
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,730
it just wasn't making the progress so

114
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,440
now we've sort of ramped it up to say

115
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,940
look I'm okay I'm not trying to tell you

116
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,769
to throw CVE out you guys do whatever

117
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,769
you want but you can't leave this alone

118
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,930
okay so here's where I am everyone's

119
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,310
still relying on CV and nvd not everyone

120
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,150
really sort of understand how it works

121
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,470
while you know cvid can get reserved or

122
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,780
it can actually get filled out and then

123
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,880
it gets passed over to nvd right and

124
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,890
then from there it gets outsourced to

125
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,830
Booz Allen and then it sort of comes

126
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,500
back okay so there's this long process

127
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,830
with it so most people rely on it it's

128
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,830
missing 67

129
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,719
thousand abilities and most times when I

130
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,729
say this people get upset with me right

131
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,650
I get a lot of dirty looks I get it I'm

132
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:37,539
used to it by now it's like finding out

133
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,859
Santa Claus isn't real you're not happy

134
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:40,419
with me that I'm on the broke the news

135
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,129
to you if you didn't know it or you've

136
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:43,530
been ignoring it because you know it

137
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:46,060
right

138
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,530
67,000 vulnerabilities and when it comes

139
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,259
down to it a lot of people want to say

140
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,000
things like oh you know I'm sure it's in

141
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,159
software that doesn't matter that's not

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,560
the case and from a third-party

143
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:59,080
component library standpoint it's a big

144
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,009
huge problem a big gap that CDE has okay

145
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,419
so to change this a little graphically

146
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:06,009
33% of all vulnerabilities are unknown

147
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:08,620
to organizations that should rely on CBE

148
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:10,479
that's true and then the next thing

149
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,009
people will say to me they'll say ah all

150
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,000
right maybe it is in software but I'm

151
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:14,680
sure it's not in anything that's

152
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,409
important it's probably I'd be all low

153
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,759
risk stuff right and so when we did our

154
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:20,379
analysis on last year

155
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,419
forty five point five percent of the

156
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:25,180
Von's not published just last year alone

157
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:28,448
in CV and NBD and of eats a CVS sv2

158
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,310
score between seven and ten now look I

159
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:32,500
have a real love hate love with CBS s

160
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,669
both version 2 and version 3 we can talk

161
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,129
about that de Loup well that's a whole

162
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:37,990
other conversation but these are serious

163
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:40,090
vulnerabilities so I really want people

164
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,949
to walk out of here going hey CV and

165
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,869
NVDA if that's in your tooling in your

166
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:46,029
stuff that's great but that is a this

167
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,339
tall to ride the ride stuff you are not

168
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:51,339
doing a lot more than you need to okay

169
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:53,860
and so at the end of the day what gets

170
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:56,889
crazy is that the ones that see ve and

171
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,979
nvd actually do track we see them days

172
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,300
weeks and months late has anyone ever

173
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:04,508
gone to look up Steve ID and you see

174
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,330
something says reserved seam this this

175
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:10,210
is normal it can be like at a long time

176
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,250
not kidding usually 1500 to 2000

177
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,810
vulnerabilities a year that have a CV

178
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,849
Eid are still in the reserve status

179
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,379
there's tons of them like that okay and

180
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:20,440
it's not that the information is not

181
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:22,120
available it is just someone hasn't gone

182
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,979
and done the work to get it you know

183
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,550
easy to parse and look at and all those

184
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:28,990
sorts of things okay so for me I do

185
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,000
think it gets worse when you actually

186
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:34,569
really think about this right we think

187
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,149
about sort of lack of coverage right so

188
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:39,459
just because you know some sort of

189
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:40,279
scanner or some sort of CBE ID isn't

190
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:42,169
there and you go

191
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,609
oh great just did an analysis my

192
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:46,549
components are clean I didn't get an

193
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:49,399
alert that doesn't visit the case right

194
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:51,888
because CVE isn't covering it we know

195
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,749
that right and it's not coming quick

196
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:56,299
enough for you to make these decisions

197
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:57,919
in a good fashion and further than that

198
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:59,779
even though I feel really confident that

199
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,909
we're covering the most stuff we're not

200
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:03,649
covering everything we know we're not

201
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:08,569
the more people I hire the more damn

202
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:11,029
phones we find right so it's it's crazy

203
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:12,679
okay so the whack-a-mole game if you

204
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:15,889
like my little picture here it's it's a

205
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:18,649
tough game to play right now and again I

206
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:22,639
think it comes back to it's bad data

207
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:24,709
right and security application people

208
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,199
scanners out there you guys know you're

209
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:29,269
using this bad data right so don't think

210
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,769
is you've got some vendor in there that

211
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:33,289
they're doing a lot more because we're

212
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:35,329
haven't seen evidence of that yet so I

213
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:37,339
believe without a doubt organizations

214
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:40,639
and product security folks need much

215
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:43,129
better data right now what I have

216
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,289
learned when I talk to people about this

217
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,029
sort of stuff even though I can walk you

218
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:48,799
through it I can show you all the raw

219
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:50,419
data you're still giving me dirty looks

220
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:52,308
that you just don't want to believe this

221
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:54,558
right because you probably use CVE in

222
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:56,179
your life it's probably a primary key I

223
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:58,219
bet some of your tooling can't even

224
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:59,929
handle it some of our customers in the

225
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:01,129
room when we first signed them up they

226
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:03,049
were like why are you sending us all

227
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:05,989
this stuff that has an FC ve stop doing

228
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:08,149
that right stop giving us better quicker

229
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:10,429
information because all we can handle in

230
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:12,499
our tool is CDE IDs that's a huge

231
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:13,998
problem okay so I don't care if you're

232
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:16,009
using my stuff if you're doing the work

233
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:17,569
yourself you need to be able to handle

234
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:20,239
vulnerabilities that don't have a CB ID

235
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:22,969
so what I've learned though is when you

236
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:25,099
effectively try to talk to people about

237
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:27,199
normal things and sort of the cyber

238
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,489
world people lose their minds right

239
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,079
there's some really common sense type

240
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:31,909
stuff you say cyber and they go poof I

241
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,789
don't know what's going on here right so

242
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:36,799
I was trying to explain the situation to

243
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,328
some some not really technical folks

244
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,120
about this and I came up with the CVE

245
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:43,609
doctor okay now if you think about your

246
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,889
current doctor primary care person you

247
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,149
trust them don't you have you started

248
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:48,889
thinking about you go well how did I get

249
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:50,029
that doctor did he someone even

250
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:51,379
recommend I don't know I just go to the

251
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:54,180
doctor and I trust they tell me what's

252
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:55,980
going on right so what if

253
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,020
you went to this doctor this is your

254
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,440
doctor and then they say to you guess

255
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,970
what there's like 33% of the things that

256
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,680
may impact you I just I just don't know

257
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,860
I can't tell you about him can't help

258
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,239
you so just so you know come here 33% of

259
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,990
the ailments I have no clue

260
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,940
okay now of those 33% of the things that

261
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:18,870
I can't tell you about 45% I'm they're

262
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:22,980
gonna kill you that's not a big deal

263
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:25,290
right you're okay the stuff that I can

264
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,900
diagnose I'm usually a couple months

265
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,390
late and in some cases it might be too

266
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,800
late to treat you you might be you might

267
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,110
be too late right we all have done that

268
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,349
earlier and then my final thing which is

269
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:40,050
completely legit when I do give you the

270
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,730
diagnosis it can be super vague or not

271
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,540
even in the right thing about the right

272
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,210
thing so you don't even know how to

273
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,760
treat it properly we see all the time

274
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,290
like look for example Tavis right he was

275
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,970
doing all this research into security

276
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,000
products and whatnot he started

277
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,620
attacking Norton Symantec products great

278
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,720
CVS came out right what did they say

279
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,459
they said vulnerabilities and Symantec

280
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,580
products they weren't they were in

281
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:03,900
third-party libraries so if any of you

282
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,250
have these components in your area and

283
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,779
you're like oh yeah we met with CVE

284
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,700
life's good we'd totally no no you

285
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,650
wouldn't you'd have no idea because it's

286
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,060
vague and it's not there so this is my

287
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,150
like let's bring it down to reality

288
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,020
would you keep going to this doctor you

289
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,110
wouldn't right come on

290
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,610
okay so I think it's pretty simply it's

291
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,740
garbage in garbage out I mean there's

292
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,040
some amazing platforms and tools in

293
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,150
house etc like we have to make sure that

294
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,680
we got the right day that we're looking

295
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,720
at the right things and the stuff that

296
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,500
our organizations are using are being

297
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,410
monitored that are being tracked okay so

298
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,640
I believe pretty heavily you know what

299
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:42,779
got us here is not going to get us there

300
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,430
it's pretty simple to say that but when

301
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:46,800
we step back and we say all software has

302
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:50,579
vulnerabilities do do we all believe

303
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:54,209
that help do right should we believe

304
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,080
that is this a stance that we think

305
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:56,430
we're gonna take forever

306
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,150
we're always gonna say tough luck

307
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:02,010
software has vulns get over it all right

308
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,569
now again it's probably another Twitter

309
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,770
argument I'm sure I'll get sucked into

310
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,950
but

311
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:10,890
would this stance prevail and any other

312
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,870
industry right it would not would it be

313
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,279
like look you can drive my car but if

314
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,080
you get bumped into you might burn into

315
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,750
flames and I owe you that bridge that

316
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,430
might crash who knows rightly so if you

317
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,830
think about the some of the stuff that

318
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,120
we say to people in the cyber context

319
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,339
that we're like no that's just the way

320
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,350
 is like there's phones what do you

321
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:30,360
want us to do if you translate that into

322
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,279
any other sort of discipline you start

323
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,980
to go whoo I sound crazy right like that

324
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,980
we would never put up with that right so

325
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,140
I saw a lot of other debates about

326
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,550
regulatory stuff or not and I've been in

327
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,199
this cyber insurance space for a while

328
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,990
so I did a lot of research into product

329
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,220
liability of physical product tangible

330
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,430
product insurance and cyber insurance

331
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,200
and it's a horrible idea we know it is

332
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,839
right I saw a whole bunch of people but

333
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,580
like if we keep with this idea that like

334
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,899
just suck it up and deal with it there's

335
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,730
bones you got to deal with it we're

336
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,560
gonna get regulated in my opinion it is

337
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,660
going to come so I sort of feel like if

338
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,130
we can start shifting our mindset maybe

339
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,860
start thinking a little differently

340
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:10,140
prior to software liability for Senate's

341
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,380
maybe down a bad path it feels better to

342
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,790
me okay so I think if we're honest with

343
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,200
ourselves there are just some types of

344
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,750
bones and classes of bones that you

345
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,550
should do not exist anymore right I'm

346
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,810
not gonna sit up here and say you should

347
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,790
write code that should never have bones

348
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,170
I do understand that but there are

349
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,360
certain types of vulnerabilities that I

350
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,790
feel like you know shame shame right

351
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,740
like that that really is the case so if

352
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,719
we think about that and we can start to

353
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,820
agree with some of that then we sort of

354
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,200
need to evolve right we need to start

355
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,980
looking at this from a more strategic

356
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,320
standpoint you know a more problem

357
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,020
management approach so what if I started

358
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,640
thinking about one of the vendors that I

359
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,170
work with and this may be an

360
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,890
organization thinking about working with

361
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,630
you guys

362
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,730
right or maybe you thinking about

363
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,170
product managers as the library and

364
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,880
components that are within your products

365
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,709
right what are the vendors that care

366
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,230
about the security of their products who

367
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:03,000
cares about this stuff who's trying

368
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,459
actively to reduce vulnerabilities pry

369
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,740
into shipping to me right and then

370
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:10,290
holiday if unfortunately a vulnerability

371
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,589
does make its way how do they respond to

372
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,449
it what products or libraries and

373
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:17,790
components cost you the most to maintain

374
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:18,180
securely that you're dealing with what

375
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,260
product

376
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,089
are more likely to lead to some

377
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,770
unauthorized access or maybe even a day

378
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:24,330
to breach right start thinking about

379
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:27,949
this instead of us going back to the

380
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:29,880
whack-a-mole game so I do recognize that

381
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,399
there are a lot of products out there

382
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,320
whether it's in you know components in

383
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,910
your products or if it's software that's

384
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,520
running it's just not going anywhere

385
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,959
right like this is software that you

386
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,910
could even if it needed to be ripped out

387
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,770
because it's horrible it's probably not

388
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,660
going anywhere so I sort of say let's

389
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:49,680
not start fighting that battle first

390
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:52,500
right but can we start to evaluate new

391
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,359
software new components without being

392
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,339
viewed as like horrible people by the

393
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,980
development organization right can we

394
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,300
start to say to them hey let before you

395
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,529
just go out and pull a whole bunch of

396
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,910
stuff done and you did a release before

397
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:05,220
we even like figured it out if it was

398
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,020
worth your doing can we have some better

399
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,399
conversations now I get a lot of

400
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,110
feedback when I talk about this that

401
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,790
people want to release and shift left

402
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,140
and they want to just release so fast

403
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,360
that why would we ever stop the pawls

404
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:18,120
about that so where we start to go is

405
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,220
can we start working this way if we

406
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,830
improve and automates maybe some

407
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:26,760
decision-making using metrics using

408
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:28,560
insight right so let's think about some

409
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,680
of the product metrics that we could use

410
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,520
and I was really pleased to see

411
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,949
Microsoft they have some of their own

412
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,020
inside stuff that they track trying to

413
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,130
look at products we do some some of the

414
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,020
very similar things of that but we do

415
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,880
some bit more right so we look at things

416
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,949
like code maturity we look at vendor

417
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,400
response time we look at time to patch

418
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:49,529
time to exploit we look at code cost of

419
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,819
ownership and a heck of a lot more and

420
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,160
some of them you may really like and

421
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,839
some of you may hate but the data if you

422
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,640
start looking at data whether the data

423
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,020
you have and you're collecting you can

424
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,480
start to get some of these metrics right

425
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:03,240
so let's talk about code maturity for a

426
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,250
second so what we try to do with every

427
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,050
vuln class and vuln that we can and we

428
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,970
can't do it for everything so I'm gonna

429
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,189
put that out there but we try to sort of

430
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:13,170
rate each vulnerability from zero to

431
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,490
five right so if it's some lame

432
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,050
cross-site scripting or sequel injection

433
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,329
bug that you shouldn't be embarrassed uh

434
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,099
we'll rate it a zero or one if it's some

435
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:21,390
really cool use after free bug or remote

436
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,910
overflow or something and maybe gets a

437
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:26,370
four it's a five right and so when we

438
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:28,350
look at it we start to say wait a second

439
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,670
what does this allow us to do well we

440
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,620
can start to look at a total number of

441
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,219
vulnerabilities for a product we can

442
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,410
look at there

443
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,360
five star ranking if you will on where

444
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,860
that maturity is and while that

445
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,660
individual may be used after free

446
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,550
buggies could have been pretty nasty the

447
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,160
organization it's actually a good side

448
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,510
for the product right it's showing that

449
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,089
there's been an investment in secure

450
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,010
coding it's insuring it's sort of

451
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:52,080
showing us that all the lame bugs have

452
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,189
been eradicated out and now researchers

453
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,750
are having to work harder

454
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,460
they have to work harder to find more

455
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,980
complicated things so it's actually

456
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,660
pretty good and you can start to see

457
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,910
over time as a product getting better

458
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,469
and then what's the likelihood as we

459
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,760
start to forecast and predict how many

460
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,700
more bugs we think we're gonna find in

461
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,520
this product that we're using right and

462
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,440
the response time for all the old school

463
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,270
people right seeing the battles back and

464
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,560
forth between vendors and finding bugs

465
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,930
and full disclosure and all that

466
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,400
nonsense we started trying to track how

467
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:23,310
well do vendors work with researchers

468
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:26,400
right so for example you find a bug in

469
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,930
your some component you send it off to

470
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,730
the whether it's an open source project

471
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,650
or vendor and you say here's what I've

472
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,480
got we start to track how long it takes

473
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:35,550
them to write back right how long do

474
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,750
they start to response we're not looking

475
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,520
for all they made it thanks for sending

476
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,110
us your stuff it's going into the black

477
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,579
hole we're looking for thank you for

478
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,650
this we're gonna start looking into it

479
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,030
that kind of thing and it really helps

480
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,310
us to say do they work well with

481
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:49,260
researchers and why we find this one

482
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,510
really important is because it bleeds in

483
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,580
to our most important metric we believe

484
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,260
the one next okay so in this particular

485
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,240
case right we see this particular

486
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,560
product takes three days on average for

487
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,660
the company to respond to them and say

488
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,369
thanks for the bug report you know we're

489
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,060
gonna start looking into it if that was

490
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:08,069
30 or say 300 days it bleeds into our

491
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,649
next one and causes problems we call

492
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,389
time to patch and so what our metric is

493
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,400
from the time of vendor knows about a

494
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,380
problem how long does it take them to

495
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,560
have a patch out and published so that

496
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,630
you can use it okay it's pretty

497
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,129
eye-opening when you start tracking this

498
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,860
now again I've had a lot of

499
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:28,680
conversations with enterprise folks that

500
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,209
have given me lectures about how some

501
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,740
certain bugs can take longer and don't

502
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:34,440
get me wrong I totally get it

503
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,810
but from your standpoint from a product

504
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,300
manager or an client standpoint they're

505
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:40,620
sitting there sort of exposed right the

506
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,480
vendor at least knows about it maybe

507
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,669
other people do and they're waiting for

508
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,870
this thing to come out right so we want

509
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:48,029
to see this number

510
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:51,209
as low as weekend that's our hope okay

511
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:53,789
now I've also seen quite a bit in some

512
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:56,159
of the other sectors where a patch or an

513
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:58,320
upgrade will be fixed it'll be done but

514
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,940
they choose not to release it they

515
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,678
choose the weight well you know we fixed

516
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,330
it but we'll release it with our next

517
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,010
cycle six months from now right

518
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,720
so we we're seeing some really odd

519
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,908
things as we look into those metrics so

520
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,700
for us it's gotta be working fixed and

521
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:14,130
published okay

522
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,429
I'm time to exploit this is sort of

523
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,450
probably one of my favourite ones ever

524
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:21,270
back in the day we always had this

525
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:23,370
theory like why would attackers spend

526
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,529
any time looking for new bugs why would

527
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,389
they do that it's hard work like it's a

528
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:29,460
pain in the butt right so the theory

529
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,260
always was alright wait for the patch to

530
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,820
come out they would look at it right

531
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,500
they do a diff or reverse it and figure

532
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,029
out what was fixed and then just start

533
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,559
writing next place for it all right I

534
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:39,149
mean makes a hell of a lot more sense

535
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,158
than spending all your time researching

536
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:43,110
for something so we were really ever

537
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:44,850
never able to prove that back in the day

538
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,350
but now we're tracking all these metrics

539
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,629
trying to be able to explain what's

540
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,610
going on and what some cool things about

541
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:53,460
some of these metrics are it allows you

542
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,990
sort of as a product security person to

543
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,330
talk to the development teams and give

544
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,919
them come armed with data about what

545
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,408
things look like so for example this one

546
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,840
basically says hey look how long on

547
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:06,270
average does it take from when a patch

548
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,149
comes out until we start seeing exploits

549
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,770
being public okay so if I'm waiting 80

550
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:13,260
days for a patch to be published and I

551
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,418
got just over you know two months for

552
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,879
exploits to come out you can start now

553
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,039
going to your IT teams or your

554
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,240
development team to say look I know we

555
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,820
talked about this bug and you really

556
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,990
don't want to fix it in this cycle but

557
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,520
you know probably an exploits gonna be

558
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,649
coming out in the next two months we'd

559
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,210
rather you fix it now than six months

560
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:31,889
from now right so just trying to

561
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,820
understand now what's really interesting

562
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,120
when we started doing some of this

563
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:38,639
research most of what we see is you know

564
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,500
patches come out and then exploits but

565
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,779
there are some where there's a negative

566
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,850
number here and that means exploits out

567
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:46,380
before patches right so we're definitely

568
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:50,639
seeing some of that as well

569
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,710
all right cost of ownership the number

570
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,720
of times people and I heard this sort of

571
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,640
theme today several times - we'll say

572
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,130
it's open-source it's free there's no

573
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,710
cost right

574
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,300
and so what we tried to do was with some

575
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,250
of these metrics start to explain

576
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,350
there's a cost of ownership there's a

577
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,730
cost of securely maintaining something

578
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,709
so I'm not going to sit here and argue

579
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,420
and say you shouldn't use that gem or

580
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,700
that library or whatever it is go go

581
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,160
write your own font rendering image

582
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,450
parsing like I'm not saying that but you

583
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,120
need to start understanding there's a

584
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,470
cost to maintain this stuff okay so some

585
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,870
of these metrics now you can start to

586
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:26,630
understand you know how often are those

587
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:29,120
vulnerabilities disclosed right so

588
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:31,880
what's the disclosure interval what's

589
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,229
the cadence of releases right and so

590
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,020
there's lots of things to think about

591
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:39,290
there but for me if new vulnerabilities

592
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:41,389
disclosed say every eight days right you

593
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:43,010
can look at that and say yeah at least

594
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,290
once a month if not more than a couple

595
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,580
times a month I'm having to all right

596
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,050
make sure I'm alerted by this

597
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,060
vulnerability okay great

598
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,830
now I got to find it in my organization

599
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,510
and then I got to spend more IT time and

600
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,760
resources to fix it right you go back to

601
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,590
Christine's talk on what did they spend

602
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,000
to do some of this stuff so there are

603
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,770
certain components as part of your

604
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,630
product that are costing more money to

605
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:04,010
maintain securely instead of just

606
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,900
playing that whack-a-mole game we can

607
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:09,500
say all right let's look what's in there

608
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:11,600
and can anything go right and and that's

609
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:15,260
where I think we can start moving so if

610
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,909
we move beyond the whack-a-mole game we

611
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,290
can start to have metrics like this you

612
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,240
can put it into your own dashboards

613
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:22,220
right you can start to do your ratings

614
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,530
whether you like five-star crash test

615
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,790
ratings or ABCD and all those sorts of

616
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:28,520
stuff right there's a lot of people that

617
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:30,740
have love hate love hate love and more

618
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,320
hate with ratings I get it but some of

619
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,350
this stuff can now make your life a

620
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,340
little bit easier what I have seen

621
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,750
especially with security teams if you

622
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,010
try to put it like some sort of line in

623
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,260
the sand where you say you know what

624
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,580
every single organization we're gonna do

625
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,050
a risk assessment on or every single

626
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,790
product or component you got to come to

627
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,379
security and we'll tell you if you can

628
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,940
use it or not and then they show up and

629
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,980
they go great here's 50 of them I need

630
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,840
it down done now and you say oh I can't

631
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,220
do it they go we're gonna go around you

632
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,050
we're gonna do it the way we've always

633
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,000
done but if you start looking at some of

634
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:01,730
these metrics right you can start to say

635
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,980
hey if it's above this or if it has if

636
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,440
it's 4 stars or 3 stars or whatever it

637
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,880
is go ahead right register it with us or

638
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,680
make sure it's in the inventory whatever

639
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,090
but if we're seeing some that's one star

640
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,800
they're there these metrics are below

641
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,300
you got to come talk to us right so I

642
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,030
think there's some things like that that

643
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,620
we can start getting better at

644
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:21,780
comparisons right I mean think about

645
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,489
procurement and and even trying to

646
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,440
figure out which which library should I

647
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,940
use if there's options you know a lot of

648
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,890
times and even in due diligence people

649
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,840
have no clue right so if you put things

650
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,670
up and you just look side-by-side and go

651
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,419
yeah they're all pretty crappy

652
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:38,670
so we'll just anyone who uses fine but

653
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,710
this one here I know it has like one

654
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:42,210
less feature but it'll cost us much less

655
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:46,590
I think those are where we want to start

656
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:49,290
going okay again not everyone loves this

657
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,449
rating stuff I totally get it

658
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,980
RedHat just a couple days ago put out

659
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:55,170
something saying hey you know there's

660
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,240
this whole principles for like accurate

661
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,260
security ratings and most people that do

662
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,990
this aren't understand they don't have

663
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:03,120
no clue about backporting and like so it

664
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,500
isn't the rating stuff isn't as mature

665
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,899
as it needs to be so what I would

666
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,430
challenge you on is some of the times

667
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,390
you got to do this work yourself right

668
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,220
you've got to understand how those

669
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,510
ratings are calculated some of the

670
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,770
systems you guys were talking about

671
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,990
start to track some of this data

672
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:17,639
yourself and you can really understand

673
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,890
what's happening just because someone

674
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,840
says it's three stars and you go blindly

675
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,850
off I mean it might help you but make

676
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,459
sure you understand how this stuff works

677
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:29,189
so trying to wrap up for you so we can

678
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,170
get us back on time how do we actually

679
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:34,020
move this concept forward how do we

680
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:35,550
maybe make some progress in this space I

681
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,800
think we got to focus on the things that

682
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,360
really matter right we got to really

683
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,129
focus on those or if there are

684
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,270
organizations and to our products I mean

685
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,790
there's so many things we get distracted

686
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,830
by these shiny objects that that aren't

687
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:49,649
the core problems and and I think we got

688
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,760
to be better about that we've been

689
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,580
arguing this for a while

690
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,020
asset inventory s-bahn whether you love

691
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,480
or hate it it's just time to get over it

692
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,400
we need we need an inventory right now

693
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,650
as a voll guy that's trying to track

694
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,180
data these s bomb people that can't

695
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,730
agree on like one standard drive me

696
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,860
frickin nuts right because it's super

697
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,390
hard to track this stuff as it is but

698
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,800
then everyone wants a different format

699
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:13,290
or a different standard we can't agree

700
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,240
on stuff it makes it so hard to get the

701
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:16,350
data to people that they need okay but I

702
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,690
think without a doubt we got to

703
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:20,550
understand what we have okay whether

704
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:24,030
it's in our products or whether it's

705
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:25,629
just in our organization we have seen

706
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,980
without a doubt especially

707
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,620
like network scanning and things like

708
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,860
that you know the old school way of

709
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:34,479
volunteering it worked okay

710
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,639
understanding your assets in your

711
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,960
inventory the whole DevOps stuff what's

712
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,370
installed and packaged your installed

713
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,440
the second of all comes out being able

714
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,780
to say where am i vulnerable across your

715
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,220
organization it's so much faster much

716
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,560
more efficient we're starting to see

717
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,060
things and like energy and healthcare

718
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,310
and others that don't even want to scan

719
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,409
at all or they're you know air-gapped

720
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:55,120
right like we need to make sure that we

721
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:57,880
have asset inventory so we can start

722
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,729
doing this intelligent stuff better I do

723
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:04,270
really hope that people can start

724
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:06,040
evaluating software prior you know prior

725
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,990
to buying I know it's in usage is gonna

726
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,030
be tough I will tell you there's a we

727
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,620
have a few customers in the audience

728
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:14,170
here and when I was first telling them

729
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:16,120
about some of our metrics they hated the

730
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,800
idea they thought it was horrible right

731
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,969
they were like unhappy with me and they

732
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,330
didn't want me to put these metrics out

733
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:24,160
and I and I understand but I think in

734
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:26,379
many ways our data has helped product

735
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,630
managers actually get more budget and

736
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,590
explained to people this is what we're

737
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:34,870
being evaluated on right we've even seen

738
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:36,970
P certs managers come to us and complain

739
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:39,189
and say our numbers are wrong and we'll

740
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,480
say well we didn't make this up I can

741
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,790
show you the numbers and what they found

742
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,860
out was there was that one product that

743
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,149
wasn't actually in the whole product the

744
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,740
product cert thing so they were doing an

745
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,630
amazing job and they had SLA is over

746
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,280
here but that one product over here

747
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:53,320
wasn't getting the same love and so

748
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,820
using that information to help sort of

749
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,429
standardize things really helped so I

750
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:00,490
think if we start seeing more and more

751
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:02,350
companies pushing vendors on stuff like

752
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:04,390
this right starting making decisions

753
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:06,219
about you look you got to care about

754
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,510
security instead of the next feature

755
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,400
that widget it's gonna sort of flip

756
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,200
things and then maybe I won't be here

757
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:17,800
ten from years from now going guess what

758
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:19,570
we tracked the most vulnerable in that

759
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,060
this can help in a positive way and not

760
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:24,700
make life hell for everyone so make the

761
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:26,889
best risk decisions evaluate your own

762
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,120
data collection please dis evaluate it

763
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:30,450
if it makes sense and you're covered

764
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,770
awesome if not expand what you're doing

765
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,870
and we believe without a doubt better

766
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:37,540
data better risk decisions so with that

767
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:38,770
I appreciate it I know where we got a

768
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,810
bust and everything so

769
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:48,730
good okay all right cheers thank you I

770
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:51,550
appreciate it all right so some CVE

771
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:53,500
questions and I do like Bob I love you

772
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:56,200
so some of these you can chime in on if

773
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,000
you want I would tell you honestly so

774
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,830
the question really is about is it lack

775
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,420
of funding I don't think it I don't

776
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:04,510
think it is they they've got a ton of

777
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:06,910
money I've just found it very

778
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:08,800
interesting that bone tracking is like

779
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:10,270
horrible grunt work I mean it's probably

780
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,419
up there with was it the whale

781
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:16,660
researcher feces thing it's it's it's

782
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:18,400
tough work and I just think I don't know

783
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,440
they if you look at it I don't think

784
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,090
money's gonna solve the CVE problem we

785
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,710
were on the CV editorial board for ten

786
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,870
years back in the osv TV days kept

787
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:28,210
trying to get it fixed and I just think

788
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,649
you need to recognize what CV is accept

789
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,660
it for what it is it's got some value

790
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:34,140
but it's not going to cover the gaps

791
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,140
that you need

792
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:38,350
have you tried attempted or Thai code

793
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,270
maturity to a financial loss of a

794
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,949
real-world exploitation I will tell you

795
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:45,430
that's like their Nirvana for us like we

796
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:47,230
are we also track data breaches if you

797
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,580
guys know that so we have like data

798
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,590
breaches that we track and we put all

799
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,449
this metadata on it and we're so trying

800
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:55,360
to track like specific vulnerabilities

801
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:57,640
to an actual breach so we can do more

802
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,250
modeling especially the cyber insurance

803
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,520
space all the actuarial z-- loved to do

804
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,440
modeling it is such hard data to get and

805
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,720
the people that can get that data like

806
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,070
Verizon right with their dbi reports

807
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,420
they can't really tell you anything they

808
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,649
can't tell you the specific

809
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,300
organizations or tie it back

810
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:15,040
unfortunately so there's some really

811
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,230
great work that other organizations do

812
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,639
that can get deeper whereas we're a

813
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,110

814
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,060
hell of a lot more but we weren't on

817
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,399
