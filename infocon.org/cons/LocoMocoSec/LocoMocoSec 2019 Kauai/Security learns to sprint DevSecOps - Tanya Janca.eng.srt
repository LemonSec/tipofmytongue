1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,048
so I'm gonna talk about today how

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,379
security people fit into DevOps because

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:10,170
we belong there and how it is our job to

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,690
enable dev and ops or DevOps engineers

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,009
to do their jobs securely as our job to

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,890
support them and make their lives

7
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,350
awesome and more secure yes let's do

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,270
this ok so what are we going to Aurum

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,460
pressing the button and pressing the

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,650
button I know I'm far but I'm not that

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,650
far oh come on

12
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:36,329
alright I had a joke come on I don't

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,969
know what to do here okay so everyone

14
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,129
pretend that that was funny and then I'm

15
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,739
just gonna go like this so I'm just

16
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,468
gonna oh good the computer will just

17
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,410
there we go okay let's see this okay so

18
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,090
at loco moco SEC these slides are online

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,640
they're not gonna have the cute images

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,670
of local moco SEC I'm sorry okay so as

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,859
we saw from this morning with Daniel and

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,930
also with James we have to do seven

23
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,989
things today I'm just kidding I'm not

24
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,700
I'm not doing that no I'm not doing that

25
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,679
right that would be really funny if I

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,150
did like seven instead of the 21 I'm

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,710
gonna do that's okay

28
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,320
okay so what are we really going to talk

29
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,789
about we're gonna talk about DevOps and

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,710
security becoming a part of DevOps and

31
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,049
in that creating devstack ops

32
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,970
I know that a lot of you are like if you

33
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,740
just do DevOps properly that there will

34
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,200
be security as part of DevOps and I

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,449
agree and as soon as everyone that does

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,049
DevOps starts doing that I promise to

37
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,420
stop saying this okay so how many people

38
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,509
have seen this slide before magical

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,790
rainbow poop that's not how I feel about

40
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,659
DevOps that's not how I feel I feel like

41
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,729
this right I feel like we as security

42
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,590
people are like giving them tools and

43
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,119
assisting them and teaching them and

44
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,040
supporting them while they poop their

45
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,170
magic rainbows we don't want to stop

46
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,229
that we want to help them do it securely

47
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,540
right so this is my view of DevOps and I

48
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,700
know that some of you don't agree yet

49
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,420
but hopefully by the next 45 minutes you

50
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:07,950
will okay okay so I'm Tanya Jenkin

51
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:10,470
sometimes I like punk rock and so on the

52
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,780
internet I'm she hacks purple and we do

53
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,120
these slides to try to show you that we

54
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,709
are

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,390
super qualified to give the talk that

56
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:18,250
we're doing just so you know that's why

57
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,379
speakers do it not because we want to

58
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,970
talk about ourselves so I work for this

59
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:25,359
little startup that you might have heard

60
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:28,420
of right we do all sorts of cool stuff

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,549
and I have the weirdest job to ever I'm

62
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,069
an advocate what does that mean

63
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:34,540
so I made a whole slide to explain it

64
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,548
but basically I get to do cool stuff

65
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,989
like this and I get to work on my

66
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,120
open-source project and make proof of

67
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:42,010
concepts and just share everything I do

68
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,930
at the community which since I was

69
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,140
already doing that before I started it's

70
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,730
pretty cool they're giving me money now

71
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,890
so I'm totally obsessed with OAuth

72
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,238
no matter what like no matter what you

73
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,149
see me talk about I'll somehow we've

74
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,190
lost in it like I can't help it and then

75
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,409
I also like so we used to be called

76
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,390
whist but now we're called woh SEC

77
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:02,739
because it rhymed with another women's

78
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,958
group and then everyone just kept

79
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:09,879
confusing us and it made them sad face

80
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,739
so I've been coding a long time and I

81
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:13,209
think I'm older than most people think

82
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:15,489
so just add ten to whatever you're

83
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,400
thinking you're probably right and so

84
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:20,620
all this society I do these things

85
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,880
because I as a software developer a long

86
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,130
time and I felt like the way it's so

87
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,810
hard to make secure software it's so

88
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,519
hard like you saw all of these talks

89
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,799
leading up to this talk of like all the

90
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,040
crazy things they're doing like how

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,470
complicated CSP is and how complex like

92
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,388
all the stuff that over was doing like

93
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,980
with the so many different levels and

94
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:43,389
it's just like it's so hard for software

95
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,209
developers to try to get through this

96
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,040
and so I started doing this to try to

97
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,889
help make it easier and with that

98
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,900
there's lots about Tonya and instead

99
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:55,690
let's talk about dev set-offs yes

100
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,340
okay so first I'm gonna give you a brief

101
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,840
overview of what app SEC is you're like

102
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,340
I'm a knapsack conference Tanya I

103
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,910
already know everything you have to say

104
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,790
good okay so what is app sec so this is

105
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,948
my definition every single thing you do

106
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,290
to improve the security of your software

107
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:13,810
is at SEC right so if you're doing a

108
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,779
secure code review awesome if you are

109
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,180
upgrading like a third party component

110
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,219
because you know it's insecure awesome

111
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,349
if you're just like grabbing through

112
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,150
your source code for things that you

113
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:26,159
found in your

114
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,750
fantastic you might not think like oh

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,570
that's important that's important and

116
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,870
that's AB sex oh thank you okay oh yeah

117
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:36,330
I said that so AB sex a problem you

118
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,419
probably know this but did you know so

119
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:42,180
in the Verizon breach report 2016 2017

120
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:44,820
and 2018 we are the winners again of

121
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,669
poor web application security causing

122
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,190
number one cause it breaches over and

123
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:56,210
over by a lot like C how one of them is

124
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:58,320
way longer than the other that's the

125
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,320
estimate that it's between like twenty

126
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,270
six to forty percent of the breaches are

127
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,159
caused by this but if you look at your

128
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,280
budget for security better believe it

129
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,470
that's not how much it's getting okay

130
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,359
okay one more thing so it's not covered

131
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,280
in schools very often this is starting

132
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,590
to change a little bit but mostly when

133
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,880
they teach software developers stuff

134
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,198
about security they're like I know what

135
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,090
we'll do we'll teach them where our back

136
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,770
means which is really important you

137
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,570
should know that and like how access

138
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,669
control works very important you should

139
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,260
know that that is not apps ech it could

140
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:30,210
be part of your design of your app but

141
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,510
it's like this one small you there's so

142
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,919
much more you need to know and imagine

143
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,289
if you're going to learn to be an

144
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,820
electrician right and then they're like

145
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:40,530
oh by the way just like twist those

146
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,450
wires into the wall and then just push

147
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,299
them in I'm sure it'll be fine houses

148
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,740
rarely burn down because of it right no

149
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,510
they teach you how to do it safely and

150
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,780
securely and in school we are teaching

151
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:53,340
people first hello world right second

152
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,469
thing that they teach you ask the

153
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,789
person's name take it from them store

154
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,919
and then push it out to the screen

155
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:01,680
cross-site scripting awesome number two

156
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:04,229
lesson and and why aren't we teaching

157
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,030
after that like but sometimes users are

158
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:08,070
bad right and so this is the thing that

159
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:11,880
upsets me because university costs a lot

160
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:15,180
in my country also see her see how she's

161
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:18,180
alone and sad that that is me whenever

162
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,060
except for a mic so at my startup that I

163
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,770
work at

164
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,520
so usually like so we saw this before in

165
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:28,979
James's kick-ass keno but it's true I've

166
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,870
never had such good numbers as this so

167
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,110
I'm that woman that's alone that's sad

168
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,370
with her computer in the data center I

169
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,660
have had it where it's like four hundred

170
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,140
developers to me

171
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,750
I've had it 2,000 developers to me and

172
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,300
if you can imagine my inbox it was like

173
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,160
someone took a cup and then they put a

174
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,840
fire hose aimed at it and then someone

175
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,250
left for a year and came back and then

176
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,599
that's what looked like every morning

177
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,250
so you started messaging me on like

178
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,020
LinkedIn on Twitter and all these other

179
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,400
places and people would like come by my

180
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,109
desk and I'm like I'm just gonna hide in

181
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,900
this other person's desk and it I

182
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,960
couldn't work harder anymore I had to

183
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,640
work smarter so oh and I'm adding my

184
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,190
cute little guys in here so I'm gonna

185
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,990
come this way my friend made me this for

186
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,390
when I feel passive-aggressive how do I

187
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,700
yeah so see how there's like dinosaurs

188
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,400
and they're frolicking and a waterfall

189
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,200
so if someone does things that I feel

190
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,320
are like really old sometimes I send the

191
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,900
mess and I'm like you're that guy but

192
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,820
water folded in waterfall didn't work

193
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,190
really well like something like only 25

194
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,920
to 30 percent of projects were actually

195
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,600
successful and waterfall and the

196
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,090
accompanying security model which I

197
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,880
affectionately call stop while we do

198
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:41,130
some security it's like you would never

199
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,960
finish the like certification and

200
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,719
assessment process or accreditation or

201
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,370
whatever like all of those things I felt

202
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,050
like the security team was like enemy

203
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,640
number one when I as a software

204
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:55,440
developer okay so what is dev SEC ops

205
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,270
it's performing app SEC and a devops

206
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,010
environment so this is where I as a

207
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,409
security person fit into DevOps like

208
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:05,099
what am I supposed to do my friend Imran

209
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,570
said that he's cool dude okay so first

210
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,220
I'm going to so now we're done the

211
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,700
review of you knew that all of your oh

212
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,470
you all already knew so now I'm going to

213
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,909
explain what DevOps is according to the

214
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,340
DevOps handbook because that's my

215
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,110
favorite definition then we're gonna go

216
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,630
through each one of the three ways of

217
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,780
DevOps and then we're gonna talk about a

218
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:27,750
whole bunch of ideas like tactics like

219
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:31,229
things you can go do physically well

220
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,460
with your keyboard so then you can go do

221
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,890
them when you get back to your office

222
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,530
okay all the things I'm going to show

223
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,360
you are things you could actually do and

224
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:41,459
a bunch of them I've actually done them

225
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,140
in little videos with my friends Nancy

226
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,310
and Francisca and Nicole Nancy's here

227
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,439
somewhere I don't know where she is but

228
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,500
anyway she

229
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,399
and we make videos of us actually doing

230
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,870
these things so if there's something

231
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,279
you're like that's cool there probably a

232
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,480
video of us being nerdy and actually

233
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:59,120
doing it so that you can follow through

234
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:00,800
so take notes okay what is DevOps okay

235
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,269
so what are the main goals of DevOps I

236
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,680
know you're not gonna answer me because

237
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:05,060
there's too many people in this room if

238
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,469
you were closer like there's no one on

239
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:11,060
the front row to pick on I see you there

240
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:14,089
the main goals of DevOps are threefold

241
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,279
right we want to get to market faster

242
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:18,769
because we want money we want to have

243
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:21,199
better resiliency like a tougher product

244
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:23,569
that does not fall down and we also want

245
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:25,969
to make sure that we have we're

246
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:27,709
deploying often with little or smaller

247
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,019
deployments so that we have again so

248
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:31,609
that it's more solid right so I bet

249
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:33,050
you're thinking that's nice those are

250
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,860
business reasons but those are security

251
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:39,829
reasons that I like DevOps okay improve

252
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,920
deployment frequencies this is how I

253
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:44,899
feel about this this means you can you

254
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,839
can fix my security emergency right now

255
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:50,079
I want you to fix it right now not in

256
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,920
eight my used to work somewhere and the

257
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:57,138
emergency release cycle was four months

258
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:01,870
emergency we had a 16 months release

259
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:03,920
cycles her features and I was like and

260
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,589
obviously everything was written in

261
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,160
struts all different versions oh don't

262
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:12,529
worry we didn't standardize but like

263
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,209
that makes fixing security emergencies

264
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,040
impossible so DevOps means you can

265
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:18,319
actually get stuff fixed in a reasonable

266
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,439
amount of time the next thing is is

267
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:23,589
lower failure rates okay so I feel like

268
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:27,290
security people should like this

269
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:29,059
resiliency as the DevOps call it who

270
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,069
cares seen this everyone knows this off

271
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:32,870
by hurt right okay now all the hands go

272
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:33,880
up so now I'm gonna tell you it's your

273
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,649
fault

274
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,380
so confidentiality and integrity and

275
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:41,449
availability is the mandate of every

276
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,759
security team this is why we get paid we

277
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:46,910
get paid to protect these things your

278
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,600
systems and your data as they relate to

279
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,910
these things

280
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,100
this is drilled into security people

281
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,300
that know developers have ever seen this

282
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,709
when I give this talk to developers

283
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,990
they're all like that's where there's

284
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:57,880
triangle there

285
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,200
the fact that they don't already know

286
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,970
this that they're not topless in

287
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,190
computer science like this is why I come

288
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,320
to her office and hassle you this is why

289
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:08,590
I'm upset because these aren't in line

290
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:12,040
okay so if we go back here resiliency

291
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:15,160
what is resiliency mean it means the

292
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,050
availability in CIA if your app is super

293
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,780
tough as nails no one can knock it down

294
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:22,780
it's always available that's a big plus

295
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:25,199
in computer security terms ok next

296
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,610
faster time-to-market

297
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,800
how does this fit in for security why

298
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:34,180
does security care I'm seeing someone go

299
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:37,150
like this ok so there's no security team

300
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:40,390
if there's no business and it is in my

301
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:42,459
interest to be employed so if I am the

302
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,830
risk to availability if I am doing all

303
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,880
these things

304
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,890
stopping the people from getting their

305
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,710
business then then this means I am the

306
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:53,590
risk to our product right and so faster

307
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,090
time-to-market matters to security

308
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,070
because security doesn't win if the

309
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,870
business doesn't win it is our job to

310
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,240
enable them to get business done

311
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:07,510
securely if we make it so they can't get

312
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:09,790
anything done ok so this is my

313
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,680
compliment DevOps is the best thing to

314
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,349
happen to application security since Oh

315
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,689
ASP yeah I said that I quote myself mark

316
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,220
Miller taught me that it seems more

317
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:22,030
impressive if you're quoting something

318
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:24,060
right I am totally obsessed with ojas

319
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,470
we've had like a five-year love affair I

320
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,150
do a lot of things within that community

321
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,460
and that community matters to me a lot

322
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,800
but I really think that if security gets

323
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,780
on board with DevOps and gets in there

324
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,060
as opposed to standing on the outside

325
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,329
like this could be like a renaissance

326
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:43,000
for security of software ok so now I

327
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:47,400
want to talk about DevOps and the three

328
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,450
ways who here feels sleepy after lunch

329
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,010
ok because like you're thinking like

330
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,360
slightly not that responsive I'm gonna

331
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:56,830
make you put your hands up later I'm

332
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:59,170
sorry I mean ok three ways so does

333
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:01,810
anyone dare tell me one of the three

334
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,130
ways I have a candy for you if you do

335
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,339
they're like we can get candies from you

336
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:08,270
anytime Tonya

337
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,270
okay I'm gonna tell you the three ways

338
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,199
yeah the audience is too big it's too

339
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:19,590
big okay so the first way is making sure

340
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,020
the entire system is fast emphasizing

341
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,700
the whole system not just your part so

342
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,170
let's say I speed up my part so it's

343
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,730
really fast but there's some other thing

344
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,599
that everyone else is waiting on still

345
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:33,270
and I didn't work on that my work does

346
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,130
not count or it doesn't help really so

347
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,870
instead if I see my parts already really

348
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,610
good and someone else's part is awful

349
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,080
what I should do is put my part down

350
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,670
tell my bosses what's happening I should

351
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,650
go over and help them so the entire

352
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:46,500
system is faster so that's the first way

353
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:50,550
making things fast the next way oh wait

354
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:52,830
no no no go back yes

355
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,859
the second way is King feedback right

356
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:59,790
away King feedback the whole way through

357
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:02,730
okay waterfall is basically like I can't

358
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,410
hear you I'm just gonna wait till the

359
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,400
very end to talk to anyone and see if

360
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,650
I'm doing the right thing

361
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,390
DevOps is the antithesis of that it's

362
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,400
about getting feedback as soon as

363
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,480
humanly possible regularly so you're

364
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,850
always making sure you're on the right

365
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,670
course and the third way of the three

366
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:20,010
ways is continuous learning and

367
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:23,400
experimentation and risk-taking so make

368
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:25,200
a big mess clean it up keep moving this

369
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,970
can be you taking a course as can be you

370
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,130
coming here this can be you making a

371
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,870
proof of concept and seeing how this

372
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:34,590
works it could be you watching the

373
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,850
videos again from this conference that

374
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,080
specifically stood out to you is

375
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,060
something that might help you at work

376
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,970
right and continuous learning it's

377
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,829
really important and who here has

378
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,270
someone in their office or has ever

379
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,370
worked with someone where they haven't

380
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,500
gone on training in like five plus years

381
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,780
and they're like this senior tech that's

382
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,550
super bitter and they're like I can't go

383
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,470
on trainings if I'm it's one day at work

384
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,180
everything's gonna burn to the ground

385
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,010
yeah that's cuz you ever been on

386
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,370
training in like 10 years like you don't

387
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:03,720
know anything so I I feel that the three

388
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,640
ways are really important for making

389
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,500
good software they feel they're really

390
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,010
important for security and here's why

391
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:13,230
okay one so let's emphasize the security

392
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,630
of the entire system so I like to walk

393
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,930
around a lot and release

394
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,310
worry about this is it okay I'm not

395
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,560
breaking anything I heard like some

396
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,599
sounds like microphone sounds it's fine

397
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:27,550
okay good okay so we're gonna emphasize

398
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:32,480
the entire system efficiency speed so

399
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:34,069
right to left or this amazing I feel

400
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,660
like my animations are getting really

401
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:40,010
good and at some point I'm gonna have to

402
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,670
do like professionals just kidding but

403
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,680
you get the picture

404
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:45,410
right like so if you're doing DevOps

405
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,829
you're doing agile you're doing you're

406
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,930
doing fragile you're doing waterfall or

407
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,150
water fail you know what I mean but like

408
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,930
no matter what you need requirements you

409
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,640
actually need to know what you're

410
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,290
building you need to actually design

411
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,390
make a plan that you do the fun part

412
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,560
gets code things then you test things

413
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,420
hopefully you've been testing things

414
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,849
actually like a lot sooner than that and

415
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,770
then you release it and you monitor it

416
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,690
and you hope everything goes well

417
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,790
and I have other talks about that but

418
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,960
let's just focus on this okay so we want

419
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:16,010
to go fast we're going right to left

420
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,500
left that's right you know what I mean

421
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:21,020
okay so what does this mean for Devon

422
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,760
ops right so this talk I realize that

423
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,100
most of you are security folk but it

424
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,390
matters to you what it means to Devon

425
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,250
ops because if you don't know how to

426
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:31,699
explain what you need from them we are

427
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:33,620
lost so it means we need their help in

428
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,660
tuning our tools so that we don't break

429
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,210
everything and make their life hell

430
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:41,120
right it means that we want them to

431
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:43,700
reuse code that we know is good and not

432
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,800
use code that we know is bad right and

433
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,200
we can guide them on this it means that

434
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,510
we want to use up-to-date images or if

435
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,340
you're gonna do containers like ensure

436
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,080
your settings are good follow best

437
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,540
practices which is a thing we can guide

438
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,550
them in and support them in it means we

439
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,349
need them to actually make unit tests so

440
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,880
that we can make malicious unit tests

441
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:05,540
because that's what they're for right

442
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,490
and and it means security bugs need to

443
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:11,300
start to break the build big security

444
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:13,730
bugs not little ones but we okay so who

445
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,220
who here has ever broken a build and

446
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,630
then been really unpopular oh really

447
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,540
you're all perfect that's good okay

448
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,130
there's some truth tellers here I had my

449
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,119
friend break my build like the night

450
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,159
before I was gonna give this big talk

451
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,958
it's just like ah you know what I did I

452
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:31,440
turned off all the security stuff so I

453
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,150
could get it out so I feel developers

454
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,580
pain okay but this talk is for security

455
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,039
people oh this is the photo slide this

456
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,210
talk will have seven pictures slides so

457
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,340
you could just take a picture and not

458
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:43,309
take notes if you want to because I've

459
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,600
heard if you put words on the screen

460
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:48,059
while you're talking everyone just reads

461
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,370
so I have pictures of women of color

462
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:52,049
doing tech instead so you could just

463
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,689
like appreciate their awesomeness and

464
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:57,330
how they're like being super capable and

465
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,250
like getting all the crap done and

466
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,340
hopefully listen okay so this is number

467
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:04,260
one there's gonna be seven okay so what

468
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,120
else does this mean for security it

469
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,740
means we want to ensure okay so this is

470
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,360
the number one rule make sure Devon ops

471
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,149
aren't constantly waiting for you you

472
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,279
cannot be the bottleneck this means you

473
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:16,918
cannot break the build unless it's a

474
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,299
real emergency right it means that for

475
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,850
instance you're not gonna turn on like a

476
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:22,230
static code analysis tool and put it in

477
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,480
the build and have it scan everything

478
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,860
like on a regular day and it's just like

479
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,649
takes nine hours to run and you're like

480
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,178
oh whoa you will not get invited to any

481
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,399
of the parties if you do this and it's

482
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:33,929
important it's important to be a part of

483
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:36,120
your team and be invited to the parties

484
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:37,620
I have worked places where when I got

485
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,418
there the developers would actually send

486
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,029
the effort to us in emails because they

487
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:43,590
hated the security team so much and it

488
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:44,640
only took me a few weeks to realize it

489
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,760
was all our fault

490
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,190
so it's really important and we need to

491
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,250
make processes that actually work right

492
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:54,659
that's so important I remember so I

493
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,990
worked somewhere and they're bringing in

494
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:59,029
something called SAA like security

495
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,649
accreditation and certification or

496
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:04,770
whatever cares what stood for it didn't

497
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:07,139
work like auditors can do a good job

498
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,549
they were not and I was like well when

499
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,590
does it finish like Oh none of them ever

500
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:15,179
finish we never actually like finished

501
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:16,678
them I'm like okay so that's not cool so

502
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:19,649
this means that we need to learn to do

503
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,390
sprints if developers are doing Sprint's

504
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:23,879
right so we need to break our stuff up

505
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,679
into smaller activities so we can get

506
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,230
things done faster which I'll talk about

507
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,549
in more detail in a second but mostly I

508
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,049
just want you to take away from this

509
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:33,299
slide is that we can't just slow people

510
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:36,780
down unless there's a really really good

511
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:38,430
reason and we need processes that work

512
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,129
so next what else does this mean for

513
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:43,800
security breaking security activities

514
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,480
into smaller pieces okay so there's a

515
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,970
lot of options for this so static code

516
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,290
analysis that takes a long time I have

517
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,060
seen it where it takes like three days

518
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:56,129
to run and then it has this 10,000 page

519
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:57,960
report no you can't hand off a 10,000 or

520
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,940
even 1,000 or even a hundred page report

521
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,410
to a developer because that's like

522
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,790
giving them a big picture of you giving

523
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,400
them the middle finger that is not

524
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:08,040
helpful right instead let's just look

525
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,660
for a one bug class okay so let's just

526
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,760
look for injection vulnerabilities and

527
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,350
then again in the next sprint let's look

528
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,510
for a different one and let's try to

529
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,129
knock out one bug class at a time or if

530
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:19,530
you're doing a pen test for instance

531
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,270
like maybe that will be a copy of the

532
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:23,550
app that you're doing it on well people

533
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,560
can still continue to develop and you

534
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,540
take those tests and then you add them

535
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,730
to unit tests like the findings of your

536
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,350
of your pen test like I had some things

537
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,060
in to look for those things to make sure

538
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:36,179
that the developer that made that

539
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,679
mistake doesn't make it again it's

540
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,440
really really important that you don't

541
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,820
create a process that does not allow

542
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,470
anyone to get their job done because

543
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,030
then you are enemy number one of the

544
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,040
business and of the developers and the

545
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:51,030
ops folk okay

546
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:54,470
next yeah so this is another photo slide

547
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:58,139
Oh another thing here the last one is

548
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:00,810
providing secure coding templates so a

549
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,580
code repository is like a woman's purse

550
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,950
you do not put your hand in it without

551
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,510
permission okay so if you're a security

552
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,650
person you don't just go back barge in

553
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,180
there and start doing things because

554
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,980
you'll get locked out really quickly

555
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,590
instead you want to ask first for read

556
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,900
access so that you can scan it but then

557
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,520
you want to talk to the team and see if

558
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,680
you can find things that can be reused

559
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,570
right I worked at a place where we made

560
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,520
custom software for everyone and every

561
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:26,520
single person wanted a username and

562
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,470
login type of screen so we had someone

563
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,540
come in and just hack the crap out of it

564
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:32,430
and then we all reuse that and we would

565
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,980
just retest the template every time and

566
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,080
then we would proliferate it amongst the

567
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,210
team whatever changes were required this

568
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,040
saved tons of time and you know upped

569
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,440
our security really quickly right so

570
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,330
that last one on that side well you all

571
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,950
took the picture okay so what else does

572
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,300
this mean for security I have a lot of

573
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,370
slides that are mostly just for security

574
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,220
there's gonna be a lot of ideas and here

575
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:56,939
and again I'm sorry I'm going like

576
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,559
throwing so much at you but these slides

577
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,830
are available so you can look through

578
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,299
them again and again I'm on the internet

579
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,100
and I have videos and all sorts of

580
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:07,679
things please don't feel over who feels

581
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,699
overwhelmed at this point okay

582
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,710
everyone's great awesome

583
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,120
yes I'm wearing for nothing good okay so

584
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,980
another thing that I think is really

585
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,139
cool is so you have like the main

586
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,970
pipeline that pushes to prod right and

587
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,289
let's say that you know the teams are

588
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,580
like you know you're allowed doing this

589
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:22,679
mini test you're allowed this many

590
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,539
minutes of slowing us down but you can't

591
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,190
do all the tests you want so instead

592
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:28,440
what you could do is create a parallel

593
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,880
pipeline that just has like every

594
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,490
security test that you could ever dream

595
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,399
of and then you have that run Friday

596
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:37,230
nights so you are not annoying anyone

597
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:39,360
and it goes nowhere it doesn't publish

598
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,500
it just goes off into nowhere and then

599
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,090
you can sit there and look through the

600
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,100
static code analysis results or you can

601
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:46,080
look at the dynamic application security

602
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,939
testing results and then you can make

603
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,730
sure none of them are false positives so

604
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,980
that you are not under the gun for time

605
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,480
and that you also haven't like slowed

606
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,669
anyone down or annoyed the crap out of

607
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,679
anyone don't want to make enemies like

608
00:22:56,669 --> 00:23:03,240
James said earlier okay so more on this

609
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,100
you can code your own libraries for your

610
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,409
specific business needs this is a more

611
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,149
advanced activity don't start here but

612
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:10,980
as you saw earlier from for instance

613
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:12,418
Netflix with their chaos monkey and

614
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,090
their repo kid which we'll talk about

615
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,830
later like they saw things that were a

616
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,299
whole and there wasn't a tool or

617
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,770
something that they could go get so they

618
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:22,740
made their own cuz that the special

619
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:24,570
circumstance right you can do this too

620
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,130
if everyone on the security team knows

621
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,870
how to code or just some of you or

622
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,520
you've made good friends with some

623
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:31,049
developers like this is the thing that

624
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,460
you can actually accomplish which is

625
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:34,260
kind of awesome

626
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,000
basically you just want to help the

627
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:39,120
developers and the ops people get their

628
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,799
jobs done as quickly and securely as

629
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,500
possible so you can be creative

630
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,879
everything counts don't feel like if you

631
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,380
didn't see it and one of the slides here

632
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,029
today that you can't go off and do it

633
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,860
and it might not be completely awesome

634
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:54,029
and if you do tell us because we want to

635
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:57,899
know okay so here are more things that

636
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:58,980
you can add for your photo slide I want

637
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:01,639
to emphasize you don't have to do a

638
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,840
hundred percent of the work yourself

639
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,600
right so its developers

640
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,549
jobs to write most of the code so you're

641
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,168
not expected to go in and code every

642
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:11,700
single part of the app that has to do

643
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:14,190
with security because you will never get

644
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,409
things done and it won't scale right so

645
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,669
when you see these things try not to

646
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:21,960
have a panic attack

647
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:24,600
good okay all right so now I want to

648
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,250
talk about faster feedback I want to

649
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,039
know immediately if stuff is wrong I

650
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:31,350
don't want my you know colleague to tell

651
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,390
me three weeks later like no one likes

652
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,709
your suggestions so no one implemented

653
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:38,940
it they all just nodded because you're

654
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:41,340
scary that's not helpful to me so what

655
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,490
does this so amazing graphics again you

656
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:46,678
can see I'm gonna work for Pixar next

657
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:48,720
see how we're going left so we call this

658
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,909
pushing left insecurity is my favorite

659
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,159
thing so I used to only be invited here

660
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:55,440
I did pen testing and I would come here

661
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,960
or instant response I did so much work

662
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,669
here that sucks

663
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,529
I'm like you know why you're inviting me

664
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:03,419
here because you didn't let me give you

665
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:05,010
any security requirements because no one

666
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,799
looked at your design and said oh that

667
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:09,840
looks awful like no like I is just

668
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:11,100
invisible so I want to start at the

669
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,840
beginning I want to be there the whole

670
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,240
way through so that's what pushing left

671
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,520
is and security but this applies to

672
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,490
every single type of bug as we will see

673
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,090
okay next button okay so this is the

674
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:28,110
management slide see take a picture show

675
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:31,740
your boss it costs exponentially more

676
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:34,020
the later you wait to fix a bug or the

677
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,600
later you find it I mean like I had a

678
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:39,690
developer once tell me so we hired to

679
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:42,120
secure code review dudes and two people

680
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:45,120
to come do pen testing and the fourth

681
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:48,209
person found a bug and he the developer

682
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,010
was so awesome he was like yeah I knew

683
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,390
about that the whole time I was waiting

684
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:55,408
to see if any of them would catch it and

685
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:57,210
I was just like if you know hope I had a

686
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:58,260
bug you should tell me and he's like I

687
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,419
just wanted to see if any of them would

688
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,539
get it and just like okay so I clearly

689
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,730
need to educate my staff more right so

690
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:07,470
show this to your boss and tell him

691
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,289
that's why you need to push left okay

692
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:12,510
next okay so now what else does this

693
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:15,149
mean for dev and ops right if we're

694
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,950
gonna get feedback quickly what does it

695
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:18,560
mean well

696
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:22,040
please tell us what you're thinking and

697
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,659
then we need to listen and take action

698
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,730
so I'm gonna tell you a little story

699
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,250
that is not my story this is a Netflix

700
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,350
story that asketh told me about she's

701
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:33,050
this awesome human being that leads the

702
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:35,260
app sect team at Netflix and so they

703
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,580
started this thing called repo man

704
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,560
because you know they have a billion

705
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,570
micro services and they wanted to do

706
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,919
least privilege right they didn't want

707
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,090
all of them to have tons of privileges

708
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,610
they didn't need because that's how you

709
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,530
stop like attackers if they get in if

710
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,719
there's almost no privileges then they

711
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,190
can do less damage so they made this

712
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,930
thing repo man or taking away

713
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,730
permissions and they broke so much stuff

714
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:57,710
people stopped inviting them to parties

715
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:00,950
and social outings this is not good so

716
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:04,000
then they listened and then they took it

717
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:09,140
down and then I came out with repo kid

718
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,610
which is like less aggressive so instead

719
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,350
what it would do is it would watch a new

720
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,479
instance and it would sit there watch

721
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,590
and you know it had a base set of

722
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,390
permissions but then it would start

723
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,679
pulling away permissions if they hadn't

724
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,930
been used and slowly pull away

725
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:24,710
permissions and they pulled off around

726
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:26,420
like 30 or 70% of the permissions on all

727
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,430
the different types of services they had

728
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,230
because they finally could see what

729
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,540
least privilege actually was and not

730
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:34,700
burn everything down and this was

731
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:37,399
because the developers actually shared

732
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,200
with them their and then they actually

733
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,990
listened so the for everyone in this

734
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,140
room listen it's really important ok

735
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:47,030
also another thing we want as we need

736
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,290
their participation when we do security

737
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,879
activities so if we give security

738
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:52,550
training it'd be awesome if they showed

739
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,570
up right and I don't mean like don't

740
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:56,540
click that link

741
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:58,850
I mean don't click stuff but I mean if

742
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:02,000
we offer secure coding or secure design

743
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:04,610
or threat modeling training please come

744
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,670
if there's an incident please don't just

745
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:09,889
leave if it's your app that we are that

746
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:11,570
we are investigating I was investigating

747
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,340
an incident like a live incident like

748
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:16,310
we're being attacked at the moment and

749
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,750
like I went into stuff and I came back

750
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:19,610
and I was talking the developer and then

751
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,320
I came back and then I went to him and

752
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,550
he had left because it was the end of

753
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,710
the day for him and he needed to catch

754
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:26,710
his bus I was just sick

755
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,620
so we we need them to participate that's

756
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:36,980
what we need okay so but what does this

757
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:41,000
mean for security so first of all we

758
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:42,890
want to push left right do I do I need

759
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,870
to cuz I have I'm wondering how much

760
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,640
time I have and if I should like go no

761
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,679
I'm not gonna tell you the story I can

762
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,870
tell you a story after but it's like an

763
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,970
analogy of building a house and I'm

764
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:56,149
already telling it so I might as well

765
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:57,650
but like if you if you tell like if you

766
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:00,050
tell someone to change the design

767
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,400
drastically right near the end it's

768
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:04,190
gonna cost you a fortune it's not going

769
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,230
to be great oh do I have five minutes is

770
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:08,390
that what you're telling me oh wow okay

771
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,280
so anyway it means a lot of things for

772
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:13,250
security and I could have sworn that I

773
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,820
had 45 minutes so I'm gonna rush just go

774
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,550
okay

775
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,889
so it also means we need to tune the

776
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:20,300
tools we need to listen to them we can't

777
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,130
have a tool that just breaks everything

778
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,780
I have worked so many places where that

779
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,730
like the security people put in a tool

780
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,960
it shatters everything and then the

781
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:33,140
developers are complaining and they're

782
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:36,410
like tough no okay next okay this is a

783
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:38,360
side tangent so my friend Clint he can't

784
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:40,100
just ignore the whole slide except this

785
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,979
he wrote this rapper that went around

786
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:45,169
this old function so that would

787
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,060
immediately rename itself so there was

788
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:48,560
very clear immediately that people

789
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,690
should not use this and he said the

790
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,399
usage of this went down instantaneously

791
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,840
like no one was using it and then the

792
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,460
very few people that we're using it they

793
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,220
went and interviewed them and asked them

794
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:03,350
why they didn't go yell at them they

795
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:03,620
asks them in a nice way okay one more

796
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:07,600
thing

797
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:10,550
oh wait wait no no back okay sorry I'm

798
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,459
so actually I already told this story so

799
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:15,050
nevermind that's fine but the the point

800
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,570
is is that it's really important that

801
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,070
one we break the build if there's a real

802
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,389
secure this is like a thing I'm going to

803
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,679
repeat a bunch of times because if you

804
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,540
don't break the build when there's a

805
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:27,920
secure serious security problem you're

806
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:29,659
in trouble okay next I would like to

807
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,070
suggest that if your developers are

808
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,420
doing a lot of unit tests that you can

809
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:35,060
take those tests and turn them into

810
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:37,880
negative unit tests or what I like to

811
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,179
call regressive security testing so you

812
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,680
take their tests the

813
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,960
are already doing that already work and

814
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,220
then you add payloads into them what

815
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,560
this means is every time they run their

816
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,270
unit tests you get a whole bunch of

817
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,159
testing done for you and if you have a

818
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:52,170
penetration test done we're all sorts of

819
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,910
if you have a bug bounty you add these

820
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:55,260
to the unit test and that means before

821
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,040
even gets to the pipeline it's had

822
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:02,040
hundreds if not thousands of tests yes

823
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:03,870
and another thing okay we want to invite

824
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,670
Devon ops to participate in our

825
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:08,070
activities right if there's an incident

826
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:09,270
they should come if there's training

827
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:12,000
they should come if there's threat

828
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:13,980
modeling you should come we need their

829
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,750
opinion because they are the most evil

830
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,610
developers are all hackers they just

831
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,960
don't know yet no one told them when I

832
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,040
was a developer I did all sorts of

833
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,930
hacking a little time and did not

834
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,850
realize but evil guys doing I was like

835
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,950
oh I just like paused the debugger and

836
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,389
then I copy out the password and I just

837
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,760
log into prod and change the things I

838
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,320
want and they're just like what mike and

839
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,520
they're like does everyone on your team

840
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,020
know that I'm like if they're smart

841
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,370
enough to they're not smart enough to do

842
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,230
that they're now my dev team then they

843
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:41,129
were dumb dumb

844
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:42,720
my boss is just like you anyway and we

845
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,460
should try to talk them into security

846
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,080
sprints where you fix all the security

847
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,580
problems that's not where you fix all

848
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:53,070
the things in the backlog you fix our

849
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:54,510
stuff okay one more thing on this I am a

850
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:56,520
big fan of metrics and measuring

851
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:58,379
everything under the Sun so if you can

852
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,810
take a list of all of the things you've

853
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,550
seen the most often and give it to the

854
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:05,070
developers tell them these are a problem

855
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:06,930
right so everywhere I work I ask

856
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,310
immediately or if I consult what are the

857
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,810
three things you've got the most of in

858
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:12,060
your tests and two of them are always

859
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:14,399
they're allergic to security headers and

860
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,960
also cross-site scripting is prolific

861
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,090
and then the third one's always

862
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,440
something really weird there is like

863
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,449
there's this one developer doing this

864
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,820
one crazy thing right and once you find

865
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:26,580
out who that is it's okay again right

866
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:28,889
and so use the metrics to share with the

867
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:31,169
developers okay and then create unit

868
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:33,060
tests out of those things okay so this

869
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,500
is slide number five I feel like I

870
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:37,260
really got a rush this

871
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,570
and I'm really sorry okay so continuous

872
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,810
learning this means learning all the

873
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:44,010
time

874
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:45,600
so for Devon ops oops nope second for

875
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:48,480
Devon ops this means if we offer

876
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,159
training they should accept it and I

877
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,410
want you to offer them training

878
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,690
right if there's an incident tell them

879
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:56,580
what happened how it like how'd it like

880
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:58,080
after its cleaned up after it's fixed

881
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,250
rate if there's like a cool new thing

882
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,530
that you want them to use give them

883
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:08,250
training don't make them pay for it um

884
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:10,290
it also means that we definitely want to

885
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:12,600
create as many learning lessons as

886
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,800
possible and this means that if someone

887
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,110
does something wrong we don't punish

888
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:19,230
them this means we have post-mortems to

889
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:21,600
discover what security guard was missing

890
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,220
or not security guard like what policy

891
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,010
was missing or what safeguard was

892
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,960
missing so that this happened as opposed

893
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:30,150
to it's Alice's felt or Bob's fault this

894
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,230
is really important in this in this

895
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:36,960
thing and another thing is we want to

896
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:39,930
I'm a big fan of security simulations or

897
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,490
exercises if you invite developers to

898
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:43,620
those and explain to them like this has

899
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:45,330
happened what would you do it opens

900
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,159
their eyes to a million things I had

901
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:48,419
someone from security take me on an

902
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,920
incident and then that's how I got

903
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:53,220
hooked on incident management this is a

904
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:55,440
great recruiting technique okay so what

905
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,390
else does this mean so this is this is

906
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,570
there's gonna be one more site after

907
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:02,190
this for photos but no one's taking

908
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:04,679
photos that's okay okay so what else

909
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,720
does this mean for security it means

910
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:10,409
talking about incidents after they are

911
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,480
over it means teaching developers and

912
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:14,850
ops what the output from tools actually

913
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,168
mean so I have worked places where we

914
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,279
give them a security tool but no one

915
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:19,408
knows how to use it and they don't know

916
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,760
what it means and they can't tell what

917
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:23,490
things are true positives or false

918
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,750
positives and so give them training on

919
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:27,928
these tools if you're going to give it

920
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:31,379
to them otherwise you're wasting their

921
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:34,290
time again okay and everything needs to

922
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:37,350
go into a logo everything needs to go

923
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:38,879
into a knowledgebase yeah and you should

924
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:41,339
give them training that's what this

925
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:43,168
slides about okay this is the last photo

926
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:46,169
slide and then we're going to briefly

927
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:47,940
briefly briefly talk about how you need

928
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:50,908
to have culture changer this won't work

929
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:54,899
I'm so sorry I'm overtime Jim you're

930
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:57,720
okay okay so security has to become a

931
00:34:54,899 --> 00:35:00,710
part of DevOps it's not gonna magically

932
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:03,569
happen and this means culture change so

933
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:06,480
let's celebrate security wins

934
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:08,910
right instead of us getting angry when

935
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,230
there's incidents instead like what if

936
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,879
someone passes their pen tests with

937
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,230
flying colors right what if they just

938
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,910
had a security sprint and they knocked

939
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,290
out like a hundred security bugs

940
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,790
what if they upgraded all these

941
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:19,680
frameworks that were a huge pain in the

942
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:21,029
butt but they did it and now we don't

943
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,950
have to worry about a ton of problems

944
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:29,250
right like let's celebrate um also what

945
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:30,720
if we spent time with them I worked at a

946
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,670
place where the security team was in a

947
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,980
totally other building and it's so much

948
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:37,080
easier to be rude to someone over email

949
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,450
versus if this is the person where you

950
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,130
have to like you know make coffee next

951
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:44,730
to them every morning so if you can

952
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:47,130
actually co-locate your team's the next

953
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:50,580
thing here is so I'm mentioning this

954
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:52,050
twice blameless post mortems right it's

955
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,700
really really important that we don't

956
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,470
name names this can make up her

957
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,720
management super peep because they want

958
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,609
a person to execute they want that

959
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,259
person to walk down the plank great but

960
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:03,060
that doesn't really help look unless

961
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,500
this person has had training three times

962
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,700
and there are safeguards and they undid

963
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,900
them and like they're just malicious

964
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,970
like you got to get rid of that person

965
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:13,290
but generally it's an honest mistake

966
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:17,100
it's it's an accident and security

967
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,600
champions right so who here has security

968
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,980
champions where they work doesn't have

969
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,350
to be official but just people that you

970
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:25,200
know that are super into security buy

971
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:27,029
them a book give them a sticker send

972
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,890
them a cool video from this conference

973
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,810
when they come out and be like I thought

974
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,629
of you when I saw this I think you'll

975
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,820
love it that is one a great way to do

976
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,200
recruiting and to is a great way to get

977
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,730
them on your team and thinking about

978
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,200
security just thinking about security

979
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:43,950
will make them write more secure code

980
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,750
okay and now I'm gonna get awkward with

981
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,470
you for a minute because awkwardness is

982
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,340
my specialty

983
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:52,439
and so security security Straub is to

984
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:56,010
enable to have an ops to do their jobs

985
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:58,350
securely securely by enabling them by

986
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,540
teaching them automation and feedback

987
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:02,640
but I want all of you to put up your

988
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,590

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,680
I have a lot of videos on the internet

1001

Microsoft went to DevOps and it was a

1006
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,180
rough ride if you want to feel good

1007
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:57,310
about yourself and learn more about how

1008
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:02,290
we did and how we overcame some of the

1009
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:04,150
problems you can see this here I have

1010
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:05,890

1011
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,510

1012
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:09,220
help you get started with application

1013
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:11,410
security they're all free courses or

1014
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,839
links or things that I think that you

1015
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:15,279
really need to know and I keep updating

1016
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,660
it and if you have a dev that really

1017
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:22,510
wants to learn about this send them

1018
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:23,770
there and then the last one is I I would

1019
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,599
love it if you would follow me because

1020
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:28,390
this is all I talk about and I'm super

1021
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,980
obsessive and then with that I would

1022
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:32,259
like to thank all of you for your time

1023
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:36,780
and attention today thank you

1024
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:41,239
oh yeah there wait yes thank you

1025
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,239
[Applause]

1026
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,899
so we have just one question so do you

1027
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,810
find it hard to sell people on the idea

1028
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:55,060
of negative regression test case as it

1029
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:57,070
is seen as extra work or it's something

1030
00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:00,610
valuable yeah it's hard to sell everyone

1031
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:02,890
on anything know what like I I find that

1032
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:04,720
like people they have such tight

1033
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:07,150
deadlines all the different places that

1034
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,580
they're working I find it really hard to

1035
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:11,050
convince them to do any extra work but

1036
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,330
if you can show them the value of the

1037
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,920
things that it caught that's where you

1038
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,270
get it I usually convince people by

1039
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,950
doing their work for them for a little

1040
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:21,340
bit and then they see the value and then

1041
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:24,879
like your turn this works for me

1042
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:28,270
so do we have any so incoming moderation

1043
