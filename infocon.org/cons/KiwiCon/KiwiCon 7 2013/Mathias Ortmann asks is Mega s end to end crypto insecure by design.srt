hey welcome everybody you talking about
I will talk about

10
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:45,100
day a.m. which is the year design

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,120
me the wrong the making from talking
more accessible

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,309
is on bottom anything over

13
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:55,799
yet I think that number did and the

14
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,119
I'm also going to be quite often all
coat

15
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,299
across the province computing
environment which is life more

16
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:02,929
interesting

17
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:06,119
that focusing on job for

18
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,310
so and remain for me know

19
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,319
they know is because our company it is

20
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,420
the offering enchanting from 212 orange

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,330
and to as special and I'll

22
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,509
for within your web browser there's a
number from

23
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:25,679
to of rent an effort to talk orange up

24
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:29,909
none of them actually a involves ever

25
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,500
course they're called human more
integration

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,170
native up just purely probably after

27
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,310
and you currently have a user

28
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,800
stories about had about think about that
and over changes

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,950
rod so

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,190
NJ interaction and pretty much sensual

31
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,239
if you want to have terms of heart
basically I you know

32
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:56,250
for both stories a.m. the user provide

33
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,970
of dokie and No %um

34
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,250
or plain text ever exciting anywhere
outside

35
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,399
communication and point and ignition
point is always

36
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:10,649
you were necessary condition Michael

37
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,340
through but to is assumed to be true and

38
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,780
the the fact that surviving person is
not an awesome

39
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,959
illustrated by any issued of

40
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,780
a in 2011 where after software update

41
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,800
and their of Education checking

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,530
Road and or of our gridlock

43
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,730
any problem how anymore and

44
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,730
to involve a horrible reached or
director region all

45
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,159
for to a crawl which would not have
happened

46
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,079
had use and incursion and another

47
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,130
topic that is becoming an issue the fact
that

48
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,260
government are getting very interested
in the

49
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,670
sport daughter from card provider

50
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,450
and it's very easy for government just
for

51
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,720
retrieved and mom all while or

52
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,060
bro so that's another reason why in
Jennifer's

53
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,720
is pretty much essential these days so

54
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,990
the difference between end-to-end
encryption and a

55
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,069
surviving fraction is a fourth that
encryption

56
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,339
both in a I'm no

57
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,330
bridge all daughter when the incall
reach the unit

58
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,370
1 p.m. law any carmen hart

59
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,010
by into the persian ones anything useful

60
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,569
and surviving fraction there's something
to

61
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:38,640
you can always just going to anyone Hall

62
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,679
if you want compromise and a car all

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,980
an entertaining for up to 12 hours
provider what happens then

64
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,220
well as old to be fine which is

65
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,370
in to you always detectable whether it
is happening in fact

66
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,830
other matter but the you you could not
do so without

67
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,440
user be able UK the quite

68
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,940
more a as we all know in person but

69
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,420
use or up use a horse

70
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,089
example GP was up twenty your has still
not really gone mainstream

71
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,230
outside take Muni and airports

72
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,259
special to lower barrier to entry and

73
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:22,710
10 you or pretty much only way to do so

74
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,500
and home for par bro just open the

75
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,490
the URL because I heard and uses

76
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,139
without and install or any have all
abroad

77
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,020
result problem majority users

78
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,150
not using it a

79
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,479
nevertheless for some reason the the

80
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,830
choice all using javascript proto has
stirred up by the

81
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,080
motion adjuster causing

82
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,400
read thing and a delegation

83
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,539
JavaScript is a terrible idea

84
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:04,159
someone said then on the for

85
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:07,699
well republicans of that's bad use ours

86
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:11,219
for those better than I thought things
are or or

87
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:14,710
that on earth public you tried

88
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,919
all hyper other or there's no security
implications

89
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,039
or on are or this particular on

90
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,219
or on more said

91
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:29,279
on occasion Davi as don't are or and

92
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,839

job somewhere propecia problem

94
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,949
reno or for the 312 illustrated

95
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:42,979
what are you emotionally-charged talking
proponent of

96
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:46,849
is and at the reason why I would like to
know

97
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:51,289
preservation today and with a number of
alternative

98
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:54,878
a confers Java aretha

99
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,300
security issues after the more takeover

100
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,849
I would not advise anyone to run Java

101
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:05,020
the versions and there are over flash

102
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,188
a.m. having more whole

103
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:12,080
and by a factor of about 10 or 20 lower

104
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,349
at today's of saw so like that

105
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:19,438
and ActiveX thing don't want to use a
cross-platform

106

right number generator a auto cold that

110
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:35,948
a that is up to in part by

111
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:39,389
you have provided any a report

00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:48,619
are also from

131
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:52,169
and you expect upon crypto on

132
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:56,049
make ish so question

133
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,139
it's far you can do it up is your

is the desired problems of and the

135
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:06,110
when you look at the you apparently no

151
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,250
and an interview with the operation or
nations reach

152
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,700
and it makes no difference whether you
inflict compromise

unfortunately many of these about of
breakout

158
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,180
X hold on machine fell

159
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,209
which means the Java

160
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,170
sandboxing did not mean for and we have
a lot of

161

same origin policy regions as well 15
interview with another site

to a.m. and very

163
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,630
ish and interesting and rather topic is

164
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,370
prospecting where the users/suppliers

165
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,440
content and the confidence intervals
pose

166
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,020
fortune you proper manners interviews

167
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,110
call hochberg policy as you have

168
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,450
your application problems separated old
and

169
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,910
on them and you have to be probably
about

170
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,329
policy hold of run grave

171
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,690
of suffering caused

172
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,200
and the jobs but also provides a better
separation between unrelated up

173
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,760
on the crosstalk then they'd only you

174
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,210
don't run it in virtual machines or

175
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,350
differences are a.m.

176
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,930
crosstalk tight-knit hair on paramount

177
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,300
from her is more you read issue so

178
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,020
I have not seen any working further a
and more tomorrow

179
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,850
ATI's that I'm for permission from jobs
that it is a bond for example

180
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,050
if you're concerned about your you
ending up on her pagey

181
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,900
pile then you might on his job because
there's no API

182
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,780
block three-month in memory but again if
you

183
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,870
for hibernate use head

184
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,950
to death and even those law eighties

185
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:08,440
course made you are that no big
difference

186
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,050
the biggest issue with Java is actually
about only JavaScript

187
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,250
in for delivery pay you actually trial

188
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,990
the whole that's what about Bob with
major phone

189
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,660
we have on Windows and Mac OS other mark
for

190
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,680
a build and protect check it's called

191
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,310
cosigning and you can obtain birth
certificates from

192
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,930
better also offer SSL Certificates that
baby

193
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,099
because are better are potentially
subject to national

194
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,870
leonard and in my heart as applying
fourth

195
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,750
make people look like it's your unreeled
its law

196
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,200
on all the platforms you usually involve
your fav or chrome

197
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,700
independently for fun or which

198
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,150
I don't know how resilient from home
redhead

199
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,449
you to a request from the US government
some stuff

200
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,890
into their repository or

201
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,490
better apart or oh and 21 on hark.com

202
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,620
with that have a passion hopefully
published independent channel

203
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,710
that hopefully verified and

204
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,730
also nato's and belong and

205
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,040
than Ron well Java unfortunately

206
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,670
is a not take checked and it

207
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,430
know it and refreshed on every time you
know the website

208
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,170
there many more opportunities although
the initial install much suffers from

209
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,310
some other

210
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,119
trust issues there's many more
opportunities more website operated

211
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,210
power from Joe on times

212
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,420
that overly provider

213
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,520
made old inflation on

214
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,140
partly install separate verified

215
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,460
hash we have progress on

216
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,390
updated in a made hold-ups becoming more
popular

217
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,730
both benefit because Yuki 15

218
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,350
love you original programmer but long

219
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,770
arrest because both those program
special open-ended

220
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,120
stay might use up to to

221
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,850
election so in conclusion

222
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,410
if you want to to the permissions hose
sp1 delivered

223
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,630
for are you're better off with jobs

224
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,620
you we have a significant this involves

225
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,220
you end up and a.m. there's some
indication

226
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,500
mechanism and the install robbed

227
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
still don't have Paul F

228
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,170
machine but they are the that holding

229
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,479
job locally don't have loan from her
every time

230
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,130
side and you can progress sign me up

231
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,480
for this brings us back to for sign

232
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,500
auto updates aerial aidid that or

233
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,290
we are awesome option if you want to

234
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,670
inject malicious old their very better

235
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,709
or source you can do so

236
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,760
by poor religions or the original
programming 5

237
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,120
row or or low then that you

238
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,450
point for you always dead total you can

239
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,550
just packed or compromise web server

240
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,709
is holding the Java or combining

241
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,810
you can use the network management a
already

242
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,339
yes everybody's you today you again

243
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,500
forms izetbegovic you government

244
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,110
and on hover marie's your connection
summer

245
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,800
user her and or name server:

246
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,740
which awesome possum government if you
want to

247
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,730
many things up easy a horse as no
mechanisms of problems that would

248
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,220
has jobs rejected as for long

249
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,300
mutated is changes

250
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,529
an issue want to meet a difficult as a

251
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:01,920
reformers fine the native over par
support

252
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,490
difficult and present place the improved

253
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,930
source and the you have you

254
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,579
separate published and many verified her
than your for

255
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,670
the September a compromise a

256
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,360
course the to them look at the half
compared

257
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,480
that it's not happening so

258
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,120
the problem of home-and-home
trustworthiness in general

259
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,410
help you growth biochemical and

260
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,920
fortunately if you want to move on for
example when does

261
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,029
just a single run updated bed

262
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:40,550
a lot of leftovers and therefore
practical

263
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,760
and the is one behind backdoor

264
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,840
then you here your about

265
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,450
jobs although you are program problem

266
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,910
hi back for jobs as well just think
about every overrun

267
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,020
and think that on community

268
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:02,540
semen hair to the untrained eye and of
course you the fact that most

269
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,770
home run today never objected all

270
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,720
and auto we have to rely upon

271
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,920
rock crock

272
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,979
and the such as a music fan of

273
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,690
via across hardcore things for example

274
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,720
on me we trust aren't enough people

275
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,839
on more to play again we line

276
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,029
of people that we don't know if you want
an operating system

277
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:35,080
we talk Largo around Marvel for

278
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,680
among the homeless more than a thong
over on Windows

279
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,270
there's more than two I'll work on of it
would be more

280
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,370
makeup I development old

281
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,360
a.m. so is it better to have a lot of
people that many

282
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,810
change other open mic problem proper of

283
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,859
to to independently verify and take it
from there

284
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,240
43 but you know that and

285
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,140
or trust to make of questionable

286
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,680
a

287
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,220
0 another issue with fast that

288
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,790
even the most prosperous service
provider of software vendor

289
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,040
might be subject to government action
that fourth

290
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,659
and relinquished

291
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,990
the hundred-page the head and for

292
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,040
built back doors and old Hollywood

293
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,409
on my import and

294
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,990
again effect infected autos & Co is a

295
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,020
pretty much necessary part and

296
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,180
undermine trust are with minors

297
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,920
every month re naw Hall so

298
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,500
and every Windows RT is a collector for
the are

299
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,340
350 don't know any case where commercial
for a better

300
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,970
youth the on up there to actually Trojan

301
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,180
a user a upon request are

302
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,220
or or agency but this from

303
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,420
and he does because Mike run flesh or

304
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,510
here and there's free from the original

305
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:12,110
with fourth you here

306
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,290
but still complex if you want to
audiences or

307
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:19,190
hold of me a nontrivial of approaching

308
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,620
was bed significant I'm a.m.

309
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,500
may have of is open for up in a
five-hole

310
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,530
you want to have a look at it so and

311
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,350
might have about our running so
incentivize people

312
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,550
to long and on fine back to earth at

313
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,610
some or Mahal ho

314
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,899
other nobody was home or month there

315
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,290
and I just everybody over

316
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:50,649
program and fully on it 100 and from
there on all updates all

317
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,310
by number independent reviewer your
chest area

318
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,590
fining yet rose session that I talked
about only

319
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,949
except the update or you made only
accept an update

320
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,460
and their third threshold met all

321
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,200
your signature and the abortion

322
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,530
I don't know any your world occasion
desire

323
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,470
and of home by a hermit our involved

324
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,540
of often told just or

325
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,540
own on home that basis redid

326
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,320
as a vision I would say that

327
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,139
said of and has a two-fold is actually
better job

328
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,900
better indeed a accessibility for

329
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,300
so if you run your mind in a separate
sample

330
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,770
and to you don't need a special
privileges and you have you look at the

331
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,600
half and

332
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,760
masthead and only really attack record

333
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,450
that one go undetected 2011 already

334
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,740
in action regional programmer
implementing something that

335
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,180
or fourth something the very very

336
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,700
the preferred unfortunately does not
bend

337
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,270
so to in the village if you have to
first are concerned of

338
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,700
on a life-changing has of

339
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,050
that tomorrow should or

340
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,610
JavaScript is better than of

341
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:22,250
of God because it provides parent that
bomb

342
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,900
through the browser therefore have
missed own I'll

343
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,220
your machine just him so rigid

344
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,700
playing to provide for them the next
ever made

345
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,530
of run old machine on the run very old
bro

346
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,710
from E on institution problem your day

347
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,780
does and tomorrow jonathan Aitken

348
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,620
called a home similar products so
whether you have for

349
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,419
hold off buying more you have a

350
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,720
or Java you still want after Austin

351
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,660
to you for running so there's no real
difference

352
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,500
on other than the fact that jobs problem

353
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,350
years all but heart so and

354
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,810
of complex a draws a heart attack chain
there is

355
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,909
a shortcoming about them a

356
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,730
roth offering such believe made other
with a typical or

357
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,470
at least some have then published on

358
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,530
severed Weather Channel or even better

359
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:30,379
from abroad awesome that is not me tight
the internet for example printed

360
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,260
newspapers

361
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,370
and then just compared he had today he

362
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,409
vision are other much for that

363
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,510
up overall pictures makes

364
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:46,750
a.m. we see in the JavaScript is not as
bad as some think it'd

365
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,980
for but I heard

366
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,240
and still a lot of harm to entrust

367
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,520
bar through partying

368
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,530
program made okay that

369
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:06,530
the situation any question yes we store
has all

370
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,800
follow opponent ho encryption and heard
a few friends

371
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,129
generally only filed have

372
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,520
several independent from for conversions
are

373
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,379
files up by in bed every his

374
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,679
but anything longer at very much in love

375
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,740
or is it possible that the same file
same you

376
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,790
Hector uphold or to hold a

377
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,820
coincidentally file different of

378
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,270
anchor different and other Paul but
those are by

379
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:55,360
art more for life file well

380
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,010
defective the shortfall are usually

381
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,150
mock very mission-critical and longer
part of someone like

382
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:06,550
to combine that uses

383
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,220
sufficient have I hope Ruth so

384
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:15,020
a one like fun power a horrifying to

385
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:22,020
the collision president number that up

386
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,480
we a at half past your iPhone running

387
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,600
only hope that a lot of people want

388
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,719
have onerous course pro room

389
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,899
old each other old but don't have a
formal

390
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:46,799
in and external from a commercial lender

391
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,170
a we might actually that

392
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,160
your challenge the community and the
phone by the number of

393
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,390
the gonna miss you issues

394
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,600
at work very quickly at there was no
sign of any

395
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,730
party back door and as far as I know

396
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,900
or program head

397
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,010
so and a hollow you don't have all a

398
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,280
the mall parth

399
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,370
from service providers we strongly
believe that doesn't lock

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,750
or or K and it doesn't knock

401
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,620
for made a hole in the government to

402
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,739
or coupon that part to

403
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,010
form X objected and of ago

404
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,640
for in order to prevent

405
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,660
prediction from here or you

406
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:44,660
0

407
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,550
we have a any 50 million from
third-party home

408
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,639
up quietly %um and yes that

409
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,820
if there was any 3G Shindo that we've
already have

410
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,389
for but a.m. as in the initial airing

411
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,850
for comprehensive ok you have to

412
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,139
and who all Park on FB

413
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,630
as a field trip like orgy you your all
these other

414
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,710
on you also the that

415
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,970
or that Iran the Jonah on

416
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,700
in theory of up to be subtitulado star

417
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,650
the BIOS the computer those on the
operating system

418
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,860
browser or any other for others running
on them me

419
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,229
and for the Wii paranoid a

420
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,790
you and digital machine should be from

421
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,899
because there have been some spared

422
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,060
Intel a bag of chips which i think is

423
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,080
low-level my hope up from no

424
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,179
invent number generator of cultures my
we

425
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:55,180
art you don't know no

426
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,560
we'd only third-party on RRT you

427
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,770
whole apartment or finder

428
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:06,420
company invested for anyway but remember
comment

429
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,480
homes and those are some like

430
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,970
%um I'll you home there's nothing to bed

431
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:19,970
if you have

432
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:29,050
up in the morning there there's an
update home

433
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,629
and then the is your

434
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,820
service paranoid compared you have was

435
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,129
independent channel does interviews
those

436
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:46,130
you there bed

437
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,180
that's exactly the problem

438
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,270
if you have a user looked for example
did

439
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,650
between and all the new version play it

440
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,130
by change the on of

441
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:03,760
make said as old what happened

442
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,760
independent on doesn't look at it every
time you have

443
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,810
and that basic some channels yeah

444
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,050
I don't over your head you don't guide

445
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,180
you have from he struck me or from

446
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,210
but have fine saw and yet

447
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:24,060
for their where browser extension you

448
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,260
an update once there's a minimum number
of final

449
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,260
by independent auditors that one amended

450
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,980
I from there %um and

451
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:40,980
know about what happened for their
afternoon

452
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:46,049

good

454
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:02,990
head no

455
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:06,590
the government up

456
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:10,149
that government not use of

457
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,549
a you have use have particular on their
call

458
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:17,158
some think about everything video and
they will send it off

459
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:21,640
say look this file author on hobbled by

462
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,529
I'm follow corruption and would have to

yes on take has for on our own server

472
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,049
for unification for and you factors that

473
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:14,960
the government fine makeup with he
attacked that's a different story that

474
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,580
weekend

475
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,580

at want to buy it to the power info

479
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,809
100 I'm outside haha

480
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:43,960
one problem what happened within for

481
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:50,010
by time forever

482
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,010
unification other you have and you take

483
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:56,679
young there's all a

484
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,679
at someone more to follow there all and
there's no physical

485
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:03,940
up having on the server for membership
so there is

486
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:10,940
unification up

487
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:18,500
'em 3 yet so

488
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,330
you have you know the power so if you
have a very large file

489
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,480
