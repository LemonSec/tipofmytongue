58
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,359

you also need provide photo ID

60
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:53,429

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,929
very positive okay and you can block
absolutely love them

65
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,959
now we'll see and why this is a major
problem

66
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,690
this is what bad have applied you the
republican form that is

67
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,500
sufficient number this is Tony HID

68
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,130
basically I the idea that had its what
do you want

69
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,650
medicine online if you want to you know
all of the whole

70
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:44,650
had a stone the nominee no

71
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,009
into the UK stuff the pageantry money

72
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:51,919
you doing anything online we presented
with this fall

73
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,979
it with it was tossing okay

74
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:58,620
not only apply at home he had another

75
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,979
this is if they did not gone back to get
you need an email address

76
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:06,310
and a possible this partisan fun

77
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,120
up he think that is a little more
careful

78
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,580
you know this there they have just six
digit number

79
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,609
its long like a super-secret anybody can
start walking down six digit numbers

80
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,970
there's no verification almost a

81
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,500
to put you on Etsy one blade so

82
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,440
if a major problem the other thing is
little

83
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,560
capture on this page yeah

84
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,220
so yeah

85
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,270
week instead with israeli they had

86
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,460
now if someone or even happy yeah

87
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,489
well I don't have any action for this
but I don't think many people wish they

88
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,120
had

89
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,620
by so I'm guessing you could probably
make

90
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,180
I have recently had out there so

91

else you can get a

98
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,919

163
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,910
keel you can verify Hickey

164
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,750
so it's really helpful if he's our way

165
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,220
same cleaning up busy one you can really
help

166
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,440
if it had a different piece that is not
very

167
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,100
his you know yesterday one individual

168
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,260
and images had different each week

169
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,260
had which is no bombs at least not apply

170
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,290
and and the keys

171
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,439
I to make you like for the latest
problem don't need

172
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,529
and to all that he had before you need a

173
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:21,890
and somehow the head honcho by today

174
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,060
and now I P hard to get function work my
PSA

175
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,449
function to subdivide but either way

176
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,190
not reveal back like a maybe you will

177
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,260
so my then it's like I'm

178
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,100
really hard but it happens well put a
day

179
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,430
possibly to pay p no again many

180
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,189
apso it sounded right Lake

181
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,139
yeah the bony it a is

182
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,680
on TV Guide alien ticket here

183
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,010
this a problem because yet we can use

184
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,100
be yesterday

185
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,769
and edible WAP to them

186
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,899
crack all the other key yellow stickers
very good

187
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,170
it basically get us we lack a

188
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:22,170
to every may have had an actor's yes

189
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,600
so no you know discover how we can you
know acting

190
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,600
the party manager Pat little about what
and along

191
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,040
this is it this like the lowdown on what
you want to do a lot

192
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,219
but there is a thing that

193
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,399
so 10 it's a very good

194
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,529
that day United

195
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:49,149
non-taxable yeah United

196
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,870
will you don't like it but not
particularly

197
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,040
well in

198
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,110
the book lost members were here bad
happens if the number

199
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,440
that repeated in home I and I have
thought long and hard

200
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,010
there's been quite useful

201
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,069
and yet

202
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,820
for the day and a half loss probability

203
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,350
yes it really interesting information

204
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,660
on the leaf we have each transaction ID
especially

205
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,550
how many times and it over what they had
been used in a box

206
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,469
generators are and on the right hand
side

207
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,529
we had bass stored

208
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:39,260
and the number seems so official

209
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,560
case additional but to be able to just
you know

210
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,579
scandal with any moral modify that
you're looking for

211
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:50,599
Anna busy

212
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,279
that this started rule is no but right

213
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:58,389
so them there was no word yet indication
he is bomb

214
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:02,089
the pads and in what is known even to

215
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:05,240
so thats another manager

216
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,220
security issue

217
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,339
yes so the

218
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:16,730
really only losses operate on a
stand-alone mode

219
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,570
mmm so then but they don't have a few
online

220
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,670
back to the same service and if you're

221
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,500
kinda or standard trusting whatever hud
houses because

222
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,790
you could have got a lot of talk to
happened well

223
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,029
as a half a day and you get a lot of two
minutes later

224
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:38,680
any DVD is what I'm all about this is a
defective blindly trust

225
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,529
what it would have yesterday time JK
does is make sure that

226
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:47,000
really is what we had said

227
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,820
every couple the when a possible what I
just a

228
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,279
ill-suited it you know stalled after
this elected

229
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:58,579
effect is a and that way like they can
be updated

230
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:02,339
solely even imagine usually that

231
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,540
if you can change that any and he
quickly

232
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,689
it would have been obligations 0 you
know yet he said

233
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,410
the phone system bought

234
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,350
yeah

235
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,220
yeah

236
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,029
yeah you modify the

237
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:29,180
had its think with the

238
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,459
those like yeah okay yeah

239
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:38,990
so my daughter think it's just different
everyone believes it will not have

240
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,970
but as the on hold for mister which is
just

241
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,630
like yeah I'm

242
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,680
this a major problem how to make a
formal system

243
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,680
now have a video in do with this

244
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,250
high pay

245
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,150
yes quite a bit I am obviously a

246
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:13,150
by caving in video in

247
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:24,060
the

248
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:29,230
yeah sale

249
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:34,670
quite a bit of money a

250
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,079
on added

251
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,730
this little LCD display they don't know
it isn't about money

252
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:45,620
that's on the right hand side ahead of
and

253
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,529
they're the engine was only as old I'll

254
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,230
small right get a lot more or less and

255
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,870
by which is only this propagated yet
mister

256
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,160
the nation and family like this

yeah you went well

259
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:19,240
will be nanette values have had

260
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,950
so here does just on the net

261
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,480
only non forceful the removal is

262
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,680
tools but only details but

263
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,740
assigned integer so call

264
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:41,740
got everything right

265
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,140
or so.

266
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,840

267
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,990
as a nation each head

268
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,280
a deferred he uses and a

269
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,320
he is I Drive

270
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:05,320
from the public you idea he had if you
popping up on 81 hard

271
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,510
it won't work because Akii

272
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,580
doesn't matter %um any often USA

273
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,780
because than an effect this is all your

274
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,830
device called a 53 as the

275
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,070
very in with her open source

276
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,340
I houdini really have a right to

277
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,639
well as well does has everything is
needed in which you can update

278
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,310
usable particles it's really good
expansion but

279
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,440
yet what we can do this

280
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,580
is weekend with the Indiana

281
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,020
that all but it was like the probable

282
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,700
like the you know yeah I

283
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,870
both in Canada between had

284
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,709
and every day and being you can record
all the fact that

285
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,220
goes between a half and every day any

286
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,860
those own world the researchers in your
good

287
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,020
if %um I

288
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,610
hey if you can't do that okay thing you
can

289
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,709
peace years in the making K it

290
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,550
really hard to say goodbye music and
years all

291
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,020
very bitter so

292
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,370
this is looking good you know it's
pretty much just

293
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,560
up yes thinking well prosthetic heart

294
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,179
you around hey nicely the bottom of it

295
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,670
and see you again

296
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:42,370
a yet again retrieve the keys

297
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,370
from the

298
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,870
affiliation with the area and

299
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,879
so up if you have a brand new habit

300
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,990
not a major Pakistani let and everything
that should

301
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,450
3s not going to work because it doesn't
have the

302
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:09,450
he met but it wouldn't but the props not
in the net

303
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,770
and media would get me in no the track a

304
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,280
Krejci the it to indicate

305
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,399
obviously not be our the used

306
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,480
and it may be more aware they had

307
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:31,480
sick at home those he has learned and
December 31 St today means

308
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,010
if cad said you know

309
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,220
his 3 it correctly Wednesday

310
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,180
and it seems to have some will hold out
what about system

311
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,440
it so the elite 11

312
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,740
nothing like they know all the way
business is done that a

313
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,980
you know here we did on K so this

314
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,320
have imagined because we can't you know
don't you write

315
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,659
when you're not you can buy what might
be best had just a

316
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,530
Beijing China I brought a problem but
when he does

317
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,220
are yet the ritziest is in some way

318
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,360
said

319
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,929
article we get in cast system but would
also be able was

320
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,780
we could copy somebody acid had so

321
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,670
every show %um you can keep the
formation from

322
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,690
like so you get my skeletal system
figure out some 115

323
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,940
on some important day and

324
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,770
if you don't do you could not copy they
will be killed

325
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,379
so in the daylight I don't know that
it's the head around it but

326
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,860
I can imagine the actor

327
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,969
they had table with it how do I D

328
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,370
and the had that and S like the net

329
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,489
and is another mapping

330
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,670
uniform P to that ish number

331
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:04,010
so that in turn the human mind the UAB

332
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,050
let her and shoppers on

333
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:13,629
and is an estimate from if you go to the
website is a

334
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,020
where she playin into your 6-digit it
number

335
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,110
and getting that bad look at what to do
it

336
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:24,820
it we think this yeah so just good

337
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,480
you're out of luck with that number and

338
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,440
and Isabel it was a bit more than other

339
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,460
sup he

340
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,960
yes to if he responds but OK

341
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,770
was the most often as well it's not
really well so

342
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:47,260
your mother first then that or just gave
it a while that

343
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,309
we have to have balance so that number
seems

344
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:53,610
the house you know my top

345
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:57,250
what it is a have stated

346
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,760
wish for you then you can it work
overall the

347
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,520
possible you know six digit number and
hit you that hard

348
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,000
his we're headed the national weather in
law

349
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,870
selected and getting a hot flower and

350
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,750
then we have nothing more to have
another look just look like a really

351
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,020
long

352
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,570
the US so this this

353
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:25,620
not part number: whatever might be
minister and a

354
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,709

355
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:32,450

what we want that i mean they should get
it

359
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,570

now if you look at the right and what's
wrong with that

392
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:58,050

so yet I had closer to the people

429
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:20,780
I'm kinda hoping that

430
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,780
after this you know maybe you don't want
to do something

431
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,620
me so

432
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,909
what we can do it UK most users personal
information

433
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:38,430
because not every day system if you'd
like to

434
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,730
we can reform and a balanced you that
there's anything

435
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,600
all statehood the bookies and
non-fiction on the dot

436
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,219
