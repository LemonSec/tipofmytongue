github I'll tell you about them here but

37
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,950
as I said isn't normally a web

38
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,589
application security

39
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,840
but let's talk about what we have to do

40
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,840
to actually begin our ways I'm assisting

41
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,950
alright so the first question asked is

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,840
security the right fit for you

43
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,090
everyone loves to hang most people want

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,700
to talk about hacking when people hear

45
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,739
about fraud it's like I'm interested to

46
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:14,910
say I wasn't doing oh no was done

47
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,530
non-stop and I used to like Devlin and a

48
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,049
lot but never really pump this really

49
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,220
could be the hacks are funny is true

50
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,290
this is the best part of the job

51
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,720
absolutely but there's a lot of hard

52
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,220
work and stay that goes in prior to that

53
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
and the preparations really understand

54
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,680
that

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,958
so your first leg of your journey is

56
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,850
determined this is your real passion is

57
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,709
this what you want to spend your hours

58
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,109
of free time in this is something too

59
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,030
much you make your main light you might

60
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,610
commit all your time there's good sizes

61
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,350
Security fits I have here that go how to

62
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,870
surgery creativity and maybe doing tech

63
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,940
outside work but if you like taking

64
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,519
apart things you like to see how things

65
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,910
are prevented one of my friends here is

66
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,459
for those all squinched up when she says

67
00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,209
something bad it wants to prevent it

68
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,640
that's a good sign that you should so

69
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:05,670
time to set a new course

70
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,500
why me by this is is your job sucking

71
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,839
image you need to leave or something you

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,459
just need the culture my dad gave me

73
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,970
this book and it's always a bad sign the

74
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,260
dad gives me weird strange books I have

75
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,090
a whole stack of them if you guys want

76
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,500
to reread I could give you one it gave

77
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,780
you this one called or main the giant

78
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,549
hairball is a monetary loan alarming

79
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,810
title because it's like on now this is

80
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,390
no good it's going to be another dad

81
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,549
book by this ornament Kenzie guy he

82
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,649
worked at work at hormone I'm sorry

83
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,440
hallmark he was hired because of use

84
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,600
creative his artistic but like most of

85
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,880
us when we start a job in corporations

86
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,500
they don't really want you to show those

87
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,140
things they want you to kind of have to

88
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,819
admit and incorporation your in so the

89
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,589
things he got been may not be other

90
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,768
things are highlighted when you worked

91
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:53,250
there his idea was that hairball is a

92
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,350
policy procedure deformity competition

93
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,110
and focus on title they people don't

94
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,510
like orbiting is taking the originality

95
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,340
the nonconformity the creativity and the

96
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,549
innovation

97
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,940
and actually find a way to work it into

98
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,920
that the without extra game piling into

99
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:13,160
the air hole his idea is you orbit it

100
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,690
you don't fall into that you can't just

101
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,730
do anything you want you just have to

102
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,548
find pants that the company needs you do

103
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,049
but then you want to do without falling

104
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:23,690
into the tailor politics jealousy

105
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:24,229
unfairness it was actually a really good

106
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,030
fall

107
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,490
it gets a little bit wild at the end

108
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,909
just recommend this it's like five

109
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,100
dollars on the end zone that being said

110
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,500
the day you decided to go into security

111
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,150
just like quitting smoking you get an

112
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,100
immediate benefits that very first day

113
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,989
there's things that you will know that

114
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,240
other people just won't know you'll have

115
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,740
a wide sort of holistic look at

116
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,830
technology the other people just don't

117
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,780
have so it's you're going to see that

118
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,090
you're valuable just from the day one

119
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,380
when you first open that very first book

120
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,510
you'll have things that your team just

121
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,219
doesn't it what might be boring

122
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:01,580
beforehand when else would be beneficial

123
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,290
did you know in 1980s if you were a spy

124
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,680
going to the critical skills you have a

125
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:12,110
know was held pastor a wall I would not

126
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,310
want plaster wall if someone but why

127
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,260
would you need to know it if you can

128
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,720
plant a bomb in the embassy especially

129
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,580
the old embassy you're going to the wall

130
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,860
from where you I have to do you're going

131
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,349
faster or not they have a journeyman

132
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,060
that actually watched agents pester

133
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,979
walls since they didn't do right they

134
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:32,660
knocked it down program pledging walls

135
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:34,400
of online learning technologists so if I

136
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,930
when I was a developer if I haven't

137
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,150
talked about another framework again I

138
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,550
thought I was going to lose my mind if I

139
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,530
talk about framework can see there's

140
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,639
mobilities there's things that I can

141
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,380
work around those things that people

142
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,840
need to know well that's that's

143
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:50,570
something and now I can actually really

144
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,750
enjoy aspects of my training but maybe I

145
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,520
did now are you too late I have a friend

146
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,370
of mine told me it's too late for me I

147
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,659
can't do it you absolutely can it's not

148
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,270
too late they actually started working

149
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:06,260
this in your job now or to look to you

150
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:08,599
when you were child hey so how's if ASEC

151
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,000
look in the future this is from Bureau

152
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,610
of Labor Statistics from my farm

153
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,189
I'm Tommy twenty-eight it's looking like

154
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,500
3% rejected job growth which is great

155
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:20,509
good candidates are always such and

156
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,310
here's the thing attackers just aren't

157
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:25,789
going away I mean as we sold heard you

158
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,639
know who sings target t.j.maxx Experian

159
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:31,789
was that the one that cut back the

160
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:34,099
suddenly the name very much then it

161
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:37,539
makes people CIOs see so is very nervous

162
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:40,310
and they are always hard if I could be

163
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:42,050
job satisfaction talk to my colleagues

164
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,389
here and they will tell their you can

165
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,860
tell you they love their job it's a you

166
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:47,629
get a player knowledge and you really

167
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,400
make a difference every day so it's

168
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:50,840
really great have you guys ever been a

169
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,120
job where someone picks your knowledge

170
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,289
yeah like you have some people that

171
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,270
obviously don't know what they're doing

172
00:06:54,289 --> 00:07:01,009
it's hard to do insecurity can't do it

173
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:03,409
so if you are a professional that can

174
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,479
speak very well that you can show the

175
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:09,110
multiple skills they're going to be very

176
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:10,550
very happy in this job in you now when I

177
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,080
talk to people at conferences they

178
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,020
almost always say I want to be a pen

179
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,359
tester or I want to prevent invest those

180
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,830
are just two of the security jobs that

181
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,719
you can use in this field there's a

182
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,930
whole bunch more I got this all from

183
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:26,990
stance and there they actually went down

184
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,550
several several lines more but there's

185
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,560
things like threat hundred you can

186
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,180
actually assume that your network has

187
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,560
been an end and sort of finding that

188
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,169
people have actually attacked you a

189
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,759
forensics or instead of responder one

190
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:39,529
recommended your career be that all the

191
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,009
time that you that's a good place to

192
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:44,300
look at you malware analyst that's a

193
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,740
really great job that if you have any

194
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,719
interest in then people are going to

195
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,419
want to talk to you disaster recovery

196
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:51,770
and business continuity that was why our

197
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:53,359
attendance and security is

198
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,460
confidentiality integrity and

199
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,589
availability this is the availability

200
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,060
part people tend to overlook that like

201
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:01,550
why don't want to do anything with that

202
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:05,569
well that is a key area security that

203
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:08,690
people really want do it in Korea they

204
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:10,490
won't go to Derby con 2017 do you guys

205
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,669
say the keynote for Microsoft or they

206
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:16,460
talked about imposter effect it's where

207
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:18,799
you think that other people know a lot

208
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,060
more than you do and I love the fact

209
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,610
that they brought this up they just had

210
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,819
a Don because I think this is the thing

211
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,680
as in this field a lot do you think you

212
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:30,319
don't know what you're doing or you

213
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,299
can't do what other people do and the

214
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,860
truth is just on that if you've watched

215
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:35,179
a good Mission Impossible movie there's

216
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,130
all these people that have overlapping

217
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,679
skills that's what you're looking for

218
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,929
the idea here is that you should hit it

219
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,669
head-on by the theory there's just a

220
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:45,019
lack of confidence in this arena it's

221
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:47,510
very easy to talk yourself out of

222
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:47,959
success and say I'm not gonna be able to

223
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,450
do this

224
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,609
it's a present here is a lobster pail

225
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,950
situation if you put a bunch of monsters

226
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,570
in a pail I'd hear a financial

227
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,310
experiment verify this

228
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,260
the monsters would pull it all the

229
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,768
monsters into the bill you don't know if

230
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:08,959
this group sure hope is there you see ya

231
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:11,079
all right cool true so that happens all

232
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,079
the time

233
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:21,199
you're not worth you can't do it when I

234
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:23,870
was an active particular contract it was

235
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,220
a project of our 12 people ends in

236
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,350
development so if you're in the

237
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,350
development actual amount people on

238
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,449
three right and there's two releases one

239
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,519
person got fired so the other person had

240
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:36,170
to go to those early songs on fever

241
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,870
leaves that was the person reading it

242
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:41,420
developing and presenting working late

243
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:44,240
nights miss my family all the time I was

244
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,010
out like the only person in the office

245
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,390
looking out the window going so this

246
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,810
kind of change it just can't do the

247
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:53,959
service and and I wrote down three

248
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:56,209
things like a dune and InfoSec use them

249
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:58,969
agree like I actually have meteorology

250
00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:01,069
which I have no business yeah as number

251
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,620
two because I just didn't think I could

252
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:05,660
do it it's very easy to talk yourself a

253
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,519
low success my brother

254
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,290
god bless him was one of really pushed

255
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,920
in this field and kept on saying you can

256
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,260
do this

257
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,849
kept taking projects Cheerilee me all

258
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,890
the way you guys don't have the benefit

259
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,800
my brother but I'm just telling you you

260
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,510
can do it it's worthwhile so been T on

261
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,399
your path for a day or so that's why I

262
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,949
did and they mention your course of

263
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,260
action and then just keep discipline and

264
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:29,319
record but making you remember is no

265
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,890
matter what this is not wasted time

266
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,890
security will manage

267
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,240
that being said what you choose to go to

268
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,730
security you're sort of artificially a

269
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,550
spy you have to consider operational

270
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,899
security immediately so why I mean by

271
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:47,149
that is you had to seek out the people

272
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:49,040
in your field that can help you figure

273
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:50,720
allies it would be beneficial to you

274
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,170
people that will be realistic and

275
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,350
assessing you they may become be people

276
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,610
outside and they probably should be

277
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,709
people though that were supportive of

278
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,449
your goal they notice Ellsbury Oprah but

279
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:05,209
just as the positive people are very

280
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:06,859
realistic they may be a surprising area

281
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:09,979
some of the people have benefited me or

282
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,420
people I was really not expecting there

283
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,449
are those that will never cease to see

284
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,620
them and they are different reasons I

285
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:18,859
think there's a bunch of ego in this

286
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,410
field sometimes and there's competition

287
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,170
and some people in your team just may be

288
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:27,500
afraid of losing so you have to keep it

289
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:30,110
on the down-low I was surprised to find

290
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,970
the self only took me over 40 years

291
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,360
- out but some people find knowledge

292
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:39,410
competitive didn't know there was real

293
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,600
surprise so just be aware of that

294
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,550
I do recommend learning someone is

295
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,930
secret not fully I like didn't actively

296
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:49,339
pull those employees and share with your

297
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,649
allies what you're doing yeah but you

298
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:53,949
just does this mean what Eric told me

299
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:55,639
not to say anything so there's this

300
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:57,469
support call they're talking about

301
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,829
networks I would say a map I barely see

302
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,420
anything

303
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:00,680
no definitely demonstrated knowledge but

304
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,139
you just don't have to tell everyone

305
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:07,849
everyone in Stein security guys see you

306
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:09,939
suckers later he plasters because you

307
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,649
don't know where the semantic you I

308
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:14,420
don't know if my colleagues know but I

309
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,009
was actually really hope that I want to

310
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,779
be able to look to you which is Pat

311
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:20,300
hilarious if you know me because I

312
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,129
really don't belong MIT so keep your

313
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,930
options open you don't want to bid to

314
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:28,160
one pound and that people hold you to

315
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,769
all right so let's talk about how we

316
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,149
start down the path we have to do one of

317
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:35,899
the hardest things ever we just will

318
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:38,540
along in i hate humans but is the only

319
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:40,759
way to do it and you have to determine

320
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,060
your account areas these are things that

321
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:44,820
if you're in

322
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,949
a job you know how develop if you're a

323
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,290
developer to you know networking do you

324
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:51,240
know how the internet generally works do

325
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,860
you know any scripting languages like

326
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,440
the pure of Python program have you

327
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,450
worked on that or vice versa if your

328
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,580
windows how much Linux exposure do you

329
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,900
have anything of my spiritual Nautilus

330
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,580
thing you have to learn all these right

331
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,350
away and you don't need know all your

332
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,390
doubts right away but you should at

333
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,820
least be realistic and sesame maturing

334
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:11,640
what you're missing then you need a

335
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:14,040
crate repository to be a one music

336
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,689
whatever it is and your first page and

337
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,910
swipe down those kinds what you need and

338
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:20,250
start being editor them then put your

339
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,650
nose - please buy how do you find those

340
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,660
camps the areas that you're missing well

341
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:26,819
I talked to several people in empo

342
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,189
psychic about Holly found their their

343
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,040
knowledge there's a different way to do

344
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:34,740
a list of all of you

345
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,140
okay I'm sort of like my own names but

346
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,110
the college meant a lot of times it

347
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,819
started out and college and recent

348
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,930
liberal arts you don't end up in the

349
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,790
major you think you did

350
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,819
so people go in and say you know I think

351
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,949
I'm gonna be English radio they take the

352
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,320
first etymology classes like that's

353
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,370
that's where I belong so what they're

354
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,500
doing is they're sampling a lot of

355
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,560
information and finding out what is in

356
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,420
those centers in space there's the

357
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,839
exploratory method finding something you

358
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:06,689
don't know at all and making that full

359
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,550
probably really exploring it in debt you

360
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,890
can ask for official training but it's

361
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,780
kind of hard to go too hard you get this

362
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,790
is usually in people's panic they're

363
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,500
interested in it was sick as for

364
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,750
training they're denied they give up

365
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,250
don't let that be you there's an

366
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,440
official training though and that's

367
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,900
really easy to require and I'll show you

368
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,750
how do you fight so let's talk about

369
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,819
that you have the college method one

370
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,340
thing I did is I'm a big book reader I

371
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,500
know not everyone is there's a whole

372
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:37,380
bunch of folks that using it and I

373
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,900
recommend she become very familiar with

374
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,880
Mountain Sports Half Price Books has all

375
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,890
the certifications most the people have

376
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,960
gotten rid of and have given up on and

377
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:48,210
they are great if you wanted to get it

378
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,790
into the security they're there for like

379
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,130
nine dollars I was there

380
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:54,290
two days ago and there's a bunch of them

381
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,660
out there occasionally you see big-name

382
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,430
books like nmap or menace plate over the

383
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,850
web hacker's handbook all good choices

384
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:03,620
but syrupy can be familiar with that

385
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:07,190
hacking expose if you guys see many more

386
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:09,440
gigantic book about actual hacks how

387
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,360
they were done and help prevent them if

388
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,760
you find yourself forgiveness you'll

389
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,240
find out wow I actually really enjoyed

390
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,100
this this is a great mentioning this was

391
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,820
like is a little bit old but I think it

392
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:25,400
was $8 at Half Price Books either way at

393
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,530
your library if I dinero eBay is worth

394
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:31,640
it will give you a very clear idea of

395
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:33,170
what you're missing also check your

396
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,020
corporate library I'll mention this

397
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,400
again a lot of corporations have

398
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,680
libraries that are free and available

399
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,530
and - of these molds pregnant I'll

400
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,030
mention them morning

401
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:45,140
podcast I would start podcasts

402
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,870
immediately if you're slightly

403
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:50,780
interested today start finding out that

404
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:53,060
you can I like risky biz but everyone

405
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,589
here is opinion security now is a good

406
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,540
choice down the rabbit hole and it's a

407
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,670
really annoying intro but you can really

408
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,219
have some really good stuff in this the

409
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,890
SS Koran you can find some people have

410
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,140
their opinions if you're a video learner

411
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,420
which I try to be crazy that some people

412
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,970
really go well with that think about

413
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,589
weaponize that's Jeremy Durance site I

414
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,920
guess all sorts of things from

415
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:18,860
application security to encryption

416
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,829
all sorts of things Samy Kamkar gets rid

417
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,840
of them is that a hacker that will talk

418
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,560
about Wired about how things have been

419
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,870
taken for these cars

420
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,030
you know things guy he's a really good

421
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,100
one to kind of follow because you can

422
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,800
pick up about half away says when you

423
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,910
first start out like well some of the

424
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,380
things also it's a really good hack five

425
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:45,949
there may try to sell you the gadgets

426
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,660
but they have a really good whether or

427
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,240
not women are really sort of program

428
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,709
it's really highly produced but it gives

429
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,160
you some really good ideas of what's out

430
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,020
there

431
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,339
go ahead to buy anything to learning and

432
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,850
what's good about them is they actually

433
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,850
will cover

434
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,610
the main thing is to find something you

435
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,610
can research daily and find resistance

436
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:09,199
now the exploratory one we're going to

437
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,689
go into like finding a full knowledge

438
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,089
about some particular topic that maybe

439
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:16,360
you don't know I'm a gadget rippin love

440
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:18,530
gadgets I'll talk about gadgets all day

441
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:20,479
always find options that you can build

442
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,339
instead of body so there's a there's a

443
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,829
ton of things out there right now for

444
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,839
you that you can look forward for free a

445
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:30,230
portable fireball is a great option

446
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:32,899
Raspberry Pi and there's so many choices

447
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,280
they're open wrt or about tomato if

448
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,200
you're not familiar that with that that

449
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:40,490
will flush your router and make it into

450
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:42,800
some new Arduino there's just so many

451
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,110
choices Mulder that you can explore is

452
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,310
there any price will be an interesting

453
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,620
find out there's a gadget you can make

454
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,730
and do it if you have no idea if I'm the

455
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,219
engine with a bunch of these you know

456
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:55,220
Levi's I don't even know where to start

457
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,140
look at hacker box hacker boxes is good

458
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,330
i subscription service you don't have to

459
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,550
subscribe and there were around 60 or 80

460
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:05,389
dollars each and they have all these you

461
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:07,070
need to do some sort of gadget project

462
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,810
and there's utilized six or seven things

463
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,179
in them includes things like physical

464
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:14,510
pen testing so you can pull box black

465
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:17,420
base rfid mean so you can make your

466
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,920
alarm system and bypass it I think

467
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,010
there's some wireless one out there and

468
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,750
USB enhances all sorts and the

469
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:27,260
restrictions are pretty good so there's

470
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:30,110
really good place to start if you don't

471
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,660
want your gadgets develop if you've

472
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:35,449
found that you really like in people

473
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,280
have created so many wrong them there's

474
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,150
no reason for you want to do one just so

475
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,129
you dilute it though

476
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,050
the idea is just the best that I'm into

477
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:46,610
yourself now so you can learn more and

478
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:48,620
more no I want apologize to you on this

479
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,300
one because there's gonna be a night if

480
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,850
you do this you're really going to hate

481
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,110
me really really sorry because it's like

482
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,360
that you'll have that moment where it's

483
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,070
like I am so frustrated I could not

484
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,139
figure this out why did you send me down

485
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,510
this road now I'm a dad I'm about to say

486
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,310
a damn thing that frustration is a gift

487
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,320
it really does help you because my

488
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,899
portable firewall project I've listed

489
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,340
here I absolutely hated every moment of

490
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,400
it I use everything

491
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:15,350
today which is crazy that's why it could

492
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,110
never be nil because I wasn't willing to

493
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:21,439
do this and you have surely obtain real

494
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:23,389
demonstrable skills let's talk about

495
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,429
working projects so here's a portable

496
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:29,570
firewall I like this one a lot because

497
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:32,029
it's a gadget you can get you are here

498
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,309
if you go to a hotel you know the people

499
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:36,380
can listen in to your traffic you're

500
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:38,029
certain about people into your devices

501
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,760
especially after when she ran upstairs

502
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:43,460
the portable firewall I will do is you

503
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:46,520
can hook it into an Ethernet or into

504
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:49,220
Wi-Fi for the hotels rather and will

505
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,620
protect a nasty traffic from Union you

506
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,210
also can be can out through it and what

507
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,760
you're doing is you're buying a $30

508
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:58,190
router flash unit and programming with

509
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,529
all this additional stuff what you

510
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:03,289
different is networking does anyone

511
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:06,110
really good at networking you yeah so

512
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:07,820
good then we're getting if you don't do

513
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,070
it this is a great place for it if

514
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,960
you'll need them learn about VPN and

515
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,960
certifications or certain certificates

516
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,820
for your later working security this is

517
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,470
a great place to learn about Linux if

518
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:22,689
you've got any exposure this is very

519
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:26,450
gentle intro any day Ganges business a

520
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:29,960
dropbox dropbox is uh I really like

521
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:32,570
they're very James Bondy the use of just

522
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,330
will be device plug into eight and you

523
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:39,230
can waltz into a target plug it into the

524
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:42,289
routers with permission and it would

525
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:44,000
dial back to your home box and send out

526
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:47,450
all the information you want or maybe

527
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,299
use it as a way to get foothold into an

528
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,460
organization you get even boilies you

529
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:54,379
get more networking but you also get

530
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,870
exposure to things like encryption a

531
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:59,240
bunch of the tech tools and you get a

532
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:02,689
gadget element this is worth the time

533
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:08,330
and you start collecting edges my whole

534
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:09,679
or is you know me you're going

535
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:12,080
to promise eight you're saying buy

536
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,220
everything an egg fine now right no they

537
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,080
make it way too easy

538
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,120
find something right now that makes it

539
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,679
where you actually have to work it out

540
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,149
and then after you do something really

541
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,890
and you feel really good about where you

542
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:25,610
are on the security world you said

543
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:27,810
cutting edges to reward yourself

544
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:32,550
by government security boss about my

545
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:35,129
payment now official training you can

546
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:38,090
ask for it but if we were literally

547
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:40,920
building bosses moved though the budgets

548
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:43,139
kind of assist your listings chance of

549
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,350
success you may not get the clutch you

550
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,150
want you may sign up for a sim class

551
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:51,870
find out you're selling in a SQL manager

552
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,860
developers course so be aware you may

553
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,360
not get what you want

554
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,179
you also may be questioning lot or

555
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,439
detoured or pigeonhole you said you were

556
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,630
going to be blue tea here if you blue

557
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,280
team from now on you don't want that you

558
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,470
don't want this to be your only Avenue

559
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,850
I do think other paths are more fruitful

560
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,100
because you get apply things at your own

561
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:10,469
pace you get to do things that you want

562
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,870
and maybe if you're exploiting Idaho for

563
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,390
is it and you say this isn't for me you

564
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:19,739
can yourself say I'm done with forensics

565
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:21,210
I'm moving on you have flexible the

566
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,740
unofficial training and this is

567
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,590
something I really was excited to tell

568
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,160
you this it's often available to you

569
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,840
right now

570
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,910
I bet almost every one of you when you

571
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,409
go back to your job and look on your

572
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:34,560
internet you're going to see our product

573
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:37,680
is sold to almost every corporation for

574
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,870
a university or emailed library this is

575
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,360
often free it's often realizing

576
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:45,330
sometimes it's nearly always rarely news

577
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,250
it really like four points that you can

578
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,550
find including in men men display

579
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,600
Wireshark is all probably there you have

580
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:54,510
the same product

581
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,250
you'd be surprised what's there a lot of

582
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:59,250
times of certification courses for free

583
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:01,740
there are on video courses that won't

584
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,600
prep people for certification if you

585
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,120
want a free option here's your free

586
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,500
option and go ahead and use it as I said

587
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,120
no one even needs to know that you've

588
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,880
done it I'm not that you're trying to be

589
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,320
a little super stealthy about it but you

590
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,640
don't have to answer to anyone you can

591
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:20,189
use possibilities there are also lots of

592
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,100
free online options have you look like a

593
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:25,490
ocean for a lot of people Corriere is a

594
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,379
google web application security training

595
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:31,770
nothing that's one destroy element hiker

596
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,679
box is a good capture the flag but those

597
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,809
are some

598
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,730
signups for a security webinars now like

599
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:40,500
Hills have a great webinar recently

600
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:44,250
where they're actually be needed putting

601
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,990
together a card game based on different

602
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,580
security promise did you guys hear about

603
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,789
that World War two thing where they had

604
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:54,029
silhouettes and planes on the plane

605
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:56,429
apply planes while we're just playing

606
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:58,440
really this is the same idea you're

607
00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:00,510
playing a game you saw accidentally

608
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,179
learning about all sorts of security

609
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,919
products really good idea they're going

610
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,600
to make me bill them I think this month

611
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,039
but you wouldn't know about them less

612
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,168
you can sign up for their security of

613
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:11,640
webinars we start doing to know inside

614
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:16,679
the frozen Asian yeah there's a whole

615
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:19,020
bunch out I got me a commercial but join

616
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,179
Issa if you haven't it's a really good

617
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,970
place to connect professionals and you

618
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:25,470
learn about all sorts of stuff but I

619
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:30,090
just presented web application security

620
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:32,250
just students find inner of relay

621
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:36,830
communities anyone here familiar with

622
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:39,480
the InfraGard good course your argument

623
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,830
InfraGard is that you guys outreach who

624
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,299
wouldn't want to be part of the FBI's

625
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:46,080
outreach I love being able to go there

626
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:47,330
and say sorry boss I gotta go so it's a

627
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:53,129
really good one you guys do

628
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:56,730
really recommended in this route but we

629
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:58,799
have time to tell you something so this

630
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:00,179
one about now nearing your question

631
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,270
really making it where you really

632
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:05,250
understand and get marketable skills you

633
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,750
can really apply in did you something

634
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,580
and during the first interview

635
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,649
here's your day at the window where you

636
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,080
just had enough here's your foundation

637
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:15,449
for about six months give or take for

638
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,039
your exploring in your learning the rest

639
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,149
of the six months is going to be finding

640
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,250
that right fit

641
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:22,770
finding a way to take what you've

642
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,500
learned really find what suit suit you

643
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,000
even apply those to so you should have a

644
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,279
general idea of what you kinda like

645
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,570
maybe you found compliance right blue

646
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:35,250
team secure development just we're going

647
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,860
to take that and sharpen to real old

648
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:40,400
skills six months though seems long

649
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,500
right unless a disease

650
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,660
but you want to know that if you're

651
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,190
making a career change if you're

652
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,870
actually thinking about going into one

653
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,040
of these areas you want to meditate on

654
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,120
to make sure you're making more anything

655
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,950
you don't want to find yourself in it

656
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,110
and then you've gotta go well this is

657
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,390
nobody will expect you want experience a

658
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,370
little bit but your mileage may vary you

659
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:02,980
may decide the right teacher meeting

660
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:05,899
jump right in so somebody on your team

661
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,210
chances alarm has something they want to

662
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,610
get rid of right now it is security

663
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:13,190
related every development

664
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:15,469
I have been on in every development team

665
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,480
on familiar road I have people that have

666
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:19,580
these items and they would throw a party

667
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,860
for you if you took any one of those

668
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,590
using greeting there they're all

669
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:27,139
security related security remediation

670
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:28,520
most development team teams do not want

671
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,950
anything to do with it this is

672
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,270
continuity operational readiness you

673
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,670
want to see a bunch of people run out of

674
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:38,720
room screaming just mention operational

675
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:41,660
readiness firewall in one like firewall

676
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,180
condition not really but it's a great

677
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,010
weight on the security practitioner was

678
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:49,340
a security practitioner someone's paying

679
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:51,890
security action of their daily job these

680
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,720
are all security jobs even if you're not

681
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:56,660
going to be have an official InfoSec job

682
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,180
title you now have experience in it when

683
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:01,580
I was adaptive I took out all business

684
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,320
continuity and people couldn't give it

685
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,090
to me fast enough and it was great

686
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,790
because I was able to study for my fence

687
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:10,459
at the same time and good to practice

688
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:12,080
why I'd learn and I didn't like that it

689
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,870
misses continuity before I went to

690
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,429
security as I said earlier I really

691
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:18,860
liked it once I was actually able to put

692
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,780
mine parts into place so yes

693
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,159
recommended they'll take you out to

694
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,760
lunch you should have them take you out

695
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,110
to lunch to kiss a male sex with women

696
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,790
if I hesitated presentation

697
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,530
opportunities you know here's the thing

698
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:34,100
I don't actually want to saying a lot

699
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:36,379
spider but it's a great way to minister

700
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,020
your students and also learn a lot in

701
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,670
the process and if you're starting out

702
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,760
this a good way to establish yourself as

703
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:45,500
an expert at least in your team related

704
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,120
to your job fold-in security but that

705
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:50,120
doesn't have to maybe talk about why

706
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,120
place maybe you could talk about fishing

707
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,010
they're things that they will find

708
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,610
useful the great thing is that everybody

709
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,440
wins

710
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,928
you become the expert those painful

711
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,750
things are taken away the company minds

712
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:06,500
anyone so it's a win all the way around

713
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:10,549
really great thing to do keep creating

714
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:12,020
also while my colleagues propose a

715
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:14,150
moment later okay

716
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,940
says that the best currency you can

717
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:20,000
carry it's given that gift back to it in

718
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:22,490
the innocent so a series a Nemecek nil

719
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,679
find a github project you can contribute

720
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:26,570
to there's a whole bunch of them they

721
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:29,510
don't have them on all codes some of our

722
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:32,658
project plants some of them are ways to

723
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:34,190
make each engine some just lists so

724
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:35,990
start giving them make up your own

725
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,470
gadgets and projects and posting a

726
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:42,020
tribute Arctic article you didn't it

727
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:44,600
your brave answer own security second

728
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:48,620
change though I wouldn't man doesn't

729
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:51,260
mean but you know I'm gonna work for you

730
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:53,779
oh you can volunteer your time I would

731
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,860
be careful on that isn't this so anyone

732
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:58,960
heard about what's going on with coal

733
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:02,918
fire right now hope I'm missing anything

734
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,419
this is a group that does auditing and

735
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:08,090
fantastic they are real pros because

736
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:10,880
they really know what they're doing if

737
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:13,580
you will on it you know you're going to

738
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,460
cross your T's don't you guys and these

739
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:17,870
guys broke into eight with a good

740
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,059
statement work signed off other

741
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:23,539
authority we're going to a courthouse as

742
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:27,908
part of the bendi reserving this broke

743
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:30,080
into a corner the defendant unlocked it

744
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:30,620
acted like it wasn't locked in the first

745
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,020
place

746
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,330
Pro can waive for the police when they

747
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,950
self alarm intentionally show the police

748
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,840
alert equals a sheriff who was

749
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,330
responsible for the for house didn't

750
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,279
like that arrested model even though

751
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:45,230
they had a statement word signed off

752
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,240
correct authority these guys knew what

753
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,100
they were doing I say that only is a

754
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,929
word of money because if you're first

755
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,908
starting out is easy to miss few things

756
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:55,159
you may want to be careful how you

757
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:56,510
volunteer your time so don't say hey

758
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:58,520
guys guess what I'll bring it to your

759
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:00,890
billing just give me a signature I would

760
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,210
recommend that right up but there are

761
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,800
things you can do if you find the

762
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,180
opportunity

763
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:08,290
volunteer history I have a estrous here

764
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,060
you'd be surprised how many people do

765
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:12,010
done don't know so pick it up the very

766
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,540
day you stop it you know you already

767
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:18,610
have an engine we'll still other people

768
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:20,710
I talked to several team members and

769
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:24,159
colleagues to do bug movies this is an

770
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:27,160
option you can get real money and real

771
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,140
knowledge and real experience I

772
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,230
recommend working for a company gives

773
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:34,900
you a better shield from liability a lot

774
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,280
of times the issues are found a me and

775
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,450
it's going to be hard for you to be one

776
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,780
of those people find those big issues

777
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,640
might be a bit frustrating I actually

778
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,700
tried to do this myself I really wanted

779
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,310
and Omega watch so I'm like not just for

780
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:53,380
that weekend read my guns

781
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:55,240
so this is why I do my daily job send

782
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,860
you reports to companies some of them

783
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,880
have hidden and their terms of service

784
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:02,800
hey we take bug movies it's usually

785
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,320
woman but stay within their scope and

786
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,480
delivery carefully some good if you

787
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,580
decide this into a company hey I found a

788
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,470
security issue be very careful how you

789
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,169
do that some do not respond well to the

790
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,670
fullest of reports so I'm saying be

791
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,830
careful with this be careful that mature

792
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:22,260
security you're going to be sometimes a

793
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:24,939
professional also I really do recommend

794
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,140
gain a basic certification well I've

795
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,690
talked to people in project management

796
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:31,690
they asked joining the project and

797
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,860
dissertation I usually say well what's

798
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,590
your experience have you done it then

799
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:39,340
naveen on these days with agile maybe

800
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:42,070
maybe possibly development I think it's

801
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:45,040
a certifications needed I don't I do

802
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,490
insecurity Elise's we did for a couple

803
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,740
reasons

804
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:50,200
no it's probably going to be if you're

805
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,570
in for the center of I'd probably might

806
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,600
be while your gate follower islands but

807
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:58,360
punky ia offers well the security and

808
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,459
and has plants addled load hops this

809
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,070
with less expensive injury and what's

810
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:07,270
great is you don't need to take a course

811
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:09,970
two passes I took my security plus

812
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:14,020
entirely on at price quotes and modules

813
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:16,750
and ease is it easy test is not if you

814
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,950
don't know anything about security you

815
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:21,130
you're first learning is gonna be a

816
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:23,200
challenge but it's worth it and you it

817
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,240
will prove to yourself that you've done

818
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,190
it and it will show to others you're

819
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,169
serious about this school your creeper

820
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:32,289
knowledge and you're so sorry you better

821
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:34,929
money the resultant security plus

822
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:37,049
insurable Wallace ice party I still have

823
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:40,809
my Mullen size card because I love

824
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:43,539
adjustments me so much dude so the

825
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:44,918
result is you have real work in your job

826
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:48,340
taking all the good stuff that people

827
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:50,110
don't want outside contributions at the

828
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,360
bus roll knowledge at gadgets

829
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:55,000
development maybe you want you may be

830
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,219
certified the other way if you interview

831
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,380
now we'd want to talk to you but with

832
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:02,679
these kind of things because it really

833
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:05,230
shows that you're interested Jeremy said

834
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:06,789
recently I I don't know how any of us we

835
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:09,610
have found it was like we were fully

836
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:12,010
qualified exactly so we're trying to

837
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:14,199
make up you could be a person that shows

838
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:16,059
a passionate about this field and shows

839
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,049
us your names I'll get you the right way

840
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:22,270
and also it'll don't very quickly also

841
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:25,840
on one of my team members

842
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:29,668
thanks to this so it was a pregnancy

843
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,020
solar pump and she was absolutely right

844
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:35,020
so let's talk about measuring success is

845
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,370
seen how where you are as a year point

846
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,150
you're probably doing a lot better and

847
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:39,489
they think you are

848
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:41,020
but we listen to podcast where you read

849
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,419
books are you completely lost when

850
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,080
people rental horns really don't know

851
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:46,570
what that's about

852
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,100
or do you like make sure you keep you up

853
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,600
to date I understand what's going on man

854
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,799
do you feel underwater or do you feel

855
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,600
like you're kind of swim you don't have

856
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,539
to be perfect did you feel like you're

857
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,280
still going on them carry a logician

858
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:59,860
from some of your allies that's why I

859
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:02,230
think honest good allies are great if

860
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,908
you still tell you you're full of it but

861
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,590
you know have them telling you for you

862
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:07,809
here's what I'm doing then we'll say I

863
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:10,119
think you're doing this oh you should do

864
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:11,889
this next the key is to keep finding

865
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,500
those camps though and continue to

866
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:17,679
practice the most points fun and non fun

867
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,629
and I say this this is important to

868
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,820
revisit what you felt defusing initially

869
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:27,690
go back because you might find that

870
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:27,690
wasn't or isn't nil I didn't Google rare

871
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:34,178
tree

872
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:38,540
it was completely must have application

873
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:42,710
and it's question I revisited after

874
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:47,839
about the eighth month so that's why

875
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:49,940
they're dense so definitely your slug

876
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,489
need also need an edge result are you

877
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,690
still in thews or is it just split as I

878
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:55,699
say that everyone was amused by your

879
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:58,460
fortune yourself to es5 and really

880
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:00,169
that's not been you it's okay if

881
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,089
something doesn't fit you you can

882
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:03,380
actually make it in that you're not

883
00:35:02,089 --> 00:35:05,690
wasting your time everything is

884
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:08,060
cumulative so even if you learn about

885
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:10,130
stuff that isn't in your your area

886
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,540
this will main help you later if you

887
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:13,190
decided that you want to be blue team

888
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,960
insight and I don't really wanna be blue

889
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,460
team okay you're renting well guess

890
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,880
what's going to help you a lot a lot of

891
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:21,530
knowledge about what the blue team is

892
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,740
also there's this thing where you

893
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:27,589
suddenly become your job not really just

894
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,810
do your job whether was in app dev I was

895
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:31,910
a very very good developer I was very

896
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:34,310
good project manager that was my day job

897
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:36,319
I did not know if a booked on the

898
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:38,599
weekend I definitely didn't want to talk

899
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,420
about it later and there's just exhaust

900
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:43,550
in the TV box I am a InfoSec

901
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,619
practitioner anyone that knows me knows

902
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:47,690
I really doesn't breathing constantly on

903
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:49,730
the vacation of the two projects peeler

904
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:53,300
my Savior wants to do that simply I've

905
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:55,130
always he thing going on there you end

906
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,839
up doing a lot of it you read about it's

907
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:02,150
was it interesting to you so if you're

908
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:04,040
still find this quite exciting today you

909
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:07,070
should also maintain the super spy

910
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,900
secret agent offset of I mean by that is

911
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,910
you don't want to show up even though

912
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,160
it'll be so tempting the first vlog

913
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:15,740
that's picked that first exploit the

914
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,540
first web app if you're a ham radio

915
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,939
operator and I know I'm dating myself by

916
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,900
saying if you have a radio operator you

917
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,609
don't tell her when you're in hand

918
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,200
because anytime someone has their TV

919
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:26,720
goes slightly won't meet they're gonna

920
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,460
blame you I tell people I do now which

921
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,529
I'm still having them struggling the

922
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,030
best way to tell people is if I say I'm

923
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,560
a professional hacker they'll

924
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:36,560
immediately check their wallet which I

925
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:40,339
find hilarious is like physical test I

926
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,299
wouldn't be able to do that but some

927
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:43,549
people just really

928
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,710
so just be careful keeping the family

929
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:47,780
about what you're doing do take a

930
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:51,740
picture though your first exploit I took

931
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:53,720
pictures of mine stolen and you know

932
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:56,629
this time is probably good kinda share

933
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,609
with your manager my active manager was

934
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:01,190
shocked to find out why I ended doing

935
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:02,930
and at that point is like where I'll end

936
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,120
it soon there you go

937
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:07,669
place it on the resume and it was great

938
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:11,750
at least at the very minimum for their

939
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:20,360
reaction so deadly moments of that take

940
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:22,810
a picture of that - you guys say stuff

941
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:26,270
of them and as you go on don't rest

942
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:29,090
we've reached our golden right so you're

943
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:32,120
in keep movin aboard you have to keep

944
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:34,100
that continued self investment I've been

945
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:37,400
in this field for a long time I remember

946
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:39,950
visual basic one in visual basic one

947
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,920
said your control since you got here a

948
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:45,200
bunch of toys at toy box wasn't true but

949
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,490
you can make your InfoSec toys really

950
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,149
have you seen you just said to make your

951
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,770
work fun

952
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:51,290
so wave comes live in your knowledge

953
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:52,360
forward continuing to continually find

954
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:54,800
what you don't know

955
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,220
just recently I'm Brady on an Android

956
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,200
phone

957
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:59,029
they wanted as rid of their Android code

958
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,980
let me know if you live in trouble but

959
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:04,610
constantly fighting with the Fisher

960
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:08,330
board and find ways to play at work

961
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:10,670
I wasn't DMV guy by understand that

962
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:12,290
there's a magic user right that has to

963
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,350
read a spell book every so often they

964
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:17,360
keep the spells up is that right the DG

965
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:20,390
people come on we're in fo sec there's

966
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:23,030
gotta be someone here Monday what's a

967
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:24,170
day no the thought was what's the thing

968
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,430
well it's sort of the same wood thing

969
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,190
but you don't have to do absolutely

970
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:30,440
everything but you do want to do another

971
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:31,970
skills off your oughta because this

972
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,590
study adventure probably really on post

973
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:39,410
with you conferences casera bomb going

974
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:41,570
into a conference maybe on your own

975
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:44,930
vacation and maybe something you need

976
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:46,640
for I went to Def Con last year it was

977
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:48,919
paid for by me and it was definitely

978
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,859
worth it and I guess hit a green cane

979
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,080
which was awesome

980
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,030
and you can serve areas a lot going

981
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,580
things and it looks like you might not

982
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:58,960
now also you get to connect see what

983
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:02,319
other people are doing and you get to be

984
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,060
a lot of people are in your also at this

985
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,040
point you have a proven record for a

986
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,930
year you have knowledge in hopeful team

987
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,060
you've taken on operational readiness

988
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,279
this might be the time to take one of

989
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,660
those points in your managers say how

990
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:19,990
that you pay for that one-day conference

991
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:23,250
for me to go maybe not maybe not apply

992
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:25,830
it now but maybe something like D size

993
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:28,510
also customized look for the right fit

994
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:30,370
your community like Issa point you in

995
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:35,410
the right way but you can look inside

996
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:38,020
your own company when I was on DVD on

997
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:40,540
another story I was assigned temporarily

998
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:43,180
to a team that required project

999
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:44,950
management management person was able I

1000
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,600
came in there as someone had understood

1001
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:48,609
the technology so I was assigned to it

1002
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,589
for six months then they started looking

1003
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:52,390
for they didn't know the name I think

1004
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:56,050
I'm gonna call it security evangelist

1005
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:58,690
may be a security champion I am not

1006
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:00,970
known to go to classes and bosses pastas

1007
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,560
and pastas bosses bosses and saying

1008
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,939
you're not going to find anyone else in

1009
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,680
your organization if you do like you do

1010
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:09,100
pictures of the experience who's going

1011
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,319
to you you need meaning and the I've

1012
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,029
never done the kind of before they gave

1013
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,800
me my attorney push the other person

1014
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:18,040
aside does they weren't actually very

1015
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,590
good security and I decided not that

1016
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,660
team bad parts about the team and that

1017
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:27,550
was definitely a good part so I would

1018
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:29,170
definitely I got stood up pain Taylor

1019
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,970
Swift on my presentations I just

1020
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:35,110
realized that she has been in every

1021
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:37,569
single presentation I've so sorry about

1022
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:39,010
that you see there were going to be

1023
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:41,080
people that aren't going to tell you

1024
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:43,000
right off you aren't gonna belong here

1025
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,400
there's a lot of video and I've said

1026
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,510
this on the earlier slide I definitely

1027
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:51,190
experienced it myself

1028
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:52,390
David people told me hilariously if

1029
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,720
you're a developer you have no business

1030
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:57,940
insecurity which is funny because we

1031
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,640
want people that are developers their

1032
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:03,900
experience in those other areas so is

1033
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,310
people have experienced people

1034
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,410
so today you're here showing interest in

1035
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:10,029
security you're committed to security in

1036
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:12,040
the future therefore you're grading

1037
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:14,410
security in the extra so keep moving

1038
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,390
toward your goal and you're funny to do

1039
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:18,940
that no I know a lot of you guys are

1040
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:23,350
InfoSec people but just in case you're

1041
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:24,850
not today you're deputized fully you can

1042
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:27,310
become ugly call yourself a enthusiasts

1043
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:28,720
and Vangelis champion if you actually

1044
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:30,009
are doing it right now and you don't

1045
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,709
actually have the title guess what

1046
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:34,120
you're a security practitioner again the

1047
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:37,540
practitioner someone between security

1048
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:39,339
into place so start moving you or listen

1049
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:41,350
to podcast and they say this is for

1050
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,870
security practitioners worldwide that's

1051
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:45,870
for you I want badges for everyone

1052
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:49,210
minded know how many people live

1053
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:50,620
spensive sorry so bad but you know it's

1054
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:54,370
pretend bitch telling people that you

1055
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:55,960
got different eyes 2019 anyone else's

1056
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:59,020
says you don't belong is completely

1057
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:02,680
wrong so just to revisit what we're

1058
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:06,190
talking about it be humble invest in

1059
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:08,589
yourself do the hard work but really the

1060
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,690
key thing is finding in Jordan and find

1061
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:11,910
ways to play where you can actually do

1062
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:13,780
security

1063
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:16,379
don't get stuck in the hairball it's

1064
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:19,450
really easy to do that well you I

1065
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,520
understand the basketball players be

1066
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:24,250
upset with others because somebody makes

1067
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,990
it less familia me look person this case

1068
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:31,930
stick it in your balls that true but

1069
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:33,459
smart phones don't work well big fan of

1070
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:40,600
a hopeless bangle spin that's why I told

1071
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:43,480
people I don't know what so so it works

1072
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,339
it's amazing how that works but seek

1073
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,470
opportunities that you can apply your

1074
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:50,020
special skills if you aren't enjoying it

1075
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:51,669
we sit yourselves a recharge it's really

1076
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,530
important that this is one of those few

1077
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,300
investments that you can put time in and

1078
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:57,100
you're an echo through a wave once

1079
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:00,010
you've learned it's not like a visi on a

1080
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:01,930
framework this it's not like the child

1081
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,310
learning couch pages showing that maybe

1082
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,990
no face will be used maybe one

1083
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:08,279
everything you use the security will

1084
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:11,080
only bump yourself up that much weird

1085
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,370
that's right so here's my contact

1086
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:15,009
information you can take a picture of

1087
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,220
this like this is my personal address

1088
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,770
I'm also reached

1089
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:20,419
st. crossbones at gmail.com I would

1090
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:23,150
explain why Saint cross but some other

1091
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:25,660
time look for my github I have all sorts

1092
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:28,280
of programs out there I'm just posting a

1093
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,450
if you want to make your own shark Jack

1094
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:34,970
you can't

1095
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:37,069
I think heck I found it it may put us on

1096
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:42,680
their own pillows as their own can't

1097
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:44,900
believe it so I'm heavy is there any

1098
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:48,160
questions you guys have at all yes

1099
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:51,800
please on the github account do you

1100
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,230
suggest it be public or hidden because

1101
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,030
if you can think of something that

1102
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:58,130
somebody else hasn't thought of then

1103
00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:00,080
everybody will copy it and then you

1104
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:03,980
won't be unique it's a good question so

1105
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:07,848
should you have a github I'll answer two

1106
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:11,060
ways I would possibly do both but I had

1107
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:12,230
before cuz we've seen a github or

1108
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,910
someone was paying what they were

1109
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:18,020
learning and they were clearly not

1110
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:20,598
learning anything dangerous for them if

1111
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:23,990
you have your own idea then you probably

1112
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:26,089
don't want to post it the reason my

1113
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:28,430
company owns my penance as I was dumb

1114
00:44:26,089 --> 00:44:32,619
enough to open my mouth I'm glad I got

1115
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:32,618
in the Porta so I know I can't pass up

1116
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,740
for the things that you think are

1117
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:39,589
beneficial if you didn't Street

1118
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:42,470
neurology definitely even if you are

1119
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:44,420
giving away ideas that's okay this is

1120
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,950
good currency for you and it spells out

1121
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:50,859
how much money am I going from this

1122
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:53,839
versus this benefit me show my that's my

1123
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:56,210

1125
00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:01,490
they talked about a national membership

1126
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:04,009
that was like $100 or $65 and it

1127
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:07,700
includes benefits if you have time to

1128
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:09,980
pull it up to see free yeah it's like a

1129
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:12,529
national and as opposed to the chapter I

1130
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:14,780
did not bring up my something new

1131

1143
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:55,280
heritage month and I know people walk by

1144
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:59,890
zli very spanning what's going on then

1145
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,890
it's uh I had an FBI training

1146
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,489
[Music]

1147
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:16,489
[Music]

1148
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:25,400
[Music]

1149
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:30,220
certifications so for in the DoD world

1150
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:33,440
you're wanting to like just basic level

1151
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:35,569
information security your Karma's gonna

1152
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:41,060
be security at least security plus right

1153
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:43,480
exactly yet I told about the mission of

1154
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:46,700
so glad you said that

1155
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,109
right so DoD does required security plus

1156
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,230
no pickup and a lot of other government

1157
00:46:48,109 --> 00:46:52,250
jobs so the zoo well weren't your

1158
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,470
investment right because you already

1159
00:46:52,250 --> 00:47:00,440
have it right the demonstrator yes I

1160
00:46:54,470 --> 00:47:03,589
just wanted to say and the only problem

1161
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:06,680
I've had with cyber area is Mount emails

1162
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:11,030
that you get to try and elevate your

1163
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:13,879
free membership into a career getting

1164
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:14,660
tons of that that's what we have Outlook

1165
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,660
rules right

1166
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:22,069
yes trying to the tarnish learn those

1167
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:25,430
are your opportunity I'll talk to you

1168
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:29,480
have good thoughts of it or the talk for

1169
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:32,330
the DoD I've also heard that they really

1170
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,400
prefer what network admins who want to

1171
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:37,520
learn security and get the security plus

1172
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,029
because the explanation was you have to

1173
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,069
know

1174
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:42,349
what it is you're protecting that's true

1175
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:43,549
but see the thing is like that's why I

1176
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:44,719
really think you need to be well-rounded

1177
00:47:43,549 --> 00:47:45,979
because if you're a developer when

1178
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:47,899
focusing on a development

1179
00:47:45,979 --> 00:47:49,638
you've never wicked networking most of

1180
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:50,569
the developers I've worked at but never

1181
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:53,449
deserved it

1182
00:47:50,569 --> 00:47:54,769
they would never give you I say this

1183
00:47:53,449 --> 00:47:56,779
block if you want to see something

1184
00:47:54,769 --> 00:47:59,238
really funny as your lead developer what

1185
00:47:56,779 --> 00:48:03,919
messages and they'll just look for water

1186
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:07,309
so like um you should seriously be real

1187
00:48:03,919 --> 00:48:09,499
fun but you don't have to be just that

1188
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:11,269
in order to get a security you can as

1189
00:48:09,499 --> 00:48:12,499
long as you know general areas because

1190
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:16,029
what's one of the best ways to get into

1191
00:48:12,499 --> 00:48:19,279
a corporation is through their web and

1192
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:21,349
there might be projects with us that if

1193
00:48:19,279 --> 00:48:23,869
you want to be a developer that never

1194
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:32,919
security to work on I shouldn't mention

1195
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:36,969
at once yes any other questions alone I

1196
00:48:32,919 --> 00:48:36,969
will offer if you guys
