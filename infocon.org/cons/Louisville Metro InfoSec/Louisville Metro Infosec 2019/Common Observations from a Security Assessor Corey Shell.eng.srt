1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,810
but I hear me okay my name is Cory shale

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,490
I'm a senior of cyber security

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:11,309
consultant with being Norton and the

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:15,089
purpose of this talk is I'll be speaking

5
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:17,250
from perspective of a cyber security

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:22,769
consultant who's performed technical

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,240
security assessments for years so a

8
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,680
little bit of background on me I've been

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,720
doing starting security assessments for

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,330
over four years prior to that I spent

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:37,260
seven had several years of IT security

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:40,250
experience so we attended today we're

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,390
gonna cover some areas that we typically

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,789
perform security assessments for

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,579
starting with cloud security with

16
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:51,210
external security which is your internet

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,850
facing security account security with a

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,670
focus on Active Directory and local

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,829
account and passport management and then

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,239
we'll go over endpoint security so

21
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,460
that's the security of your endpoints

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,670
we'll also cover some common security

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,470
controls and then we'll close with some

24
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,119
free tools as well as informative

25
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,760
references that might be helpful for you

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,240
and I'll take questions at the end of

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,979
the presentation so to start with cloud

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,130
security we're gonna have a very heavy

29
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,479
emphasis on office 365 and Azure so

30
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,720
we're not really going to be covering a

31
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,950
double u.s. or other cloud platforms and

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,150
I just get a show of hands how many

33
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,619
people here use office 365 okay so this

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,040
is going to be very relevant for a lot

35
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,960
of you so we're going to start off with

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,420
some statistics from Microsoft

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,548
so pertaining to identity identity

38
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,920
attacks they have server roughly 300

39
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,920
million audience signing attempts daily

40
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,380
81 percent of breaches are caused by

41
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,630
credential theft so a big topic of this

42
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:57,060
presentation will be credential theft

43
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,500
and according to Microsoft 99.9% of

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,969
attacks can be blocked with multi-factor

45
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,490
authentication so we're going to spend

46
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:07,350
some time talking about MFA and how that

47
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:09,598
could be bypassing so these numbers are

48
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,919
from Microsoft's latest ignite ignite

49
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,380
conference

50
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,820
they've observed a 300 percent

51
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,820
grease and identity attacks over the

52
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:21,329
previous year so in a single month they

53
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,760
observed a roughly 23 million high risks

54
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,160
sign ins that

55
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,299
appear to be indicative of phishing they

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,680
observed three hundred and fifty

57
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,480
thousand accounts that were compromised

58
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,310
in a single month by password spray

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,619
attacks or undercover passports praised

60
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:38,040
a bit more in depth here in a minute and

61
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:40,950
then 4.6 billion sign-in attempts is

62
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,679
detected at a single month breach replay

63
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,230
breach replay is also referred to as

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,980
credential stuffing that's where three

65
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,510
actors or attackers take a bunch of

66
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,890
usernames and passwords that have been

67
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:58,739
disclosed in data breaches and they

68
00:02:52,890 --> 00:03:00,450
replay those for other services so

69
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,610
here's a list of some very common

70
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,100
observations that we we observe when we

71
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:09,300
do a cloud security assessment the first

72
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:12,780
one is that the even the organization is

73
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,490
unaware of what their secure score is or

74
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,760
they're not aware of what a secure point

75
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,320
is if they are in track of it it's not

76
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,329
actively maintained what we're going to

77
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,100
cover that a bit more depth and another

78
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,350
slide but it's basically a metric that

79
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,970
Microsoft reports to you on the status

80
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,579
of your security controls in your cloud

81
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,780
environment we also see a very low rate

82
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,510
of adoption for multi-factor

83
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,700
authentication this also includes highly

84
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,549
privileged admin accounts such as level

85
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,560
administrators legacy protocols are

86
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:44,040
enabled this is a default setting for

87
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,810
exchange mailboxes this allows three

88
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,070
actors to target those mailboxes with

89
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,740
passive or spray attacks we'll cover

90
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,840
that more in depth in here in a minute

91
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,959
we also see that auditing is not enabled

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,270
so this is a default set you have to

93
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,350
proactively enable auditing otherwise if

94
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,570
you have an incident

95
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,250
you can't retroactively lis enable the

96
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,350
auditing and have those logs available

97
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,880
to you if it's not enabled at the time

98
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:10,130
of the incident then those logs are not

99
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,780
available for your investigation and

100
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,549
then the last observation here that

101
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,709
typically what we see is that the IT

102
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,500
staff are unable to retrieve sign-in

103
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,390
logs or investigative risk events with

104
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,820
the proper context because they lack the

105
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:28,159
necessary licensing to do so so

106
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,740
it's worth noting that most office 365

107
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,420
licenses do not include azure ad premium

108
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,420
and we're going to go over some of the

109
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:39,080
things that are included with that as

110
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,700
our ad premium license so to start with

111
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,109
the secure square there's actually three

112
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,570
different types so I've seen some

113
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:48,080
confusion on this there's a Microsoft

114
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:50,000
secure score which includes a rating on

115
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,070
six different categories there's an

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,740
identity secure score that applies to

117
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,570
your Azure Active Directory and then

118
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,280
there's an azure security center secure

119
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,409
support that's only relevant if you are

120
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,520
using Azure for your infrastructure or

121
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,050
your virtual machines to give you a

122
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,780
picture of what that looks like here's

123
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,300
the Microsoft secure score you can see

124
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,090
the on the left hand side you get a

125
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,730
total score you see what your score is

126
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,739
in each of those categories

127
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,420
the identity secure score is taken

128
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,680
directly from Azure Active Directory

129
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:26,450
secure score this is a metric that is

130
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,860
based on the controls that you've

131
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,320
implemented in your environments so to

132
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,480
give you an example requiring in it and

133
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,599
if FA for all your users that would

134
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,400
improve your score about 30 points that

135
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,970
would also greatly reduce your risk of

136
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,770
mailboxes compromised and a one auditing

137
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:46,970
that would be another 15 points and you

138
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:48,950
can see here it also gives you the it

139
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,540
shows you how you compare to your peers

140
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,099
and your industry such as you want the

141
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,380
industry average is the global average

142
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,000
and then what your score is so highly

143
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,560
recommend you check out what your secure

144
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,760
score is and take a look at those

145
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,940
improvement actions that how you going

146
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,400
to produce for multi-factor

147
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,570
authentication this is the big thing if

148
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,950
you want to reduce your risk of

149
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:11,990
compromising him via an office 365 so

150
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,090
multi-factor authentication it's a

151
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,440
combination of three one two of the

152
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,440
three here's something you know

153
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,490
something you have something you are

154
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,500
something you know such as password

155
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,100
something you have to do that device

156
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:28,150
could be a UV key a physical device

157
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:30,710
something you are such as a fingerprint

158
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,200
whenever you enroll in anything office

159
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,750
365 you are greeted with this screen

160
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,669
here that allows you to choose the type

161
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,370
of an epee you'd like to

162
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:42,349
so the type of MSA would recommend that

163
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:46,340
you use as an Authenticator app so

164
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:49,090
software token it's worth noting that if

165
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:54,219
you use text messages or SMS as your

166
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:57,710
form of your 2fa that can be

167
00:06:54,219 --> 00:07:00,050
circumvented by thread actors by what's

168
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,810
called sim hijacking so they social

169
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,370
engineer your cell phone provider they

170
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,830
give them to swap the sim card and then

171
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:10,099
they can get a text Center their phone

172
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:12,378
number there is also a tool that was

173
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:15,560
released on github earlier this year

174
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:18,409
called militia and that allows a threat

175
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,729
actor to proxy traffic to Microsoft so

176
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:26,389
if you are doing a push it can allow

177
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:27,979
them to sync it set up a fake website

178
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,219
where they can harvest you credentials

179
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:35,839
and then proxy your second factor as a

180
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:39,080
way they can by pestering my thing so

181
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:41,659
according to Microsoft only an X percent

182
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,389
of all office 365 admin accounts require

183
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:53,180
MFA anybody want to take a guess what

184
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:55,580
this number is 515 1.8% and we see that

185
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,680
too whenever we do assessments there are

186
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,289
very few privileged to have an accounts

187
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,060
that having a fan tables so then this is

188
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:03,529
one of the most critical things you can

189
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,210
do to improve security in your clouds

190
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:08,180
make sure you've got in advance for all

191
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,188
of your privileged users now we

192
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,550
mentioned password sprays earlier so

193
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:15,710
earlier this year security researchers

194
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:19,339
at Proofpoint had a study they found

195
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:21,859
that roughly 60% of office 365 and jisu

196
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:23,539
attendants are targeted by I and my map

197
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,819
based password spread attacks and

198
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:29,120
roughly a quarter of those experienced a

199
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:31,279
breach as a result so password spray

200
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,169
attacks are very common and the whole

201
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,328
really the best way to mitigate this is

202
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,990
to disable legacy protocols like I'm at

203
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:40,458
pop and SMTP

204
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,589
it's worth noting even if you've

205
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:44,088
deployed multi-factor authentication for

206
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:46,760
every mailbox and your office 365

207
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:48,800
environment but you haven't disabled

208
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,209
these legacy protocols the threat actors

209
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,699
can still get access to those

210
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:54,229
boxes so pushing out NFA is not enough

211
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:57,429
you need to also practically be

212
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,429
disabling these legacy protocols

213
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,420
Australian cybersecurity center released

214
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:04,939
and Visor Eon password spray attacks

215
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:09,490
earlier this year in August I would

216
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:12,230
encourage you to take a look at that so

217
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,389
what's the impact of disabling legacy

218
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,339
authentication well if you've got older

219
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:19,519
clients in your environment so it's

220
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:21,319
older iOS or Android handsets that don't

221
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,569
support modern authentication it will

222
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:26,839
break them if you've got older versions

223
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:29,990
of Microsoft Office to pre 2013 it will

224
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,360
break them if you've got office 2013

225
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,399
deployed that requires a registry change

226
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:40,339
to actually support modern

227
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:42,259
authentication so before you disable

228
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,209
legacy authentication especially you're

229
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:45,649
going to do a tenant why'd you need to

230
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:48,469
review your your sign-in logs and Azure

231
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,699
so you can know exactly which users are

232
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,809
going to be impacted if you were to

233
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:55,459
disable disk located however you can

234
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:58,069
access those sign-in logs unless you

235
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:59,989
have an azure ad premium license so your

236
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:04,240
IT admins need as your ad premium

237
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,240
license to give these sign-in logs

238
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:12,319
these are themselves or never use it not

239
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:14,240
for ever using either so something else

240
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:16,128
if you're 90 admin and you're

241
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,100
investigating potential incident office

242
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:21,949
365 like a null box compromise if you're

243
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,740
just using Azure ad basic or free

244
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:26,449
there's you can see that screenshot at

245
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,329
the very top right that's exactly how

246
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:31,670
much context you get a user a location

247
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:33,319
signing time there's a very little

248
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,118
context about what that risk event was

249
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:36,829
generated but if you have an azure ad

250
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:38,600
premium license you get much more

251
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:42,229
context about the user agent the

252
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,749
operating system geographic location you

253
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,819
see the risk event type so it tells you

254
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:48,110
exactly which type of risk event was

255
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:50,449
triggered

256
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,549
so those Azeri D premium license are

257
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,540
extremely beneficial to your IT admins

258
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:58,429
if they're going to be investigating

259
00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:00,439
potential incidents not was 365 so we

260
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:02,689
talked about autoblog not being enabled

261
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:04,390
by by default this is the unified audit

262
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:07,000
log it's not an a

263
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,980
until a global admin goes to security

264
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,260
and compliance center goes to audit log

265
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,960
search and clicks that turn on holiday

266
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,910
money so be sure to do that that should

267
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:21,000
also increase your shoot secure score

268
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:24,069
probably 15 points so Microsoft has a

269
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,170
feature that requires either ad premium

270
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,990
is called conditional access so these

271
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,360
are when this happens then do this

272
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,880
conditional policies you can implement

273
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,660
so I give an example we've got a client

274
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,910
that we've basically helps enforce geo

275
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,199
filtering force elite block signing

276
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,520
attempts from anywhere outside the

277
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,910
United States and that's using

278
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,040
conditional access now each user that

279
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,170
the conditional access policy applies to

280
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,089
needs an azure ad premium license so if

281
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,370
you wanted to deploy a conditional

282
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:56,050
access policy tenant wide that you would

283
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:59,980
require premium license for everybody

284
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:01,750
that applies to however Microsoft has

285
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,560
threw you a bone every now and now and

286
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,780
then

287
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,489
these are baseline policies so these are

288
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,930
policies that are available to every

289
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,400
Azure tenant regardless of your

290
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,219
licensing so it doesn't matter if you

291
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,050
just use an azure basic the downside to

292
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,840
these baseline policies is they're not

293
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,609
really customizable as much as the azure

294
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,330
premium conditional life those policies

295
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:25,930
are these are basically on or off so you

296
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,370
can't make exceptions but they are there

297
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,770
they're currently in preview

298
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,390
hopefully whenever these are no longer

299
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,840
in Creedy status they will allow for

300
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,840
exceptions

301
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,610
now this is a checklist I highly

302
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,460
recommend you to check out this

303
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,230
checklist so starting at the very top

304
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,580
Microsoft has an office 365 security

305
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,620
roadmap they tell you what your top

306
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,980
priorities for the first 30 days 90 days

307
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,930
and Beyond are now all of Microsoft's

308
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,260
recommendations and this as well as

309
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:01,209
their secure score or Microsoft centric

310
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,400
so they're telling you what controls

311
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:06,280
they offer that they recommend to

312
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,890
increase your security but it's worth

313
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:14,170
noting that they do allow for whenever

314
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:17,350
you go to make changes in your secure

315
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,189
score you can check resolve via

316
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,449
third-party

317
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,930
so I highly recommend if you're using

318
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:25,089
third party products for like DLP or

319
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,189
mobile device management be sure and

320
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:28,600
update your secure score with those

321
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:33,550
controls that are satisfied by third

322
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,589
party also the Center for EF security

323
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,859
has some benchmarks browser Microsoft

324
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:41,410
365 these are very detailed walkthroughs

325
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,819
on how you can audit security controls

326
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:47,050
in your environment and how you can

327
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:49,449
remediate those issues as well so we're

328
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,939
going to move on to external security so

329
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:54,459
some common in servation is here this is

330
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:56,469
the security security of your internet

331
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,508
facing environment so typically your

332
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,420
internet internet facing servers or

333
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:03,100
servers in your DMZ we typically see

334
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,069
management interfaces that are exposed

335
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:09,759
to the Internet including ssh telnet RDP

336
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:13,209
and let me tell you that you do not want

337
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,970
to have RDP internet facing in 2019

338
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:18,279
we'll cover that a bit more later

339
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:22,540
we also typically see single factor

340
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:26,350
authentication even for like the VPN is

341
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:28,509
an example so in that case the factor

342
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:31,149
only needs to get one users credentials

343
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:33,040
to potentially gain access to the

344
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:35,290
internal environment that users a VPN

345
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,120
user we also see a lot of miss

346
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,579
configurations so these are systems that

347
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,180
are put in either internet facing

348
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:45,279
inadvertently or they're not scanned and

349
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:48,279
check for vulnerabilities and have a

350
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,899
checklist to make sure that they're not

351
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,839
introducing burned abilities to their in

352
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:54,910
that based on barmen unknown or Sun

353
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:59,050
support assets exposed to Internet so

354
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:01,779
there's either systems that were set up

355
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,160
by a vendor or maybe have a core

356
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:04,990
operating system that's no longer

357
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,959
supported by the vendor the end of life

358
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:10,209
being exposed to the Internet

359
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:15,969
we also see how we find things and

360
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:19,000
github repositories things on websites

361
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:21,069
that are useful for staging an attack

362
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,170
when we perform open source intelligence

363
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:27,759
gathering now there's a lot of slides to

364
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:30,670
this one we're going to cover account

365
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,870
security so this is mostly focused on

366
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,910
Active Directory

367
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,340
and password management and local

368
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,839
account management so we'll start here

369
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,030
at the top

370
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,860
the most common observation is weak

371
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,650
passwords and an insufficient password

372
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:46,420
policy so we're going to cover good

373
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:49,120
pasture practices you have a bit more

374
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,459
depth here in a minute we see a lot of

375
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,250
users who think passwords using formulas

376
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:58,390
like password one exclamation all 2019

377
00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:00,640
exclamation etc we'll talk about how you

378
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,560
can improve password security here in

379
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,560
just a minute but we also see a lot of

380
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,349
principle of legal relations so a lot of

381
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,479
users are local admins we see IT admins

382
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:12,400
that use their domain admin accounts to

383
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,460
perform high-risk activities like

384
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,380
browsing the web or checking their email

385
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,910
we see a local admin account password we

386
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,670
use on multiple machines will cover

387
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:24,819
Betemit more depth in a minute why

388
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,620
that's a big security issue domain

389
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,090
admins logging in everywhere that's not

390
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,920
a good security practice we're going to

391
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,620
cover that a bit more definitely get

392
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,780
your credential theft service account

393
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,490
passwords they're typically so we see

394
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,890
service accounts that have passwords

395
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,270
that are changed very infrequently you

396
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:44,140
usually have the password set to never

397
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:45,670
expire we also see hazardous tour group

398
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,020
policy preferences we'll cover that a

399
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,910
bit more in depth here in a minute while

400
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,189
that's a bad idea and then occasionally

401
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,540
I would see this as much anymore we see

402
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,000
passwords stored in the description

403
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,439
build in Active Directory that's not a

404
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,930
good idea because that by default

405
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,390
everybody has read access to that so

406
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:05,169
it's it's not real it's not a security -

407
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:06,970
expiry so start now with the

408
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,920
insufficient password policy so these

409
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,100
are some very common weak passwords

410
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:15,520
there that we see the common password

411
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:17,079
formulas when you have the just the

412
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,950
native password policy settings in

413
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:21,458
Active Directory

414
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:23,110
we see this everywhere we go about the

415
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:24,880
only way you can really mitigate this as

416
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:29,080
good security awareness training and

417
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,060
also a passport filter so the latest

418
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,629
guidance from Microsoft is probably

419
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,620
going to it's may seem counterintuitive

420
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,170
when you consider what we've been told

421
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,610
for years they recommend maintaining at

422
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,460
least an eight character minimum length

423
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:44,469
requirements they don't require a

424
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,690
character composition requirements that

425
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,779
mean

426
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,889
that do not require complexity so digest

427
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:50,929
that for a second they're telling you

428
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:55,490
that you don't need upper/lower numbers

429
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:57,470
special don't require mandatory periodic

430
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,059
password resets for user accounts that

431
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:02,509
means don't expire your passwords every

432
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:04,070
90 days so however notice

433
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:06,289
recommendations are contingent on this

434
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,720
next one banning common passwords that

435
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:10,460
means using a password filter some

436
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,159
technical control that prevents users

437
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,379
from picking passwords like we mentioned

438
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:20,149
previously with a formula like password

439
00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:21,320
1 or Paul 2019 educating your users not

440
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:23,029
to reuse their passports for

441
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,840
non-work-related purposes so this is

442
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:26,450
something that gets a lot of

443
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,480
organizations is their users reusing

444
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:34,909
passwords that they use externally for

445
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:36,529
their password further account and then

446
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:37,639
also you shouldn't be enforcing

447
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:41,419
registration for multi-factor

448
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:43,490
authentication so Microsoft does have a

449
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:45,500
password filter that will work with your

450
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,539
on-premise Active Directory it does

451
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,240
require an azure 80 premium license

452
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:51,590
that's called Azure ad premium or I'm

453
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,080
sorry it's called azure ad password

454
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,789
protection there are a couple other

455
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,259
commercial solutions I've actually

456
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:59,269
worked with the one there in the bottom

457
00:18:57,259 --> 00:19:02,029
and makes this task or policy enforcer

458
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:04,879
we were able to use a band pass for a

459
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:07,009
list of over 500 million passwords so we

460
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:08,360
prevent our users from picking a

461
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:11,570
password of those one of those 500

462
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,729
million so it's kind of a carrot and a

463
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,110
stick you're hitting your user with a

464
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,700
stick until they have to pick a really

465
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,529
good password and it may take them 10 or

466
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,970
15 minutes but you're giving them a

467
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:22,100
carrot because they don't have to change

468
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,120
their password it's pretty cool they

469
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,639
should only have to change the password

470
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,709
if you confirm or suspect their accounts

471
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:29,209
compromised when when you force your

472
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,309
users to change their passwords

473
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,169
frequently they usually pick a formula

474
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:37,940
and then just slightly alter just a

475
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:40,429
single character every 60 or 90 days so

476
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,740
Microsoft did have a password length

477
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,899
restriction on cloud accounts that was

478
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,360
six a minimum of 16 characters I'm sorry

479
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:50,029
a maximum of 16 characters so you

480
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,129
couldn't set up an account on office 365

481
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:55,220
of more than 16 characters they did

482
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:57,779
remove that they now allow for up to 256

483
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:01,289
characters so I recommend

484
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:03,799
setting up lengthy passwords preferably

485
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:07,320
random and unique for your privileged

486
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:10,379
users and storing those in a passport

487
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:13,349
vault or password manager so we're going

488
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:14,998
to talk about password managers and the

489
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:18,960
browser parity and all of your passwords

490
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:21,029
should be random and unique and stored

491
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,460
on the passport manager you should only

492
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:24,779
be relying on you know really need to

493
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,259
remember a password to log in your

494
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:30,809
computer and then a master password for

495
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:31,950
your passport manager and then all your

496
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:33,479
other all your other passwords you

497
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,419
maintain Casper managers should be

498
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:41,309
random and unique password reuse is what

499
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:42,899
gets a lot of organizations yet now one

500
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:44,279
common question that we get when we talk

501
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:45,779
about password managers that should we

502
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,450
really be putting all of our eggs in one

503
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:50,580
basket and my instead of that I'm going

504
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,919
to quote Troy hunts it maintains a

505
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,389
website I'll have up and that's where

506
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,499
managers don't have to be perfect they

507
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:59,158
just have to be better than not having

508
00:20:55,499 --> 00:21:00,960
one so like anything else password

509
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:03,059
managers do have earn abilities their

510
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,139
software there was some security

511
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,460
researchers that found some earn

512
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:07,408
abilities a password managers earlier

513
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,239
this year but they're much better than

514
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:12,570
just saving all of your passwords and

515
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:14,969
Excel spreadsheet or Word document on

516
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:19,259
your desktop or just reusing the same

517
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:21,169
password everywhere so that Troy hunts

518
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:27,929
website have I been found they do

519
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:29,549
maintain a list of over 8 billion

520
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:33,450
accounts that have been compromised

521
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:35,219
these are a bunch of data breaches you

522
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,929
can check to see if you go to this

523
00:21:35,219 --> 00:21:41,159
website enter your email address you can

524
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:43,200
see what services you've used your

525
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:46,649
accounts make compromised in they also

526
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,839
allow you to download the password list

527
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:53,218
that they maintain it contains over 500

528
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:54,989
million passwords ok so now we're going

529
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:56,609
to talk about credential thefts so this

530
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:59,399
is a screenshot of the tool called me me

531
00:21:56,609 --> 00:22:01,499
cats so this is something that pen

532
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:05,570
testers and a becerril threat actors

533
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:08,009
will use when they gain a foothold to

534
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,749
our workstation and environment they

535
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:10,710
will dump the credentials of logged in

536
00:22:09,749 --> 00:22:12,210
users

537
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,770
and then I tend to move move laterally

538
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,350
in the environment with those

539
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,520
credentials and here lately there have

540
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,439
been malware that it actually

541
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,789
incorporated this tool so we're going to

542
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,299
cover that a bit more and definitely get

543
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:25,830
to the endpoint security section but I

544
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,570
wanted to point out when you log in

545
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,850
interactively that means when you log in

546
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,399
at the console on your computer or if

547
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,649
you log in with a remote desktop session

548
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:36,360
your credentials are exposed in memory

549
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:39,510
so that means whenever you log in as a

550
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,158
domain admin on a workstation if a

551
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,899
thread after has if the old or malware

552
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,399
has up to all of that computer and it's

553
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:45,629
using the tool like this it can dump

554
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:49,500
your credentials and then use those

555
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:52,020
credentials to move laterally another

556
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:56,450
issue that I've seen pretty commonly is

557
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:59,129
group policy preferences so back in 2014

558
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:00,899
Microsoft had a featured policy

559
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,210
preferences were allowed you to store a

560
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:06,360
password and group policy would be

561
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:08,279
stored in an encrypted value that

562
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,658
everybody had read access to on this is

563
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:11,309
all sharing because it's by default

564
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,960
every domain user has read access to

565
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:15,450
this fault

566
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,950
this was encrypted and if you look at it

567
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,450
at the top left they used to the haven't

568
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,520
message that this password is stored as

569
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:23,039
part of the group policy object and is

570
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,350
discoverable although obscured after

571
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,590
Microsoft released a patch to update

572
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,240
that to 2014 and then it said this

573
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,889
preference requires the cpap Scrat

574
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,330
review which is a known security risk to

575
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,980
help protect your environment some

576
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,600
actions may not be available that

577
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,220
basically stop you from using it however

578
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,500
if you had already deployed your

579
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,360
policies storing that password they

580
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,520
didn't renter actively get disabled so

581
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,469
what I'm seeing is leftover group

582
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,809
policies that were deployed several

583
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:50,100
years ago that are still in fact they're

584
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:51,750
still storing passwords that haven't

585
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,309
been changed and it's basically a

586
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,320
privilege escalation burn ability that

587
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:56,610
once they threw out after games I put

588
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,470
all in the computer in the environment

589
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,879
if you've got the these group policy

590
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:03,179
preferences they can escalate their

591
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,419
privileges to the account that uses has

592
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:09,179
that password storage group policy so

593
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:10,710
Microsoft has a road map called social

594
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:12,770
security privileged access for a map

595
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,850
I've got the link there at the bottom

596
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:17,460
there's really no reason not to

597
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,689
implement this for any organization the

598
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,370
very first step here is separate

599
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,520
accounts for admin and productivity

600
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:25,039
tasks the next step is just in time

601
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,179
local admin past

602
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,470
Microsoft's got a free tool we're going

603
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,630
to cover a bit more in depth here on the

604
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,120
next slide called local administrator

605
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:34,289
password solution that allows for random

606
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,168
and unique passwords for all

607
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:38,610
workstations and servers how the third

608
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:40,889
phase here is a privileged access

609
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:44,309
workstation we'll cover that more in

610
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:48,000
depth in a second so part of the

611
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:51,570
security privilege access material is a

612
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,970
true privilege access model so usually

613
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,799
most of environments we see IT admins

614
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,539
have two accounts they have a regular

615
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:59,490
user account that they might use to

616
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,559
check their email and surf the web and

617
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,970
then they have a highly privileged

618
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:05,100
account they may use to access a bunch

619
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:08,250
of servers so no infrastructure

620
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:10,439
throughout the environment this model

621
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,330
instead of having two accounts you would

622
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,549
have up to four accounts you would have

623
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,470
an unprivileged user account you would

624
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:18,629
have a workstation admin account X

625
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:21,120
server admin account and then a domain

626
00:25:18,629 --> 00:25:22,649
admin account and this is key the domain

627
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,149
admin account can only be used on the

628
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:26,580
domain controllers it can't be used to

629
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:28,350
sign up on anything else so the first

630
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,120
step of implementing this type of access

631
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,678
model is actually creating the separate

632
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,209
accounts for users making sure they're

633
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,370
pushed out to the local administrators

634
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:37,919
groups on their own workstations and

635
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,449
servers the second part of this is

636
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,679
pushing out route policies which

637
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:45,419
actually restrict those tr0 accounts

638
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,070
when logging in to tier 1 or tier 2 and

639
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,730
the tier 1 accounts from logging on to

640
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,990
tier 2

641
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,970
we'll cover why that's important

642
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:54,090
important here the influencer security

643
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:57,620
section so separate administrative

644
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:59,668
accounts you should really have a

645
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,709
standard user account that used for

646
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:03,779
high-risk activities preferably on a

647
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,450
system that is not the system used to

648
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:07,679
manage everything in the environment and

649
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,480
then you should have administrative

650
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,809
accounts preferably a tiered model that

651
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,789
we mentioned before so we mentioned the

652
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:15,658
lapse earlier this is a free tool for

653
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:17,429
Microsoft

654
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:20,429
you know it's managed through Active

655
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:22,889
Directory group policy and it allows you

656
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:24,539
to set a unique and random password on

657
00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:26,100
all members server from the workstations

658
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:28,470
for the built-in local administrator

659
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:31,110
account the reason this is important

660
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,600
like we talked about that malware and

661
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:36,299
threat actors using tools like many cats

662
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,340
earlier if you use a shared password for

663
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:40,200
the local admin account on multiples

664
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,178
all it takes is one system to get

665
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,710
compromised and then the threat after

666
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:45,870
can pivot to every other system that has

667
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,020
that shared password so you can mitigate

668
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,309
that by using this free tool that

669
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,080
ensures the local admin passwords are

670
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,490
all random and unique if the threat

671
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,779
actor dumps the password hashes they

672
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:58,679
can't fit it to other systems because

673
00:26:54,779 --> 00:27:00,480
it's unique to that system there's a

674
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,770
technique called Kerberos team we're not

675
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,200
going to for the sake of brevity we're

676
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:06,270
not going to cover too much in depth but

677
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,760
what you need to know to really mitigate

678
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:12,059
this you really need to focus on

679
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,830
securing your service accounts you

680
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:15,299
should be running at least another whole

681
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,299
domain and force function to use this

682
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:19,980
but you can have random and unique

683
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:23,129
passwords managed through Active

684
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,690
Directory or your service accounts if

685
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,029
for whatever reason you have service

686
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,909
accounts that may be a vendor requires

687
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:31,649
to be set up like a regular user account

688
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:33,960
we recommend that you ensure that those

689
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:37,110
service accounts at least have a 25

690
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,700
character link password they should be

691
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:42,570
random unique and stored in a password

692
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:44,340
manager it's also you can also use

693
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,350
fine-grained password policies to sit

694
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,840
longer your password length requirements

695
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,399
for service accounts so you can have a

696
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,350
minimum 25 character password

697
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,830
requirement for service accounts while

698
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:59,760
you have a password policy that was less

699
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:01,439
stringent for your regular users so we

700
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,299
mentioned privileged access workstations

701
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,850
earlier so this is a term Microsoft

702
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:08,879
refreshes pause it's basically a

703
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,770
hardened and lockdown workstation for

704
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,610
your IT admins so this would be a

705
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:17,850
lockdown system your IT admin would use

706
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:20,279
and then so part of your heavens

707
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,590
workflow might be they have a virtual

708
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:24,630
machine that they run from their bot

709
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:27,090
that they can do high-risk activities

710
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:30,270
like surfing the web checking email and

711
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:32,580
then from their physical host they only

712
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:34,049
use that to do administrative activity

713
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,658
so they're not surfing the web they're

714
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:40,889
not checking email from that physical

715
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:42,990
host okay we're going to move on to

716
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:46,169
endpoint security we've got a lot on

717
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,850
this slide so something I see pretty

718
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:49,470
much everywhere I go is default

719
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,600
credentials for devices so there's gonna

720
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,530
be printers network switches cameras

721
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,500
DVRs

722
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:57,450
access control systems UPS devices I

723
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,300
always find at least one device with the

724
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:02,190
bar credentials everywhere I go

725
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:05,220
printers is pretty much every time 5% of

726
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:07,050
the time we see no no we're limited

727
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,550
Network segmentation no management

728
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,230
network sometimes it's a flattened at

729
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:12,180
work sometimes they get different

730
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,430
subnets for servers or workstations but

731
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:17,280
there's no ACLs at the network level or

732
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,380
there's no hosts paste ACLs so once you

733
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,420
gain a foothold on any system the

734
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,260
network is pretty easy to move to other

735
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:27,360
systems that are more critical aspects

736
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:30,120
end-of-life systems unsupported software

737
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,270
so we commonly see it on supported

738
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:36,560
operating systems unsupported databases

739
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:39,030
sequel support third party applications

740
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:43,290
patch management this includes third

741
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:44,940
party applications we also see two

742
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:47,760
patches that every organization should

743
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,710
ensure that our patch our ms 1710 and

744
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,960
blue key because those are were mobile

745
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:54,960
microsoft burn abilities if these are

746
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,340
vulnerabilities that if malware gets

747
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,410
have to hold in your environment a

748
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,730
competitive it can move laterally to any

749
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:02,100
instant systems that don't have these

750
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:04,080
patches apply and we're going to talk

751
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,760
here in just a minute about how just

752
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,240
having one on patch system can fit your

753
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,040
entire to manifest we also see overly

754
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,110
permissive file share permissions so a

755
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,110
common technique that we use when we do

756
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:18,689
testing we had set up a unprivileged

757
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:21,179
user account so it's just a regular user

758
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:23,550
and then we scan the entire network for

759
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,710
file shares to see what file shares that

760
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:28,879
user has read and write access to so

761
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:31,680
it's representative of what you know the

762
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,850
every domain user has read or write

763
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,770
access to in the environment we also see

764
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:39,899
a lot of issues within one security so

765
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:42,020
how does the systems that are either

766
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:45,060
missing antivirus or endpoint security

767
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:47,400
they get out of big definitions or out

768
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:50,220
of out-of-date versions of the ages so

769
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,660
if you're not actively maintaining your

770
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,340
endpoint security software you can

771
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,770
actually introduce earn abilities to

772
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,120
your environment so endpoint security

773
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,710
software they can have crippled

774
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,600
escalation vulnerabilities occasionally

775
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:02,130
they have remote code execution

776
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,269
vulnerabilities so if you've got an

777
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,129
outdated Symantec

778
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:09,580
my manager for example you might be

779
00:31:06,129 --> 00:31:13,449
exposing your endpoint management server

780
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:15,249
to to compromise we also see full disk

781
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,459
encryption this one from laptops we see

782
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:20,679
that pretty much everywhere we go legacy

783
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:23,320
protocols that are enabled as soon so

784
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:26,080
these protocols include SMB version 1

785
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,399
and then llm in our Netvibes name

786
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,070
services we're going to cover that here

787
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:31,899
just a bit more depth in a minute we

788
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,809
also see that there are no system

789
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:37,859
hardening baselines apply so Microsoft

790
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:40,570
has a free toolkit that are basically

791
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:42,129
group policy objects um you can import

792
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,439
and it's their recommendations for

793
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:47,559
locking down those the Windows operating

794
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:49,739
system I've got a slide later on that

795
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:52,869
I'll link to for your reference for that

796
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:53,379
we also see no hardening for Microsoft

797
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,379
Office

798
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:58,299
so no restrictions for macros these days

799
00:31:56,379 --> 00:32:01,629
now where's commonly deployed to

800
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:03,759
environments using macro malware so you

801
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:08,399
can actually use group policy to ensure

802
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:10,029
that users cannot enable macros for

803
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,829
documents download from the internet

804
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:13,690
that's a really good control you can

805
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:17,379
implement to reduce your exposure to

806
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:19,329
that type of malware we also see more

807
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:21,728
commonly no insight into PowerShell

808
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:24,519
scripting activity in the environment so

809
00:32:21,729 --> 00:32:26,469
thread actors and as well as malware are

810
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:28,539
using PowerShell and other common

811
00:32:26,469 --> 00:32:30,549
administrative tools to achieve their

812
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:33,158
objectives so you should be you should

813
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:34,389
have some insight into PowerShell in

814
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,909
your environment either using an

815
00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:40,738
endpoint security platform or just

816
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:46,450
enable PowerShell logging through policy

817
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:47,919
so by default in Windows whenever it

818
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:50,559
needs to resolve a name to an IP address

819
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,659
that's going to use DNS but it fails to

820
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,789
resolve using DNS it'll fall back to

821
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:58,359
using a legacy protocol like llm and our

822
00:32:54,789 --> 00:33:00,789
NetBIOS so on the left there you can see

823
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:03,549
a diagram this is kind of what it looks

824
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:05,259
like the computer makes me send out a

825
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:07,869
broadcast that says hey who has file

826
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:09,429
server and the DNS servers like I don't

827
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:11,708
I don't have an a rivet I can't resolve

828
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:13,479
that and then sends a broadcast out to

829
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:15,789
every computer on the network say hey is

830
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:17,530
anybody a file server if I'm the bad guy

831
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:20,020
and

832
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:21,970
I don't even have to have my physical

833
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,710
device connected to the network I could

834
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:25,840
just have a foothold on a system of

835
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,150
compromised and there's a free a free

836
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,310
PowerShell tool called inve right there

837
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:32,050
they can run in PowerShell and to set

838
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:34,030
them to listen and wait for these

839
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:36,129
broadcasts that's a white for you to do

840
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:38,740
a relay attack so you can actually

841
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:40,180
authenticate to a system using the

842
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,460
credentials that are exposed in that

843
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:46,300
broadcast or you can crack the house

844
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:48,730
offline I'm actually I'm actually use

845
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,220
this tool to crack domain admin password

846
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:53,860
hashes so this is something you should

847
00:33:51,220 --> 00:34:00,580
be disabling it is disabled by default

848
00:33:53,860 --> 00:34:02,050
in Microsoft's security baselines so now

849
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,090
we're going to talk about malware that's

850
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:07,960
actually used some of these tools we've

851
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:10,779
talked about emu Ted and trick BOTS this

852
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,570
is a really advanced modular banking

853
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,790
Trojan that is caused some significant

854
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:17,350
impact to a lot of environments I'm

855
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:20,110
going to show you a kind of a diagram of

856
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:21,520
how this works so the way this works is

857
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:25,240
typically the user will receive a

858
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:28,120
phishing email it could be a macro work

859
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:30,250
document that's attached in the email or

860
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:33,399
it could be a hyperlink to onedrive

861
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:36,310
Google Drive Dropbox whenever the user

862
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:38,409
accesses that link and balance this

863
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:39,969
attachment when they open it it's

864
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,580
instructing them to enable macros

865
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:43,928
because it's protected and when they

866
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:47,379
enable macros it will launch a

867
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:51,129
PowerShell stager to download a binary

868
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:54,279
and executable this binaries the first

869
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:56,020
stage of the attack is a motet so it's

870
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,730
really good at establishing persistence

871
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,410
so it typically set some persistence

872
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,920
through scheduled tasks modifying the

873
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:05,049
registry it will download and grab

874
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,580
additional payloads usually the veil of

875
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:09,640
the whole download is called trick box

876
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:12,730
now this I've encountered this malware

877
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:15,520
two different times for incident

878
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:17,770
response and both times the entire

879
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,720
domain was compromised every computer on

880
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:21,780
the network every workstation every

881
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,060
member server and the domain controllers

882
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:27,610
were compromised by this malware so it

883
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:30,400
typically disables antivirus it harvests

884
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:31,600
data so if users are storing credentials

885
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,750
in their browser it will

886
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:37,630
oh great it it dumps the credentials of

887
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:40,240
the logged in user if the user is a

888
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:41,890
domain admin it will dump the

889
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,330
credentials and then use that to move

890
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,940
laterally in the environment that means

891
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:48,130
that you have a system with the domain

892
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,690
admin logged in on an effective system a

893
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:51,550
trick block it will it will still those

894
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:55,510
credentials and will infect every system

895
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:57,760
on the network it will also sprint by

896
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:59,800
brute forcing the local admin password

897
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,530
so if you don't have random unique

898
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,560
passwords using a tool like laughs or if

899
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:07,090
you're not blocking local admins from

900
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,490
you do in a network logon they can pivot

901
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:12,700
that way as well if you have unpatched

902
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:15,609
systems like that are missing ms 17 the

903
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:19,540
patch grandma 1710 it can exploit those

904
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:21,550
systems as well so the final stage in

905
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,050
this is hatching here is it drops a

906
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:27,130
payload called right

907
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:29,020
that's a ransomware binary so you go you

908
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:30,370
basically end up with credentials of all

909
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,130
your users in your environment

910
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:35,410
exfiltrated and then all the systems

911
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:40,030
getting encrypted simultaneously with

912
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:42,670
ransomware now I've seen in some press

913
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:44,620
releases before work organizations state

914
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:47,170
that their system for him--it ransomware

915
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,509
but no data that was exfiltrated that's

916
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,160
a pretty big assumption to make because

917
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,420
if they're any ones saying crypt your

918
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,799
data they probably were able to

919
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:57,160
exfiltrate your data as well

920
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,660
something I wanted to point out so this

921
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,009
is a playbook I would highly encourage

922
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,509
you to especially if you're involved

923
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:03,490
with Incident Response efforts in your

924
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,140
organization you should have a playbook

925
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:09,399
for encountering this time this type of

926
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:11,350
malware you know and just as a reference

927
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,360
the organization that we responded to we

928
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:15,520
have to take every system offline the

929
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,250
network one at a time and clean clean

930
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,860
them up because it is very good at

931
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,390
propagating throughout the network you

932
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,710
have to change passwords there every

933
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,379
account that's been compromised and you

934
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:28,170
got to take them offline to clean them

935
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,580
you cannot be logging into

936
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:32,350
infected systems with highly privileged

937
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:36,549
accounts because it will propagate using

938
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:39,250
those account credentials so we're going

939
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:41,320
to cover common security controls now so

940
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,170
we typically will assess the

941
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,460
effectiveness of security controls like

942
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:48,190
stress filtering so

943
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,780
is filter filtering that's in place on

944
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:52,510
your network perimeter at the firewall

945
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:54,309
helps you the internet so we typically

946
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,589
see pretty good ingress filtering sub

947
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:58,089
filtering coming into the organization

948
00:37:55,589 --> 00:38:00,819
but typically no restrictions on the

949
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:03,910
morale of the organization you really

950
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:05,730
should only be allowing traffic that's

951
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:08,710
necessary for business purposes outbound

952
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:10,599
or at the very least so there's two

953
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,760
different approaches whitelisting is

954
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:14,650
only allowing outbound was necessary for

955
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,900
business purposes and then blacklisting

956
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,490
is blocking what you know to be bad at

957
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,170
the very least you should be blocking

958
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:22,839
common ports of protocols that are used

959
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:25,510
by threat actors outbound to the

960
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:27,460
Internet an adequate web content

961
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:30,970
filtering so we are typically find that

962
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:33,670
the web content filter isn't configured

963
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,828
as strong as it could be so some web

964
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:38,440
content filtering vendors allow for you

965
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:40,660
to block on categorized websites so

966
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,369
through actors are they spin up new

967
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,170
domains all the time and there's kind of

968
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:45,880
this lag in between whenever they spin

969
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,700
up new domains and when they're

970
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,410
categorized as malicious by the vendor

971
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,359
if you're blogging uncharacterized or

972
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:55,509
newly seen domains that's a way to kind

973
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:57,220
of mitigate your risk there we also see

974
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:58,869
organizations that either they don't

975
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:01,029
have intrusion detection capabilities

976
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:06,010
for they have an IDs but no-one's

977
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:08,319
monitoring maintained also security

978
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,849
alerts if you're not fine-tuning your

979
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:12,640
security controls and you're getting a

980
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:15,400
bunch of noise more often than not these

981
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,140
security alerts end up being ignored we

982
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,240
also see that there's no advance email

983
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:24,578
protection so Microsoft for office 365

984
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:26,049
they have something they call office 365

985
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:28,630
advanced threat particularly threat

986
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:30,849
protection you can set up safe

987
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:32,890
attachments policies which ensure that

988
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:35,380
any attachment delivered in an email

989
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:37,029
gets scanned and a malware sandbox

990
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,359
before it gets delivered to the target

991
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:43,450
and also safe links policy so this is

992
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:45,880
URL rewriting so if there's a email a

993
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:48,339
user receives that has a URL it will get

994
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,589
rewritten to a Microsoft address address

995
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:51,660
in and then it gets scanned to see if

996
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:54,009
it's hosting malware

997
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:57,190
before the user is allowed to click

998
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:58,540
through that URL there's other vendors

999
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,210
out there that have similar type

1000
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,740
capabilities

1001
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:04,640
including fruit point and semantics I'm

1002
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:06,319
just using Microsoft as an example we

1003
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,520
also see that there's no formal security

1004
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:12,320
awareness program us at the time we also

1005
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,509
see internet facing hosts or separate

1006
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,950
not separating into a DMZ if it's on if

1007
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:17,510
it's internet facing you really want

1008
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:19,160
that in a DMZ and you want to have

1009
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:23,510
filtering in place between your DMZ or

1010
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:25,430
your internal network so some commercial

1011
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,320
solutions we can we recommend for

1012
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:30,080
security awareness training no before is

1013
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,330
a favorite of ours our preferred burner

1014
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,400
Billy scanners tell Billy messes or

1015
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:37,310
advance DNS protection we highly

1016
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,500
recommend Cisco umbrella advanced email

1017
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:41,299
protection platforms include office 365

1018
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,920
advanced threat protection and then

1019
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:46,000
proof points equivalent is there

1020
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:48,140
targeted attack protection platform and

1021
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,359
now the moment you've all been waiting

1022
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,430
for for free tools and informative

1023
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:54,250
resources so the improvement of

1024
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:56,779
resources will start there a top there

1025
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:59,890
us-cert that's the United States

computer medic emergency readiness team

1027
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:05,990
they've got a lot of good alerts and

1028
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:09,500
advisories on ongoing incidents and

1029
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:11,330
networking pains Incident Response

1030
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,640
playbooks if you go to insert a response

1031
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,890
comm there are some replay books for

1032
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,930
different types of Incident Response

misen Aereo's including malware denial

1034
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:22,569
of service mailbox compromised however I

1035
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,920
highly recommend you check that out

1036
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:27,560
showed in this is a kind of like the

1037
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,060
searching engine for the internet if

1038
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,650
you've never used it I highly recommend

1039
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,810
you check this out this is actually a

1040
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,790
tool that will use the supplements our

1041
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:36,290
permeability standards and discovery

1042
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:39,170
scanners when we do an assessment and

1043
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:42,770
I'm actually one time when I was doing

1044
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:46,760
an assessment I typed in the IP address

1045
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:49,670
of our client had a their their ISP

1046
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,900
router has some ports and protocols that

1047
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,369
were going to face and that looked a

1048
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,560
little suspicious to me so whenever I

1049
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:56,210
put in the IP and showdown it did a

1050
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,799
banner banner grabbing on the

1051
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,599
point-to-point tunneling protocol and

1052
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,800
told me when I looked at it said that

1053
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,960
the hostname was hacked

1054
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,300
so we inferred from that that our

1055
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,859
clients ISPs router have been

1056
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,910
compromised because they were user

1057
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:12,420
default credentials another free tool

1058
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:15,720
you can check out and

1059
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:18,690
is an email exposure texpro so this is a

1060
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:20,669
free tool from no before this will check

1061
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:23,640
to see which users in your organization

1062
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:26,360
of have their work emails that have been

1063
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,799
exposed in various data breaches I

1064
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:31,620
mentioned tenable necess is of everybody

1065
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,150
scanner on a previous slide if you don't

1066
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,950
have the budget for commercial

1067
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:37,970
variability scanner check out open boss

1068
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:42,120
it's an open-source run ability scanner

1069
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:44,399
also a free DNS security services quad

1070
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:46,740
knife there's no monitoring with this

1071
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,170
there's no reporting but you can you

1072
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:52,109
know you can benefit from their threat

1073
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:53,640
intelligence to stop queries to

1074
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:56,160
malicious domains in your environment

1075
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,600
I mentioned the Microsoft security

1076
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,850
compliance will give this is a free

1077
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,220
toolkit for Microsoft which allows you

1078
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:04,890
to implement security best practices for

1079
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:07,350
workstations servers and Microsoft

1080
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:08,879
Office you can the group policies are

1081
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:11,940
ready to go you just have to import them

1082
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,770
and tune them to your environment the

1083
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,870
center program security has a secure

1084
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:19,020
suite membership membership and this is

1085
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:20,880
free public sector clients it's kind of

1086
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:24,480
the agreement Microsoft security on

1087
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:28,800
school kid account security tools we

1088
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:31,260
mentioned weak passwords that no before

1089
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,690
has a free tool called password exposure

1090
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:35,370
tips that you anybody can use no

1091
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:37,470
technical knowledge whatsoever to use it

1092
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:39,029
you can get a list of all the users in

1093
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:41,339
your environment that have weak

1094
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:42,860
passwords highly recommend you check

1095
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,180
that out

1096
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:46,650
Microsoft's free tool a local

1097
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,480
administrator password solution that's

1098
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:50,880
the tool that ensures that all passwords

1099
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:55,170
are random and unique for your member

1100
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:58,800
workstations and servers some additional

1101
00:43:55,170 --> 00:44:01,770
free security tools so from no before

1102
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,100
they have a few different tools one is

1103
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:06,360
efficient alert button so this is a

1104
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,990
add-in that you can install an Outlook

1105
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:11,340
that gives your users a button in their

1106
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:13,470
Outlook proven they can click and it

1107
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:16,440
will automatically send a user or it

1108
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:19,620
will send a email to whatever

1109
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:22,470
distribution group you specify to inform

1110
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:24,180
them of a suspicious email they've got

1111
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:25,649
another tool called second chance so

1112
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,509
this is a tool that

1113
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:28,980
when your users click a hyperlink in

1114
00:44:27,509 --> 00:44:30,690
their email they'll get a pop-up that

1115
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,430
says hey are you sure you want to click

1116
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:34,619
through this link that gives them a

1117
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:36,868
second chance to back out of clicking

1118
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:39,390
that's a spit of sling they've also got

1119
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:40,499
a free ransomware simulator you can run

1120
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,690
in your environment and see how

1121
00:44:40,499 --> 00:44:45,629
effective that your endpoint security is

1122
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:48,839
at stopping 16 different ransomware

1123
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:50,999
scenarios if you don't have the budget

1124
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:53,788
for these some of these tools there's a

1125
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:58,348
free fishing platform you can use open

1126
00:44:53,789 --> 00:44:59,460
source tool called go fish and also if

1127
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:02,099
you don't have the budget for security

1128
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:04,200
awareness videos cope fence has some

1129
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:06,359
free computer-based training that you

1130
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:11,730
can download and import into a LMS

1131
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:14,749
system I know I covered a lot so does

1132
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,749
anybody have any questions

1133
00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:25,049
you know a program is that only for the

1134
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:27,269
administrator username or good I think

1135
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:32,249
you're supposed to disable all those new

1136
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:33,959
users okay so um Microsoft used to

1137
00:45:32,249 --> 00:45:36,749
recommend disabling the built-in

1138
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,700
administrator account for workstations

1139
00:45:36,749 --> 00:45:40,589
and servers they now they now no longer

1140
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:44,759
recommend doing that because that free

1141
00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:46,319
tool lapse manages them so lapsus is

1142
00:45:44,759 --> 00:45:48,359
managed from Active Directory so

1143
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:50,849
whenever you log into Active Directory

1144
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:52,680
and you go and look at a computer object

1145
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:55,799
if you look at you know all the

1146
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:57,808
attribute editor tab you would just have

1147
00:45:55,799 --> 00:45:59,700
the password that is unique and random

1148
00:45:57,809 --> 00:46:02,609
for that computer there and then they've

1149
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:04,169
got a power show tools you can you can

1150
00:46:02,609 --> 00:46:06,930
run a power show and they want to get

1151
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:09,089
the password for that year and I've got

1152
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,859
a GUI so they've got a lab see why you

1153
00:46:09,089 --> 00:46:12,328
can run you just type in the computer

1154
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:14,730
name and click search and then it tells

1155
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:16,079
you what the password is for the local

1156
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:19,890
administrator account on that computer

1157
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:21,749
and then Microsoft also recommends that

1158
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:24,598
ukalaka local accounts or may not do a

1159
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:27,680
