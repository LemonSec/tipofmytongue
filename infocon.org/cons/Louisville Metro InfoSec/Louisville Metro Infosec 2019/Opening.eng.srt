00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,560
welcome everybody we're gonna go ahead

2
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,180
get started we started a few limits late

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,038
on the opening ceremony so we could make

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,198
sure everybody downstairs I could finish

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,269
talking to the sponsors and get up here

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,260
and get some food so people are still

7
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,909
rolling in but we're gonna go and kick

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,250
it off so we can keep the rest of the

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,320
schedule on point for the rest of the

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,930
day so I just want to say thank you all

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,809
for coming and supporting the local Issa

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,190
chapter and welcome to the Louisville

13
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,089
Metro campus state conference sponsored

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,579
by checkpoint

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,500
thank you checkpoint a few things I just

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,320
want to cover first thing

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,070
can everybody hear me in the back cool

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,280
awesome

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:55,980
if you can't ever just yell at me so

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,690
first thing is a Kentuckiana that's the

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,000
group that is hosting this I am the

22
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,239
president of the local chapter we do

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,339
this to raise money for our chapter so

24
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,679
we can continue throughout the year we

25
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,500
do pretty much quarterly trainings at

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,570
least at least three times a year we've

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,780
done some very successful ones this year

28
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,130
on what web application hacking I think

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,869
the first one we did was on password

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,539
cracking that actually met in last year

31
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,350
but we've done quite a few things and we

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,210
were able because of events like this

33
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,158
and making money for the chapter we're

34
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,639
actually able to sponsor students who

35
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:36,509
would not normally be able to afford

36
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:38,909
top-notch training like that and so we

37
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,430
sponsored about 30 seats for students

38
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,149
who normally wouldn't be able to afford

39
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,290
that type of in-depth training so that's

40
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,009
something we're really proud to do and

41
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,869
also we subsidize the ticket prices now

42
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,649
not only do our members get a discount

43
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,479
so that's incentive to join but we also

44
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,009
subsidize it for everyone

45
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,710
that's one of the kind of goals of the

46
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:05,520
chapter is to have top-notch training at

47
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,949
low prices a lot of people charge $500

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,449
and up for a day's training for anything

49
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,900
that's you know really really worthwhile

50
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:16,480
and we charge about a hundred of

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,249
$125 $150 something along those lines so

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,810
it's something we're kind of dedicated

53
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:22,269
to so the more money we make from events

54
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,670
like this we can try to give back and we

55
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:26,859
will continue to keep trying to increase

56
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:32,138
the number of trainings and things that

57
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:34,810
we offer so that said become a member if

58
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:37,569
you all have any questions about joining

59
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,939
up or benefits of becoming a member of

60
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:43,298
the International Issa or the local

61
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:44,769
chapter please talk to just about

62
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:47,439
anybody that has one of the the black

63
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:49,120
bars at the top of their badges or or

64
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,549
myself I might be running around a

65
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,810
little crazy today though so but feel

66
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:54,659
free to come up and to us to talk to us

67
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,280
about it

68
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:00,548
this is a screenshot from Eventbrite we

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,959
sold out completely which is amazing the

70
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:04,840
venue's a little smaller than what we're

71
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,159
used to we didn't miss last year so I

72
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,889
wanted to make sure we kind of started

73
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,689
back small and make sure we did it right

74
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:13,269
we didn't want to do a subpar event so

75
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:16,358
hopefully this will be a wonderful day

76
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:20,379
everybody will be you know pleasantly

77
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:22,180
surprised and enjoy the day so one of

78
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:23,828
the things is we had a lot of turnover

79
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,370
in the chapter leadership with people

80
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:29,979
having personal issues come up moving

81
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,329
this that in the other so we've got a

82
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:36,000
kind of mostly a new group so I think

83
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:38,949
only two people that are on the

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,319
conference board had ever actually done

85
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:43,989
a conference before so we're learning a

86
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,849
little bit as we go but we're already

87
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:47,169
have a lot of notes for next year

88
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,268
obviously we're going to need a bigger

89
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:51,129
venue because we had about a hundred

90
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,810
people hitting us up asking if they

91
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:54,909
could come today after we've already

92
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:58,540
sold out so that's a good problem to

93
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:59,679
have I guess so our diamond sponsor is

94
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,709
gonna run through the sponsors here real

95
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,590
quick checkpoint they are our diamond

96
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:07,780

00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:17,440
every dollar that comes in we try to use

124
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:19,629
as effectively as possible to give

125
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:25,240
everybody as much bang for the buck as

126
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:27,310
we can make happen so that said we've

127
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,130
got the morning keynote like I said is

128
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,110
sponsored by checkpoint so they'll have

129
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,210
a introduction coming up here shortly

130
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,060
James Trachsel will be talking about

131
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,940
preventing mobile cyber attacks we've

132
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,360
got mark Lovelace who's been a keynote

133
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:47,919
in the past talking about real world

134
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,949
zero trust implementation and also an

135
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:56,020
exome is going to is sponsoring it so we

136
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:57,520
can have the speaker for lunch and the

137
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,299
closing keynote which is sponsored by

138
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,490
our local chapter

139
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,430
Harlan Compton is actually one of our

140
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,889
own members locally here and he's going

141
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,840
to be talking about surviving the modern

142
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:09,039
compliance minefield and this is a

143
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,659
little bit of a different format than we

144
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,039
usually do we've never had to my

145
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:14,379
knowledge I've been coming since about

146
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:16,870
2004 to these I don't think we've ever

147
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:21,219
had three keynotes so it will be sending

148
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:22,960
a survey out in a few days or so seeing

149
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:24,969
how you all like the format versus kind

150
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,739
of previous years if three keynotes are

151
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:30,520
good or if you'd prefer more of the

152
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:33,940
breakout talks so that'll be in the

153
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:37,630
survey so we can kind of fit your all's

154
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,870
needs next year so a little bit

155
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,790
information

156
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,310
so here on the second floor we've got

157
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,960
the ballroom obviously breakfast is in

158
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,100
the back if you didn't notice there's

159
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,919
also coffee and water lunch will be here

160
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:54,860
keynotes will be here and track one

161
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:57,410
tracks two through four will be on in

162
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,180
the basement and right in the middle of

163
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,340
everything is the sponsors on level one

164
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,900
along with registration and at the

165
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,510
registration desk we all registered this

166
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,070
morning is where your sponsorship bingo

167
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,960
cards will be turned in at the end of

168
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,400
the day make sure you put your name on

169
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,440
it it's always disappointing when you

170
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,020
get a drawing and there's no name on it

171
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,370
and so you might have missed your chance

172
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,890
we just go through there make sure the

173
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,750
different vendors there put the sticker

174
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,729
on there write your name on it turn it

175
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,400
in and we've got quite a few prizes that

176
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:28,040
is a Kentuckiana will be giving out and

177
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,419
then also vendors will also be having

178
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,010
there are a few of the vendors will also

179
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,660
have some giveaways around the end of

180
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:36,460

181
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:40,580
including bourbon so we are in Kentucky

182
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:42,260
so I just wanted I saw this going

183
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,359
through Twitter so I just thought it was

184
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,920
funny so I just wanted to post this up

185
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,560
so hopefully kicks off the morning with

186
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,460

187
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,290

188
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:55,070
