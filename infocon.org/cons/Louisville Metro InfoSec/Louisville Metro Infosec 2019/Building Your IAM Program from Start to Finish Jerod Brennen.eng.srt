00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,580
I'll uh get started you are go ahead

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:11,370
sweet mmm mornin folks appreciate you

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,610
coming here to start the day off

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,600
I'm Jarrod Brennan I am currently a

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,070
senior sales engineer at a sale point

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,699
and I've been any an access management

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,289
vendor over the course of the 20 years

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,510
that I've been doing this stuff I've

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:32,160
done day-to-day implementation

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,320
management I've had a couple of teams

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,929
that have been mine I've done pretty

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,690
risk assessments pentesting love without

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,750
pen testing a lot of down on the

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,040
enterprise side I've also got a lot of

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,440
consulting experience I hoping people

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,149
figure out how to do this stuff so what

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,239
I've put together today's it's kind of

18
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:54,570
the trifecta of this is what it's like

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,578
to do this stuff day-to-day we mixed in

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,980
with a blend of information that you'd

21
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,289
be provided by consultants teaching you

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,629
how to do this stuff mixed in with all

23
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,010
the other nerds and Geeks I get to talk

24
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:09,320
to on the back end or actually building

25
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:12,270
technology to address these challenges

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,119
early well no it would have been about

27
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,820
mid I guess in my career I was working

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,220
for a very large retailer in Columbus

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,860
Ohio and we were tasked with deploying

30
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:27,000
and managing and identity and access

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:30,840
management platform for 3,000 office

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,970
workers something like 60,000 retail

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,310
workers seasonless question right a

34
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,259
Fender works retail you know it's in and

35
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,079
out and our goal is to automatically

36
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,520
provision and deprovision accounts them

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,110
that they somebody showed up because

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,700
that this retailer people would show up

39
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,049
they would think they were going to do

40
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,670
one thing find out the job with

41
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,460
something else entirely and then quit

42
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,200
before orientation and stuff so we had

43
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,570
to have them a provision before they

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,619
showed up and then D provisions before

45
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,658
much time and we could only do that with

46
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:03,030
with the tech we deployed but I learned

47
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,130
a lot in that time and so what I want to

48
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,038
share with you today is just lessons

49
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,160
learned I don't know if the slides are

50
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,350
going to be available

51
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,270
after I I think the organizers are

52
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,600
putting them out on the website but if

53
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:19,120
not hit me up I'm real big one sharing

54
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,210
and teaching and so you can have this

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,630
stuff just let me know I have to get the

56
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:27,640
buzzword bingo out of the way and and

57
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,109
there is method to my madness here how

58
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,140
many folks if you look at your

59
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,600
organization what you do day to day when

60
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,820
it comes to identity how many of you are

61
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,220
making decisions as a company based on

62
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,810
digital transformation trying to move

63
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,830
faster trying to change how you engage

64
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:48,370
the customer alright how many of you are

65
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:51,030
more on the zero trust side right we're

66
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:54,040
we've expanded a little too quickly

67
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,900
maybe we've got some looseness in our

68
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,880
permissions and privileges and we're

69
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,280
trying to rein all that in in order to

70
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,799
contain possible threats to get ahead of

71
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,590
possible data breaches anybody making

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,060
those if I had asked which ones are

73
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,050
retail and which ones are government I

74
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,630
think I could could pick it to what I

75
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,870
learned early on before I went into

76
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,609
retail I was at a public utility the

77
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,190
public utility I worked for was very

78
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,540
risk-averse and the changes that they

79
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,820
made in their environment anytime we

80
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,790
deployed a technology it was to reduce

81
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,410
risk and in some cases right it's a

82
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,500
matter of physical safety right if

83
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,570
somebody gets into ascator Network and

84
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,280
screws around with nuclear reactors

85
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:40,120
that's a loss of life right that's a

86
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,650
disaster scenario as retailers right we

87
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,660
just sell t-shirts we just saw hammers

88
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,360
people are willing to move much more

89
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,790
quickly and take a lot more risks when

90
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,400
you are making changes to more than any

91
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,470
program it's critical that you

92
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,330
understand the people that you're

93
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,430
talking to in the different leadership

94
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,860
roles because not everybody's got the

95
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,750
same risk appetite you already have an

96
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,060
idea just from show of hands you already

97
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,370
have an idea of what messages are going

98
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,540
to resonate with your leadership keep

99
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,480
that in mind as we go throughout the

100
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,640
rest of the talk this one gets away from

101
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,869
leadership and gets more to the

102
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,930
day-to-day right the people who are

103
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,810
doing this stuff hands-on when you look

104
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,750
at your identity activities right all

105
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,819
the things you do around

106
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,830
do you feel that the people working on

107
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:28,819
that stuff are focused on high-value

108
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:31,800
activities or low value activities

109
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:34,889
anybody high-value doing more strategic

110
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,639
stuff anybody doing things that could be

111
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:41,460
automated with a very small shell script

112
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,870
so is both alright and that's great

113
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,080
that's probably the more realistic right

114
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:50,639
that that bell curve when I was a hiring

115
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:53,128
manager I hired people so that I can

116
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,120
train them to be good enough to not work

117
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:57,300
for me anymore

118
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,090
I know that I'm a curious person I like

119
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,620
to grow I like to learn one of the

120
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,330
reasons I've had some of the successes

121
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,580
I've had in my careers because I've had

122
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:09,060
the opportunity to work with people who

123
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,370
give me a chance to explore if you hire

124
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,779
somebody and then stick them in a job

125
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,300
where they're just reviewing logs all

126
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,650
day or creating Active Directory counsel

127
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,529
they're going to get bored and they're

128
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,698
going to leave but they're not going to

129
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:22,889
grow right they're not going to be able

130
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,259
to do the cool smart creative stuff they

131
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:28,050
were hiring to do in the first place um

132
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:31,740
that is a big factor when you're talking

133
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:34,250
about identity governance and identity

134
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,870
and access management when you start to

135
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,190
refine your program and fill things out

136
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,349
you can take people who are doing those

137
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,960
repetitive tasks and put them on the

138
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:46,589
cool stuff which has just for me it's a

139
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:51,659
personal thing it's so there's a lot of

140
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:54,330
value to that at a personal level before

141
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:55,500
I got into some of the how-to just want

142
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,930
to make sure we've all got some of the

143
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,639
same language because I know everybody's

144
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,469
coming from some different background

145
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,169
when I talk identity and access

146
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:06,690
management or identity governance and

147
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:10,948
administration I'm really talking about

148
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:12,389
people having access to things at its

149
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:14,699
simplest that's all we're talking about

150
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:17,339
it but it's not just like Active

151
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,240
Directory counts right it's somebody

152
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:21,479
needs a badge

153
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,210
somebody needs physical access to a

154
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:28,099
building whatever you're giving people

155
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:31,198
access to the ability to track that and

156
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:34,469
automate it is is really what that that

157
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,650
program looks like

158
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,240
so when I look at identity and this is

159
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,729
some of the language we use internal the

160
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,400
the company I'm with there are three

161
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:48,030
types of activities that I care about

162
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,669
join remover levers a joiner is when

163
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:53,250
someone enters into a relationship with

164
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:56,490
the organization the most common example

165
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:59,150
is you hire an employee but it's not the

166
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,470
only example right if you engage

167
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,760
contractors or consultants and you want

168
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,950
to put them on your network for a minute

169
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,659
before you take their access away

170
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:10,740
that's a joiner then you've got

171
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:13,050
suppliers partners volunteers interns

172
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,730
doctors nurses students I mean that

173
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,010
there's a whole population of people who

174
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,610
might not fit into that full-time

175
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,670
employee

176
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,170
bucket but they still need access to

177
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,910
things in order to do what you're trying

178
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,770
to do so when that relationship starts

179
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,140
out to joiner event when the

180
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:31,820
relationship ends right that's a lever

181
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:35,310
of it and that lever of that can get

182
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,990
messy I spent some time working in

183
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,580
higher ed right nobody ever leaves

184
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,919
higher ed right they just move to a

185
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:44,550
different area right they're either an

186
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:46,380
employee a student their alumni if

187
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,919
they're on the Med Center side and their

188
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,180
doctor patient nurse right it's

189
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:53,909
complicated and when people retire from

190
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,010
an organization they still may have some

191
00:07:53,910 --> 00:08:00,210
relationship for benefits and healthcare

192
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:02,070
right somebody goes on well you the end

193
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,870
of it right when they no longer need all

194
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,690
the access that's leaver but that middle

195
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:09,060
ground the mover is where something

196
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:12,330
changes in that person's job but they're

197
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:15,510
still actively engaged somehow which is

198
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,700
where I put what transfers and

199
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,349
promotions right somebody decides

200
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,469
they're fed up with IT and they want to

201
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:25,710
go work in legal right so now they need

202
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:28,590
a whole different batch of access if I

203
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:31,320
have somebody who goes on short-term

204
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,510
disability right or somebody who goes on

205
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,280
sabbatical maternity leave paternity

206
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,710
leave where they're not going to be

207
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,510
there for an extended period of time but

208
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:43,229
I don't just want to shut everything

209
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,939
down I want to maybe disable a couple of

210
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:48,090
things and pull them back understanding

211
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,279
those mover events is kind of tricky but

212
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,260
if you approach your identity program

213
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,850
saying look I'm going to put everything

214
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,620
that's happening into one of these three

215
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,140
buckets it's either a joint or mega

216
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,360
mover event or a lever event you'll find

217
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,040
that it's a lot easier to start to

218
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,080
identify about all the processes that

219
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,459
you need and it's a heck of a lot easier

220
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,680
when you're trying to communicate with

221
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,630
people outside of your team you don't

222
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,829
have the same depth of knowledge or

223
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,310
understanding that you're bringing to

224
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,730
the table

225
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,829
so there that's your I am primer the

226
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,150
first thing I recommend using when

227
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:21,660
you're building out your identity

228
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:23,850
program is seek first to understand so

229
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,410
take a look at all of the accounts right

230
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,820
this is we're not going out making any

231
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,660
changes we're just going out and doing

232
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,420
discovery

233
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,400
how are people accessing the things that

234
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,170
they're accessing well chances are

235
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,600
there's a username and password maybe a

236
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,279
multi-factor token somewhere that you

237
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,990
put the right combination together and

238
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,180
they can get on a linux box they can get

239
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,600
on the domain they can get into an

240
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,339
internal web app they can get into a

241
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,740
like an external software service web

242
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,720
app right if you start to look for these

243
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,080
accounts it's going to start to paint a

244
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,360
picture of what's in scope for your

245
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,970
identity program now and when I use the

246
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,400
word identity I'm being very deliberate

247
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:07,020
and identity is not an account right I'm

248
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:09,120
Jerry I have a couple of gmail accounts

249
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,800
I have more social media accounts than I

250
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,660
care to admit

251
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,280
I've got my work account on I've got my

252
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,750
online banking account I've got all

253
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,280
these different accounts that are

254
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,010
different usernames different passwords

255
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,360
but in the end of the day I am one

256
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,700
flesh-and-blood person and that's the

257
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:29,400
identity that's connected to all those

258
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:31,230
separate accounts by identifying all of

259
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,680
the accounts you're going to get a

260
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,360
better idea of how they will lock to an

261
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,089
identity so like I mentioned with the

262
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,209
joiner events we've got employees which

263
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:44,339
might be full-time part-time seasonal

264
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:47,060
employees which can get a little tricky

265
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:50,670
people who are still employed but are

266
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:53,520
away for a minute people retired alumni

267
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,740
all of these tend to be governed by HR

268
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,959
so Human Resources is going to say hey

269
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,540
come to us we're the folks you need to

270
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,099
talk to about those accounts overall map

271
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,250
them back to identities but there's a

272
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,410
whole population over here that HR as

273
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,620
nice as they are doesn't want anything

274
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,360
to do with right there they're busy with

275
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,650
benefits and health care and training

276
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,240
and all the things that are providing

277
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,449
all the services that they were hired to

278
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,320
provide for employees then now we've got

279
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:24,000
contractors consultants we've got

280
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,339
accounts that live at the Machine level

281
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,200
right like if you've got admin rights

282
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:29,490
you might have your regular day-to-day

283
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,660
accounting I mean you might have

284
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,540
accounts that give you elevated

285
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,890
privileges

286
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,540
you're going to have those built-in

287
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:39,839
admin accounts and some of the admin

288
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,459
apps if you're an IT in running system

289
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,110
all these things that HR doesn't want

290
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:46,140
anything to do with right that's not

291
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,450
their world and then customers is

292
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,670
another where we've got a whole

293
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,400
population of users who are accessing

294
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,410
more and more of our stuff but they

295
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,650
don't live in any of these environments

296
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,939
from an identity and access management

297
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:02,370
perspective you want to look at all of

298
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,870
them then make decisions about which

299
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,850
ones you want to Governor which ones you

300
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,370
want to address is anybody doing

301
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:11,370
anything with BOTS today our PA robotic

302
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,079
process automation I just started

303
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,020
playing around with uipath I've got a

304
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:19,050
bot I'm trying to build that does a sent

305
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,370
gathering for web just all publicly

306
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,319
available information you can get on the

307
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,940
web but I'm trying to automate it to a

308
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,220
point that I can send an email to a

309
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,230
gmail address and then the bottom kick

310
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:32,490
me back audio sent for the organization

311
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:34,140
on profile it's really a fun time to be

312
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,240
playing around with technology like that

313
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,800
because it's accessible to people like

314
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,130
me who I don't do it in my day to day

315
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,300
job I'm just doing it as a hobbyist

316
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:45,150
organizations that are deploying BOTS

317
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:48,540
are giving them access I mean that they

318
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:50,730
they become their own identity but who's

319
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,469
managing that stuff right that's another

320
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,970
thing that HR if they they want to talk

321
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,310
to contractors who are flesh-and-blood

322
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,770
then they're not going to talk to your

323
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,329
our PA box either so they're a little

324
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,160
different than your system service

325
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:04,170
accounts but you want to find all of

326
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,990
these accounts and you want to figure

327
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,059
out who governs this who makes decisions

328
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,949
about policy

329
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:15,689
and turning the council on turning them

330
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:18,738
off start there and then you're going to

331
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:21,509
follow it's kind of like a breadcrumb

332
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:24,719
trail right because the accounts are

333
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:27,059
likely going to live in a directory now

334
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:30,479
most of them may be Active Directory you

335
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:32,459
might have apps that have like a local

336
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:34,549
database of accounts that people aren't

337
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:37,289
pointing all the internal apps to ad

338
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:38,579
software is serviced apps tend to have

339
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:40,379
their own accounts even if you're doing

340
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:42,539
federated authentication right like

341
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:44,009
single sign-on or Sam oh you're still

342
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:46,769
going to have accounts that live out

343
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:49,619
there that users might be able to log in

344
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:53,399
with and as you're tracking these you're

345
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:55,769
going to find that every counts got at

346
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,509
least username password maybe it's

347
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:59,099
hooking and then once they get in

348
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:01,439
they're going to have access to two

349
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:03,509
different types of data structured data

350
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:06,689
is all the database stuff right apps are

351
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:13,319
usually put on this unstructured data is

352
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:15,949
like file shares email and that's I saw

353
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:19,769
Bironas up there right I know there are

354
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:21,659
vendors in the space who have ways of

355
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:24,029
looking at that they can help explain it

356
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:25,649
anyone more detailed but this is what

357
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:28,409
we're saying what can these accounts get

358
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:29,879
you what can they access it's going to

359
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,559
be one of these two types of data and

360
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:33,109
then if you're going to find that there

361
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,238
are accounts that have the ability to

362
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:38,069
create and destroy system level objects

363
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:40,409
they can create and delete user accounts

364
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:43,378
these privileged accounts they can do

365
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:46,349
more and we talked about BOTS and

366
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:49,229
service accounts when you find all of

367
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:50,789
these accounts right eventually audit is

368
00:14:49,229 --> 00:14:51,629
going to come to you and say all right

369
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,848
so what can they do

370
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:56,459
or all the accounts that are turned on

371
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:59,579
supposed to be turned on are all the

372
00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:00,978
accounts that have access to things they

373
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:04,169
have the appropriate level of access

374
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:06,119
when we talk about all that the I am

375
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:08,609
universe all the things that are in

376
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:10,229
scope that are connected back to these

377
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:13,739
accounts that's what I'm talking about

378
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:15,899
all these activities so if you've got an

379
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:18,269
idea of all the accounts this is going

380
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,429
to lead you to well what systems do we

381
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:21,840
have a play and when I say system I'm

382
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:24,959
not talking about sir

383
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:28,290
I'm talking about a collection of like

384
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,270
processes technology that performs some

385
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,640
business function right like if you've

386
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:35,189
got an ERP system and their site what an

387
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,050
enterprise resource planning right ERP

388
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,450
systems are not just a box right there

389
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:41,760
there are a lot of bits and pieces start

390
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,790
to identify all of your systems does

391
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,700
anybody have like a CMDB in place today

392
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:50,189
configuration management database that's

393
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,529
shops that go down the ITIL path where

394
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:56,160
you're trying to build that consistency

395
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:58,050
of your your operations they tend to

396
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,329
grab this info so you may have people

397
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:02,520
your organization who already have a

398
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,700
complete list of all the systems that

399
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:08,220
are in scope talk to them to get some of

400
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,680
the info for your apps you're going to

401
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,589
want to look on Prem and SAS

402
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,900
I've done enough third party risk

403
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:19,460
assessments to tell you that even mature

404
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:22,529
security organizations have people using

405
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:25,140
Web Apps to host your data and to

406
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:27,120
perform some business function that IT

407
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,520
doesn't know about security doesn't know

408
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,710
about purchasing doesn't know about but

409
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,150
from an identity perspective that's in

410
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,700
scope for what you're trying to do with

411
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,770
your iam program if somebody's using it

412
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,140
for work and if there's an identity tied

413
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:44,579
to an account type to access its in

414
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:46,920
scope and then also local accounts as

415
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,180
well but you want to look around for all

416
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,740
of these things because this is where

417
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,000
the accounts are going to be stored and

418
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,760
you're going to start painting a picture

419
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,220
of what your environment looks like to

420
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,720
give some context to all the things that

421
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,600
people can access because not every

422
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,000
account is equal right you've got some

423
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,800
basic accounts that can only do two or

424
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,290
three things versus privileged accounts

425
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,889
that can do a lot of things in the

426
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:13,470
middle there's this notion of how do I

427
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,459
say like data classification and users

428
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,189
who have different levels of access

429
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,959
based on their job does that mean having

430
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:20,100
like a data classification policy in

431
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,179
place already

432
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:27,119
are you three tiers or four or five five

433
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:31,380
oh my gosh I was too complicated for me

434
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:34,620
if it works it works I'm a fan I've seen

435
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,990
the four tier model work pretty well

436
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,459
and I I hesitate to make it too complex

437
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,220
because finding that balance between

438
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,800
simplicity and security is a daily thing

439
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,480
with me at a minimum if you've not

440
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,919
explored data classification you should

441
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,080
have at least three tiers I don't know

442
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,970
how to get past this right you're going

443
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,750
to have data that everybody can see even

444
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,660
if they don't work for your organization

445
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,250
that's public your marketing website if

446
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,970
your marketing website isn't publicly

447
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:02,400
available you got bigger problems

448
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,720
internal data is stuff that if you work

449
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,960
for the company you're allowed to see it

450
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:11,520
right but if if you have certain data

451
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:14,600
sets that are restricted to like doctors

452
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,040
and nurses can only see medical records

453
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,750
people doing customer service can only

454
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,850
see credit card numbers and even they

455
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,820
can only see one at a time you're gonna

456
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,990
have certain data sets that are

457
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,260
regulated or that you want to protect

458
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:30,590
with a little extra vigor a little more

459
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,390
attention even if you're like

460
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,280
manufacturing some of your intellectual

461
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,590
property even though it doesn't have

462
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,629
like an external regulation bound to it

463
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,280
necessarily you might still say well we

464
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,770
don't want everybody in the company to

465
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,540
have access to that ID when you start to

466
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,910
find all these accounts and map them

467
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,710
back to systems you need to start

468
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,440
painting a picture which systems are the

469
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,670
most important because otherwise you're

470
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,710
gonna get stuck you're not going to get

471
00:18:53,670 --> 00:19:02,220
anywhere you've got to start start small

472
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:05,340
and build up from there what I have done

473
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:08,600
both in my consulting days and even now

474
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:11,270
in the the role that I'm in I do these

475
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:15,480
maturity assessments around identity

476
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:19,110
where it's really I'll talk about the

477
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:22,320
IDSA and just to say 25 questions about

478
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:24,959
what we should be doing in our identity

479
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,870
progress and instead of saying are we

480
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,940
going it yes or no I use the capability

481
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:32,040
maturity models five-point scale if

482
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,560
you've not done any maturity work it

483
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:38,490
comes out of the DoD I think it's a

484
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:42,389
Carnegie Mellon now but you've got five

485
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:45,360
tiers of how well are we doing it with

486
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,700
one being individual heroics literally

487
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,779
one person at the company

488
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,710
to do it I actually I was swinging a PCI

489
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:53,090
self-assessment for someone when I was

490
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:55,309
consulted they were trying to figure out

491
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,799
credit card security and wanted somebody

492
00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:00,908
to come in who've done it before and as

493
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:03,918
I'm doing it I got to the point about

494
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:06,379
terminating accounts if somebody has

495
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,909
left the organization PCI says you got

496
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:09,769
to turn off their access this is pretty

497
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:12,230
common and a lot of public standards and

498
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:13,999
frameworks so I asked my contact who

499
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,859
does this oh that's just wrong I don't

500
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:17,960
remember his name this one guy so we go

501
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:19,668
to his desk and he's not there it's

502
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,549
close to lunchtime something maybe just

503
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:25,369
left early for lunch so I asked the

504
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:28,730
person in the desk next to the empty

505
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:32,238
desk I'm like hey soso here no it's not

506
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:34,369
in today Oh is he in like later this

507
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:36,950
week no I think he's on vacation all

508
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:38,779
right well while he's out whose job is

509
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,619
it to turn off accounts when people

510
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,720
don't work here anymore

511
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:44,480
and I get this deer in headlights look

512
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,859
and the guy says I I don't know he's the

513
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,289
only one who's got access he's the only

514
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:49,789
one who knows how to do it number one

515
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:52,309
that's not going to pass an audit but

516
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:54,350
number two that puts you in a bad way

517
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:57,019
from a security perspective if somebody

518
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,820
leaves angry right and if somebody

519
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:00,470
leaves with intent to do harm leaving

520
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,859
their account on until somebody gets to

521
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:06,590
it just opens you up to risk and from a

522
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:08,899
maturity standpoint that's at level one

523
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,369
right that's you got one person who can

524
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:12,350
do it and you know the risks are there

525
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:14,809
but you're accepting them as soon as you

526
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:17,149
write this stuff down you get to level

527
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:18,769
two repeatable and it's repeatable

528
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:20,479
because you can hand that document to

529
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:22,700
somebody else and say here we do it and

530
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,830
that way if you're out you can have a

531
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,659
backup even hopefully if it's our first

532
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,869
time doing it as soon as you introduce

533
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:31,730
some sort of automation like PowerShell

534
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:34,158
script a Python script now you're at

535
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,080
that level three now not only do you

536
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,940
have consistency that you've taken human

537
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,980
error out of the equation it's

538
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,409
automatically gonna flow from A to B to

539
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,450
C as soon as you start tracking metrics

540
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:47,899
around the thing that you're trying to

541
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:50,029
do that's a four metrics give you the

542
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:51,289
ability to say hey we don't know this

543
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:53,809
stuff month-in month-out

544
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:55,879
are we getting better are we actually

545
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:57,499
doing what we set out to do if you don't

546
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:58,939
measure it at some point you're never

547
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:59,399
going to improve you might not even be

548
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,259
doing

549
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:04,320
you think you're going but if you get to

550
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:07,200
a level five optimizes that's when it's

551
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,689
so seamless that it's not disruptive to

552
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,719
the business at all right people things

553
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,639
just work stuff just flows if somebody

554
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:15,929
means access to a thing they get it and

555
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:17,428
they're able to do their job and then

556
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:20,009
when they don't need it it's gone and

557
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:22,469
they don't even notice so not every

558
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:25,049
organization once could be it a five

559
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:27,539
because you can imagine five can get

560
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:29,700
expensive which is why you've got to go

561
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:31,950
back and say well what's in scope what's

562
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,899
the most important if I can't do

563
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,429
everything unless you're one of those

564
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:38,668
rare organizations that has infinite

565
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:40,649
budget infinite staff if I can't do

566
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:42,239
everything then I'm just going to focus

567
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:43,289
on the stuff that's the most important

568
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:44,909
to the business or and what have you

569
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:49,200
focusing on the stuff that's a highest

570
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:51,450
risk 25 questions where I say where are

571
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,179
you today and where do you want to be

572
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:56,129
and then I give that to the leadership

573
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,169
and say all right these are your answers

574
00:22:56,129 --> 00:23:00,718
I'm not an auditor this is not my

575
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:01,950
opinion this is what you said what are

576
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:03,960
you going to do about it it's a great

577
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,909
tool and you can all do a

578
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,349
self-assessment every one of you can go

579
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:09,089
out and build your own little

580
00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:11,609
self-assessment tool in like an hour

581
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:12,928
it's just a spreadsheet and then have

582
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:14,489
that conversation with your leadership

583
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:17,279
and get to that point you've got an idea

584
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:19,679
of what you want to do so all of that is

585
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,450
discovered the accounts of systems the

586
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,909
data classification and the

587
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,279
self-assessment at that point you're

588
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:31,049
ready to start engaging people outside

589
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:33,869
of AI team I'd like to start with a

590
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:36,719
steering committee put people on the

591
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:38,279
hook with expectations that you're

592
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,789
actually going to participate we might

593
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:41,399
do it

594
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:44,639
once a quarter you might do it twice a

595
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:47,399
year depending on what folks are comfy

596
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:50,508
with it's all company culture even if

597
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:53,279
you just do it once in twenty twenty one

598
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:56,129
time you're already moving that that

599
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,200
needle right you're getting better you

600
00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:59,759
do want people with the technology then

601
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,899
on the steering committee because

602
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,210
they're going to be doing a lot of this

603
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:04,439
work but you want people with seeing

604
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,539
their title because they're going to be

605
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,129
the ones making decisions about who's

606
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:13,260
working on what and where are we

607
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:16,409
spending money CIO see so if you've got

608
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,810
educated people doing identity work you

609
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:21,810
you want them at the table some director

610
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:23,450
level where it could be the person over

611
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:26,159
ad it could be the person over

612
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,750
application development wherever you're

613
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:31,530
creating user accounts you want somebody

614
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:34,050
with that that director level vision at

615
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:35,399
the table and then you also want people

616
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:40,290
who are doing this stuff day to day

617
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,970
because what I find without fail is the

618
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,560
people at the top have a different

619
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,820
opinion or understanding of what's

620
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,030
happening than the people who are doing

621
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,439
it day to day and it's it's like a game

622
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,910
a telephone it's got to go through so

623
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,310
many layers that by the time it gets up

624
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:57,180
to the top that message isn't always as

625
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:58,770
clear as it can be unless you put all

626
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,000
these people in a room around the table

627
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,160
and have them talk it out

628
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,540
you also want people who are there from

629
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,960
the business because if your steering

630
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:09,870
committee is only IT you're you're

631
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,660
missing it you're you're not connecting

632
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:13,800
with the people that we're here to help

633
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,360
now the business you're gonna have line

634
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,399
of business people depending on what

635
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,159
your business is how you make money how

636
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:23,040
you provide goods or services to the

637
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,630
customer base you want some of these

638
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,830
line of business leaders there but you

639
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:32,010
also want ideally HR that's a given I

640
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:34,379
liked how illegal there especially as we

641
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,690
see more and more privacy laws coming to

642
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:40,110
bear legal role is becoming even more

643
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:44,160
and more important and audit auditors

644
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:46,199
are your friends I said engage audit

645
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,360
early and then say look we're trying to

646
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,950
get better is what we're doing lining up

647
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,330
with what you're looking for if you've

648
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,880
got a steering committee that's got a

649
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:56,669
pretty good mix of these people and you

650
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,530
give them that maturity assessment it

651
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:00,930
totally changes how you approach

652
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,700
building out your program because now

653
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:05,070
instead of fighting for one thing or

654
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,720
another thing they're saying oh yeah we

655
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,820
already decided this is the most

656
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,170
important thing to the company what do

657
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,620
we need to give you to make that happen

658
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:16,770
how can this happen this year next year

659
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:18,090
that's first step the committee and then

660
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,830
once you've got that committee you want

661
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:23,040
to ask some uncomfortable questions like

662
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:24,300
who owns identity do you have an answer

663
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,620
for that in your company who owns

664
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,620
identity in your company

665
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,190
yeah it's a it's a tough one and it's

666
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,860
not necessarily that there's just one

667
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:38,640
answer right human resources may say

668
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,350
look we own identity for employees but

669
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,790
we don't own accounts well good

670
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,169
all right now we're having having a

671
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:45,870
conversation now we're making progress

672
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:47,730
the accounts are all the technical teams

673
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,229
but you want to start with who owns

674
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,510
identity because this concept of

675
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,650
governance of making decisions about

676
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,750
what's going to happen

677
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:58,500
that's altima gonna roll up to an owner

678
00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:01,320
and I'm not a fan of ownership by

679
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,090
committee if you put two people and say

680
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,230
well they co-owned it then when

681
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,550
something goes south it's a

682
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,960
finger-pointing game right I thought

683
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,360
they were gonna do it no I thought they

684
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,950
were going to do it usually if you can

685
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,399
get down to like a title you got to put

686
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:18,080
a name but like director of HR VP of

687
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,450
engine if you get that level you'll get

688
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,939
a good list of owners and then you want

689
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:26,430
to start identifying some of the

690
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,070
activity what do you do around joiner

691
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:31,890
mover leaver events well who actually

692
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:33,780
does that who creates Active Directory

693
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:37,350
Council your company who resets

694
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:39,180
passwords who handles benefits right I

695
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,560
mean you already know the answers to

696
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,630
some of these questions but you want to

697
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,190
write it down because if you've got all

698
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,230
that information you've collected in the

699
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:48,330
discovery of all these systems and apps

700
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:51,030
you're gonna find that there are things

701
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,409
that you just assume for example that

702
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,600
people are going into your software

703
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,890
as-a-service apps and turning off

704
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:00,090
accounts for people who've left the

705
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:03,930
company are they so who's responsible

706
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:05,399
for what this is more like a technology

707
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:09,800
leadership are we a cloud first

708
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:12,210
organization that term is is very

709
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:14,159
distinct discovery specific meaning is

710
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:18,420
anybody here using that language

711
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:20,610
internally call first I dig it

712
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:26,010
how how long is your company been in

713
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:27,780
business five years yeah 50

714
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,990
ah so you're uh you're ahead of the game

715
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:32,820
um organizations that go cloud first I

716
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,920
would say you know a we're gonna put

717
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,950
stuff in somebody else's data center

718
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,930
right unless we absolutely have to

719
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,600
in ours when I talk to you I've got

720
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:43,250
friends up in Columbus who work for

721
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,040
startups that are in that five 10 year

722
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:47,300
range they don't want spinning platters

723
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,680
which I mean I know we don't have

724
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,210
magnetic there's so much anymore but

725
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,430
that's still the term that you write

726
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,900
they don't want any technology in-house

727
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,190
they want everything to be somebody

728
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,260
else's problem because they just want to

729
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,540
focus on the business and you're going

730
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,430
to see that trend continue and it's

731
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,750
going to impact how you do this I get

732
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:06,230
anything because if you're building your

733
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:07,730
program for the old way of doing thing

734
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,290
and your leadership is saying look we

735
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:13,460
don't want this stuff in our data center

736
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:15,670
we want everything in the cloud then you

737
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,020
need to bring that to bear with all the

738
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:20,810
activity you're doing and then how do

739
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:23,030
you prioritize the this list of three

740
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:25,610
and this list is very specific and there

741
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:27,200
are no ties if you ask this question do

742
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:29,600
not let somebody say well they're all

743
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,360
important no that's not the point I mean

744
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,010
one two three because risk reduction

745
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,899
tells me that I'm risk averse as an

746
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:38,810
organization I'm going to be more

747
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,760
interested in zero trust cost reduction

748
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:43,610
tells me that you're not so interested

749
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,530
in what I'm doing as long as the numbers

750
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:47,600
are better next year and then business

751
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:49,160
enablement tells me that digital

752
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,379
transformation better customer

753
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,790
experience is a message that's going to

754
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,790
resonate throughout the organization

755
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:57,889
when I worked utilities risk reduction

756
00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:00,050
and cost reduction fought for one and

757
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:03,080
two but risk reduction was number one

758
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:05,210
when I worked in retail business and

759
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,000
ableman was number one then cost

760
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:09,860
reduction than risk reduction you need

761
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,140
to understand one two three your

762
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,209
organization if you want the things that

763
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,910
you're telling them to click

764
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:19,000
otherwise you'll be you know talking

765
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:22,340
into the ether you won't you won't get

766
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,070
the response you're looking for I'm a

767
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:27,590
fan of writing things down I've worked

768
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:30,830
with people who intentionally avoid

769
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:33,949
policy I don't get it I once go to be a

770
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:36,550
teacher and what I learned in my student

771
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:39,860
teaching and I'm also a parent of three

772
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:43,129
one in college two in high school what

773
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,929
I've continued to learn by parenting if

774
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:47,630
you tell somebody something once that

775
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:49,160
doesn't mean they get it right if you

776
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,640
set an expectation

777
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,010
verbally

778
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,230
don't expect everybody to even interpret

779
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:57,900
it if you work in an organization that

780
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:00,930
has an international workforce you'll

781
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:03,870
also find that culturally even the word

782
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:06,180
yes or gestures like nodding have

783
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:08,489
different meaning to different people

784
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:13,140
based on where they grew up

785
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:14,850
so if you write things down about we we

786
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,340
know what's in scope we know what we

787
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,959
want to do let's start putting that on

788
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,330
paper now you've got a communication

789
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,710
mechanism for everybody right you can

790
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:24,960
put that out everybody in the

791
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:27,300
organization knows what their password

792
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,700
has to look like everybody knows that

793
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,200
they're not supposed to put its stuff on

794
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,510
their computer that doesn't belong there

795
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,520
and that they're only accessing things

796
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:37,379
that they need to do their job right put

797
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,360
this stuff down in writing you'll have a

798
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,150
maybe like an iamb policy data

799
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,310
classification policy you might put some

800
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,020
of this in acceptable use but as you're

801
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:49,409
starting to figure this identity thing

802
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:51,720
out take a minute and write it down what

803
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:54,390
I mentioned during the the maturity

804
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,360
assessment discussion IDs a identity to

805
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:59,160
find Security Alliance first does

806
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,800
anybody know who this group is is

807
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,390
anybody good enough all right

808
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,200
another question how many you have heard

809
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:09,030
of Oh wasp all right no boy that's like

810
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,550
half the room right there so for folks

811
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:14,820
who have a wasp open web application

812
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:18,690
security project has been around 20 plus

813
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:21,149
years and they do all things application

814
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:23,550
security it's a not-for-profit global

815
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,860
organization with tens of thousands of

816
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:28,290
people working on projects and

817
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,899
documentation and cheat sheets and if

818
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:34,020
you do any application security work a

819
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:37,110
wasp is your jam they are the people who

820
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:40,020
have all the stuff you need if you go to

821
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:42,979
buy an application security scanner and

822
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,940
it doesn't check for the OWASP top 10

823
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,550
chances are it's not going to make it

824
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,500
through the the vetting process because

825
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:51,060
they have become that integral to

826
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,890
application security that they're

827
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:58,260
they're kind of the standard for how we

828
00:32:52,890 --> 00:33:00,420
get our foundation in Web Apps the IDSA

829
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:04,290
is kind of like Oh wasp

830
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:07,350
year one but for identity so it's a very

831
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:09,870
new very young organization but it's not

832
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:12,240
for profit they've got a director who's

833
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:14,040
driving a lot of steering committees and

834
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,040
they've already published a framework

835
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,629
for how to do identity

836
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,580
they've got use cases they've got

837
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:23,310
reference architectures they've got

838
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:26,490
input from I don't know how many dozens

839
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:28,770
vendors and consulting companies people

840
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:31,680
who have been living this life for years

841
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:35,100
and because it's all these people it's

842
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,810
not one vendor saying do it our way it's

843
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,840
kind of a vendor agnostic know these

844
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,889
principles apply regardless of what

845
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,639
you're trying to do if you're doing

846
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:46,800
identity this stuff is is useful they've

847
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,320
got the twenty five controls I use with

848
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,570
my maturity assessment copy/paste

849
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,100
out of this framework and it's free you

850
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,600
don't even have to register to download

851
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,000
it it's there on their website IDs

852
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,709
Alliance so as you're building out

853
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,840
policies as you're doing that framework

854
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:03,210
and and you're talking to people about

855
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,919
identity take a minute to look at that

856
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,540
framework and start to bring some of

857
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,880
that language into your conversation

858
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:11,850
because if they continue when the

859
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,429
trajectory they're on then in five years

860
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:17,130
it's going to be like the go-to starting

861
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:20,300
point are you doing identity right yeah

862
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:22,860
actually lines right up with the IDSA

863
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:25,230
and then you want to write down some

864
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:27,419
relevant metrics if you want to improve

865
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:30,080
you have to measure I don't know a way

866
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:33,690
around it and I say relevant because

867
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:36,210
depending on your audience not everybody

868
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,010
cares about the same numbers right if

869
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:40,139
I'm looking at antivirus numbers and I

870
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:42,270
say yeah I've got ninety-nine point

871
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,009
seven percent coverage of all my Windows

872
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:47,909
machines that are running the latest

873
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:51,929
engine with the latest definitions your

874
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:54,569
CEO doesn't care never will they that as

875
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:58,860
soon as you said ad engine you lost them

876
00:34:54,570 --> 00:35:03,210
right but if you can say over the past

877
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:06,090
month we've had zero helpdesk tickets

878
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,890
related to malware which means that

879
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,690
we're not paying for people to clean up

880
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:12,240
problems that we've automated through

881
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,800
technology okay now I'm going to talk to

882
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,339
my language right you're saving money I

883
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,989
appreciate that but what

884
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:19,759
around the people who are doing this

885
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:21,559
stuff day to day they want to be

886
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:23,239
recognized for all the work that they're

887
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:24,829
putting into it and that's very you

888
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:26,930
should be going that if somebody is

889
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:28,960
spending all their day creating

890
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:31,700
accountants and resetting passwords

891
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,880
track that and give them credit and then

892
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:38,029
as you start to go down the path of

893
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,400
improving your iam program you can go to

894
00:35:38,029 --> 00:35:42,469
those numbers and say yeah we used to

895
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,119
have this many password resets a day

896
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:46,549
which resulted in this many phone calls

897
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:48,499
to the help desk when we automated that

898
00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:51,049
password reset functionality that number

899
00:35:48,499 --> 00:35:52,368
dropped now like that's a lot of time

900
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:54,259
and money we're saving we're able to

901
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:55,940
take those people in the desk that put

902
00:35:54,259 --> 00:35:57,140
them with more complicated tasks because

903
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,119
they're not doing something we could do

904
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:02,629
with a very small JavaScript shell

905
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:06,019
script so understand your audience and

906
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:08,210
then always always always try to figure

907
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:10,089
out what's the business problem that

908
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:13,700
this technical solution is addressing

909
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:16,430
right get in the habit of mapping stuff

910
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:19,669
back to the business to my point with

911
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:22,219
the antivirus right yeah security people

912
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:24,529
we don't want infected machines on our

913
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:27,019
network we understand at our core that

914
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:28,880
that is bad but people in leadership

915
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:31,939
just want their employees to be able to

916
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,960
do their job right so addressing that

917
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:38,859
antivirus a question in the language of

918
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,599
business productivity and cost savings

919
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:43,009
translate that over to all the identity

920
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,170
work you're doing all the manual

921
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:47,299
activity you're doing can you automate

922
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,950
that to help users do what they're

923
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:53,119
trying to do more quickly more

924
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:55,218
effectively different metrics for

925
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,499
different audiences and now you're ready

926
00:36:55,219 --> 00:37:00,469
to start engaging your project managers

927
00:36:57,499 --> 00:37:02,479
I've got a friend who's a project

928
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:04,609
manager and it doesn't matter what

929
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:06,460
environment he's worked a large

930
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:08,690
financial institutions large insurance

931
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:11,089
institutions small consulting companies

932
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:15,109
he's got the same methodology he applies

933
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:16,640
wherever he goes because it works right

934
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:18,619
first thing you want to do when you've

935
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,779
got all this information right you know

936
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:22,700
what your environment looks like you

937
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:25,489
know what leadership is interested in

938
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:28,470
tackling put together a strategic plan

939
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:29,970
just next year we're going to do this

940
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,069
and then the year after we're going to

941
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,709
do this the examples I have up here

942
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:37,050
aren't yours right this isn't

943
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:39,150
necessarily right for your organization

944
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:40,770
you've got to take the info from that

945
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,030
maturity assessment and say all right

946
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,950
what's the most important thing for us

947
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:46,109
to do this if you're getting

948
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:48,779
hammered by audit about disabled

949
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:51,630
accounts belonging to or active accounts

950
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,430
belonging to terminated employees then

951
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:56,190
just automating de-provisioning

952
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:57,868
there's going to be a huge deal but if

953
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,070
you've outsourced your service desk and

954
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:01,050
you're paying something like three

955
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:04,050
dollars five dollars a phone call and

956
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:06,540
you can show an immediate cost savings

957
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:08,910
to automating password resets maybe

958
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,710
that's what you start with right I can't

959
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,670
answer that for you but you can find the

960
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,920
answer to that question with that

961
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,660
maturity assessment so go through that

962
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,150
assessment and then put a multi-year

963
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,859
plan in place and say this is this is

964
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,750
where I'm born this is the direction

965
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:23,819
that I'm heading steering the committee

966
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:27,510
you agree that we should tackle these

967
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:31,369
things in this order once you get that

968
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:35,540
info in front of the committee it is

969
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:40,680
essential that you find one quick win

970
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:44,310
because once and zeros aside people are

971
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,990
people and we get distracted if you're

972
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:48,240
in a large organization and there are a

973
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,799
lot of competing projects and you go in

974
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,930
with all these identity things you want

975
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,490
to do and you try to do them all at once

976
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:56,009
but you say yeah I'll have something for

977
00:38:53,490 --> 00:39:00,209
you in two and a half years you're going

978
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:02,910
to lose attention and funding probably

979
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:05,369
within six months why am i throwing all

980
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,779
of this money at your program if you're

981
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:07,140
not actually changing things for the

982
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,330
better

983
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:12,540
but I am changing it just it takes time

984
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:14,069
well I don't see it all right so I've

985
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,680
got other people who are willing to do

986
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:18,390
things today if you're doing that

987
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,480
strategic plan of all the big things you

988
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:23,549
want to do scale it back and pick one

989
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:27,060
thing that you could knock out that

990
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:30,050
would be noticed by multiple people I

991
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:32,520
talked to a lot of people who are doing

992
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:34,109
certifications right we have to go in

993
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,369
and review somebody's access and say

994
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:37,470
yeah they're all supposed to have it

995
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:39,210
talk to your audit department and ask

996
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:41,129
them if the people who are doing that or

997
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,030
just rubber-stamp in it all right

998
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:44,970
I've got to

999
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,950
Jarrett has access to yeah he's sure he

1000
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:47,730
needs access to all those because if I

1001
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,589
say no

1002
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,630
right and I disrupt his ability to do

1003
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:55,380
his job it's just going to create a

1004
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:57,810
problem for me later but if you can go

1005
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,150
to audit and say let's automate that

1006
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:01,740
that process and then all the people

1007
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,510
throughout the company technical and

1008
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,390
non-technical who have that

1009
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:08,940
responsibility reviewing access can be

1010
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:10,830
your advocates right you can go to them

1011
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,660
for success stories to take the steering

1012
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:15,330
committee they say yeah I used to have

1013
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:17,609
to spend four days going through all

1014
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:20,790
these accountability and now I do it in

1015
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:24,050
like an hour right that that kind of win

1016
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:27,330
is going to make a big difference

1017
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:29,370
politically and it's that blend of the

1018
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:32,970
the politics and the technology that

1019
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:35,549
help you move your program forward also

1020
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:37,669
when you're writing down all the things

1021
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:41,700
you're going to do individual ownership

1022
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:43,710
again somebody has to be ultimately

1023
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:46,200
accountable now you can make it a team

1024
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:47,940
but it's a manager the team who owns

1025
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,009
that responsibility if it doesn't happen

1026
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,960
they're the one in front of the steering

1027
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:54,270
committee saying yeah I know we wanted

1028
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,120
to do this but I miss it right that's my

1029
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:59,310
bad you want to have individual

1030
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,839
ownership of all these things otherwise

1031
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:03,270
you run the risk of them not actually

1032
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,400
getting done but once you've got that

1033
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:07,259
plan in place right you've built on

1034
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,820
everything that you've discovered you've

1035
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,800
talked to people in the business about

1036
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,110
context and find out what's important

1037
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,000
and now you've written down a plan of

1038
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:17,970
what you're going to do now you actually

1039
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,430
go out and do it one of the first things

1040
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:22,980
you could do from one of those quickly

1041
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:26,370
well kind of a quick blend but it's more

1042
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:29,370
for like long-term success is clean up

1043
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:31,500
some of the directories if you discover

1044
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:34,319
directories right once you've got a list

1045
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,960
of all the places people can log in ask

1046
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,250
the admin for each directory are there

1047
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,100
any accounts that we can get rid of

1048
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:43,110
right or permissions are the permissions

1049
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:45,630
right right just talk to your Active

1050
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:47,180
Directory administrators and ask them if

1051
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:49,320
there are any groups you can get rid of

1052
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,210
because as you start doing all this

1053
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,880
identity stuff as you start building on

1054
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:55,550
all these accounts and time

1055
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,190
together if you've got garbage right if

1056
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:59,720
you've got bad data number one you're

1057
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,100
going to be building that bad data into

1058
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,169
your system and number two you're going

1059
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:05,509
to be spending a lot of time building

1060
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:07,130
things that you don't need right what's

1061
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,750
a Marie Kondo

1062
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:12,980
right y'all know the the joy right a guy

1063
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:16,220
my wife knows her I don't know her but

1064
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,470
she does the the whole get rid of stuff

1065
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,029
that doesn't bring you joy right it is

1066
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:22,160
that kind of thing you got to go through

1067
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:24,830
your environment clean house so that

1068
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,529
you've got some sort of stable

1069
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:29,990
foundation that you're going to build

1070
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:31,640
build that stuff one I get into those

1071
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:33,319
environments to start cleaning up

1072
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,020
attributes this gets into some of the

1073
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,760
automation you're gonna like that later

1074
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:40,720
you want to be able to determine what

1075
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,800
maps to what is they may have done EDI

1076
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,259
electronic data interchange right that's

1077
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,700
where I cut my teeth on i.t right and

1078
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,350
it's the whole notion of I've got two

1079
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,240
disconnected systems they need to share

1080
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:51,589
data I need to give them a common

1081
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,419
language right I need to give them the

1082
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:55,910
ability to get data back and forth so

1083
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:58,310
that they both understand it identity is

1084
00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:00,910
pretty similar but it gets down to

1085
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:02,990
attributes of map who has access to what

1086
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:07,549
so you want to go in and clean those up

1087
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:10,180
and then start defining roles as they be

1088
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:12,530
doing what makes access control today

1089
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:14,480
that's all right know that even a shaky

1090
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:19,420
hand is good

1091
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:21,980
our back is big and it can be daunting

1092
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,990
but you don't have to do everything

1093
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:27,370
right out of the gate right if you just

1094
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:31,819
automate Active Directory account and

1095
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:33,500
emails write those two things number one

1096
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,730
people can walk in on the day that

1097
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,100
they're hired and start doing something

1098
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:39,290
because I guarantee HR will already have

1099
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,580
sent them email messages say you need to

1100
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:43,430
do this training you need to sign these

1101
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:46,549
policies I but it doesn't mean that you

1102
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:49,490
have to do down to the ants degree every

1103
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:52,070
little thing automated no just just do a

1104
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:53,750
couple of simple things start to make

1105
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:56,360
people's lives better and then build on

1106
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,560
top of that that basic just a couple of

1107
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,270
things we call that like birthright

1108
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,960
provisioning right that's every employee

1109
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:05,070
gets it you might be able to go and say

1110
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:08,460
everybody in finance gets this app

1111
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:10,710
buddy in accounting that's this app like

1112
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:12,480
HR gets this Apple ego gets this out and

1113
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:15,210
then you could certainly depart mental

1114
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,940
map knees and then you can go down to

1115
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:20,070
like job code and say if you've got this

1116
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:23,250
job code it means your manager versus

1117
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:24,600
employee versus supervisor and you can

1118
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,980
build it on top of all that but you

1119
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,589
don't have to build all those roles

1120
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,320
right away just start with the basic

1121
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:34,110
birthright stuff and then it's okay to

1122
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,540
have Singleton's right these little one

1123
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:38,010
offs and just don't fit anywhere right

1124
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,840
you can get to a point where you can

1125
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,760
automate the request an approval and

1126
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,440
provisioning process but people don't

1127
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,230
need to get that as soon as they hire in

1128
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,960
HR just get started with some basic

1129
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:52,170
stuff and then build on top of that and

1130
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,720
then I you're going to look back at that

1131
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,490
I am universe and say what what can I

1132
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,279
make come out of a provisioning d

1133
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:03,209
provisioning can I automate password

1134
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:07,350
resets can i aughtta mate who has access

1135
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:11,220
to what data what file shares and then

1136
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:13,620
again the value of having audit involved

1137
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,240
early on is you're going to be able to

1138
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:16,650
take all these things you've done and

1139
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,089
just give it to them and say yeah that

1140
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:21,000
stuff you've been asking me for four

1141
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:24,330
years here here it is and you'll find

1142
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:29,100
with audit is your ally that helps your

1143
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:32,940
budget as well and then Step five it's

1144
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:35,400
important to again recognize success so

1145
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,290
attract those metrics brag on the people

1146
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:42,480
who are fixing things and making things

1147
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:44,070
better give them kudos if that's a extra

1148
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,370
a couple hours vacation if it's a gift

1149
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:50,460
card to Amazon if it's we see as kid you

1150
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:51,029
not a stuffed animal public utilities a

1151
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,550
beanie baby

1152
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:55,110
you remember beanie babies right they

1153
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,700
whoever was doing the cool thing that

1154
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:59,310
month they got to keep the beanie baby

1155
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,990
on their desk and it made a big give us

1156
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,590
a really big deal to the the people who

1157
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:03,509
got it

1158
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:06,270
whatever your corporate culture is

1159
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:07,740
whatever gets people going take a minute

1160
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:11,610
to recognize when they have those

1161
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:14,580
successes track your progress in your

1162
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:16,800
missus Essman give that info back to

1163
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,230
steering committee and then every time

1164
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,090
you've got some success story

1165
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:21,710
somebody saying look I didn't know what

1166
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:23,990
you guys are doing but after you did it

1167
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:26,240
this is how it changed my job it made it

1168
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:29,149
so much easier for me to do the stuff I

1169
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,569
was hired to do in the first place grab

1170
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:35,840
that and then I pizza and I'm here at

1171
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:38,570
the very least it goes so far to just

1172
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:41,390
give people some simple token of

1173
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:43,609
gratitude to say look I appreciate it

1174
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:45,170
because I mean every one of us we go

1175
00:46:43,609 --> 00:46:47,630
home at the end of the day's we've got

1176
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:49,820
friends we've got family we've got pets

1177
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:52,430
we've got things that we do outside work

1178
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:53,869
we are not our job and that's true for

1179
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:56,089
every single person that you're going to

1180
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:59,210
be looping in to this project to these

1181
00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:00,770
efforts so recognize them right give

1182
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:01,880
them credit for the work that they're

1183
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:04,220
doing especially if you've got them

1184
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,369
staying late or working weekends or

1185
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:09,919
taking this on top of other work take

1186
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:12,980
time to give them that recognition I

1187
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:16,790
can't emphasize that enough and then the

1188
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:18,800
last step is I lied it's not a project

1189
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:21,200
right that the whole program thing

1190
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,790
doesn't really have a finish line you

1191
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,250
just get to a point where the cycle

1192
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:28,160
starts over again we we love Cod sorry

1193
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:29,869
anybody seen dr. sleep yet I'm a big

1194
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,990
Stephen King fan my wife and I saw it

1195
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:35,300
this week and loved it but the whole

1196
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:36,830
notion of what when you get everything

1197
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,200
to a point you feel like yeah I've got

1198
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:42,770
it go back and do that discovery again

1199
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:45,799
what's changed right have any of you

1200
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:48,140
started using SAS applications at your

1201
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:52,190
company in 2019 that you did not use in

1202
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:55,279
2018 no that's kind of a wordy question

1203
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:58,160
but I guarantee that things have changed

1204
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,450
over the last year for them things have

1205
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,490
probably changed over the last month

1206
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:03,410
things may be changing today while

1207
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:05,629
you're here at this conference so you

1208
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:07,670
have to keep going back to ask people

1209
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:09,200
what's changed what's different and then

1210
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:10,550
go through that cycle again and make

1211
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,810
sure that your program is covering

1212
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:17,480
everything it needs to cover and then

1213
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:18,980
just a few questions where I'm said I'm

1214
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:23,390
out of Columbus right where blue jackets

1215
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:27,200
family so the Gretzky quote is a hockey

1216
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:28,569
thing but start to ask yourself is there

1217
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,100
a way we could be doing things

1218
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:32,059
differently or are there things that

1219
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,519
were not even

1220
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:35,839
during your planning for yet well some I

1221
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:39,348
wish I could remember who was somebody

1222
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,910
pitched this idea to me what if we

1223
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:43,880
started like an 8 o'clock in the morning

1224
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:47,149
we had a job that ran that gave people

1225
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:49,640
access and a 5 o'clock another job ran

1226
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:52,189
that took all that access away and from

1227
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,479
5 p.m. to 8 a.m. it didn't matter if

1228
00:48:52,189 --> 00:48:55,519
they wanted to log in they couldn't

1229
00:48:53,479 --> 00:48:57,259
because we disabled their access not

1230
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:59,868
just disabled we actually stripped it

1231
00:48:57,259 --> 00:49:01,160
away gave it back and my initial thought

1232
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:03,229
was that's crazy well how did you do

1233
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,759
that but the more I think about it I'm

1234
00:49:03,229 --> 00:49:08,328
like boy there's work/life balance

1235
00:49:04,759 --> 00:49:11,239
there's reduced risk of compromise and

1236
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:14,449
people attacking you after hours but I

1237
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:16,999
mean it's risky but if that's something

1238
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:18,499
that your company wanted to do right or

1239
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:20,509
if you want to get away from passwords

1240
00:49:18,499 --> 00:49:21,529
entirely right but whatever the thing

1241
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:23,779
you're trying to do you need to

1242
00:49:21,529 --> 00:49:25,519
incorporate kind of that that future

1243
00:49:23,779 --> 00:49:28,640
thinking that direction into your

1244
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:32,359
identity program anybody ever been to a

1245
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:34,578
dentist's bookmark that if you're doing

1246
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:37,369
identity or if you've got people at your

1247
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:39,259
company who were doing identity identify

1248
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:41,689
is a multi-day conference for some of

1249
00:49:39,259 --> 00:49:44,179
the best identity professionals around

1250
00:49:41,689 --> 00:49:46,368
the world they all descend I think it

1251
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:49,189
looks like in DC this earlier this year

1252
00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:51,799
and all they talk about is identity

1253
00:49:49,189 --> 00:49:53,239
stuff so some of its going to be stuff

1254
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:54,890
like this write out a little program

1255
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:57,559
some of its going to get really deep

1256
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:58,999
into protocols and and depending on what

1257
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:02,390
your jam is and what you're looking for

1258
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:05,359
you've got options but things to look at

1259
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:07,339
is artificial intelligence and machine

1260
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:10,788
learning or disrupting a lot of

1261
00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:12,859
industries I worked for a firm that did

1262
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:14,599
accounting and they bought a cyber

1263
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:16,759
security company that I worked for

1264
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:18,439
because they knew that accounting was

1265
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:21,049
going to be entirely different in a few

1266
00:50:18,439 --> 00:50:24,078
years thanks to this technology well

1267
00:50:21,049 --> 00:50:25,759
it's coming into play in in how some of

1268
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,979
you probably already have some different

1269
00:50:25,759 --> 00:50:30,349
tech probably like your sim technology

1270
00:50:27,979 --> 00:50:33,879
threat hunting tech deployed doing some

1271
00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:37,579
of this already so something like that

1272
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:39,920
go to identify or at least look up the

1273
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:41,869
talks after the fact and see what people

1274
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,189
are talking about and then take that

1275
00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:44,660
back to your steering committee and say

1276
00:50:43,189 --> 00:50:45,049
looking ahead this is something we need

1277
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:48,109
to

1278
00:50:45,049 --> 00:50:49,489
concern ourselves with so take a minute

1279
00:50:48,109 --> 00:50:52,009
to get out from behind your desk and

1280
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:54,409
talk to people once you understand what

1281
00:50:52,009 --> 00:50:57,619
you're you're talking about write things

1282
00:50:54,409 --> 00:51:00,289
down and put it into effect with your

1283
00:50:57,619 --> 00:51:02,239
project management team take a minute to

1284
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:04,429
celebrate the small wins and then go

1285
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:07,779
back through the cycle again it'll help

1286
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:11,359
you move the I identity program forward

1287
00:51:07,779 --> 00:51:14,539
and I know I'm I always run yeah one

1288
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:20,839
minute always writing in time any

1289
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:23,089
questions so if you want to slides if

1290
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:25,069
you think this info is useful hit me up

1291
00:51:23,089 --> 00:51:27,469
or hit up the conference organizers

1292
00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:29,179
we've all have them and then take them

1293
00:51:27,469 --> 00:51:31,999
back share them with people start using

1294
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:34,819
this and just focus on a couple of small

1295
00:51:31,999 --> 00:51:37,328
ways and build on top of that so thank

1296
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:37,329
you very much
