8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,250
play a lot of sports so if I throw

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:26,039

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:34,920

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:37,399
year 16 yay everybody seems so excited

14

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,390
alright so legal disclaimer today we're

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,190
going to talk about ransomware recovery

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,629
more specifically there have been a

18
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,690
number of organizations that have

19
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,960
allowed me to share their information in

20
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,019
hopes that you can either prevent

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,160
ransomware attacks from occurring or

22
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,539
increase your security posture how many

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,029
of you are familiar with ransomware or

24
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,570
have lived that experience it's a great

25
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,989
experience isn't it oh you've heard of

26
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,439
it

27
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:12,240
oh you you live vicariously all right so

28
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,970
while I'll try the best not to name

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,199
names some of them you may identify as

30
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,280
as we have clients all over the US a

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,110
little bit about myself I've been in the

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,340
industry now for 30 years to the point

33
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,810
where I've come to the conclusion that

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,340
the brat the grass is brown everywhere

35
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:32,119
so with that we'll go ahead and kick

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,590
right in it's a little bit about myself

47
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,609
so I've worked with companies ranging

48
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:20,730
from fortune 500 to small medium-sized

49
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,439
businesses to startups worked with state

50
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,750
federal government agencies as well as

51
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:30,180
foreign governments I am a speaker Oh

52
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:34,170
Adrienne's giggling that's a that's a

53
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,299
bad sign oh okay sorry do you want me to

54
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,619
stay in one place I can't stay in one

55
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:40,739
place I've had so much coffee this

56
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,109
morning okay I am a hacker which means I

57
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,450
have to ask and get the answer to the

58
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:48,840
question of why how what things do I'm

59
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,638
also a instructor with aisaka one of the

60
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,579
organization's here a little bit about

61
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,349
the company what we do we work on audit

62
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:56,549
insurance cyber acquisition due

63
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:58,439
diligence so if you're requiring a

64
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:59,549
company they fill out that form that

65
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,379
says they're doing all the right things

66
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:04,379
we actually get to ground on whether or

67
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:06,239
not they're actually doing them Incident

68
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,370
Response Management one of the passions

69
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,980
that I have is helping organizations

70
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,819
when they're in their time of crisis in

71
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,179
this case we're going to talk

72
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,168
specifically around ransomware

73
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,239
information security and risk advisory

74
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:20,190
services regulatory compliance because

75
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,389
we're not regulated enough and in our

76
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,470
industries right training and education

77
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:29,400
where I have the distinct unique

78
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,810
privilege we are central Ohio's and most

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,659
of the Ohio River Valley's only

80
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,540
accredited trading organization that has

81
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:38,250
instructors across the core four

82
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,260
certifications around governance of

83
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,540
enterprise IT information security

84
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,548
management information systems audit and

85
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,048
risk an information system control as

86
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:50,280
well as the governance framework of

87
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:54,150
COBIT and soon next year hopefully the

88
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,470
cybersecurity Nexus platform CSX as well

89
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,379
as doing vulnerability assessments and

90
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:03,840
pen testing so that's the adult version

91
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:06,120
of me I travel way too much this came up

92
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,159
in my stats this this week for this

93
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,340
year's travel so it's a little off on

94
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,870
the number of cities I like to have fun

95
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:18,780
when I travel much to the chagrin of

96
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:21,450
most of hotel management because I'll

97
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,789
leave this when I leave a hotel and then

98
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,990
I will get a phone call mr. McCabe the

99
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:26,610
couple that came into your

100
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,300
afterwards do not appreciate the message

101
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,680
you left on the mirror for those of you

102
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,630
are interested these are the companies

103
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,039
that actually have a sense of humor the

104
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:42,780
ones with red Xs do not full disclosure

105
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:44,099
I am a a Hilton honors member now so as

106
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,590
you probably guess a little bit about

107
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:48,630
myself I am filled with snarkiness I

108
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,440
mean information security for those of

109
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,030
you who can't see you

110
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,910
I will go to Starbucks and I will order

111
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:57,090
and give them that name which is hours

112
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,349
of entertainment nothing like being in a

113
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,150
Starbucks where you have somebody call

114
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:03,719
out Marco and watch the crowd respond

115
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:07,590
with then go see you guys have a sense

116
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,080
of humor I'm really jaded because of

117
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,630
math this is the number of data breaches

118
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,008
that we've incurred thank you yahoo for

119
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,479
putting us over the billion mark i'm

120
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:21,050
somewhat controversial because i will

121
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,930
tweet images like this about compliance

122
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:26,009
followed up with that i had somebody

123
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,740
actually stopped me they're like you

124
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:31,680
traumatized my child i was like why is

125
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,800
your child following me on twitter let's

126
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,159
get to the actual problem and yes it's

127
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:43,440
true i'm not right on on any level this

128
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:47,250
is my normal work attire oh i am a geek

129
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:52,009
I am wearing my boob with that socks

130
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:54,750
today to any other science fiction geeks

131
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:57,449
really only one person emits two three

132
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:01,110
okay it's a safe space here we can admit

133
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:04,229
to being sci-fi geeks so what we're

134
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,030
gonna talk about today we talk about

135
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:09,240
malicious software specifically we'll

136
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,619
get into the area of the history of

137
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,810
ransomware where it came from where

138
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,860
we're at today how old do you think

139
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,860
ransomware is ooh

140
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:23,870
who said that what kind of chocolate do

141
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:27,509
you like okay

142
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:34,409
Nicolas do you oh okay no we'll let you

143
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:36,150
pick I got it get to pick your chocolate

144
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:43,199
they didn't tell you this was gonna be

145
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:47,520
an interactive talk today Hershey's from

146
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:50,190
doctors to criminals so going back to

147
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,299
2005 which is sort of a misleading

148
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:56,550
statement because back in 1989 was the

149
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,710
first case of ransomware where the

150
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:03,449
person who was holding it was a former

151
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:05,219
doctor who had gotten frustrated and he

152
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:08,400
demanded ransom for the recovery of your

153
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:11,070
systems now where he went he might have

154
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,260
went wrong at as you had to send payment

155
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:18,990
to a post office box might that pose an

156
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:22,680
issue if you're a criminal again he was

157
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:25,650
a doctor not a criminal all the way

158
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:31,139
through coming up to how many of you

159
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:37,549
remember this want to cry want to cry is

160
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:37,550
that a good thing bad thing good bad

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,900
it's your state of mind every day you're

162
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,029
an information security longer than I

163
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:49,770
have right I used to be happy so this

164
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:52,169
was an unprecedented attack because of

165
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,870
the fact of all the individuals that

166
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:57,830
were impacted but there was something

167
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:01,219
else that was a little bit problematic

168
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:06,469
how did these how did want to cry

169
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:06,469
propagate anybody remember

170
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,888
well we're gonna get into that this was

171
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:15,479
within the first 24 hours of one a cry

172
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:18,800
being released and identified in the

173
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:21,750
wild over two hundred thousand-plus

174
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,440
organizations were impacted some very

175
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:31,969
large once anybody remember what day

176
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:36,929
this happened Mother's Day my mother

177
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:38,669
called me to ask me about this not the

178
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,309
call that I was expecting because my

179
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:43,020
mother is not in information systems or

180
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,540
IT she actually sells furniture for a

181
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,800
living so when my mother calls me about

182
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,959
something like this I know it's going to

183
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,449
be big how many of you get calls from

184
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,750
your mother saying hey what's this new

185
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,790
virus that I'm hearing about well one of

186
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:00,089
the reasons why it was so impactful was

187
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:03,120
because if anybody remembers it used a

188
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:06,870
nation-state exploit actually use two of

189
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,700
them eternal blue and double pulsar now

190
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:12,510
eternal blue is the one that got a lot

191
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:15,300
of recognition however the way it

192
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:20,819
propagated was using SMB small message

193
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:23,250
box protocol well how is it how is it

194
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:28,860
that SMB protocol impacted all these

195
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:31,529
organizations anybody want to guess it

196
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,720
was exposed because what could go wrong

197
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:36,380
with having windows file shares exposed

198
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,380
to the Internet

199
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,560
it was then used to deliver the payload

200
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:45,110
which in this case was the actual

201
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:50,880
ransomware the scourge of our existence

202
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:53,850
which bargains us to a unique point if a

203
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,370
nation states cyber Arsenal gets like

204
00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:01,640
leaked to the Internet what do you think

205
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:03,480
we should do we should patch patch now

206
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,120
these are not your common

207
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,610
run-of-the-mill exploits these were

208
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,880
designed for the purpose of exploiting

209
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:14,279
other nation-states what was interesting

210
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,310
was Microsoft prior to this being

211
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:19,670
launched Microsoft made the patch

212
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,670
available

213
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:29,230
which brings us to our timeline 1710 was

214
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:34,030
released Microsoft put it out this is

215
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:41,080
the actual timeline from there of course

216
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:43,110
our conference required hacker you know

217
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:47,770
the guy who can hack into your network

218
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:49,450
one-handed but can't buy a chair they

219
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,310
started working on this they started

220
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,410
researching and finding out what do what

221
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:57,089
was going on now during that time of

222
00:10:53,410 --> 00:11:00,339
course business as usual for IT right

223
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,450
we're just gonna hang out we're not

224
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,220
going to patch we're trying to explain

225
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,140
to the business why we need to patch but

226
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,590
but it's you know just like every other

227
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,670
patch no this was a little bit different

228
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:14,560
then we had the shadow brokers dump

229
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:16,209
which ik rich released the tool it was

230
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,640
actually released a number of tools some

231
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,040
of which were still still dealing with

232
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,620
today

233
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:28,449
bad guys got an early Christmas gift way

234
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:30,390
back when and then we had want to cry or

235
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:34,330
what I call the dumpster fire of things

236
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:36,610
and this cycle continues on we're still

237
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:39,670
seeing organizations and we've seen

238
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:42,490
organizations post wanna cry that are

239
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,170
still facing these issues that still

240
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:49,600
have these vulnerabilities that can be

241
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:51,310
exploited I love this one so this is

242
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,310
from The pieman Institute it's a little

243
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,530
bit dated from 2016

244
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:59,739
56% admit not ready for a rain similar

245
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:03,610
attack 38 stated that they have a

246
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:08,950
strategy what is the only viable

247
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:11,380
strategy for ransomware confirmed

248
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,820
backups right now for those of you who

249
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,530
are math elites like me you'll notice

250
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,910
that these two numbers don't equal 100

251
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:18,850
which led me to an interesting thing

252
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:21,959
that the remaining 60% could not respond

253
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:25,220
because of an ongoing ransomware attack

254
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,390
so that's important to keep in mind

255
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,450
so when we talk about the traditional

256
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,970
attacks why ransomware is effective

257
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:34,680
versus traditional attacks

258
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:37,560
well it's because when an adversary

259
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:40,430
attacks they leave a trail behind they

260
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,589
have to invest a lot of time and effort

261
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:46,079
they're going to leave potentially leave

262
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:48,089
behind tools they're going to need

263
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,439
additional resources maybe they have

264
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:52,350
somebody that's from great at exploit

265
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,029
development in a specific language but

266
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,320
not necessarily the one they're

267
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:57,630
proficient in so they have to outsource

268
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,170
development it's a nightmare

269
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:05,010
requires a larger investment the

270
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:06,300
potential for getting caught how long do

271
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,480
I have until I sell that information

272
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:12,149
before it's no good so let's shift the

273
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:17,550
dynamic for an attacker ransomware is a

274
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:21,269
no-brainer it's a low barrier of entry

275
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:24,329
entry doesn't take a lot of effort to

276
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:25,620
develop this in fact in hindsight when

277
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:27,689
we look at a number of the ransomware

278
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,029
attacks that occurred you know was not

279
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,470
uncommon for the first round first

280
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:32,910
couple of generations they were only

281
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,690
asking for a couple hundred dollars in

282
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,890
ransomware why is that they are waiting

283
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,800
for the larger target and we're gonna

284
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:43,500
see the increase on this and when we

285
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,510
talk about Bitcoin you know I remember

286
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,890
years ago working with a very large

287
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,130
financial institution they're like I

288
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:54,180
will never get on board with Bitcoin

289
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:55,529
it's it's magic there's no no way around

290
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,719
it well when you have a criminal

291
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:59,399
syndicate that's holding your data for

292
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,440
ransom and the only way you can pay is

293
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,760
Bitcoin guess what they just created

294
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,760
their own market for cryptocurrency

295
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:13,380
when we look at getting into launching a

296
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:15,449
ransomware attack just like everything

297
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,420
else it's as a service now you can't go

298
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:22,980
to Amazon Prime yet and ask for a ransom

299
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:28,290
or attack but maybe again the rise of

300
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:34,170
cryptocurrency so why is this so

301
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:36,630
lucrative well it is a little of a month

302
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,229
you can actually develop a valid

303
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:42,439
ransomware

304
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:44,910
attack say that only cost us 32,000

305
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,650
we're gonna host it on disposable

306
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,480
infrastructure because cloud is a great

307
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:51,329
thing right any cloud vendors in the

308
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,100
room I'm not using your your

309
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,100
infrastructure for this I promise

310
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:03,660
launching the attack running a helpdesk

311
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:07,670
we're going to run that 24 hours a day

312
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:12,300
ten days we're gonna pay our staff 150

313
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:19,800
total costs to launch the attack 56 and

314
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:21,160
a half now if we get 1% of 1 million at

315
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,339
300 ollars a system

316
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,339
[Music]

317
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:31,360
we can net 2.9 million on ROI which begs

318
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,748
the question why are we here and not out

319
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,850
writing ransomware I have to question

320
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:38,649
that every single day and as it turns

321
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,689
out it's because I do not look good in

322
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:44,040
orange

323
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:46,329
so I'm not going to temp that that fate

324
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:51,998
what about from the business side why is

325
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:54,099
ransomware a major concern you know we

326
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:58,029
like to say well if our employees would

327
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:01,360
stop clicking things and we know that's

328
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:06,490
not going to happen because we've become

329
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:08,649
accustomed to using things like email

330
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,059
and clicking on links as a part of our

331
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:14,470
job and if I send your Accounts Payable

332
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:16,600
a malicious link or a malicious document

333
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,389
that says a count past due or account

334
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,149
overdue what is your accounts payable

335
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:23,259
going to do they're going to click it

336
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:31,660
why are they going to click it though

337
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:35,199
Lisa it will go even easier than that

338
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:37,000
it's their job and we know what there

339
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:42,149
are individuals job is and we can get

340
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,149
them to do what we want as an adversary

341
00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:46,360
plus we know that users are only doing

342
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,910
their jobs so they're going to try and

343
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,379
find ways around if we put in kludgy

344
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,540
controls which we all know when we

345
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:56,040
implement information security controls

346
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:59,649
they are seamless to the end-user right

347
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,029
so they'll find ways around it when I

348
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:02,500
was active due to you I was working with

349
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:04,390
the Marines and one of the things that

350
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,760
we we had done was rolled out these new

351
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,459
things called web proxies that would

352
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,030
prevent a website talking with an in

353
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:14,699
point system from directly communicating

354
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:17,678
we thought we'd see a decrease in the

355
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:20,500
amount of malicious software that was

356
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,089
getting in except for we didn't think to

357
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,980
control all the way through and there

358
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:28,089
are some smart Marines no matter what

359
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:30,130
you hear they figured out that they

360
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,629
could use other proxies because we

361
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,970
didn't set down the the permissions

362
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:37,030
properly to restrict who could filter

363
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,110
the proxies so they were going bypassing

364
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,678
our proxies

365
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:43,059
right out to the Internet users will

366
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,320
find a way to do their job and at the

367
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:48,190
end of the day that's all they want to

368
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,350
do is do their job and watch cat videos

369
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,700
[Music]

370
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:57,549
from a business perspective though we

371
00:17:51,700 --> 00:18:00,280
have a bigger problem do we know who has

372
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:02,429
access to your data even within your

373
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,428
business

374
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:11,410
when do they access that data is it

375
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,470
restricted to business hours or is it

376
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:17,230
that they're logging in to a.m. to 6

377
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:21,220
a.m. tax that's the data can they access

378
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:24,640
that data here's the big question why do

379
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,570
they have access to that data I don't

380
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,910
know how many times I've seen

381
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,470
organizations where you have somebody

382
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,090
that starts off how many of you are in

383
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:34,780
the same position now with the

384
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:37,740
organization you're with now that you

385
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,740
originally started from

386
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:46,209
now most of us make lateral transitions

387
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:49,979
we move within the organization but does

388
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:54,610
IT necessarily revoke our permissions

389
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:56,320
they should but they don't usually when

390
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,178
we especially if we're doing the lateral

391
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,370
transitions from one department to

392
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,769
another usually the two managers will

393
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,779
make a drug deal with each other and say

394
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:06,309
hey you know we need this individual to

395
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:07,600
stay on this project for at least three

396
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:08,980
more months and then they keep your

397
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,809
permissions in place so you can support

398
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,820
that project has that ever happen to

399
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:14,980
anybody

400
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,330
happens quite frequently right but then

401
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,840
three months comes and goes you're off

402
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:21,039
that project but due permissions go away

403
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,019
now and you move from one department to

404
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,899
the next and guess what happens you get

405
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:27,070
over privileged what's really

406
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:29,908
interesting is when we see organizations

407
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,928
that go that route of trying to clean up

408
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,860
what gets really interesting when we

409
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:34,269
start saying we're going to take

410
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,439
permissions away people take it

411
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:40,690
personally what did I do wrong

412
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,100
nothing you don't need it why do you

413
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,100
want something you don't need access to

414
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:51,009
where can they access it from do you

415
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:54,759
have to be on campus and on Prem or can

416
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:56,950
you remote in maybe it may not be a good

417
00:19:54,759 --> 00:20:00,580
idea for your R&D staff to be able to

418
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:04,799
remote access your data because what

419
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,799
could possibly go wrong there right

420
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:14,139
again is it required for them to do

421
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:16,090
their job do we know how many of you

422
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:20,019
have rule-based defined access controls

423
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:22,480
within your organization we've got about

424
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:25,110
a room of 100 and I saw maybe six seven

425
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,110
hands go up

426
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,430
when it comes to ransomware the

427
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,260
ransomware

428
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:36,330
will get the same permissions as any

429
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:38,830
user it infects which means cool

430
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:45,639
anything that that user can touch during

431
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:46,899
day to day so can the ransomware you

432
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,660
have to assume that they have the same

433
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:53,890
permissions this is why solutions like

434
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,840
role based access controls are very

435
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:59,320
important only give access to what is

436
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,770
absolutely needed when it comes to

437
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:06,820
paying a ransom if you get hit or the

438
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:11,350
pros and cons well one pros you can

439
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:12,490
potentially restore if you pay but this

440
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,959
begs the question do you have a business

441
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:18,010
continuity plan and disaster recovery

442
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,170
capability and more importantly is it

443
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,180
truthful

444
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:25,420
does your BCP and dr take into account a

445
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,670
ransomware attack and have you tested it

446
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:31,600
do you know with certainty you can get

447
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:33,730
your data back how many of you have BC P

448
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,060
and D are plans that that have like that

449
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:40,480
quarter-inch of dust on the binder you

450
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:43,419
don't have to raise your hand a lot of

451
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,090
organizations do some folks look at it

452
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:48,340
as being the cheaper alternative

453
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:49,990
compared to the value of the data can

454
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:55,629
you live without that data that's being

455
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:57,280
held hostage maybe it maybe not back to

456
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:02,440
business as usual once you pay the

457
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,820
ransom yeah that's the same position

458
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,060
that got you to where you're at at

459
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:10,840
present on the con side of the house it

460
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:15,360
does promote criminal activity are you

461
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,360
sponsoring somebody like Isis RDP kr

462
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:21,330
maybe maybe not maybe it's just cousin

463
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:27,299
Yuri over in Kiev that you're sponsoring

464
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:30,359
that makes you feel better right talk

465
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:31,830
about potential file corruption just

466
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,779
because you pay does not mean

467
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:40,369
necessarily that your data is going to

468
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:43,019
be recovered as we'll cover later on and

469
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:44,840
keep in mind you're dealing with a

470
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:48,059
criminal organization or an adversary

471
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,580
they infected you once so when they send

472
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:52,320
you that self-extracting key method to

473
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,199
decrypt your data what else are they

474
00:22:52,320 --> 00:23:00,119
putting on your systems or do you even

475
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,789
know now it may sound like a no-brainer

476
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:04,289
hey we'll pay 17,000 and and that

477
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:09,350
because security professionals are

478
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:09,350
expensive just pay the ransom

479
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,820
unfortunately there's a big but here

480
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:20,340
things you need to consider how many of

481
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:25,159
you heard about the Hollywood

482
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:28,949
Presbyterian attack this was classic

483
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:32,779
they got hit with ransomware they got

484
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:34,799
the note for $300 per computer system

485
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:38,100
how many of you deal with Incident

486
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:43,289
Response on a regular basis do you ever

487
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:45,748
want to poke the bear so their IT

488
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:47,460
administrator who got the ransom reached

489
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:50,190
back out to the adversary and said do

490
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:55,019
you have an idea who we are our lawyers

491
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:57,379
are going to sue you at which point the

492
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:59,700
ransom then went become multi millions

493
00:23:57,379 --> 00:24:03,149
because now you just announced who you

494
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:06,629
are highly recommend if you get hit with

495
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:09,959
ransomware do not email them from your

496
00:24:06,629 --> 00:24:12,299
account use a proxy service try to

497
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,889
coordinate make it look less than than

498
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:15,239
it is

499
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:16,439
hopefully they fall into the same issues

500
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:18,779
that we have that they cant do proper

501
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,590
threat intelligence to identify where

502
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:26,149
it's coming from but they spiked the the

503
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:29,149
cost the cost of their ransomware

504
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:29,149
exponentially

505
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:39,130
jnana South Korea they got hit they

506
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:42,279
tried to bargain with their ransom or

507
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:46,870
for the recovery of the keys in fact

508
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:50,200
they worked out a payment plan they were

509
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:53,289
going to pay them for four two hundred

510
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,059
and fifty thousand dollar payments on

511
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:57,850
the agreement that when they hit the

512
00:24:55,059 --> 00:25:06,039
third payment they would get the

513
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:07,178
decryption keys spoiler alert they paid

514
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:11,139
all three payments and guess what they

515
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:12,399
didn't get because seven hundred and

516
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:17,620
fifty thousand is still better than a

517
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:21,939
million right criminals may not be

518
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:26,199
trustworthy I've heard just just

519
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:28,620
wondering the Ottawa Hospital that got

520
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:32,230
hit with ransomware this was brilliant

521
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:35,739
they were actually prepared they had

522
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:39,279
practiced they ran it consistently they

523
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:41,889
got hit on Friday on a Friday because as

524
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:45,850
it turns out when two adversaries like

525
00:25:41,889 --> 00:25:47,168
to attack Fridays and holidays they know

526
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,820
the operations are running smooth

527
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:52,000
however they had their stuff together

528
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:56,980
and they were able to fully reimage

529
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,720
those systems with a minimal impact now

530
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,130
going back to Hollywood Presbyterian how

531
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,960
could this happen we're talking about a

532
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:05,230
hospital that falls under HIPAA

533
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:09,399
requirements which require back-up plan

534
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:11,440
and disaster recovery so when we see

535
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:14,918
cases like this occur and we also like

536
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,450
the cases in Atlanta and in Florida and

537
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:19,899
Maryland that these organizations got

538
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:22,570
hit with ransomware but they couldn't

539
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:26,018
recover and they made the news because

540
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,908
it had been going on for so long so when

541
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:30,399
you see events like this you have to ask

542
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:33,370
the question well where were their dr

543
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:37,120
capabilities at not where they thought

544
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:38,149
they were not where they thought they

545
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,579
were

546
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:42,079
and unfortunately there is no yelp

547
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:43,549
review for ransomware criminal

548
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,869
organizations that you can go in and say

549
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:48,949
hey these were really great people to

550
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:52,238
work with versus you know it took 24 to

551
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:57,379
48 or 48 to 72 hours for them to respond

552
00:26:52,239 --> 00:27:02,679
this doesn't happen when you get hit are

553
00:26:57,379 --> 00:27:04,789
you ready we talked about cryptocurrency

554
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:08,779
how many of you enjoy working with

555
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:10,519
procurement could you imagine going to

556
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:13,359
your procurement department and asking

557
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:16,819
them for them to invest in this this

558
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:19,579
ethereal cryptocurrency what are they

559
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:23,569
going to do to you what are they gonna

560
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:26,599
ask I want to spend five ten fifteen

561
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:28,039
thousand dollars on cryptocurrency how

562
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:30,399
many of your procurement departments are

563
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:30,399
ready for that

564
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:43,158
what's that which we all know most cases

565
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,139
ransomware that clock is ticking right

566
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:46,909
that sense of urgency and every time

567
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:50,299
that clock hits a certain level the

568
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:54,049
price goes up you know is it easy to get

569
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:54,979
cryptocurrency in a best-case if you're

570
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:55,908
working with somebody that already

571
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:57,759
hasn't established

572
00:27:55,909 --> 00:28:01,129
Bitcoin wallet or cryptocurrency wallet

573
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:05,289
they can make the payment but they want

574
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:06,918
to be renew mereta dand repaid as well

575
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:08,859
again how are you gonna get your

576
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:13,219
procurement department sign off on it

577
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:16,158
what are the legal implications you pay

578
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:19,219
this ransom you're sponsoring Isis are

579
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:23,989
you okay with that how does that

580
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:27,349
potentially look what happens with your

581
00:28:23,989 --> 00:28:30,529
taxes we know that the cryptocurrency

582
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:33,349
market is highly volatile it could be

583
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:34,549
worth a couple thousand today and the

584
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:38,599
span of a couple of hours the price

585
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:42,559
increases or drops dramatically can you

586
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:47,559
travel with it coming into or out of the

587
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:51,800
US you have to declare any income or any

588
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:54,720
financials that you have over $10,000

589
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:58,950
funny story TSA stopped me because they

590
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:02,550
saw Bitcoin on my laptop really wasn't

591
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:05,880
Bitcoin but that's that's a story for

592
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:11,100
another time let's just say me and T SAR

593
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:25,650
are not like this so let's get into some

594
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:28,439
case studies so let's see if you can

595
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:33,180
figure out what happens here it's an

596
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:40,320
aircraft manufacturer what do we think

597
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:43,580
this is fishing we have here hear no

598
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:49,740
evil see no evil speak no evil

599
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:51,990
13:59 and 10% let's break it down so

600
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:55,320
really what happened was yes they opened

601
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:57,090
a phishing email attack the individual

602
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,540
who opened it did not notice that it was

603
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:01,830
malicious

604
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:04,310
and as a result did not report it the

605
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:06,510
ransomware ran for over 14 hours

606
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:12,780
resulting in 90% of their network

607
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:16,710
systems being encrypted 90% locked out

608
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:18,750
business was at a standstill so what we

609
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:22,020
call the makings of a perfect storm was

610
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:25,710
their environment over privileged users

611
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:27,480
lack of segmentation and unconditional

612
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:29,850
trust we trust our employees to do the

613
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,990
right things right it's not really the

614
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,850
employees I'm worried about it's

615
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:39,300
somebody tricking them into doing

616
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:41,850
something the secretary is the one who

617
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,470
received the phishing email and they had

618
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:48,980
promoted her to being the senior

619
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:51,980
administrative assistant IT mistakenly

620
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,650
put her into the domain admin group

621
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:58,940
because they thought it was the domain

622
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,940
for the administrative staff

623
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:06,020
simple mistake that they made as it

624
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:10,790
turns out domain admins tend to have a

625
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:12,740
very wide reach don't they lack of

626
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,639
segmentation secretaries account

627
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,300
permissions allowed her to get

628
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:22,640
everywhere within the organization so

629
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:24,560
when we rolled on site what we

630
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,710
discovered was of course as you can

631
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:30,020
imagine with 90% of the network impacted

632
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:33,530
all these capabilities were were no

633
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,670
longer there the only department that

634
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:37,129
wasn't hit was the engineering

635
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:39,200
department because when they got hit

636
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,580
they had not brought the engineering

637
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,700
department online yet they had just

638
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:46,970
finished a uplift and had not physically

639
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:50,960
connected them back to the network not a

640
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:52,430
good day we asked about your backups and

641
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,960
they said yes we have backups and it was

642
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,100
like cool this will be in and out and

643
00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:00,380
they're like yes we test these on a

644
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:07,959
regular basis the grass is brown guess

645
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:07,960
who else had access those backups

646
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:15,890
yeah they had them the backups were

647
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:18,290
encrypted as well so again they were

648
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,390
very eco friendly to ransomware

649
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:22,490
propagating within their organization no

650
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,980
longer retention no net flow of no

651
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:27,590
packet executives did not want to IT

652
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,870
upsetting the users because they were

653
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:32,199
pulling permissions even though they

654
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:34,969
recommended it

655
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:38,110
they're now logging they're capturing

656
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:40,250
net flow with a rolling 48 of peak app

657
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:41,810
as it turns out when it comes to

658
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,310
upsetting users versus the ability to

659
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:47,510
generate revenue guess where senior

660
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:50,090
management goes they're putting in the

661
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:52,100
appropriate securities policies in place

662
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:55,780
they're training their staff they're

663
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,560
enforcing them they run to unannounced

664
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,420
since we worked with them two

665
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,500
unannounced IRS where they simulated

666
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,500
ransomware attacks again

667
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:10,040
again this client ended up paying the

668
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:11,659
ransom to get their data back even

669
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:16,310
though we told them you may not get it

670
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:18,800
back they were lucky again this was only

671
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:21,080
twenty five thousand plus their downtime

672
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:25,340
which they did not disclose to us for

673
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:27,010
our final report but it should never

674
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,550
have happened

675
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:33,470
County government case that we worked

676
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:35,120
why would you target a County a

677
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:41,900
municipality a small government

678
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:43,459
organization what's that they don't have

679
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:48,190
the staffs low-hanging fruit for an

680
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:53,000
attacker and we know that in most cases

681
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:54,320
yes the counties will pay in fact we're

682
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,810
seeing a lot more organizations

683
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,179
municipalities that are getting hit that

684
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:00,530
are turning to their insurance companies

685
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,640
so I'm wondering how long that's going

686
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:07,928
to take before the insurance companies

687
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:10,669
go that's not our job in this case again

688
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:14,900
this was after the wanna cry attack but

689
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:18,109
but they allowed SMB sis to be exposed

690
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:24,080
to the Internet what do you think

691
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:25,340
happened it was a fire when we started

692
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,719
rolling through with them talking with

693
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,740
them we're like what about your logs and

694
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:32,799
there looked at us and they're like that

695
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:36,859
cost money we don't want to store logs

696
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:40,820
their logs were gone which makes it very

697
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:43,340
difficult to do forensics by the way we

698
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:45,679
asked them about their network flat

699
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:48,010
network syndrome you can see the end of

700
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,240
the Internet and you would fall off

701
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,100
alright how many of us have flat

702
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:56,739
networks don't raise your hand because

703
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:59,089
because I'd guess that 99.9% of us do

704
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:03,020
when we asked him about capability for

705
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:05,420
net flow and packet capture it was like

706
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:12,110
asking them to go find unicorns and cage

707
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:13,970
them up they had no concept now this was

708
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:16,700
a county munis this was a municipality

709
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:21,509
County government

710
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:26,000
and tack through SMB Sif's no

711
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:29,390
centralized logging flat network PCI or

712
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,370
packet capture and net flow was too hard

713
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:34,109
lateral movement yes we could see this

714
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,400
even after we were on site we could see

715
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:38,280
the attacker still moving within the

716
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,820
environment and propagating we

717
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,260
identified 343 systems out of how many

718
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,960
well we didn't know because they didn't

719
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:48,270
have an asset inventory in fact a

720
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:54,150
hundred of these systems were discovered

721
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:57,810
only because of the ransomware attack so

722
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:59,790
give you an idea of the time line we see

723
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:04,920
the going back from what we were able to

724
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:06,810
see started playing fire whack-a-mole so

725
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,360
initially fire department and Sheriff's

726
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:12,120
Department were hit then the County Jail

727
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,860
and water utility plant were hit the

728
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:17,400
passport office and and voter

729
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:21,510
registration County Courthouse DA's

730
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:24,300
office the tax assessor and the animal

731
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,850
shelter were the last two to get hit the

732
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,260
problem with playing whack-a-mole

733
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:30,450
they tried doing this themselves to try

734
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:37,170
and clean up because their IT manager

735
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:38,850
knew security they didn't we created a

736
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:42,660
problem and that problem was they

737
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:46,319
stomped on everything which led us to

738
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,490
having these types of impacts people who

739
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,500
were supposed to be released from jail

740
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:54,270
could not Sheriff's Department their

741
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,670
call system which was supposed to be

742
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:58,380
theoretically removed from the system

743
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:01,760
and not on the same network guess where

744
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:05,780
it was on the same network

745
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:09,720
passports water treatment facility

746
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:11,760
firefighting courthouse voter reg

747
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,149
Texas hustler and again this is the same

748
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,340
day that we got hit or we got called was

749
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,830
when it hit that last day with the tax

750
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,330
assessor but but I like to try find

751
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:24,620
goodness so I think the actual reason

752
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:24,620
they call this was because of this

753
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:38,059
I think this is why they called us there

754
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:42,150
pound could not let animals go to people

755
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:44,989
which that at least the brighter side of

756
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:47,369
things that's why I think they called us

757
00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:50,369
again when we talked about some of the

758
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:53,459
issues that they had you know firewall

759
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:55,079
review doing that now log retention

760
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:59,129
they're outsourcing that to a third

761
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,779
party the re architecting in our network

762
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:05,489
which is sad that that we have to take

763
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:07,019
that level of effort to do this again a

764
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:11,009
lot of this is being outsourced to a

765
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:17,189
third party again totally unprepared for

766
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:18,599
the incident that occurred 60% of the

767
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:23,549
business critical systems that they had

768
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:25,949
were able to be recovered about 100

769
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:27,719
systems that were being ransomed IT did

770
00:38:25,949 --> 00:38:31,799
not know about and guess what they

771
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:33,239
weren't able to recover that data this

772
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:37,650
one was a cheap one only one hundred

773
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:38,719
eighty thousand yen could have been

774
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,920
avoided

775
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:48,209
could have been avoided have we been

776
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:51,029
doing the basics healthcare providers

777
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:53,190
because we know that when we go to a

778
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:55,880
hospital we need we're not there for

779
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:58,090
just our our share enjoyment right

780
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,440
usually it's because there's an issue

781
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:02,729
[Music]

782
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,660
these folks were working hard at a

783
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:09,118
breach and ransomware event over

784
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:11,459
privileged users data was everywhere in

785
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,269
their environment they had no defined

786
00:39:11,459 --> 00:39:16,769
boundaries anywhere we couldn't identify

787
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:18,448
where data was supposed to be and where

788
00:39:16,769 --> 00:39:22,288
it had been moved by the adversaries

789
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:27,029
prior to encrypting it they had of

790
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:29,190
roughly 250 employees for were IT their

791
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:31,240
CIO chief technology officer and then

792
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:34,200
two people on the helpdesk

793
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:38,618
I think they may have priorities

794
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:42,819
priority issues they use the same local

795
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:46,690
password on over 400 systems because

796
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:48,609
what could possibly go wrong no

797
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:50,170
information security staff they were

798
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:52,569
dealing with very public breach as well

799
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:57,190
as part of the ransomware attack again

800
00:39:52,570 --> 00:40:00,430
email came in to one of their nurses who

801
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:03,970
then took that email forwarded on to

802
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:05,230
doctor number one who wanted to share

803
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:07,959
the love so he sent it to doctor number

804
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:11,859
two who sent it to doctor number three

805
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,839
who then sent it to their IT admin but

806
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:17,259
also doctor number two sent it to the

807
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:18,430
helpdesk again not security trained who

808
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:23,230
then turned around and sent it to the

809
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:23,980
IDC IO now we're talking about

810
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:28,330
ransomware

811
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:29,250
hitting a healthcare provider as well as

812
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:31,509
others

813
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,970
keeping in mind data is everywhere in

814
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:37,869
their environment this adversary went to

815
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:40,720
town with them CIO as it turned out had

816
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:44,770
access to all of these admin had access

817
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:47,189
to all of these employee records old

818
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:51,310
patient information the cloud drive

819
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:55,510
where they were storing stuff that was

820
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:57,040
not authorized by the organization the

821
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:59,140
admin was just trying to find additional

822
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,820
space because IT told her they they had

823
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:04,089
run out of space on their storage device

824
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:09,820
oh this Google things for you so I'll

825
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:13,330
just put it up there we took this

826
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:18,640
picture and this is I kid you not from

827
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:21,640
the client site notice that they put a

828
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:25,348
chain two chains and countersunk it into

829
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:27,759
the ground to secure their picnic table

830
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:29,320
someone gave more thought to protecting

831
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,820
a picnic table than their customer or

832
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:34,119
their consumer information their

833
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:37,390
patient's information fast forward to

834
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:39,619
the end of that this one went over a

835
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:42,999
million

836
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:46,279
and again could have been avoided

837
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:50,319
construction company because as it turns

838
00:41:46,279 --> 00:41:52,729
out criminal adversaries are not are not

839
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:55,819
discriminatory when it comes to who they

840
00:41:52,729 --> 00:42:00,919
attack they will attack anybody in order

841
00:41:55,819 --> 00:42:03,799
to ferret out money why would you attack

842
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:08,890
them anybody in here a fan of the

843
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:16,279
wu-tang clan a couple yeah cream right

844
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:20,868
what is cream stand for cash rules

845
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:24,170
everything around me Wow we are we in a

846
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:26,299
post lunch coma now okay Nick let's

847
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:30,920
start throwing out start getting candy

848
00:42:26,299 --> 00:42:32,450
and sugar out to the folks I'd mentioned

849
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,589
earlier the organization when you're

850
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:38,239
working with while we were in the course

851
00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:39,979
of doing the investigation they got they

852
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:44,499
they were reading the the message that

853
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:47,239
was left behind their general counsel

854
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:48,950
against our wishes we told them do not

855
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:50,479
reach out to them if you want to

856
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:56,149
communicate with them communicate

857
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:58,538
through us their general counsel sent

858
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,539
out an email

859
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,660
dear Sirs we understand that you're

860
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:04,999
personally requiring pay two hundred

861
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:08,359
thousand to receive the file keys

862
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:11,058
they offered because of financial

863
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:14,269
capabilities they only offered $20,000

864
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:15,769
in to $10,000 payments and people this

865
00:43:14,269 --> 00:43:17,899
has never happened to me before in my

866
00:43:15,769 --> 00:43:20,808
life because they responded the

867
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,880
adversary responded conversation with

868
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:24,829
the CFO exceeds their capabilities they

869
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,079
wanted two hundred thousand dollars they

870
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:30,079
offered them twenty and two easy ten

871
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:31,609
thousand dollar payments we found out

872
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:37,219
about this and we were waiting for it to

873
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:38,749
come the adversaries responded back Todd

874
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:40,700
after much internal discussion we

875
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:43,038
recommend you fire your CFO and pay the

876
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:47,269
requested amount and then sent them a

877
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:48,799
screenshot of their general ledger the

878
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:50,959
adversary had been in their network for

879
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:54,460
some time and identified exactly which

880
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,460
systems to target and go after

881
00:43:55,060 --> 00:44:00,170
they brute-force their RDP session which

882
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,690
to the company's account they thought

883
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,920
they were doing securely because they

884
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:08,690
put it on a different port than the

885
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:12,010
normal for security purposes no

886
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:16,000
centralized logging again flat network

887
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:21,170
packet capture not a thing

888
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,460
lateral movement much 43 servers 200

889
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:29,090
workstations in total at the

890
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:30,440
headquarters and 19 active sites they

891
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:33,859
ended up paying a company two hundred

892
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,480
thousand dollars to broker the

893
00:44:33,859 --> 00:44:37,670
transaction to recover their data and

894
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,780
recover their data off system so that

895
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:42,140
way they wouldn't get infected by

896
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:45,340
anything else in a quarter of a million

897
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:47,868
dollars spent to recover from ransomware

898
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:55,869
guess who wasn't getting a bonus that

899
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:55,869
year there

900
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:07,219
different they started making changes

901
00:45:02,589 --> 00:45:11,808
they started by the time the IRR is done

902
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:13,279
I step out it is it will incident

903
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:16,640
response is fun for the first couple of

904
00:45:13,279 --> 00:45:18,219
years but after seeing the same problem

905
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:24,799
over and over at different organizations

906
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:27,680
you can burnout as did I so private

907
00:45:24,799 --> 00:45:31,670
school again we have the trifecta of

908
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:35,058
evil over privileged users lack of

909
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:37,130
segmentation and weak credentials again

910
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:39,140
this was another brute force attack so

911
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:41,359
the adversary is actually logging into

912
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,549
the systems after they've compromised it

913
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,739
they had minimal logs we were able to

914
00:45:43,549 --> 00:45:47,390
reconstruct but they don't have 24 by 7

915
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:49,089
monitoring to alert them that this was

916
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:52,940
going on

917
00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:56,630
surprise surprise flat network no packet

918
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:58,519
capture we did identify lateral movement

919
00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:01,880
but we pick up that they had targeted

920
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:03,618
those specific systems on purpose they

921
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:11,539
went after five total servers 3.2

922
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:12,859
terabytes of data in total again we were

923
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:15,499
able to reconstruct that they'd been in

924
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:18,219
the network 48 hours before they sent

925
00:46:15,499 --> 00:46:21,049
the attacker they initiated the attack

926
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:22,729
so once they gained access to the

927
00:46:21,049 --> 00:46:24,410
systems they spent two days looking

928
00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:26,359
around before they actually launched the

929
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:30,828
attack now I know what you're all saying

930
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:35,029
Edie yeah this is a downer well the

931
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:38,690
impact was basically this they actually

932
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:41,479
had tested and validated their data

933
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:43,759
recovery and as a result once the attack

934
00:46:41,479 --> 00:46:46,729
occurred they were able to recover again

935
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:48,440
another Friday night case so IT was a

936
00:46:46,729 --> 00:46:49,519
little upset but IT was able to recover

937
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:54,229
and get the school back up and

938
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:58,368
operational by Monday morning and that's

939
00:46:54,229 --> 00:47:01,149
where we should be minimal data loss

940
00:46:58,369 --> 00:47:03,410
less than 5,000 dollars should respond

941
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:05,959
there re-engineering the remote access

942
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:10,129
because because multi-factor is a thing

943
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:11,598
as it turns out they're increasing the

944
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:14,359
logging and outsourcing the monitoring

945
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,890
capability again they had the proper

946
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:23,359
planning in place that prevented a major

947
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:27,618
incident are we at the same level so how

948
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:33,229
can we recover from ransomware how can

949
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:36,459
we recover well one is as develop your

950
00:47:33,229 --> 00:47:40,160
program so you're trained for ransomware

951
00:47:36,459 --> 00:47:42,709
do you know what to do does your staff

952
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:47,808
know what to do do they know how to

953
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:49,848
report or is your organization like some

954
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:51,440
that that look at it from the aspect of

955
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:55,940
well that's somebody else's job so I'm

956
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:58,400
not going to do it how many of you now

957
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:59,630
include ransomware activities and

958
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:05,319
attacks as part of your business

959
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:09,769
continuity plan nobody

960
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:13,609
what business continuity plan do we have

961
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:16,459
that factored in getting into areas like

962
00:48:13,609 --> 00:48:20,089
network packet capture with the case of

963
00:48:16,459 --> 00:48:21,109
the County attack that I shared one of

964
00:48:20,089 --> 00:48:23,029
the things I didn't share was they had

965
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:25,819
started power cycling systems one of the

966
00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:27,079
systems they had left unattended we were

967
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,459
able to go into the memory and recovery

968
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:30,829
they were decryption key and that's how

969
00:48:28,459 --> 00:48:33,169
we started recovering some of those

970
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:35,089
files not all of them did some of them

971
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:41,239
how many of you have the capability to

972
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:43,578
do host forensics memory forensics do

973
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:46,839
you work with the folks in these cases

974
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:46,839
and if not why not

975
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:56,350
again Network segmentation we can

976
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:58,840
address a lot of this for those of you

977
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,970
who are interested understanding the

978
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,550
different areas restrict user

979
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:04,660
permissions if an individual doesn't

980
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:07,140
need the permissions in order to do

981
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:09,670
their job take them away

982
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:12,100
continuous monitoring understand what

983
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:16,330
good is on your network so you can

984
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:19,420
identify bad make sure that your backup

985
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:22,900
will recover in storage solutions that

986
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:24,370
you have will meet the need in light of

987
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:30,420
adversity in the light of a ransomware

988
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:32,740
attack mature your ransomware program

989
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,510
network segmentation is a big start

990
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,069
that's a Herculean effort it's the

991
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,530
equivalent of saying we're going to move

992
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:40,060
the building six inches to the left

993
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:44,320
because you're going to break things but

994
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:47,410
it needs to be done otherwise we have

995
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:54,610
the we run the risk of not being able to

996
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:56,460
recover mature your programs so five

997
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:58,300
steps that you can take away right now

998
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:01,990
when you go back to your business

999
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:04,630
prevent this volume shadow copies we're

1000
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:08,140
seeing a lot of the ransomware will

1001
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:12,100
disable it and delete it make sure it's

1002
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:15,700
enabled remove your users from the local

1003
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:17,049
admin groups make sure they don't have

1004
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,299
the ability to install things on their

1005
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:23,590
own either intentionally or

1006
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:25,470
unintentionally limit the number of

1007
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:27,760
shares that users have right access to

1008
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:29,620
we like to put out file share so that

1009
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,780
way makes life easier so we can put

1010
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:33,850
documents there and upload spreadsheets

1011
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:38,110
but but do they actually need to have

1012
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:40,080
access to it use hidden file shares

1013
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:44,640
don't broadcast them don't let them out

1014
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:48,890
and then only teacher users the only map

1015
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:51,839
to file shares as they need them

1016
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:58,879
if the if the ransomware can't access

1017
00:50:51,839 --> 00:51:00,839
that chair it's not going encrypted and

1018
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,240
ransomware is becoming more and more

1019
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:05,160
prevalent we're seeing advances in in

1020
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,529
the attack methods where it used to be

1021
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,720
set out through a malicious document or

1022
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:10,829
a link we're now seeing adversaries

1023
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,609
going to the next step where they're

1024
00:51:10,829 --> 00:51:18,059
breaking in before they launch it this

1025
00:51:13,609 --> 00:51:20,098
can impact your organization we can

1026
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:22,740
reduce the impact we don't have to be

1027
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:25,799
the victim if you have proper backups

1028
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:30,629
that are tested and validated you can

1029
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:35,490
recover yes it's still going to cost but

1030
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:40,069
it's not going to cost as much and if

1031
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:42,240
for nothing else do it for him all right

1032
00:51:40,069 --> 00:51:45,990
that is the talk for the day

1033
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:47,939
thank you for joining hopefully you get

1034
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:58,680
a little bit more active as the day goes

1035
00:51:47,940 --> 00:52:10,079
on any questions no questions wow this

1036
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:13,230
is easy so we're seeing organizations

1037
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:15,180
especially the ones that have large flat

1038
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,410
networks like most organizations they're

1039
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,569
putting them on their perimeter devices

1040
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:20,430
so firewalls on the backside of the

1041
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:23,099
firewalls to see ingress and egress and

1042
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:26,220
they're I using it to identify any known

1043
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:27,539
malicious or situ type of activity so

1044
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,950
they're building out at the same time

1045
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:30,180
that they're battling ransomware they're

1046
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:33,689
trying to develop their threat Intel

1047
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:35,279
capability to identify is this you know

1048
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:37,200
why am I going out why are we going out

1049
00:52:35,279 --> 00:52:40,559
to this website why are we going out on

1050
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:43,038
these ports and identifying it before it

1051
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,039
becomes an issue

1052
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,080
any other questions
