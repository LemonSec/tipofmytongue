1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,129
while trying to get the video work I

2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:18,029
couldn't tell you all UDP jokes but I

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:20,750
don't know you get yeah I was how that

4
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:20,750
was a dad joke

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,960
Boop Wow what happened here okay there

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,910
we go

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,910
all right all right thanks mark

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,649
[Music]

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:44,910
alright we'll go ahead and get going

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:50,100
here this talk is on as you can see I'll

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:52,860
be talking about zero trust and to kind

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,770
of get going through here I wanted to

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,420
give a little bit of background on this

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,610
talk because it's going to be that's

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:05,760
somewhat relevant this involves the

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:08,030
entire gitlab security team I'm just

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,280
kind of a representative of that I've

18
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:15,660
been doing a lot of blogging on the

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,970
topic and whatnot so and I end up doing

20
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,950
I am doing a lot of research on this

21
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,220
subject as well so it's kind of thrown

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,369
in there into the mix myself I've been

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,910
in the industry for several decades I've

24
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:33,960
basically been an InfoSec for the past

25
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:37,199
25 years or so as my exclusive day job I

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,179
guess you would call it I have worn a

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,009
number of different hat colors over the

28
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,740
years I started out as a black hat

29
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,810
breaking into probably many of your

30
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,729
systems that are here today sorry about

31
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:53,610
that is a long time ago but I continue

32
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,340
to wear several different hat colors

33
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,520
it's just your coincidence I happen to

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:04,110
have a gray hat on today that doesn't

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:07,259
mean or imply anything but nonetheless I

36
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:11,700
do wear I do have a pretty varied

37
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:15,510
background for a long time it was either

38
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:19,619
IT admin or InfoSec professional by day

39
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:23,280
hacker by night kind of thing more or

40
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,860
less but I'm doing the InfoSec thing for

41
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,290
I've been doing it for a while and like

42
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,280
I mentioned one of my projects at git

43
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:35,700
lab as a researcher happens to be zero

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:41,550
trust and we're talking specifically

45
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:44,069
about getting zero trust in for the to

46
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:48,030
the company itself for the employees of

47
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:49,958
get lab I'm not going to include any of

48
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,760
the fancy charts and I agree

49
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,590
people usually show with zero trust

50
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,090
where they got the big particularly the

51
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,799
big diagram that belongs to a Google and

52
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,060
they're beyond core paper I'm not going

53
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:05,530
to include that in there because that

54
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,930
might imply that I'm trying to get you

55
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,829
to think a certain way so I'm not going

56
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:14,439
to do that I'm going to be discussing

57
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:19,389
specifically what we've been doing at

58
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:21,010
gitlab in that this is the steps that

59
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:23,970
we've been going through implementing

60
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,200
this stuff so hopefully I can have some

61
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,230
either I can get you to think about

62
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,339
things in your own situation that can

63
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:36,069
apply to you if you're thinking about

64
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:37,930
doing any of this kind of stuff so I'm

65
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:39,939
going to go ahead and define zero trust

66
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,480
but I'm only defining this in the

67
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:47,739
context of this applies to get lab it

68
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:51,909
may play out completely differently in

69
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:54,310
your organization probably the first

70
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:59,138
thing is user identification being able

71
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:00,849
to specifically identify a user and I'm

72
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:03,430
not talking specifically about an

73
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:06,209
account and a password I'm talking

74
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:10,180
specifically about identifying that yes

75
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:13,590
Alice is logging in and Alice's who she

76
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,590
said she is that kind of thing

77
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:20,620
same thing for device identification

78
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:25,030
being able to identify when Bob logs in

79
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,650
that that is Bob's you know computer

80
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,948
he's supposed to be logging in with

81
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,960
that's we've identified that it's you

82
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:34,479
know patched and properly configured and

83
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:39,130
that kind of saying that would be device

84
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:41,110
identification data classification this

85
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,000
was kind of weird a lot of people say

86
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,970
there's you know just you should have

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,680
like you know public internal and then

88
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,330
there's like the segmented parts and

89
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,270
stuff like that we do it slightly

90
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,859
different we have four tiers I it's

91
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,948
detailed in a blog post and I'll have a

92
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,460
link to all a way to get to all the blog

93
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:00,030
posts

94
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,698
last slide that you can look at but

95
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:08,619
basically what it boils down to is we

96
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:10,300
have green for public and red for the

97
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,889
most critical data and there's also

98
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,020
orange and yellow and there in between

99
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,479
and I'll kind of cover it here in an

100
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,539
example coming up a little bit what we

101
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,830
mean by that it's not specifically about

102
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:26,318
data in as much as it's about

103
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:29,109
information okay and there's there is a

104
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,630
distinction to that because a lot of

105
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,780
times the data represents information

106
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,520
and within context even though the data

107
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:40,289
doesn't change the information could

108
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,289
mean something completely different

109
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,729
access controlled systems this means

110
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,810
that we don't want to implement

111
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:50,039
something that we don't have some

112
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:53,370
semblance of control or we can actually

113
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:56,199
prevent either a person or a process

114
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:59,080
from accessing it except in a way that

115
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:04,419
we want and so we need to be able to

116
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:07,150
have that and have having defined

117
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:10,389
policies in a way of you know handling

118
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:12,280
and administering those policies to do

119
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:16,210
all the other stuff on this slide and

120
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,979
make it to where stuff isn't bad which I

121
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:22,590
believe is the marching orders of all

122
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:28,440
security departments make stuff not bad

123
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:30,489
now some issues that we've kind of

124
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,770
encountered when we started looking for

125
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,479
solutions on this and this predated me

126
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,740
because I've been at gitlab since

127
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,508
February and this predated me before I

128
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,669
got there but there really didn't seem

129
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:46,840
to be any agreement on what zero trust

130
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:49,630
was by various vendors and I'm not going

131
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,448
to point any fingers or use any names

132
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:55,389
but but yeah they're just things they

133
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:59,199
all have their own vision and version

134
00:06:55,389 --> 00:07:04,199
that they would you know try to push

135
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:07,349
upon you and everyone kept referring to

136
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,610
beyond Corp and I don't know if your

137
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:11,620
hopefully if you're into the zero

138
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,680
trusting you or at least vaguely

139
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:18,639
familiar with this thing

140
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:22,210
beyond Corp was the Google model that

141
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,089
was a response to a breach that they had

142
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,560
by a nation-state that came after

143
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:31,960
certain elements of them and took

144
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:35,349
advantage of their unique architecture

145
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,210
and whatnot so they were able to they

146
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:41,860
went through and said okay we need to

147
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:43,599
change things in our model and how we do

148
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,289
security and they came up with this

149
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:50,110
thing specifically for them and they

150
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:52,180
went had put a paper out so that

151
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,680
everyone could read it so they could

152
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,650
learn from it and then go do their own

153
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,300
thing as stead vendors just latched on

154
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,440
and said we're doing beyond Corp so you

155
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:05,080
don't have to worry about it

156
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:08,349
and no vendor has a complete solution

157
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:12,669
regardless of what they tell you no

158
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:19,060
vendor does all right they don't trust

159
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:22,150
me so basically with these vendors we

160
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,789
had one that isn't Google trying to sell

161
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:28,719
us an incomplete version of an internal

162
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:31,060
Google solution to my company which

163
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:34,479
meant that it wasn't going to work there

164
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:37,240
was no way it was going to work and that

165
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,070
was kind of a tough realization to deal

166
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,409
with it just like what are we gonna do

167
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:44,290
we're just maybe we can do a parcel

168
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:46,120
solution we can just say okay well one

169
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,709
of those elements that we had that we're

170
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,610
trying to implement maybe we can take

171
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:58,000
just one of those and use that and

172
00:08:50,610 --> 00:09:01,240
implement that so going to these vendors

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,220
a lot of them this is traditionally what

174
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,350
they they would make they make

175
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,820
assumptions to a certain degree and they

176
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,490
have to because or you know they've got

177
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:13,620
to market their their products and

178
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,620
whatnot to sort of companies and

179
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,520
part of it they say okay what you're

180
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,230
doing zero trust you're going to have to

181
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,040
remove your perimeter and maybe there's

182
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:26,170
a vendor that has features or something

183
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,930
is this a part of it where that works

184
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,670
well for them they can help you as you

185
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,219
remove your perimeter that's a part of

186
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:36,640
their product or whatever and then

187
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,830
there's what we can help because we can

188
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,930
help you dismantle your VPN because

189
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:43,780
you're not going to need your VPN

190
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,579
anymore that could be that could be an

191
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:50,589
interesting thing that they may have as

192
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:52,330
a part of their offering typically few

193
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,070
remote workers they've got oh we've got

194
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,660
some solutions that while we're putting

195
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,400
this thing in we can actually address

196
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,829
the fact that you have this small

197
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,569
percentage of your organization that has

198
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,930
remote users and we can help you and

199
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,970
that's good all right and they also say

200
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,099
well look you're probably implementing

201
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:15,340
some cloud stuff we've got a way to help

202
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:18,130
with on-prem and cloud and they may have

203
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,960
some stuff that has to reside on Prem

204
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,720
and that but it can still talk to the

205
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,940
cloud that kind of thing so there's a

206
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,400
variety of things like that that we're

207
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,740
kind of in play and then they also

208
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,530
assume asset management and I'm gonna

209
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:36,670
guess pretty much everyone in here does

210
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:41,500
some level some form of asset management

211
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:43,959
and I'm not talking just about you know

212
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,300
the servers or containers or cloud

213
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,450
presences but the actual laptops people

214
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,449
have

215
00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:04,138
that's great well the thing is we had a

216
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:07,170
completely different reality at gitlab

217
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:13,620
and so that kind of caused some problems

218
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:17,959
for us dealing with vendors first off we

219
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:23,760
have no perimeter we never had one ever

220
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:27,899
no perimeter at all never did we do not

221
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:34,560
have a VPN no VPN at all no perimeter no

222
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:38,430
VPN we are a 100% all remote worker

223
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,670
company the CEO the headquarters is the

224
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:44,279
ceo's apartment out in California and

225
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,889
that is not a job that's real ok you

226
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:52,860
know it's just there are there isn't

227
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:54,720
we're all remote we're all cloud we have

228
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,600
been from the beginning and we will

229
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:03,540
continue to be moving forward there's no

230
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:07,620
on Prem whatsoever and unfortunately we

231
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,870
have limited asset management and the

232
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:15,149
area where we have the most problems is

233
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:18,240
in BYOD we only started buying laptops

234
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:24,660
for employs a couple of years ago before

235
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:27,449
that is BYOD get labs started as a fork

236
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,880
of an open-source project okay that's

237
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:31,380
how get labs started everyone was

238
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,890
working from home that's what they all

239
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:37,620
just use whatever you have and

240
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:41,850
contribute we still do that to a large

241
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,730
degree we're what you call open core so

242
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,240
the

243
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:49,090
the majority of our product is free and

244
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,790
you can get to the source code that's

245
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:54,820
out there on the on the internet and

246
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,699
anybody anywhere can contribute to that

247
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:00,790
make changes and whatnot and we've

248
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:06,040
applied that to unbelievably huge

249
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:09,130
amounts of our company which is gonna

250
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,530
seem even worse when I get some later

251
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,990
slides it's really not it's actually

252
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:17,050
kind of fraying in a way but the point

253
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:19,030
is is just we've got a really good

254
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:22,630
handle on our infrastructure as far as

255
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:25,089
what we've got in the cloud and all of

256
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:28,240
our you know servers and containers and

257
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:30,040
and and instances and what-have-you we

258
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,820
have a really good at handle on all that

259
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,890
stuff and can scale and do everything

260
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:41,260
with that that part's great it's just

261
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:43,120
that you know the asset management thing

262
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:48,390
is somewhat limited so as you can

263
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:53,040
imagine we can't rely on a single vendor

264
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:57,010
for four zero trust to work at all

265
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:01,000
most of them are selling their solution

266
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:04,030
is the Indus solves part of a problem

267
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:11,020
that we've already solved or that does

268
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:13,209
not apply to us ok so there's a few

269
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:17,530
other pain points that I didn't want to

270
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:21,610
cover that will kind of drive home some

271
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:23,079
of this even more data classification is

272
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,330
fluid and I wanted to give you an

273
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,310
example of this with something that

274
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:31,390
happens somewhat recently to us we had a

275
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,800
customer just for those of you that

276
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:39,340
don't know gitlab is say a web based

277
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,870
devops lifecycle management kind of

278
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,310
company ok

279
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:47,760
so that's what we that's what we do

280
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:52,140
and we had a customer of ours that

281
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:54,360
reported a problem and you know this

282
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,740
customer it was for them it was serious

283
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,910
it meant that they could potentially

284
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,590
have their private code breached and

285
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:05,280
because they were doing all their code

286
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:10,710
development they were doing it on on get

287
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:13,770
lab systems and so in our classification

288
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:15,600
ranking it ended up being orange that

289
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:21,720
was an you know that's considered orange

290
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:23,490
data all right now after evaluation it's

291
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,510
like oh this could affect multiple

292
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:32,430
people multiple customers so now it's

293
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:34,620
been elevated to read data once we go

294
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,569
through and we can if we figured out a

295
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,940
way to mitigate it and then very quickly

296
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,900
we had this thing patched and that

297
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,980
process

298
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:46,980
I can't it didn't take a long time to do

299
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:51,390
this but because we're all about that

300
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:53,610
whole you know dev SEC ops thing of

301
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,350
rapid development of security a part of

302
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,830
the process and everything like that so

303
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:02,760
we're very quickly able to Patrick oh

304
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:04,680
and then get the patch pushed out and do

305
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:09,660
our notifications and whatnot at that

306
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:13,849
point the data becomes green data except

307
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:16,920
for the company that recorded the data

308
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:19,920
to us they didn't want their name

309
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:22,410
associated with this they didn't want

310
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,400
anyone to know that they were using us

311
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:28,650
as a as a resource because they felt

312
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,650
that might put a target because hey our

313
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:35,610
code is located in this place and so

314
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:37,650
just to kind of help to help them and

315
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,150
this is just something to you know we do

316
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,530
just you know if you don't want to tell

317
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,350
anybody yourselves here you don't have

318
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:46,500
to and we'll keep it private for you and

319
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,270
that's exactly what they did and so the

320
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,050
fact that their name is associated with

321
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:53,640
it that becomes I became yellow data I

322
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:56,689
think it may have been Orange I can't

323
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:01,109
remember exactly but nonetheless

324
00:16:56,689 --> 00:17:03,959
during that process at any point if

325
00:17:01,109 --> 00:17:06,959
someone is going to authenticate and you

326
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:09,329
have a policy that says this person

327
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,600
cannot access read data or if this

328
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:18,898
person can only access you know green

329
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:21,779
and yellow data the data classification

330
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:23,458
could change at some point during the

331
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:26,159
day after they've done their initial

332
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:29,429
authentication so we needed to look at

333
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:32,370
ways to be able to make sure that we can

334
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:37,470
enforce on a transaction-by-transaction

335
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:40,850
basis that our data policy and adhere to

336
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:44,340
that and so that's been kind of we've

337
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:45,809
we're doing pretty good in that arena

338
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,629
because we have pretty good access

339
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:50,610
controls on our stuff and there's been

340
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:53,519
areas where we've had to you know write

341
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:55,709
some stuff to improve that or implement

342
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,750
something to improve that ends but but

343
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,370
there you have it that's that's a pain

344
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,820
point that we have to deal with so any

345
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:06,120
solution we have for any part of any of

346
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,860
this stuff that we're talking about that

347
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:13,709
comes to mind that comes to the

348
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:15,918
forefront oops

349
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:19,559
too far there but nonetheless

350
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:25,470
provisioning and de-provisioning is hard

351
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:30,539
I'll talk about that one first we had

352
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:32,700
and this was when I started there if we

353
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:36,240
had this process in place so you get a

354
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:38,760
new employee and it's already weird

355
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,440
enough because once you signed your

356
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,200
paperwork they immediately started

357
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,730
creating your accounts and everything

358
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
and of course it's digital signature

359
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,389
because we're all remote you're not

360
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,178
going anywhere for onboarding and then

361
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:53,070
they ship you a laptop and hopefully you

362
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:58,799
get your laptop before the first day of

363
00:18:53,070 --> 00:19:00,178
work and so they start creating all

364
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,789
these accounts on all these different

365
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:08,010
systems and I haven't mentioned this but

366
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:09,790
I say cloud-based were in the middle of

367
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:14,170
doing some transitioning

368
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:16,260
and whatnot and there's some things

369
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:20,320
we're keeping on certain systems for

370
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:21,810
various reasons but it's complicated but

371
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,520
we're on four different cloud providers

372
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,530
okay

373
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,260
mainly on - but we're still we're on

374
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:37,320
four different cloud providers and as

375
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:40,210
far as SAS applications go I think as of

376
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,939
well when I submitted this slides are

377
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,560
submitted to talk you know to you know

378
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,050
just just you know Ferguson for

379
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,060
acceptance for this conference we were

380
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:52,870
at well over 70 different SAS

381
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:57,970
applications and I think we've probably

382
00:19:52,870 --> 00:20:00,280
up to that by at least probably ten we

383
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,920
probably got rid of a few and then but

384
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,970
you know there's probably a net gain of

385
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,230
10 and so we do so you can imagine that

386
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:13,600
provisioning accounts is kind of a

387
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:15,310
nightmare and yeah when I first started

388
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,159
there it would take two or three weeks

389
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:20,770
to do that and of course the worst thing

390
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:24,880
you want to find is that all of a sudden

391
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:27,040
you have you know Alice is looking at

392
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,060
some system and she sees that here's an

393
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:34,600
account on some some container some

394
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:38,050
important you know Lennox server this

395
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,090
running of Bob and it's been and Bob

396
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:43,750
hasn't been an employee for three months

397
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:46,620
that's just like oh my gosh why how did

398
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:50,470
we miss that well the D provisioning is

399
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,389
probably harder and and that was the

400
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,060
thing I was probably when I was hired I

401
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:58,060
was probably a employee number I don't

402
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:00,490
know maybe 400 or something and this was

403
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:03,220
in February and we're now at over a

404
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:04,750
thousand and we're gonna be at about

405
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,390
maybe

406
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,950
I don't know bye-bye March we're

407
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:12,610
expecting to be around you know some of

408
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:16,120
the neighborhood of 1,200 or so maybe

409
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:18,189
more is so it just were having just all

410
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,199
this dynamic growth that's going on and

411
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:22,540
we're still trying to do all this stuff

412
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,370
and like I said we barely have asset

413
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:31,149
management I'm talking specifically

414
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:33,100
about laptops we're uh were a mac shop

415
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,840
mainly that's what we're buying for all

416
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:39,399
the employees are Macs

417
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:42,550
we will purchase a Dell for them that

418
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:46,120
ships with Ubuntu Linux who they could

419
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:49,419
use for Linux if they want and they most

420
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,639
people end up just wiping it loading on

421
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,280
their favorite flavor of Linux and as

422
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,860
fine but nonetheless that's the two main

423
00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:01,480
operating systems we support Windows

424
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:03,250
isn't allowed but I'll be very frank

425
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,040
with all of you we don't have a way to

426
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,900
enforce that yet

427
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,670
we really don't we can see it we can see

428
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,570
the violations that occur but we really

429
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:15,760
don't have a way to enforce it so we're

430
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:18,340
we're working on that we're we've got to

431
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,850
fleet Smith in for managing the Mac's

432
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:26,649
and that's I think yeah we're that's

433
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:28,629
implemented now and so that's what we're

434
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,880
using for all the Mac's at this point

435
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:34,620
and so we've got some semblance of some

436
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,720
control over at least a majority of our

437
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:41,080
of our workstations but we still are

438
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,460
having some problems managing that you

439
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,610
know it still doesn't mean that someone

440
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,160
can't decide to log in from their iPhone

441
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,639
or

442
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:53,500
from there you know their surface or

443
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,500
whatever it is they're logging in from

444
00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:03,290
so our plan we decided not to focus so

445
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:06,260
much on zero trust stuff that vendors

446
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:10,129
were selling we just if they had zero

447
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,510
trust like properties it's like okay

448
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,970
well we'll look at those and see if

449
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,920
that's something that we can that we can

450
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,200
use and it's something that we can

451
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:23,930
integrate in with what we're what we're

452
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:26,060
currently doing and we had to reduce

453
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,740
everything down to basics it all had to

454
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,139
come down to just the most basic

455
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:34,700
components and then solve for those

456
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:38,750
individual components such as device

457
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:40,940
management such as you know user

458
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,370
provisioning and things like that we had

459
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:46,190
just had to reduce everything down to

460
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:48,409
raw components to see what we see what

461
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:53,030
we could cobble together from all of

462
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:58,190
these uh various vendors we have to

463
00:23:53,030 --> 00:24:01,520
solve for each one of those basics we

464
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,750
had to find budget for it which is as

465
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,280
you can imagine would be tricky

466
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:08,450
particularly if we found something that

467
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:10,340
was really nice and sweet and it costs a

468
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:14,270
lot of money we have to figure out well

469
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:17,090
and right now that's basically it's

470
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:19,129
coming out of the security the security

471
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,500
budget I mean that's because it's

472
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,630
security related but now fortune we're a

473
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,640
part of engineering and and all that so

474
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,560
that's that's but nonetheless you know

475
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,540
are still it's gonna hit the bottom line

476
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:33,740
somewhere

477
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:35,960
and then we have to tie all this stuff

478
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:40,820
together we have to make every bit of

479
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:43,400
this stuff actually work where we can

480
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:48,530
actually kind of make it cohesive if

481
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:51,110
you're gonna write a policy and that

482
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:53,270
policy covers more than one of these

483
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:56,810
basics all this stuff has to actually

484
00:24:53,270 --> 00:25:02,990
work together and we're not still not

485
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:05,600
quite there so some of the things we

486
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:10,640
identified where we wanted to have user

487
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:13,070
authentication with 2fa we wanted to be

488
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:17,300
able to provision indy provision in

489
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:22,159
minutes not days or weeks like it was

490
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:24,260
when I first started there a secure

491
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,540
communications we wanted everything

492
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,490
that's talking to each other you know

493
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,639
between the various subsystems we wanted

494
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:34,160
it all to be secured encrypted believe

495
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,110
it or not there was some cases where it

496
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,460
might not necessarily be that way we

497
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,459
wanted to make sure it was that way

498
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:46,310
audit access controls this kind of a

499
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:49,660
loaded little point on here we wanted to

500
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:53,379
be able to have a way to go in and audit

501
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:59,150
all the controls we had available to us

502
00:25:53,380 --> 00:26:00,890
for a particular component api's you

503
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:04,640
know everything everything associated

504
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:06,770
with that and we also needed a way to

505
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,340
track their usage we wanted to be able

506
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:12,230
to say if someone used this API if

507
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,379
someone used this particular sub

508
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:18,770
component or whatever can we track that

509
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:23,450
we wanted to be able to do both of those

510
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:26,600
things and of course manage assets like

511
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,650
I mentioned that was another huge one

512
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,300
like I said we've gotten the

513
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,040
infrastructure part of it down all of

514
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:34,399
our cloud stuff we can manage that

515
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:38,020
pretty well and this one it may seem

516
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:41,660
like a weird one to have in there for

517
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:43,120
2fa this is one of the ones that I was

518
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,050
really adamant about doing

519
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,750
which was detection and tracking of

520
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:55,870
anomalies when someone decides to try to

521
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:57,970
bypass or not use the elements of our

522
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:00,790
zero trust solution we wanted to be able

523
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:05,770
to way to see that and see what they're

524
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:10,659
doing to some extent so he can make some

525
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:12,400
semblance of a decision on that so let's

526
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,970
talk about some of these individually

527
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:19,690
what we did or are doing user

528
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:22,480
authentication with 2fa we went with

529
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:24,940
octa I don't know anyone here familiar

530
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,870
with octave the price if you people

531
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:31,600
nodding their heads hands gone up yeah

532
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:34,590
we're using octa and we gave the users

533
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,820
this is another thing I'll touch on a

534
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:40,480
little touch on it now I'll just go do

535
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:43,960
it out we have a very very open company

536
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:47,860
and we get a lot of feedback from our

537
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:49,660
user community from the employees and

538
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,250
everything we wanted to make sure if

539
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:54,309
we're going to implement to factor that

540
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:56,110
we try to give them a choice so one of

541
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:59,170
our big conferences where we

542
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:01,870
occasionally and get together every 9 to

543
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:02,820
12 months will all fly to some city on

544
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,678
the planet

545
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,840
because we're a global company we're in

546
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:12,429
60 countries spread out all over the

547
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:15,090
place when we get together like that we

548
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:18,250
handed out a whole bunch of yuba keys

549
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:20,889
every attendant got you the keys and if

550
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:23,140
someone wants a Yubikey they can just

551
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:25,600
simply just by one and expense it and

552
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,429
it's you know just practically and

553
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,620
suddenly reimbursed and because this is

554
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:31,179
just like oh this is a no-brainer if

555
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,100
they want to give you key fine we'll get

556
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:37,320
they can do

557
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:39,928
be king if they want to like what I

558
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:44,220
opted for doing was I have the octave

559
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:46,080
verify app up my phone because I'm

560
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,320
extraordinarily lazy and I can

561
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:53,159
authenticate to factor using my Apple

562
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:56,939
watch because I'm so lazy I can't reach

563
00:28:53,160 --> 00:29:01,549
into my pocket to get my phone but I can

564
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:03,840
get to my wrist so you know I'll do that

565
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:05,850
but I mean that's what we ended up doing

566
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,639
for user authentication and that worked

567
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:12,209
out really well the other thing that it

568
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:15,230
actually helped with was the

569
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:17,630
provisioning and de-provisioning I as a

570
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,530
you know a company that's you know

571
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,880
integrated all these different shows

572
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:23,789
octa integrates with all these different

573
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,679
SAS applications most of these SAS

574
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:28,559
applications will speak something you

575
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:32,520
know the del out for SSO a lot of them

576
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:35,158
talks sam'l and so we kind of pseudo

577
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,610
de-facto standardized on sam'l and now

578
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:40,919
it's a part of an evaluation process

579
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:43,049
when we're evaluating a new SAS company

580
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:47,280
that we're wanting to get a part of it

581
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:49,799
is like hey can you talk to octa or do

582
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,530
you have sam'l support so we can figure

583
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:55,918
out a way to make you talk to octave and

584
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:58,649
what happened with this is that one of

585
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,500
things we have we used bamboo HR Izumo

586
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:08,030
familiar bamboo HR if you've had our

587
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:11,659
bolts an HR type SAS application and

588
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:18,120
very popular with startups and whatnot

589
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:25,309
when excuse me when HR creates a new

590
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:29,520
employee in bamboo HR that

591
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:30,960
auto-populates out to octa and then octa

592
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,500
goes out and creates all of those

593
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,920
accounts and this is based upon the

594
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,200
user's titled and

595
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,910
and the department they're in and even

596
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,940
some groups that they're associated with

597
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:45,130
and so that gets to be auto-populated we

598
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:49,480
can do the same thing when we deeper

599
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:51,580
vision so all of a sudden they leave

600
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,630
their say you know I submit my

601
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,240
resignation

602
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:59,130
boom someone can go in there and

603
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:04,930
deactivate their account on everything

604
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:09,300
and that's that's been a huge thing an

605
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:15,430
area that we're still working on this is

606
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:17,110
as you can imagine we do have a we do

607
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:20,170
have these administrators of our

608
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:22,780
infrastructure and these are people's

609
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:27,820
it's an independent of our coders for

610
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:31,750
example or do all the development but we

611
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:33,810
have this infrastructure group and for

612
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:35,980
them they were just like this is

613
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:38,620
unbelievably painful to create a new

614
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,630
user and now you're telling me I'm you

615
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,370
know Mike you you stupid people you

616
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,860
granted my wish I'm getting 50 new

617
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:47,260
employees in the next month I'm gonna

618
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:51,010
have to have a couple of engineers spend

619
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:52,840
days going to end to all these systems

620
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:55,570
to create accounts for these particular

621
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,340
people and they came to security and

622
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:58,649
said look this octave things really cool

623
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,030
can you

624
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,740
is there something along those lines

625
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,590
that'll actually work for us and there

626
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:09,010
actually was there's octa ASM octave for

627
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:12,970
a sa I think it's called and it does SSH

628
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:16,900
and RDP and we use the FIR SSH and so it

629
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:19,380
will even allow us to provision accounts

630
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:22,360
and so that's and we're thinking about

631
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:25,630
well possibly rolling that out to our

632
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:28,179
developer community as well so that all

633
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:30,640
the stuff that they have to SSH into to

634
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,520
do their stuff do we have some semblance

635
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,620
of control over that as well so that's

636
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,690
that's kind of that's really kind of

637
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:41,399
work so we think we've got a pretty good

638
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:43,870
handle between the two factor and the

639
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:46,230
provisioning and de-provisioning orage I

640
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,659
should mention all the two-factor

641
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:54,360
in some instances where we had something

642
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:58,620
that was basically hosting read data we

643
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:01,290
went ahead and added a third factor for

644
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,360
some of those Thanks bamboo HR example

645
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:05,210
you can look you can log in at the

646
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,679
beginning of the day into octave and

647
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:09,870
then you get the octave dashboard and

648
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:16,350
you click on the app and if you click on

649
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:19,020
a bamboo HR it's gonna ask for another

650
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:20,820
factor it's usually the same two factor

651
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,310
but it's gonna say okay you're gonna

652
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,800
have to prove it again just to make sure

653
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:28,889
and just kind of a good policy that we

654
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,750
were able to implement that way by the

655
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:33,480
way I'm not trying to make this I don't

656
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,980
work for octa when I work from it lab it

657
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,040
probably sounds like a commercial for

658
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,420
them but that part that part of what

659
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:44,760
they were doing work for us it really

660
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:47,310
did the secure communications thing this

661
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:53,670
was one of these really weird ones as

662
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:56,820
you can imagine we have a git lab we

663
00:33:53,670 --> 00:34:00,000
participate with the hacker one bug

664
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,889
bounty program and have been paying out

665
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,330
a lot of money to people to find bugs

666
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:09,270
and our stuff and I think we were even

667
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:11,159
trying to you know improve like how

668
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:12,179
quickly we pay and stuff like that

669
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:14,909
because we're really trying to encourage

670
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:20,839
that cuz it's been very very helpful for

671
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:23,460
us and someone had found a flaw in and I

672
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:28,860
won't go into details but basically it

673
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:33,030
had to do with a form of you know pseudo

674
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:36,930
injection as it as it were when I came

675
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:39,990
down to it and we were looking around

676
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:41,549
for solutions and since we're based on

677
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:43,080
open source is just like Willis or any

678
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:45,480
type of open source product it's

679
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,900
outdoors or any type of thing that we

680
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,550
can do because we this specifically

681
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,470
could be taking advantage of the fact

682
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,630
that you know you have like one system

683
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:55,859
is trying to communicate with another

684
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:58,410
system but it's got to go through a

685
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:00,870
cluster and so it's just like it's

686
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:02,640
you've got to specify something and it

687
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:05,640
is so we needed some way to kind of

688
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,410
manage all of that anyways we're looking

689
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:11,609
at solutions for this we ended up using

690
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:13,589
this thing called camo proxy and camo

691
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:16,770
proxy the thing that was really cool

692
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:18,150
about it was that by doing you know

693
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,380
security department's looking at it

694
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:22,860
we're saying this thing is awesome

695
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:27,120
because by default it makes sure that

696
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:30,990
you're doing encrypted communications

697
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:32,880
between nodes and then someone said hey

698
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:34,649
I got an idea so we don't run into this

699
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,850
problem again while we just implement

700
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:40,950
this everywhere in the company and then

701
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:44,370
we're just like sure

702
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:48,419
turn and so we instantly have not only

703
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:51,210
did it solve some a current and possibly

704
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,370
future security problems it actually

705
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,920
ended up securing our communications so

706
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:57,359
it's kind of a nice little side benefit

707
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,600
there is that all of our communications

708
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:09,900
were taken that and you know taken to

709
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:12,290
that level on the auditing of access

710
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:15,240
controls we're still working on that one

711
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:18,360
there is an effort going on right now -

712
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,549
I mean we can do this manually we're

713
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:24,240
looking and we're still doing it

714
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:27,210
manually because we're not done this is

715
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:31,830
a hard problem and we're looking for

716
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:33,570
ways to solve this where we can actually

717
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:35,880
go through and just say oK we've got all

718
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:38,580
the I mean you think that because a lot

719
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,100
of it's our own code that we we know but

720
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,750
still you it's just like but we don't

721
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,330
have auditing you may not have auditing

722
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:47,850
turned on to everything we want and then

723
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:51,690
you've got issues with the data

724
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:53,520
retention you've got issues with because

725
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:55,440
I mean we've got employees all over the

726
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,350
planet so you've got like different

727
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,690
jurisdictions or different privacy laws

728
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:03,150
apply and as a general rule to make

729
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:07,020
things easier it's just like okay what's

730
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:08,370
this what's the most strictest policy

731
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,119
out there we're just going to do that

732
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,890
implement

733
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,190
that company-wide because it's just

734
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:19,609
easier than trying to go region by

735
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:21,299
region you know so we're having a some

736
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:23,630
difficulty with that what we're getting

737
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:23,630
there

738
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:38,759
managing assets that's again that's

739
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:41,039
still another kind of a tricky one like

740
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:44,490
I mentioned having to we got the servers

741
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:48,420
and instances and all the containers

742
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:50,839
stuff down pretty good we're still we're

743
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:54,059
gonna have to figure out something for

744
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:56,730
mobile devices I don't know I know what

745
00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:59,249
we're gonna do there it was it an

746
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:02,130
informal poll of our security department

747
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:03,569
and and and our security departments

748
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,460
pretty big by the way I mean it's

749
00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:10,319
actually because the upper management

750
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:13,680
was so keen on security the number of

751
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:16,410
people in the security team is a direct

752
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,509
percentage of the total user population

753
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:21,509
of the company so as the company grows

754
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:27,960
we grow and that's kind of nice to have

755
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:29,910
that kind of built in there but and this

756
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,579
is also the security team is not just

757
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:34,379
you know researchers like myself but

758
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:35,789
also there's like you know application

759
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,309
security there's people that are doing

760
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:41,309
you know sac ops you know the day-to-day

761
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:44,759
stuff there's a team that handles

762
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:47,579
nothing but abuse that occurs there's a

763
00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:50,819
team that handles compliance and a red

764
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:52,259
team and field security which talks to

765
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:53,880
the rest of the company about what we're

766
00:38:52,259 --> 00:38:57,029
doing security wise and whatnot so

767
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:59,730
there's a whole big effort there and an

768
00:38:57,029 --> 00:39:03,529
informal survey of just the security

769
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:07,769
team who should know better there are

770
00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:09,029
violations of our BYOD policy because I

771
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:11,058
technically you're not supposed to be

772
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:14,300
accessing anything from phones

773
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:17,030
technically we all do it though

774
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,350
it's just work we're willing I means the

775
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:20,600
security and we're willing to accept the

776
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:22,880
risk that something could happen down

777
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,750
the line and someone might say you know

778
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,280
hey I need to see what's on that phone

779
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:30,650
not the company but just you know

780
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,110
there's outside forces that could you

781
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:35,600
know as a part of some whatever it could

782
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:38,000
happen the chance of that happening is

783
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,620
extraordinarily small and since we're

784
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,770
into risk assessment and security

785
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,690
department we've all done the math in

786
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:47,570
our head and said well I'm gonna get hit

787
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:50,930
by lightning twice before that event

788
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:52,430
happens so I probably will be okay if it

789
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:56,049
happened once I'm gonna go play the

790
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:56,049
lottery instantly gonna tell you that

791
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:02,120
but this ties into the detection and

792
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,890
tracking of anomalies thing this is

793
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,799
something we've started we're in the

794
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:08,930
process of coming up with a way to

795
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,620
collect all these logs and all this log

796
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:15,529
data so that we can do some really

797
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:20,870
interesting things that against logs

798
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:23,000
that aren't 100% obvious and to give an

799
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:27,290
example of that it's like let's say that

800
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:32,530
I have sceptic on Alice and Bob a lot

801
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:34,990
say that Alice logs in from Seattle

802
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:41,900
which is where she works

803
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:45,709
but her authentication is her two-factor

804
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:49,670
authentication is occurring from a

805
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:51,860
different time zone or a different

806
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:54,020
continent okay that's something that's

807
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,220
kind of odd there may be something up

808
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:58,370
with that

809
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,959
now it could be no and this could happen

810
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:02,779
that's like just say you know midday

811
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,280
she's logged in from one place and then

812
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,000
in the afternoon all of a sudden she's

813
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,620
logged in

814
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:13,600
according to her Lobby other planet now

815
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:15,890
she could be going to coffee house and

816
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,430
logging in from there and using a

817
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:23,029
personal VPN and the personal VPN is

818
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:24,680
then you know going through a server

819
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,900
that's located somewhere on the other

820
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,450
side of the planet that kind of makes

821
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:32,120
sense in some cases that might explain

822
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:35,089
why on a two-factor saying that it's

823
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,650
coming from different places we want to

824
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,840
be able to track that kind of odd

825
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:42,110
anomaly now if these things are coming

826
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:47,440
from different systems we want to be

827
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:50,360
able to track that there's some

828
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,830
geolocation type stuff that we might

829
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,660
want to be able to do if we're able to

830
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:56,120
pull something up off the phone that

831
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,220
says one thing or are they you know and

832
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,600
it doesn't match up with you know the

833
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:03,770
other we want to be able to pull all

834
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:06,380
those odd things if you have a you know

835
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:11,170
processes runnings that shouldn't be

836
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:14,600
running except as a result of someone

837
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:16,370
logging in and launching a job and then

838
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,040
all of a sudden those processes just

839
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:21,980
kick off on their own that's an anomaly

840
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,970
that we want to be able to to note does

841
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:27,340
it could mean that there's something

842
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:29,839
going on that was not intended so that

843
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:34,250
ties into that and if we could somehow

844
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:38,840
then affect access associated with those

845
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:41,900
actions then we can make that a part of

846
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,790
our are not only with it it's pretty

847
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,440
cool to be able to do that but if we

848
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:49,040
make that kind of a part of our whole

849
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,790
policy involving access so that's

850
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,990
something we're kind of working on my

851
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:55,820
advice if you're doing this stuff

852
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:58,640
obviously you're going to have to get

853
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:01,640
upper management to support this

854
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:06,109
we're lucky in that case that security

855
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:17,390
is way up on the list it's one of the

856
00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:19,220
top is in the top three okay and the the

857
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:21,680
breaking things down into simple

858
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,299
components is just a must you just have

859
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,029
to do that that's the only way to get

860
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:29,720
this kind of thing implemented we

861
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:31,640
couldn't just come in and do these but

862
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:36,649
the last thing you want to do is to be

863
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:38,390
adapting whatever a vendor says to do to

864
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:40,309
your environment you shouldn't have to

865
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,839
change your environment to accommodate a

866
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:44,540
vendor it should be the other way around

867
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:46,220
you should be saying I'm going to take

868
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,710
this this this and this from this vendor

869
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:56,359
and make it work for me it should be the

870
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:58,069
exact opposite look where you're have

871
00:43:56,359 --> 00:43:59,808
areas where you're winning and then

872
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:01,640
capitalize on that for us we were

873
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:04,250
winning with octa and so they ended up

874
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,078
saying what else can this thing do and

875
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:08,270
that's why we're you know implementing

876
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,339
some of these other features and stuff

877
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:12,799
that maybe at the beginning if we tried

878
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:15,319
to sell this entire thing to upper

879
00:44:12,799 --> 00:44:18,680
management it might have been a harder

880
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:21,009
sell but by doing it piece by piece were

881
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:24,319
able to say well hey remember when we

882
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:25,490
you know when we had HR personnel

883
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:29,270
running around trying to track down

884
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:32,240
people to create a council you know 70

885
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:33,049
plus systems you know we don't have to

886
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,479
do that anymore

887
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:37,609
if this happens in minutes think about

888
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,579
the productivity gain so we got in that

889
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:41,930
you know in a lot of ways you can start

890
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:44,690
doing that kind of thing

891
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:46,399
you know just you're taking all this

892
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:49,700
tedium out of it and you're saving

893
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,549
people money individual departments and

894
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,990
it ultimately the company then and go

895
00:44:52,549 --> 00:44:56,480
for it and that's what we've done we

896
00:44:53,990 --> 00:45:03,558
tried to capitalize on everywhere we're

897
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:06,410
running where we can do that and like I

898
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:09,090
said just ignore the vendor spin just

899
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:12,420
realize their solutions may not be your

900
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:15,300
I have a few culture things this

901
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:19,430
specifically is probably more security

902
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:24,750
related in general than zero trust

903
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:26,250
related but the adoption of new ideas it

904
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:32,460
does work a lot better when you have

905
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:34,380
end-user input at gitlab if you wanted

906
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:38,220
to know how we did a certain thing or

907
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:41,010
what our policies are you can you like

908
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:44,040
you people out there now can go to our

909
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:46,560
website and look it up the handbook for

910
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:50,070
the company is online and it is open to

911
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:53,070
the public we put almost every single

912
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:57,120
thing we have up and online and make a

913
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:59,280
public one is the kind of a part of that

914
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,049
whole open-source thing so you figure

915
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,760
others could probably benefit from this

916
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:07,860
and - it just it gives us a it kind of

917
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:12,030
helps hold we are kind of holding

918
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:14,790
ourselves accountable and so that's why

919
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:16,380
we do that and we go ahead like some of

920
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:21,029
the ideas we've had on some of these

921
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:23,550
things came from unbelievably simple

922
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:28,520
suggestions from regular employees

923
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:31,020
saying hey why can't you do this and

924
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:33,720
just like wow we never thought of that

925
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:36,390
and so I mean during your onboarding

926
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:39,209
process that get led you're supposed to

927
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:43,170
make at least one change to the manual

928
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:45,480
to improve it to the handbook that's and

929
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:46,890
the handbook is it that's this every

930
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,570
policy everything it's all written down

931
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,920
so you want to see a lot of our policies

932
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,590
you want to see what our infrastructure

933
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,670
looks like with the goofy map with all

934
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:59,900
the stuff you can look at it's all

935
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:02,400
online it's all just very open and so

936
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,590
we've consistently tried to go to the

937
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,040
users and try to see what's going to

938
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:10,680
make them up make them happy and see it

939
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:12,540
make their lives easier and if we can

940
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:16,109
come up with if there's a solution and

941
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:17,279
it's got two routes one it they're not

942
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:18,690
going to like it into the

943
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,550
are gonna like it we're gonna go with

944
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:23,370
the one that they're gonna like present

945
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:26,240
they'll use it and that's that's a

946
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:26,240
that's a big deal

947
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:34,640
we always tried to leave things better

948
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:39,870
for the users than when we started

949
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:43,319
that's just and this may sound really

950
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:45,890
stupid but back when I was a black hat

951
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:48,480
and I was breaking into computer systems

952
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:52,290
before I leave I typically would patch

953
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:55,380
the hole you know I try to clean up

954
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:57,509
after myself I didn't didn't leave a lot

955
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,430
of junk out there in the logs I I

956
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:00,990
cleaned all that up and I think I'm

957
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:03,390
gonna head patch the hole I mean just

958
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:05,509
you know just I left things a little bit

959
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:08,120
better than when I got there you know

960
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:13,650
you know I had ethics when I was

961
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:15,960
committing felonies so but nonetheless I

962
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:18,330
mean just doing that for the for the

963
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:22,980
people you that your work was is makes a

964
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:24,450
huge difference and we're boils down to

965
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:26,160
is if you've got something that's

966
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:28,290
extremely hard which is gonna be

967
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,170
extremely hard to implement or extremely

968
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:35,460
complex for people to understand and

969
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:38,390
don't do it it's as simple if it's

970
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:40,710
really that hard and complex don't do it

971
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:43,350
do something simple there's got to be a

972
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:45,030
simpler way to do things we've been

973
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:46,860
finding them I mean you just got look

974
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:48,990
that's the only thing you got to look as

975
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:52,290
that that's part of that whole research

976
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:54,479
thing in my job and so for applying that

977
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:56,700
to zero trust you know it should make

978
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,550
things easier and if it doesn't do that

979
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:02,939
