00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,528
gonna try to not move that ah

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,680
thanks to the Kentuckiana chapter the

11
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,690
Issa for a fantastic conference I

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,340
understand that all that is standing

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,149
between all of you and closing

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,390
ceremonies is this talk brevity is a

15
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,539
virtue it's not one of mine however so

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,160
I'll do the best I can

17
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:51,300
this is a I guess I should introduce

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,949
myself first

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,120
my name is Harlan countin for those of

20
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,059
you haven't had the pleasure of meeting

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,209
I can usually be found loitering around

22
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:05,039
the Issa chapter meetings on the first

23
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:07,619
Friday they feed me I show up I am a bit

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,200
of an oddball professionally I had a

25
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,229
really good thing going as a software

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,479
developer in this cyber security space I

27
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,470
worked in finance healthcare a little

28
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,590
bit of time with the Department of

29
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,298
Defense and I don't know why I decided

30
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,520
to screw that up and go to law school

31
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,630
it's so long ago it's blacked out of my

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,060
memory but I did so I thought that would

33
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,399
make me you know beloved among attorneys

34
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,369
and engineers it turns out I just no

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,710
longer fit in with either group but I am

36
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:42,960
an effective translator between the two

37
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:45,360
and so what this talk is about is taking

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,699
a look at the bigger picture of how

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,520
compliance works in an organization

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,740
versus cybersecurity some of this is

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,689
background material especially for you

42
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,179
compliance professionals in the room I

43
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,740
did this talk a few months ago for a

44
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,840
bunch of lawyers talking about

45
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,579
engineering and so now I'm trying to do

46
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,530
it the other way around so we'll see how

47
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,559
it goes

48
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,288
and right into it

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,390
so first thing is the old security

50
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,859
versus compliance debate everybody's

51
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,899
familiar with it right everybody

52
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,520
familiar with checkbox security where

53
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,319
your legal department sends you those

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,020
questionnaires or whatever it is your

55
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,519
organization does and it's like you have

56
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,110
to do these things and if you do these

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,010
things we're gonna tell everybody we're

58
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:31,260
secure and that's in no way true but

59
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:34,890
that's just how it was it still is today

60
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,489
but I'm gonna get into why it's not even

61
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,049
that simple anymore so if you came here

62
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:42,239
looking for a checklist of things I can

63
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,060
do to keep my organization out of legal

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,540
trouble and you may have come to the

65
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,600
wrong place

66
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:53,010
but again we'll see today we go back and

67
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,720
forth between security and compliance

68
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,220
departments they want us to do the

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,530
checkbox things that don't matter

70
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,819
we want to actually protect data so we

71
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,700
don't have a breach and don't have to

72
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:06,299
worry about it and nobody has figured

73
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,160
this puzzle out even Microsoft who love

74
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,230
them or hate them you'd have to agree

75
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,440
they've got their stuff together when it

76
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,480
comes to regulatory compliance had an

77
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,859
issue recently I don't want to breach my

78
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:23,488
NDA but some of you use Azure they do

79
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,380
these audit reports and I was reviewing

80
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,989
their audit report and they had a

81
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,299
security finding but when you go and you

82
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,850
read it they didn't actually have any

83
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,350
security issue it was a routine task

84
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,140
that they're supposed to be performing

85
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,329
and they did but somebody forgot to fill

86
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,208
out the appropriate form and put it in

87
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,070
the appropriate place and so the auditor

88
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,650
said oh you've got a security issue here

89
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,900
and so all over the country I'm sure for

90
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,220
the past three months

91
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,900
Microsoft sales department has had to be

92
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,160
having conference calls with legal

93
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,709
departments for their enterprise

94
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,510
customers because somebody didn't fill

95
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,400
out the right form even though they had

96
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:04,500
proof they had they had achieved the

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,970
control so that was hard enough in a

98
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,049
world where our companies were only

99
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:13,829
bound by one regulatory scheme or one

100
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:16,560
set of laws today it's a little

101
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:17,820
different and I use the term minefield

102
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,000
because I couldn't think of anything

103
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,340
else to call it but

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,430
I'll occasionally talk to somebody who

105
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,719
thinks that their organization is immune

106
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:32,790
from all of this data security stuff I

107
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,350
have yet to have such an encounter and

108
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,450
have it end where I'm convinced that

109
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,390
you're right you're not under any of

110
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,520
these regulatory frameworks I suppose if

111
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:45,360
you had a farm in Nebraska with no

112
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,520
internet access and no employees and no

113
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,250
health insurance benefits and no

114
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,109
customers maybe you wouldn't have to

115
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,530
worry about any of this for the rest of

116
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,390
us we do we've got the big ones and this

117
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,369
this slide is not comprehensive there

118
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,950
are so many things out there I just went

119
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,180
with the ones that that I've worked with

120
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,610
but we're all familiar with the big ones

121
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,570
right you've I work in health care at

122
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:13,020
the moment with HIPAA in the financial

123
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,820
world got sarbanes-oxley and of course

124
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,590
everybody's favorite subject the past

125
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:21,180
few years the European Data Protection

126
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:23,280
Act or regulation the GD P R and of

127
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,320
course there's always been the voluntary

128
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,890
I put those in quotes for a reason

129
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,180
voluntary frameworks right PCI DSS you

130
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,030
you don't have to deal with that if you

131
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,250
don't want to handle credit cards we're

132
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,070
still a cash society right

133
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,040
the AICPA has their standards if you

134
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:44,010
deal in finance or if you remember SAS

135
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,810
70 now the Sauk reports that's usually

136
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,820
required depending on your line of

137
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,710
business by your customers you know

138
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,860
there's FINRA high-trust is my new

139
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:56,479
favorite one because my main plan is

140
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:59,340
going down that road and then of course

141
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,950
not to be content to let the feds and

142
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,960
the Europeans steal all the fun various

143
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:07,680
state regulations have been emerging

144
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,090
over the past decade the first one I

145
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,690
encountered in my career was the

146
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:15,690
Massachusetts data privacy laws Ohio

147
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:21,270
came around in 2018 with the Ohio Data

148
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:23,460
Protection Act there's the New York data

149
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,760
wall which was interesting because it's

150
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,380
an incentive in the healthcare space and

151
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,650
in the news lately the California

152
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,479
consumer privacy acts which has passed

153
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,590
it's going to take effect on January 1st

154
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,479
and the entire

155
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,630
illegal community and the government of

156
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,370
California is still unsure exactly where

157
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,820
and how it's going to apply it's

158
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:48,090
interesting like that and as the old

159
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,980
adage goes as goes California so goes

160
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,859
the rest of the country when it comes to

161
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:56,570
regulatory regimes anyway and so there's

162
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,710
already a plethora of copycat CCPA

163
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:02,219
regulations popping up in state

164
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:04,979
legislatures all over the country and

165
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,590
not to be content to let the states have

166
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,360
all the fun the alphabet soup agencies

167
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,479
that we all know and love each want

168
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,850
their piece of the data security pie so

169
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,350
there's been a lot of big moves in the

170
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,910
past few years from the Federal Trade

171
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,560
Commission Securities and Exchange

172
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,920
Commission to have their own set of

173
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,580
criteria that you have to abide by and

174
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,020
of course the States Attorney General's

175
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,630
we'll talk a little bit briefly about

176
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,190
Equifax in a moment they've realized

177
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:36,390
there's money to be had from companies

178
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:39,060
who have data breaches and no talk about

179
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:43,310
lawyers and regulations would be

180
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:46,230
complete without plaintiffs lawyers

181
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,060
ambulance-chasing is tiring why not just

182
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:52,740
sit at home and wait on the the breach

183
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,600
databases that come to you so the

184
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,100
alphabet soup agencies the first one I

185
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,820
wanted to talk about was the Federal

186
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,860
Trade Commission FTC enforcement's

187
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,420
aren't new right the Federal Trade

188
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,240
Commission's always had this standard

189
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:09,000
against unfair deceptive trade practices

190
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,080
and that's any business in the United

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,730
States they've been charging businesses

192
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,919
with lack security practices who

193
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,590
experience breaches with unfair

194
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,290
deceptive acts and historically those

195
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,210
have always been settled we'll get the

196
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,680
settlements in a moment but basically

197
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,780
through a thing called consent decrees

198
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,220
where a company says I agree to admit

199
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,020
that I did wrong and you have the

200
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:36,000
authority to penalize me and here's some

201
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:39,900
money until the Wyndham Hotel chain came

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,669
under the ire of the FTC the FTC came in

203
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,500
and said hey Wyndham your data security

204
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,660
is terrible it's obvious that you just

205
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,250
don't care your customers data is

206
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,890
leaking

207
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,280
everywhere and we're going to find you

208
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,540
for unfair business practices but

209
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,730
Wyndham instead of rolling over like

210
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,410
everyone else prior to then had done

211
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,600
decided no we're gonna go to court

212
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:03,500
because FTC I don't think you have the

213
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,890
authority to even meddle in this long

214
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,300
story short Wyndham claimed that the

215
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,040
reason that they didn't have the

216
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,770
authority was because he never gave them

217
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:16,370
notice notice is an important legal buzz

218
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:18,620
phrase all go into more later as well of

219
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,510
what appropriate safeguards are like hey

220
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,760
there's no HIPPA there's no you know

221
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,530
matrix of controls for me to check off

222
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,240
and make sure that I've done what I'm

223
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:32,569
supposed to do and the court found that

224
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,610
those consent decrees are all public

225
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,610
they're on the FTC website and they

226
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:40,010
constitute sufficient notice and that

227
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,170
you as companies should read them and

228
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:45,350
make sure that you comply with them so

229
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:47,060
you don't have to pay the same fines the

230
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,650
main thing I want to highlight here and

231
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,670
my Bold print is much more start on my

232
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:55,400
high-definition screen than it is on the

233
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:58,280
projector but I've highlighted the

234
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,410
phrase reasonable here and you'll you'll

235
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:04,189
see this coming up over and over and

236
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:07,730
over again but I'll save that for now so

237
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:10,820
the question is if a federal agency can

238
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:14,180
penalize us for not abiding by standards

239
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:16,130
that they haven't listed anywhere just a

240
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,449
body of precedent saying these are

241
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,210
things other people have got in trouble

242
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,760
for so don't do those where does that

243
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:25,430
leave us and I pose this question to the

244
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,339
lawyers I was talking to nobody really

245
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,630
has an answer we're still waiting for

246
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:32,960
courts to churn out some more lawsuits

247
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:36,110
to answer that for us the Securities and

248
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,760
Exchange Commission is another favorite

249
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,820
of mine they've been bringing

250
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,360
enforcement actions under s regulation

251
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,950
SP for at least the past ten years

252
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,589
probably longer I haven't been an

253
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:51,380
attorney that long I was licensed in

254
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:55,400
2014 so anything before that is history

255
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:57,890
to me in 2016 there was a landmark

256
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,370
settlement against Morgan Stanley for a

257
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,170
million dollars

258
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,360
that was an issue where one of their

259
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,069
employees had been exfiltrating data and

260
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,589
that employee shouldn't have even had

261
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:10,500
access to the data it wasn't like they

262
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:12,270
used some crafty exploit kit they didn't

263
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,650
go to one of Jeremy Drew ins classes and

264
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,750
learn some cool trick and steal data

265
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,110
they just copied it from the share and

266
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,970
walked out with it

267
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:24,270
regulation SP requires that companies

268
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:27,360
have here's that word again reasonably

269
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:30,689
designed policies and procedures to

270
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,970
protect consumer information the SEC

271
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,100
continues to go down this road because

272
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,570
if you know much about government once

273
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,450
they've got a taste for money and that

274
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:42,000
they can get money out of us they just

275
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:45,720
keep going so they created a cyber unit

276
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,930
for enforcement in 2017 and I was just

277
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,279
reading about another one this morning

278
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,859
and then my old friends the plaintiffs

279
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:56,040
lawyers the ambulance chasers the ones

280
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,770
you see in the cartoons not to be left

281
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,449
out of the money pie that exists for

282
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:03,480
lawyers after a data breach

283
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:05,310
there were 23 private so these aren't

284
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,070
government entities these are like

285
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,750
consumers who banded together and start

286
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,360
to try to start class-action lawsuits

287
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,430
there were 23 of them filed in the week

288
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,410
that followed publication of the big

289
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:20,160
Equifax breach with which we're all

290
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:22,020
familiar there ended up being 50

291
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,050
something if I recall correctly by the

292
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,900
time all was said and done and better

293
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,160
than that

294
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,439
for the first time it may be the only

295
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,319
time this has ever happened all 50 state

296
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,690
attorneys general joined together in a

297
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,750
private class action lawsuit against

298
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:42,540
Equifax if you're not familiar with what

299
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,010
happened with Equifax everybody knows

300
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,829
about the basic control you have in

301
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:48,240
place about patching your software and

302
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,490
then they didn't do that for a couple

303
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,920
months there's a big Apache exploit and

304
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,839
that's how the whole thing happened so

305
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:59,760
it's always the simple failures that

306
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:01,200
make the big breaches now with this

307
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,660
patchwork of things that I just

308
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,370
described and that's not even that's not

309
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,339
even a tenth of it I could do an entire

310
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:11,700
hour long talk just on all of these

311
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,660
different frameworks and regimes but

312
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,660
what happens to us

313
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,160
because there's so many that we don't

314
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,640
have one set of standards to follow

315
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,230
anymore I one example I like to bring up

316
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,770
is if you are a health entity that does

317
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:27,090
business in Europe now you're kind of an

318
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:31,410
ADD and if you do damned if you don't

319
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:33,210
situation in some ways so if you're

320
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,829
familiar with the GDP are one of the

321
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,810
things it has the press likes to call

322
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,750
the right to be forgotten it's the right

323
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:42,410
of erasure it's that me as a consumer if

324
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:46,110
I were a European subject which I am NOT

325
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,969
have the rights to talk to any company

326
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,160
who is holding my data and tell them to

327
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:53,520
delete it and that would include health

328
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,469
care entities but in the United States

329
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,540
that patients don't have that kind of

330
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,280
right under HIPAA in fact it's exactly

331
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,680
the opposite

332
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,050
HIPAA while being about privacy is also

333
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,349
about complete records and the insurance

334
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:09,329
part the eye the eye is important

335
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:12,240
because you can't just call in and say

336
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:15,540
hey delete my records otherwise myself

337
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,360
as the chronic smoker obese guy who

338
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,069
never runs that I am would love to call

339
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,320
every health care provider I've ever had

340
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:25,230
and said hey delete my data and watch my

341
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,880
insurance rates go down meanwhile all of

342
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,520
you healthy folks get to make up the

343
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,230
difference in the United States that's

344
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,150
not allowed for a very good reason so

345
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,460
what do you do if you have a European

346
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:38,970
citizen who lives here and is treated

347
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:41,460
here what about data concerning

348
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:43,440
individuals who aren't the patient so

349
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,450
under HIPAA you can't even talk about

350
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,270
data to somebody who's not the patient

351
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:52,020
but patient records have things like

352
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:54,270
fraternity information bereavement

353
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,640
emergency contacts genetic information

354
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,900
anybody ever been to see their doctor

355
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,150
and you have to fill out that form about

356
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,209
the German or dad have heart problems or

357
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:04,800
diabetes or whatever that's private

358
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,870
information about your mom and dad they

359
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,719
don't have any say over that in your

360
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,280
medical record at your record these are

361
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,170
unanswered questions I'm just

362
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,750
illustrating the kind of crossfire that

363
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,310
we're caught in and then of course the

364
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,250
just the standards for enforcement are

365
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,989
different the gdpr has very rigorous

366
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,150
standards about you it's very

367
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,580
black-and-white you did it or you didn't

368
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,620
HIPAA has this more nuanced approach

369
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,570
it's okay if you screwed up as long as

370
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:34,529
nothing bad happened right no harm no

371
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:35,970
foul that's a terrible way of putting

372
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:39,510
that and don't ever tell anyone a lawyer

373
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:41,700
said that all right the Ohio Data

374
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,620
Protection Act is another example of

375
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,490
where these things are going in

376
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,320
different directions

377
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,959
Ohio decided to take a different

378
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,940
approach looked at the the United States

379
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,920
and said companies are getting beat down

380
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,680
all over the place because of data

381
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,689
security and data breaches maybe instead

382
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,540
of using the stick and beating them down

383
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:04,950
some more we as the state legislature

384
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:07,949
should take a encouraging approach so

385
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:11,850
what Ohio did was they created their

386
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:14,339
data security law and created the press

387
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,290
has called this a safe harbor provision

388
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,149
where if you get out of jail free card

389
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:22,260
if you've done these things then you

390
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:24,240
can't be sued in court what actually

391
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,490
they created is called an affirmative

392
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,440
defense which means it doesn't stop you

393
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:31,680
from being sued it's something that your

394
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,329
lawyers can raise in the lawsuits so if

395
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,099
you're worried about paying the expenses

396
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:36,810
of litigation Ohio doesn't help you

397
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,000
there nonetheless it's a nice thing to

398
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:42,449
have and all you have to do to qualify

399
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,820
for that is to substantially comply or

400
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,520
sorry reasonably back to that word

401
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,050
that's going to keep popping up

402
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,430
reasonably conform to one of a list of

403
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,459
frameworks and that lists the frameworks

404
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:56,729
includes nist and high trust and i think

405
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:59,520
c is there's a few of them and so if you

406
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,870
can show in a court of law

407
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,730
when you're being sued that you

408
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,800
reasonably conformed with one of those

409
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,410
frameworks then that's a defense to

410
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,909
someone's claim that you breach their

411
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:13,970
data meanwhile california headed exactly

412
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:17,429
in the opposite direction

413
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:20,850
California Privacy Act introduced for

414
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:24,000
the first time a defined private right

415
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:26,909
of action which means that you or I if

416
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,280
we lived in California have a right to

417
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,490
sue as individuals companies who lose

418
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,970
control of our data that's not actually

419
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:37,890
a remedy that's available to us in the

420
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,820
rest of the country or in California

421
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,770
until January 1st

422
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,450
and normally when we want to sue a

423
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,460
company we go into a big class-action

424
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:49,030
and we allege that they've harmed us in

425
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,910
some way or that they were engaging in

426
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,680
unfair practices California will be the

427
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,510
first place where you can say you all

428
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,060
control up my data that is my legal

429
00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:00,340
claim not some other thing and we'll get

430
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,530
into some of those other things but what

431
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:06,730
happens is anybody here do business just

432
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:09,399
in Kentucky or Indiana one state that's

433
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:12,280
really cool and you are so lucky for the

434
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,320
rest of us you know our companies are

435
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,720
growing we have customers all over the

436
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,240
country and it's very realistic that if

437
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,240
we experience a data breach that we're

438
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,730
gonna have customers in Ohio and

439
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,330
California our business might be in Ohio

440
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:30,000
or California and what happens when we

441
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:32,439
start getting sued

442
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,320
under that new right of action I just

443
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,390
talked about under the CCPA and we

444
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,350
raised the Ohio affirmative defense

445
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:43,900
because our business is in Ohio

446
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:46,000
what's court going to do with that again

447
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,940
we don't know until somebody gets sued

448
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:55,240
and we find out what happens all of that

449
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:57,730
is to try anyway to paint a picture of

450
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:01,270
this patchwork landscape the minefield

451
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:04,420
so I want to get more into the legal

452
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:08,050
side and talk about how does all this

453
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:10,090
work so all day at this conference we've

454
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,919
talked about preventing breaches

455
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:14,530
detecting breaches good security

456
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:18,040
practices etc so what I want to talk

457
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:20,590
about is what happens after the breach

458
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,030
that's something that we tend to not

459
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:25,540
think about too much as security

460
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:27,070
professionals but what happens after the

461
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,590
breach when you start getting into these

462
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,990
lawsuits in the court system that

463
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,149
circles back and that's what creates the

464
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,860
foundation for how we argue for the

465
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,530
controls we put in place and how we

466
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,120
justify spending money on them so if

467
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:42,190
you're struggling with your board of

468
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,629
directors or management or whoever it is

469
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,450
that signs the checks and your

470
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,920
organization especially if it involves

471
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,350
the legal department or your compliance

472
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,420
people this will be some valuable stuff

473
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,560
to know you can speak a little bit of

474
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,070
their language

475
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,149
bolster your case so to start with we

476
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,220
all know that data breaches are

477
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,950
expensive you've all seen charts like

478
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,810
this with the four million three point

479
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,810
nine two million dollars the average

480
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:09,850
cost of a data breach last year we all

481
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:12,850
know that the United States experiences

482
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,830
the highest burden of that cost and the

483
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:17,980
healthcare industry has finally

484
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:20,199
overtaken the financial industry as the

485
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,840
bearers of the largest cost of data

486
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,510
breaches everybody agree that it's

487
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,360
expensive when you have a data breach so

488
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:31,120
I don't really need to go on much about

489
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,689
that but where those costs come from

490
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,070
right so when I was working in security

491
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,990
security proper before I went to the

492
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,340
dark side I never really thought much

493
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,750
about this I just knew it was expensive

494
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,419
right you know if you have a breach it's

495
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,490
gonna cost this much money but but why

496
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,620
is there like a data breach theory that

497
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:49,750
walks into the CEOs office with with

498
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,939
their hand out and say give me four

499
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:55,810
million dollars it doesn't quite happen

500
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:58,000
that way there's there's a lot of costs

501
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,800
that come with a data breach right

502
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,370
you've got your classic loss of

503
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,450
reputation business opportunities

504
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:09,010
anybody signing up for a yahoo email

505
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:12,070
account lately your ability to contracts

506
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,300
so if you deal with sarbanes-oxley you

507
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,669
deal with anything under Homeland

508
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:18,639
Security if your customers require you

509
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:20,410
to have those sauk reports you

510
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,420
experience a data breach you may be

511
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:25,570
ineligible to keep doing business in

512
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:28,840
your sector insurance coverage is a cost

513
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:31,030
that seldom gets thought about but your

514
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,550
insurance company if your company has a

515
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:35,639
cyber insurance policy which it should

516
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:38,200
and if it doesn't maybe look in the one

517
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,570
in the fine print of that policy there's

518
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,640
a list of data security requirements for

519
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:44,679
your organization for this policy to pay

520
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,660
out and if you try to file a claim

521
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,090
they're going to come find out if you

522
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,800
complied with those terms because they

523
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,959
want to deny your claim that's what

524
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:56,290
insurance companies exist for is to not

525
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,030
pay you money you have your loss of

526
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:01,000
certification

527
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:03,430
there's breach of contract issues I know

528
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,170
with my company the contracts we have

529
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:08,680
with our customers have all kinds of

530
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:10,720
liquidated damages clauses etc

531
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,920
there's the classic fines injunctions

532
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,760
and sanctions that we're all familiar

533
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,200
with civil suit damages so those

534
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,290
plaintiffs lawyers the attorneys general

535
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,120
coming in with private lawsuits and then

536
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,770
you know I'm throwing costs the

537
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,229
notifications I work a lot with HIPAA

538
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:28,480
and that's by far the biggest cost when

539
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:31,810
there's a data mishap is you've got to

540
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,640
notify all these patients and then my

541
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:36,909
personal favorite is the attorneys fees

542
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,380
and litigation expenses the only person

543
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,420
who wins in a data breach is your

544
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:44,760
company's chief legal officer and

545
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:47,350
whoever they hire so that last one is

546
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:50,470
the thing that everybody's afraid of and

547
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:52,179
why you so rarely hear about the rest of

548
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,830
what I'm going to get into because

549
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,290
companies are driven as a settlement

550
00:22:53,830 --> 00:23:01,090
because they're scared of the cost of

551
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:03,550
litigation settlements are a shortcut

552
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:05,409
for I'm not going to assume that

553
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:08,260
everybody here is familiar with the way

554
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:11,350
that the lawsuits work but I sue you I

555
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,640
say you breached my data and you look at

556
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,649
your attorney and say how much is this

557
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,380
gonna cost to defend what are the odds

558
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,760
that I'm gonna win versus what am I

559
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,120
gonna lose what's it gonna cost but when

560
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,230
all of that goes into this actuarial

561
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,300
calculation to determine I'm willing to

562
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:28,990
settle I'll write a check for X dollars

563
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:31,659
and you go away and I'd say 99% of the

564
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,940
time that's that's how these things end

565
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:37,270
and a lot of it has to do with again the

566
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:40,210
fear of those costs but it's important

567
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,980
to put those aside and and let's just

568
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:45,400
keep stepping forward and what would

569
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:48,760
happen if you are sued so let's say that

570
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,040
your organization is sued under one of

571
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:55,510
those rights of action under the CCPA

572
00:23:51,040 --> 00:24:00,310
or the FTC comes after you and you fight

573
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:02,500
back like Windham did in the law we have

574
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:05,230
a phrase where we call we say a cause of

575
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,780
action sounds in some area of law

576
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:10,270
there's different areas of law

577
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:12,250
there's contract law there's property

578
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:15,490
law which I've kind of ignored for this

579
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:17,590
whole thing but you know if you violated

580
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:20,370
someone's patent or trespassed some

581
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,520
other way that would be a different area

582
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:25,120
there

583
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,650
the statutory items where a government

584
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,860
body comes after you and says you

585
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,300
violated the law in some way it's not

586
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,649
like a traffic ticket where they just

587
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,060
get to write you a citation right they

588
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,550
got to go to court they got to prove it

589
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,110
unless you settle with them

590
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:41,050
there's civil actions in state and

591
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,310
federal court and the one that I'm going

592
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,960
to spend the most amount of time on

593
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:46,960
because it's the one that happens the

594
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,120
most often in cyber security is torts

595
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,370
and if you've never heard that phrase

596
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,489
before think back to the ambulance

597
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:56,919
chasers a tort is an injury of some kind

598
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:59,080
so I was in a car accident and now I've

599
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,030
sustained these medical bills and my car

600
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,129
needs replacing and I'm out of work and

601
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,870
you as the person who calls that I'm

602
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,750
taking the court and you need to make me

603
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,649
whole or you know all of the claims

604
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,050
you've heard about infliction of

605
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:14,080
emotional distress the infamous

606
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:15,850
McDonald's coffee case which if you want

607
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,409
to know more about that that never

608
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,090
actually happened the way it was played

609
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:21,270
up in the media I'm happy to talk after

610
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:24,280
this it's one of my favorite subjects

611
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:28,690
but those those are all torts the

612
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:30,280
California right of action will also if

613
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,880
you were to sue somebody under it you

614
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:37,060
would be suing them in tort now your

615
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:40,960
organization's and my clients they don't

616
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,790
care what way the lawsuit sounds in I'm

617
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,160
bringing this up because it's important

618
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:49,629
for where we're going they just don't

619
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:52,570
want to be sued there's also the concept

620
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:55,210
of proof so what happens when somebody

621
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,460
Sue's you if you don't settle the first

622
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:59,350
thing your your staff or your legal

623
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,110
staff do is they file a motion to

624
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:04,330
dismiss they say hey Your Honor you know

625
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:06,659
even if you assumed everything that the

626
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,949
person filing this lawsuit said is true

627
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,360
it still doesn't meet the legal

628
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:13,720
requirements of proof and you should

629
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,790
dismiss the case if that fails the suit

630
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,340
goes on and you start going into what's

631
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:20,230
called discovery everybody's heard the

632
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,929
phrase ediscovery and why is it so

633
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:26,350
expensive that's the process by which

634
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:30,010
companies or just litigants in a lawsuit

635
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:32,709
get the right to inspect the records and

636
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:35,320
in personnel of whoever they're suing or

637
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,390
being sued by to collect evidence the

638
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,120
purpose of all of that evidence is so

639
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,820
that you can have proof in court

640
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,040
eventually these things go to a trial

641
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:47,710
presided over by a judge and you have to

642
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,810
put on proof you don't just get to say

643
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,730
hey this happened and everybody knows it

644
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:54,100
you you have to do this formal process

645
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,350
so back to Microsoft at the beginning

646
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,810
when the auditor cited them because they

647
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:00,459
were missing a form the form is the

648
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:03,280
proof so even though everybody knows

649
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:06,430
that they actually carried out that

650
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:09,760
control just fine they couldn't prove it

651
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:11,500
in the legal sense there are different

652
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,780
standards of proof this may be a review

653
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,400
back to high school civics but I never

654
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,020
learned this in high school in fact I

655
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,950
heard these phrases for the first time

656
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:21,550
as a law student

657
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:23,290
so prima facie evidence is what I just

658
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:26,320
talked about that hey there's enough

659
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:27,700
here to sustain a lawsuit that a judge

660
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,070
is going to let you go ahead and go to

661
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,840
trial if you don't have that like you've

662
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:34,149
just got no proof like hey I think they

663
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,040
lost my data and they're responsible but

664
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:38,440
that's it you're not going to get

665
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,870
anywhere preponderance of the evidence

666
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,940
this is the one that you're most likely

667
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:46,540
to deal with this is the standard of

668
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:48,970
proof in every civil action and it says

669
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,830
are you more likely than not to have

670
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:53,620
proven whatever it is you're trying to

671
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:56,500
prove I like to call it the 51%

672
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,459
threshold which is not to be confused

673
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,070
with the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt

674
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,020
standard that those of us who are law

675
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:04,300
and order junkies are familiar with

676
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:07,240
where if you can just create some level

677
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,649
of doubt your client gets a walk civil

678
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,150
suits don't work that way there might be

679
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,460
a lot of doubt that you're actually

680
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:15,850
responsible but there has to be at least

681
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:21,640
a majority and then there's the question

682
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:24,399
of who has to prove so almost all the

683
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,560
time technically it's the person who is

684
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,660
doing the suing who has the burden of

685
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,220
making their case so you as an

686
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,830
organization who experience of data

687
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,150
breach if you've ever lived through one

688
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,679
of these before the first thing that

689
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,780
your legal department does when they

690
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,940
show up is they tell everybody to shut

691
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,850
up turn their email off and don't say

692
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,200
anything to anybody and that's not just

693
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,000
because they're control freaks and

694
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,740
narcissists that we are but it's also

695
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,230
because you're

696
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:53,809
but he who's the one being sued doesn't

697
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:56,540
have the burden to prove anything and so

698
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:59,210
yeah the fifth amendment in criminal

699
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:01,520
trials is the same concept like don't

700
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,809
say anything let's see what they have

701
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,800
and go from there

702
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:08,629
but there's exceptions for instance the

703
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,990
Ohio Act that we talked about a little

704
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,820
bit ago if you were trying to raise that

705
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:16,160
affirmative defense saying hey I'm

706
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,200
immune from this lawsuit because I

707
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,300
complied with Ohio's requirements

708
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,880
well you as the defendant are the one

709
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,110
that have to prove that so you don't

710
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,070
just get to say that you've got to come

711
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:30,500
to court with your proof and if the

712
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:31,879
fact-finder which is another thing I'll

713
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,170
get to in a moment

714
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,570
believes you then then you're good to go

715
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:39,860
but let's be real this is where I take

716
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,050
off the lawyer hat and put on the

717
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,790
prognathous hat juries aren't composed

718
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:47,270
of attorneys juries are composed of

719
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:50,030
folks like me and you and the jury is

720
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:52,900
going to say but there was clearly a

721
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:56,270
data breach and it was clearly your data

722
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:58,400
so what are we doing here and so even

723
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:01,700
though legally speaking and procedurally

724
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,290
you don't have any burden of proof you

725
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,880
kind of do right you've got to convince

726
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:09,559
the jury that you weren't responsible

727
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,510
for this loss of data the fact-finder

728
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:13,070
would be the jury in most cases

729
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,170
sometimes it's just the judge their job

730
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:18,860
is anytime the person who's suing you

731
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:21,350
and you say I disagree that this is the

732
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:25,309
facts well that's those are what juries

733
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:26,928
decide there's a popular perception that

734
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:29,750
juries just kind of sit down and say

735
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:31,190
guilty or not guilty and move on but

736
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,440
that's not actually what lawyers are

737
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:35,360
asking the jury to do they're asking

738
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,610
them to each one of these things that

739
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,909
are in dispute which side do you think

740
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:42,439
is telling the truth and then the the

741
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:44,450
some of that you know at the end the

742
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,100
math answers the question of guilty or

743
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:50,300
not guilty because that's already

744
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:52,280
established in the law every case has

745
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,720
required elements that must be proven

746
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,889
right you don't just walk into court and

747
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,690
say you know you had crappy security and

748
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,010
you breached my data and here's my

749
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,290
wealth of evidence that you're

750
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:05,240
security was terrible I win there's

751
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:06,710
actually a set of legal elements for

752
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,630
every claim and they're different for

753
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:12,050
every claim depending on what your suing

754
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:14,390
under that determine whether you're

755
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:16,909
going to be successful in the end we're

756
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,890
gonna focus on torts again because we

757
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,870
don't have six hours for me to go on

758
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:23,540
about this and this is the most common

759
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:25,370
one so in it sorts as every first-year

760
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,930
law student has beaten into their head

761
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:29,570
until they're saying it in their sleep

762
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:32,990
you have duty breach causation and

763
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:34,970
damages these are four pieces that you

764
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:37,760
have to prove to a court before you can

765
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:40,280
get money out of somebody for an injury

766
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,160
so in that California cause of action

767
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,990
somebody loses control of your data you

768
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,730
have to go and establish each one of

769
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:50,810
these elements to the court so question

770
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:53,180
one is let me think of which perspective

771
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:54,980
I want to look at this front we'll go

772
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,530
from the plaintiffs perspective the

773
00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:00,440
person doing the suing so you have to

774
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:03,560
prove that the person you're suing owed

775
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,860
you some duty right generally speaking

776
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,510
you and I don't owe each other anything

777
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:12,709
other than you know respect and civility

778
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:15,140
but everybody owes under the law a

779
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:19,880
standard of care that's just you know

780
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:21,980
normal decency after you prove that the

781
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,840
person you're suing owed you some duty

782
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:28,490
you then have to prove that they

783
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,990
breached that duty so not only that but

784
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,420
you then have to prove that whatever

785
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,580
harm you suffered was because they

786
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,620
breached their duty right you can't say

787
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:40,159
that you weren't rotating your passwords

788
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:42,800
as often as this says and also my data

789
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,940
is out here on the dark web so you're

790
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,649
responsible doesn't work that way you

791
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,480
got to show that one thing calls the

792
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,760
other you have to prove that in a court

793
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,050
and then finally and this one's always

794
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,180
the fun one this is the one that gets

795
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:55,940
all the media headlines is you have to

796
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,830
prove what damages you suffered so you

797
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,350
can't just say you owe me ten million

798
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:02,149
dollars you have to put on evidence of

799
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:05,870
why you sustained 10 million dollars

800
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:07,550
worth of harm unless there's a statute

801
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:10,290
that says you're entitled to that but

802
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:15,620
again brevity

803
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:20,550
so when we're talking about a breach and

804
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:23,550
a duty generally speaking these are all

805
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:26,490
going to revolve around the standard of

806
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:28,680
reasonable care but I remember seeing

807
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:31,260
reasonable on a whole bunch of slides

808
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:34,410
before now reasonable is a term of art

809
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,240
amongst attorneys some of us love it

810
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:39,050
some of us hate it but it is what it is

811
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,480
and the reason it's so prevalent is

812
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:44,669
because it isn't very well defined and

813
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,400
so what you have to do is you have to go

814
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:49,200
to previous court cases see how they

815
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,540
were resolved and how your case is

816
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,420
similar and that's how we build up the

817
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:56,040
standard of what is reasonable

818
00:33:53,420 --> 00:34:00,990
technically speaking reasonable is what

819
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:04,200
would an ordinary person or be expected

820
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:07,110
to do so it's not what would an IT whiz

821
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,970
be expected to do or what would you know

822
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:10,290
your company whose really awful at

823
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:12,569
security and doesn't care about it be

824
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:17,219
expected to do so what would an ordinary

825
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:20,850
person do so ordinary in our

826
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:22,799
cybersecurity world means industry

827
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,389
standards right those those basic core

828
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,450
controls that every one of those

829
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:30,990
frameworks I talked about has NIST CIS

830
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:33,449
sans any of these security exams or

831
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:35,759
certifications that they're all getting

832
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:38,129
to these same fundamental practices that

833
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,690
your organization needs to have those

834
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:44,639
are what's reasonable because they are

835
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:48,270
the industry standard so you have to

836
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:52,050
prove reasonableness to the jury because

837
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:53,879
again and there aren't any lawyers in

838
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,230
the room are there No okay I would get

839
00:34:53,879 --> 00:35:00,509
in a lot of trouble for this really bad

840
00:34:55,230 --> 00:35:02,820
joke but I almost put peers in quotes up

841
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,380
here a jury of our peers the jury is not

842
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,450
composed of people who do what we do

843
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:09,750
right your jury is going to be composed

844
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:12,509
of folks who couldn't find an excuse to

845
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:14,610
get out of jury duty in most cases so

846
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,770
they they don't know anything about

847
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:18,690
there might be the one guy that does

848
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:20,910
right he's an IT guy or an engineer but

849
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,780
generally the jury is completely

850
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,930
ignorant of

851
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:28,440
what we do in this field so you have to

852
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:31,230
educate the jury at the trial about what

853
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,930
is reasonable how are you going to do

854
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:36,960
that when you do with evidence in this

855
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,759
case expert witnesses are how I would do

856
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,920
that so what you're going to do is

857
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,360
you're going to bring in some CISSP you

858
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,460
found who's willing to take your money

859
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,920
and sit on the bench or in the witness

860
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,510
box for a while and you're gonna brag

861
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,310
about his credentials and they're gonna

862
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,230
sound real flashy to convince the jury

863
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:54,000
that this guy's an expert and we should

864
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:55,950
listen to what he says and then you're

865
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,470
gonna ask that expert what is the

866
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:00,509
industry standard in this area and what

867
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,939
is anybody who would be qualified as an

868
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:05,450
expert in cybersecurity almost anybody

869
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,500
going to say right it's those core

870
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:12,120
fundamental controls you have under

871
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:15,840
nests and CIS whatever what you don't

872
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:17,549
want is to be in the courtroom and have

873
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,190
some expert witness who's very

874
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:22,110
well-qualified say whatever the industry

875
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,970
standard is and it's completely not what

876
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:26,190
you were doing that's that's going to

877
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,689
end poorly that's when your lawyer calls

878
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:31,830
up the plaintiff and says hey let's read

879
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:33,990
talk about that settlement so moral of

880
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:37,140
my story today when we talk about

881
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:40,709
navigating the minefield the best thing

882
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:43,529
you can do is don't be different I know

883
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:45,060
that we're all eccentric people for some

884
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,880
reason our field just draws a very

885
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,200
diverse crowd of people we're all

886
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,240
individualistic but we shouldn't be

887
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,100
professionally right listen to your

888
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,069
security professionals and those basic

889
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,589
things if you perfect those critical

890
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:00,240
security controls whatever framework you

891
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:03,420
want to go with those foundational

892
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,069
practices there is not going to be an

893
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,900
expert witness who's going to be able to

894
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:08,790
say under oath unless he's being paid a

895
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,040
lot of money and doesn't care about his

896
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:13,170
credentials that you were being

897
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,680
unreasonable or that you weren't acting

898
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:19,530
in accordance with the industry standard

899
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:22,440
and when I say don't be different one of

900
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:24,900
my favorite examples of this is you all

901
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,080
know that NIST recently updated their

902
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,760
guidance on password policies finally

903
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,490
made official what most of us have known

904
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,180
for a very long time that the standard

905
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:37,979
practice and password policies

906
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,749
is that best neutral and not helping

907
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:43,170
anything some people would argue that

908
00:37:39,749 --> 00:37:44,700
it's more harmful and these talks been

909
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,559
going on for a long time a lot of really

910
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,808
brilliant people were making compelling

911
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:51,420
mathematical cases for hey we should

912
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:54,509
really be doing passwords this way they

913
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:56,160
might be right but if their company did

914
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:57,839
that before NIST you know made it an

915
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,910
industry standard and then they're in

916
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,009
the courtroom and the jury who doesn't

917
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,960
understand any of this is having you

918
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:06,809
know a tech expert witness tell them

919
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,640
this is how everyone does it and they're

920
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:11,220
doing something different even if the

921
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,859
different thing was maybe better well

922
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,859
it's probably still not going to go well

923
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:21,779
I'm going to follow more on that for a

924
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:24,720
moment that's not always true but use

925
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:26,400
this what we've talked about you some of

926
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,919
these buzzwords right reasonable in

927
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,549
particular your legal department will

928
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,549
love you for that

929
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:36,150
your compliance folks will probably have

930
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:38,099
a hard time arguing too if you're

931
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,440
struggling to get budget for one of

932
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:43,109
those core fundamental controls that you

933
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,640
need one of the better arguments you can

934
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:46,259
have especially if you're arguing with

935
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,720
compliance or legal who want you to go

936
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:51,239
do this checkbox thing over here to

937
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,279
comply specifically with gdpr or

938
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:56,609
something and you don't have these

939
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:58,170
fundamental controls in place you can

940
00:38:56,609 --> 00:39:00,569
make a very compelling case that this is

941
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:02,009
more important because if something bad

942
00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:04,049
happens under that they're not going to

943
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:06,410
focus on which box you didn't check

944
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:08,849
under the minutiae of the rule a

945
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,379
plaintiff's lawyer is going to zero in

946
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:12,660
on those core practices because they're

947
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,059
easy to go after it's easy to find an

948
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:18,960
expert to testify about what is

949
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:21,029
reasonable security practices so like

950
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,549
the minefield when you navigate a

951
00:39:21,029 --> 00:39:25,769
minefield I know we've got some military

952
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:28,109
folks here so your your gonna know how

953
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:29,910
this works you don't just go and clear

954
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:31,140
every mine out of it nobody's got time

955
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:33,808
for that you're trying to get to the

956
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:36,029
other side so you clear a safe path this

957
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:37,890
is the path you go along so what I'm

958
00:39:36,029 --> 00:39:39,480
talking about today is doing that right

959
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:41,549
you're not going to check every single

960
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,190
box of all of that plethora of

961
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:46,349
regulatory legal frameworks what you're

962
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:48,580
going to do is clear yourself a straight

963
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:51,440
and clear path to the other side

964
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:53,210
may you suffer some financial penalty

965
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,800
maybe lose some smaller part of a

966
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:58,190
lawsuit because you didn't check the

967
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:01,130
right box under the CCPA that's not

968
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:02,630
related to those core controls yeah it

969
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,730
could happen is it gonna be anywhere

970
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:06,440
near the magnitude of the expense you're

971
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:09,020
going to suffer if you experience a data

972
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,460
breach and somebody can prove that you

973
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:13,580
didn't have those core security

974
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:18,710
practices in place no it's it pales in

975
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:20,509
comparison so we'll focus on straight

976
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:22,460
and narrow those core controls and then

977
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,960
let your legal department and your

978
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,400
compliance folks worry about all the

979
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,190
minutiae we as security professionals

980
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,710
can go back to the way we were in 2005

981
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:32,570
and not not actually care yeah yeah here

982
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,890
we'll check the box leave us alone we've

983
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:37,040
got this core stuff which is what

984
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:39,170
matters I didn't want to highlight some

985
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,930
exceptions because technology is a

986
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:43,970
constantly evolving art one of my

987
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:46,299
favorite cases from way back in law

988
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:48,859
school that's always stuck with me is

989
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,990
this thing about reasonable care I just

990
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,660
told you that reasonable care is what

991
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:57,200
everybody else is doing right follow the

992
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:59,060
industry standard except when some new

993
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,350
emerging technology pops up that's

994
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,150
readily available makes things better

995
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:05,390
but nobody's using it you should

996
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:07,940
probably still use it so TJ Hooper

997
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:11,000
versus northern barge Corp was a 1932

998
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,260
case it's very famous among among law

999
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,630
students because they all have to

1000
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,040
memorize it basically what happened

1001
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,840
where there were some tugboats there was

1002
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,370
a storm that came through some some

1003
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,680
stuff was lost and they were getting

1004
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:23,720
sued saying you should have known the

1005
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,970
storm was coming it was broadcast on

1006
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,500
every weather radio out there sug

1007
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:29,629
Boehner said we don't have weather

1008
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:33,350
radios nobody has those that's not a

1009
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:34,670
thing we do and they were right and so

1010
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:37,040
they offered evidence in court to show

1011
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,810
that there's like one tugboat in the

1012
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,350
country that keeps a weather radio on

1013
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:44,210
board but the court said you know what

1014
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:45,589
that's not good enough and I've got this

1015
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,030
quote up here if you're interested in

1016
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,700
reading it I'm not going to read it to

1017
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:52,370
you but basically what the court said is

1018
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:54,620
the industry standard is not the only

1019
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:56,900
thing that defines reasonable right an

1020
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:59,810
entire industry can be unreasonable if

1021
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,999
you operate a tugboat moving large loads

1022
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:04,219
down waterways and there's the

1023
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:06,078
now cheap enough not as cheap as they

1024
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:08,029
are today but still cheap relatively

1025
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,759
device that you can receive weather

1026
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:12,439
alerts and make everybody safer you are

1027
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:17,209
breaching the standard of an ordinary

1028
00:42:12,439 --> 00:42:20,029
person by not doing that even if nobody

1029
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:23,868
else is you should still be doing it so

1030
00:42:20,029 --> 00:42:25,969
as new threats emerge in our world right

1031
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:30,349
so speculative threats with a big hot

1032
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:32,059
topic last year if you run a data center

1033
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:34,249
and you're doing you know co-hosting of

1034
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:36,409
a bunch of clients maybe nobody out

1035
00:42:34,249 --> 00:42:38,419
there is doing mitigation for for those

1036
00:42:36,409 --> 00:42:40,279
kind of threats that's not going to be a

1037
00:42:38,419 --> 00:42:42,739
defense if you end up getting sued under

1038
00:42:40,279 --> 00:42:43,999
that it's very likely that plaintiffs

1039
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:46,669
lawyers are gonna go back to the sub

1040
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:48,888
boat case and say wait wait wait this is

1041
00:42:46,669 --> 00:42:53,058
readily available you knew about it you

1042
00:42:48,889 --> 00:42:55,639
should have been doing it and of course

1043
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:58,539
let's go to the other side and say that

1044
00:42:55,639 --> 00:43:01,339
you don't have an expectation to

1045
00:42:58,539 --> 00:43:03,439
absolutely protect data and this is the

1046
00:43:01,339 --> 00:43:04,999
part where everyone nodding off come

1047
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:07,249
back with me

1048
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:09,198
judge learn at hand if you've never

1049
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:10,549
heard of him brilliant legal philosopher

1050
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,559
don't know why I was never on the

1051
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:14,269
Supreme Court if you're interested in

1052
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:17,839
such things he's a fascinating guy to

1053
00:43:14,269 --> 00:43:19,819
read but he authored the opinion in a

1054
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:22,249
case called United States versus Carroll

1055
00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:23,929
towing back in 1947 this is another one

1056
00:43:22,249 --> 00:43:25,609
of those cases every law student gets

1057
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:29,329
beat over the head with their first year

1058
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:31,759
and what this was was a case again with

1059
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:34,399
tugboats somehow tug boats set the basis

1060
00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:38,389
that we use in cybersecurity today it's

1061
00:43:34,399 --> 00:43:40,368
weird in this case there were some

1062
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:42,889
tugboats that were left unmanned during

1063
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:44,719
the day and some stuff happened long

1064
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:46,069
story short the boats got loose nobody

1065
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:47,599
was on them they're bouncing around the

1066
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:49,939
harbor bumping into stuff causing all

1067
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:55,129
kinds of damage so the lawsuit followed

1068
00:43:49,939 --> 00:43:57,109
and there was this argument from the

1069
00:43:55,129 --> 00:44:00,319
tugboat owners that look it's

1070
00:43:57,109 --> 00:44:02,179
unrealistic for us to keep the boat man

1071
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,949
during the day when nobody's doing and

1072
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:04,569
nobody else does this it costs too much

1073
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:07,459
money

1074
00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:09,199
judge learned at him agreed with them to

1075
00:44:07,459 --> 00:44:11,448
it to a point he said you're right you

1076
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:14,479
don't have a duty to go above and beyond

1077
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:14,870
what is reasonable now he also found

1078
00:44:14,479 --> 00:44:16,640
that

1079
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,290
tugboat owners didn't meet that burden

1080
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,680
and they had to pay for all that lost

1081
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:24,380
grain but he in the process laid down a

1082
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,690
formula which is still used in every

1083
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,400
tort action today that that involves

1084
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:31,220
this kind of question he created a

1085
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:35,090
formula of burden so the burden you bear

1086
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:38,089
as a business is equal to the cost of

1087
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:41,930
injury multiplied by the probability of

1088
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:44,810
that injury happening NEC is ESPYs in

1089
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:47,240
here yeah there's a bunch you know on

1090
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:50,060
the exam that formula risk equals impact

1091
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:52,339
times likelihood judge learned at hands

1092
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:54,350
where that all came from their teaching

1093
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:57,310
certified professionals to approach

1094
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:59,720
business this way so if you have

1095
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:01,160
something that's likely if it happens

1096
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,620
the cost your organization a million

1097
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:06,430
dollars there's a 10% chance of it

1098
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:11,150
happening in any given year then that's

1099
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:13,160
$100,000 risk per year and so any

1100
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:14,750
mitigation for that risk that costs more

1101
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:17,509
than a hundred thousand dollars is

1102
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:19,760
beyond your organization's standard of

1103
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:22,670
care right that's unreasonable legally

1104
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,410
and so one of the other defenses you can

1105
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:26,840
raise if you find yourself in the

1106
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:29,649
courtroom is what the plaintiff saying

1107
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,650
that I should have been doing

1108
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:46,809
I'm realistic I couldn't I couldn't stay

1109
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:48,309
in business if I did that and you'll

1110
00:45:46,809 --> 00:45:50,829
note in the press when these data

1111
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:52,479
breaches happen and you've heard that

1112
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:54,849
before right in the press conferences

1113
00:45:52,479 --> 00:45:56,649
from the from the spokes pieces from the

1114
00:45:54,849 --> 00:45:58,029
entities that get breached like look

1115
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,109
doing this thing you're all saying we

1116
00:45:58,029 --> 00:46:01,239
should have done would have put us out

1117
00:45:59,109 --> 00:46:03,009
of business well they're there they're

1118
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:04,599
doing those talking points for a reason

1119
00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:09,400
this is setting up the defense for the

1120
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:11,109
lawsuit later so circle it all back

1121
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,029
those foundational controls all right I

1122
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:15,459
got this the Center for internet

1123
00:46:13,029 --> 00:46:18,039
security stuff up here you've all seen

1124
00:46:15,459 --> 00:46:19,959
this right tracking your inventory and

1125
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:22,059
assets administrative privileges

1126
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:24,819
vulnerability management pen testing all

1127
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:26,920
of this these foundational principles

1128
00:46:24,819 --> 00:46:29,558
you'll also see it in the NIST

1129
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:32,410
cybersecurity framework looks very

1130
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:35,880
similar right at any framework you look

1131
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:38,680
at it's gonna follow along these lines

1132
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,140
it seems like we are approaching the end

1133
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,719
of our time because Mickey told me I got

1134
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,449
a lot of time for closing ceremonies so

1135
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:48,819
allow me to finally add a disclaimer

1136
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:51,969
because lawyers and we have to do these

1137
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:54,519
things I am an attorney I am NOT your

1138
00:46:51,969 --> 00:46:56,079
nor your businesses attorney everything

1139
00:46:54,519 --> 00:47:00,569
I said here today does not constitute

1140
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:02,949
legal advice because as you've seen

1141
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:05,380
legal questions revolve around very

1142
00:47:02,949 --> 00:47:07,179
fact-specific situations your business

1143
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,099
is in a unique spot from everyone else's

1144
00:47:07,179 --> 00:47:12,099
so some of the things I said may not

1145
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:14,619
apply to you that being said I've told

1146
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:16,660
you nothing today that I have not and

1147
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:18,609
would not tell my clients when they come

1148
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,890
to me asking hey what should I do

1149
00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:23,229
I've given you the same speech roughly

1150
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:25,629
that I would give them the fact that

1151
00:47:23,229 --> 00:47:28,269
they pay me may bear some judgment on

1152
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:32,309
their part but there we are

1153
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:32,308
so thanks again to the
