1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:10,980
all right good afternoon everybody I'm

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,250
Dan Helton and uh figure today talk

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,859
about me frames I apologize for the bit

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,930
of a color problem here on the display

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,240
if you're watching this on youtube or

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,119
archive.org later then you probably not

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,229
have this problem but hopefully

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,869
shouldn't in fact the presentation too

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,140
much a little bit about myself I'm a

10
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:34,230
senior security consultant at NCC group

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,000
I must lead ooh Web Apps never

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,569
pentesting red teaming in my day job I'm

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,730
a bit of a nerd for odd esoteric

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,750
computers like history and things like

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,589
that you kept on Twitter at ch1 k pw e

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,199
or s also the comm is also my website

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,219
this presentation is on here I promise

18
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,199
this last time I gave this presentation

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,059
that I'll eventually write a lot of this

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,460
stuff up in blog post form still working

21
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,589
yeah but hopefully I'll codified a

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,589
little bit so being a better online

23
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,540
reference I got a lot materially go

24
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:11,548
through so apologize I'm a little fast

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,840
it's just it's a big brain it's

26
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,880
something that most people probably not

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,320
have much of a background in so first

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,759
off what is a mainframe it's it's

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,439
helpful to you actually define what that

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,790
is so it's almost always IBM Z Hardware

31
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,350
it's not just any old clunky old

32
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,729
dinosaur computer that's one thing to

33
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,369
get out your head it's a very specific

34
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,020
class of community there are still a few

35
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,329
competitors at unisza since my view on

36
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,640
that space but IBM Africa dominates

37
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,949
nowadays so it almost always means IBM

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,390
see hardware and almost always means cos

39
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,790
there are a couple other operating

40
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,590
systems that IBM supports proof for

41
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,380
those z/architecture I'm not going to go

42
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,420
into those I'll just stick to cos some

43
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,490
of the defining characteristics of a

44
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,189
mainframe are that it handles enormous

45
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,798
volumes of input numbers so these things

46
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,750
are made to tear prove millions billions

47
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,969
trillions of transactions that's why

48
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,100
they're the backbone of banking if you

49
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,289
used a credit card or ATM today you use

50
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,520
the mainframe indirectly because your

51
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,680
transactions are all being processed

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,000
through there another key of the

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,649
mainframe is that they're built for rats

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,840
reliability availability and

55
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,610
serviceability so these things are built

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,910
like public utilities almost like they

57
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,860
are meant to stay up 24/7 you know

58
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,640
99.99% uptime

59
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,700
it's very important to the mainframe

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,010
business they're built for pretty crazy

61
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,500
backwards compatibility

62
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,629
they are heavily batch oriented so the

63
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,690
idea is you build these complex batch

64
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:35,069
jobs JCL job control language is like

65
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,349
one of the big scripting languages in

66
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,470
mainframe world you build these big

67
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:42,899
complex jobs - like I said to take in a

68
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,640
million credit card transactions from a

69
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,750
day and then go process them and spit

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,700
them out the other end some kind of

71
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,200
format and to do it all in a very

72
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,089
complex way that he does all sorts of

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,950
variables and all sorts of contingencies

74
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,950
without a human having to jump on and

75
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,899
like interact with it they are always

76
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,549
mission critical business systems that's

77
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,319
why companies still paid millions of

78
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,629
dollars IBM every year to maintain these

79
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,518
things they're always at the heart of

80
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:07,079
the business and one quick note is I

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,709
know some people here probably came

82
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,260
thinking about es 401 that they have not

83
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:18,150
been called as/400 since the crew of

84
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,370
mash was making commercials on YouTube

85
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,019
the proper name is the IBM I platform

86
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,670
it's not actually a mainframe it's

87
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,860
what's called a mid-range computer it's

88
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,238
come connects tear down I've hacked on

89
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,670
them there's a lot of good stuff out

90
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,379
there some good tools for them but

91
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,230
they're not really desert mainframes and

92
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:35,310
they're not in the scope of this so the

93
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,829
biggest thing you hear when you tell

94
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,930
people about packing mainframes is make

95
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,700
your friends your legacy right oh you

96
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,390
know why do I worry about mainframes we

97
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,670
retired next year right the thing is is

98
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,708
like in the 90s the mainframes really

99
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,170
got hit hard in the market when like

100
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:54,030
cheap Windows and UNIX and Linux servers

101
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,069
were you know starting to beat their

102
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,090
market share so in the 90s a lot of

103
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,879
people thought maybe brings we're going

104
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:03,629
to die but ecommerce saved them and they

105
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:05,040
are still with us today seriously

106
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:06,359
IBM still makes like a couple billion

107
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,370
dollars off these things every year

108
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,760
they're not going anywhere they're still

109
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,170
big in Finance air travel insurance

110
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,959
government they're still actively

111
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,399
supported actively maintained they can

112
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,639
even run modern stuff they can run SQL

113
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,688
that could run

114
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,270
applications they can do Java stuff like

115
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:26,979
yeah you also still see stuff like batch

116
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,998
jobs that were written in the 1960s

117
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:30,520
because that's part of that backwards

118
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:33,759
compatibility to stuff you wrote like in

119
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,799
I am system/360 assembler in like 1968

120
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,629
should still be able to run on bottom

121
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,349
mainframe with little or even no

122
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:43,479
modification and they're also pushing in

123
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:45,370
other places they've tried to push CEOs

124
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:50,199
hard for like cloud computing for

125
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:52,330
blockchain all the trendy stuff I see us

126
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,800
it can be very conservative in a design

127
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,500
and style which I think you'll see when

128
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,759
we do some of the demo videos and it

129
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,439
does have insane good backwards

130
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,120
compatibility but don't confuse that for

131
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,659
legacy because this isn't actively

132
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,949
updated in detail so when you think of a

133
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:07,779
mainframe this is probably what you

134
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:11,979
think of right like real real tape like

135
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:13,569
like something on my like shirt here you

136
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,529
know then that's a--that's a 1960s main

137
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:18,520
premise of system/360 one of the first

138
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:20,879
this is actually a picture of my

139
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,930
great-aunt believe it was with the

140
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,669
seizures that Arizona Highway Patrol

141
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,460
then and they actually had a small Maine

142
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:30,698
baby just all but this is what they look

143
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,729
like nowadays you see here they look

144
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:35,529
like a giant gaining here comes across a

145
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:36,938
lot like down like the angles and blue

146
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:40,569
lights and stuff seriously looks like a

147
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:42,219
giant BGC and these things are like

148
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:43,449
monstrous like you buy one of these

149
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:44,469
things are good so you see it's not the

150
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:48,250
size and maybe like a cafeteria

151
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:51,069
refrigerator and some of the specs I

152
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,580
have written down here are kind of nuts

153
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:56,560
like you can have about I think up to

154
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,639
170 different types of processors in it

155
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,800
and that's everything from long

156
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,219
general-purpose processors to special

157
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,919
processors to just do job over just do

158
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:08,349
Linux on z/os or just do crypto and I

159
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,448
mean my main CP over CPU on all these

160
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:13,330
things is like a 10-4 five point two

161
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:14,710
gigahertz monster I mean that's just one

162
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,830
you can have hundreds of these on one

163
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,719
thing the low end of memory is like 320

164
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,628
gig and all the way up to thirty two

165
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:24,370
terabytes I think of deep and then you

166
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:26,030
know storage it's sky's the limit as far

167
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,520
as like sans everything else

168
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,640
connected up to so these are monsters

169
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,409
computers now I want to tell you a

170
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,050
little bit about how to speak mainframe

171
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,000
room because it is a very different

172
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,220
culture and a very different type of

173
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,920
lingo than what Windows and Linux admins

174
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,710
are probably used to so first off is

175
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,410
mainframes don't speak ASCII their text

176
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,539
encoding is an in-house IBM format

177
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,040
called episodic which I can reverse Oh

178
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,310
extended binary coded decimal

179
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,960
interchange code if you're curious so

180
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,460
that's one thing ELLs leave you're like

181
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,020
poking around network Wireshark you

182
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,820
might see funky stuff coming over and

183
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,260
you have to go tell Wireshark OD code

184
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,060
that is episodic instead of ASCII and

185
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,930
also have some text don't make sense

186
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,669
which I did that before and I've had to

187
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,669
pen test some neighboring applications

188
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:16,310
that I would actually like god-shaped in

189
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:17,990
Logan and catching the traffic from and

190
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,180
another one you'll hear a lot Mira where

191
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,850
Carmen says el pars logical partitions

192
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,919
so what this is this is multiple OS

193
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,560
instances all running simultaneously on

194
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,450
one mainframe Phil young who's like one

195
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,640
of these big guys in like matrix tree

196
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,190
research he compares them kind of VMs

197
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,960
but it's not really true because these

198
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,460
things are running on the disk it's like

199
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,750
you know how you can dual boot your

200
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,729
computer to have like Windows and Linux

201
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,780
on one hard drive well imagine if you

202
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:43,669
could just run them both simultaneously

203
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,710
because you just had that much RAM

204
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:47,810
processing power inputs and everything

205
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,299
so mainframe for we running multiple

206
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,530
operating systems simultaneously and in

207
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,540
lots of different combinations they

208
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,909
could have z/os on several partitions

209
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,550
they could have other outer systems like

210
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,450
CBM or Linux on z/os running on others

211
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,000
and all kinds of different

212
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:04,430
configurations a sysplex

213
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,530
is a cluster of L VARs they might all be

214
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,180
on one mainframe or they might be spread

215
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,950
out over several mainframes connected

216
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,780
over fiber-optic but that's an era when

217
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,430
you hear about sysplex isms parallel

218
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,090
sysplex is that's Alan Menken

219
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,919
parlance a system program or a cyst prog

220
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,060
that's the mainframe world equivalent of

221
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,190
a sysadmin

222
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,140
so that's like the guy you know who has

223
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,669
as you'll see the equivalent of root

224
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,229
access to the mainframe world and he's

225
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:29,030
in charge of everything

226
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:31,280
IPL initial programming load that was

227
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,978
just the phrase they used for booting

228
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,838
the mini frame up and then when it comes

229
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,729
to storage and mainframe world storage

230
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,510
coming these two things you can actually

231
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:41,370
be referring to like disk like

232
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,960
SD which is direct access the Rouge

233
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,159
device that's what you call hard drive

234
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,600
your main great world and then there's

235
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,209
also flash storage and there's older

236
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,380
stuff like tape but the healthiest

237
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,090
stores prefer to what we would call

238
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,380
memory so you might hear a referred to

239
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,540
virtual storage you're talking about

240
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,740
virtual memory so that's one thing to

241
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,069
keep in mind when you're talking to main

242
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,180
breakers another big one is that they

243
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,830
don't have files on the mainframe to

244
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,790
have data sets and there's a couple

245
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,920
different kinds

246
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,410
you have sequential data sets and that's

247
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,229
kind of like you know just a normal file

248
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,420
like here I have an example of these see

249
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,880
my mouse you have the user dot user one

250
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,229
dot data that would be like a file but

251
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,090
then you can also have partitioned data

252
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,830
sets or PD s's which are kind of the

253
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,780
equivalent of folders it's one file and

254
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,220
has several files inside of it and they

255
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,020
don't have a naming scheme kind of like

256
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,660
a high-level qualifier at the front then

257
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:30,300
a dot and then everything after so the

258
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,160
high-level qualifier is usually used to

259
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,050
denote like who owns it so if I'm user

260
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,939
one on the mainframe all my files will

261
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,319
start with user one dot and then I can

262
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,720
put dots in between just kind of like a

263
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:44,460
logical sorting they don't really obey

264
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,990
like file extension conventions or

265
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,520
anything but people kind of do it just a

266
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,020
separate stuff out in the agreement just

267
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,510
be able to visually look at it make

268
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,340
sense of it almost everything on the

269
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,020
mainframe is run like a job and that's

270
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,900
all managed by Jess the job entry

271
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,970
subsystem you'll also hear main framers

272
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:03,329
call CE OS or the mainframe operating

273
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,150
system you refer to it as MDS and that's

274
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,550
just an older name for the mainframe LS

275
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:11,400
the OS has changed names like 80 or nine

276
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:13,050
times e OS has been the longest it's

277
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,060
been the name of the OS for like less

278
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,410
decade or so and I think it's going to

279
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,530
stick around until they have some major

280
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:21,060
hardware reading up but yeah you'll

281
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:24,990
still hear any BTS used a lot in

282
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,729
majoring world so to interact with that

283
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,350
mainframe the traditional way is you use

284
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,290
T and 3270

285
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,880
which is also called the green screen

286
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:35,250
1832 70 was originally like actually

287
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,930
this it was a model of internal but

288
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,370
nowadays you can emulate it with

289
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,540
programs on your Windows PC

290
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:45,209
your Linux PC it's actually a modified

291
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,610
version of telnet that speaks up Cydia

292
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,899
and does color and it's just what they

293
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:53,579
use for their terminal sessions instead

294
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:55,230
of telnet or SSH when you use T 18 30 to

295
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:56,609
70 to access the mainframe usually the

296
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,860
first thing you're gonna hit is called a

297
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,850
detail now although you may fingers in

298
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,379
the room I didn't even ask

299
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:05,430
oh yeah well they use laugh at my jokes

300
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:07,199
it shouldn't don't kill me cuz I know

301
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,300
I'm like drastically simplifying this

302
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,709
for God but you can think of each am

303
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,269
almost as kind of the portal to the

304
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:13,888
mainframe that when you start a team 30

305
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:15,540
to 70 session keychain is usually the

306
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:18,089
first thing you hit and it usually have

307
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,099
some kind of like splash screen you know

308
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:22,230
be some cool not eps task you are but

309
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,910
episodic art maybe with like a design or

310
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,379
something you'll see more of that later

311
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,670
and usually I'll tell you what

312
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:27,990
applications are available and you can

313
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,490
pick whatever you want to get into from

314
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,410
there so you can think of you can kind

315
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,470
like the makers portal I know it's

316
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:37,559
drastically oversimplify but you know

317
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,550
yeah Tiesto is had the mainframe shell

318
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,170
it's kinda like the command line

319
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:44,609
interface for the mainframe and a nice

320
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:47,099
PF is the GUI but it's it's a text menu

321
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,679
driven based system on over T and 3270

322
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,649
it's very encouraging you to use like

323
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,240
anchors like kismet on Linux has kind of

324
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:55,290
nervous like that it's text-based that

325
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,610
kind of like they let you do mouse

326
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:59,519
clicks and stuff like that but it's all

327
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:02,639
in text and then every mainframe

328
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,370
actually has UNIX inside it so you have

329
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,980
USS unit's subsystem or it's still

330
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,149
called Bo MVS they're MDS again because

331
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,980
it was originally released as open

332
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:15,569
edition MVS back in the 80s or 90s it

333
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,899
was basically the items cheap way to get

334
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:20,849
tcp/ip support into the mainframe like

335
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,589
when Microsoft line of tcp/ip support

336
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,209
they just ripped off like B s DS network

337
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:26,129
staff IBM's like we're just going to

338
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:27,540
shove a whole UNIX inside this thing

339
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:30,509
because there's just enough room for the

340
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,370
hex as you'll see it's it's old and

341
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:35,160
clunky it's kind of like a I exaggerate

342
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,769
the I XE but it's not eix it's not gonna

343
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,569
obey all the same conventions that it

344
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:44,189
has a hint kind of flavor so obviously

345
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:46,649
it's an IBM product now maven culture is

346
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:48,750
a lot different than like Windows and

347
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:51,940
Linux and in culture many things are

348
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:53,890
very customizable every

349
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,660
installs gonna have it some kind of

350
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,130
culture the main framers are going to

351
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,930
use IBM jargon they're gonna use their

352
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,420
own jargon they're gonna have her own

353
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,550
ways of doing there is everything matrix

354
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,069
heavily customizable so like every

355
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,660
instance is going to be different and a

356
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,769
lot these themselves are very old I mean

357
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,480
a lot these people have been customers

358
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:12,700
of the mainframe since the 60s or 70s

359
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,800
and you know they've been buying every

360
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,060
continuous generation of hardware and a

361
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,170
lot of those main framers might have

362
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,250
been around since the sixties or

363
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,519
seventies and they've been using this

364
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,930
platform for a very long time so

365
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,250
mainframes I'm gonna be centralizing

366
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,859
kind of want to be distributed at the

367
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:29,500
same time because you they invite us

368
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,779
like one enormous box with all these

369
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,279
processors all this RAM but then it's

370
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:35,260
carved up it could be carved up into L

371
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,089
pars inside one L parts could be running

372
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,490
a hypervisor that's running hundreds of

373
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,899
Linux VMs like it's kind of hearing how

374
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,850
it's like it wants to be centralized and

375
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:46,990
decentralized at the same time and then

376
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,810
another thing about the mainframe is

377
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,570
it's so old that it predates really the

378
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,859
concept of user security security when

379
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,079
you know the mainframe platform started

380
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,310
out was you just locked the door - you

381
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,199
know like wherever you submit in the

382
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,689
java power I've got the green treatment

383
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,819
you know a physical terminal that so

384
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,100
z/os has some like rudimentary security

385
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,360
built in but it's had external products

386
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,660
that have like filled in the gaps in the

387
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,720
meantime so the big three are rack F ACF

388
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:16,540
- and top secret I'm just going to come

389
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,510
a rack F it's by far the most popular

390
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,980
it's actually the IBM official external

391
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,149
security manager product and it's the

392
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,019
one you're gonna see the most often out

393
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:28,269
in the wild so ragged F has a database

394
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:30,760
that holds everything concerning

395
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:32,589
security it'll store all the permissions

396
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,149
for all the files it'll store password

397
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:36,760
hashes it will store crypto keys

398
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:38,709
everything when you're on a mainframe I

399
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,089
get an ISP F or TSO session you can run

400
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,130
the our variant Communion and I'll tell

401
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:43,540
you where that database is located in

402
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,850
case you want to feel it later which you

403
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,579
know all the times you can't there's no

404
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,899
real concept of rude or admin in the

405
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:51,459
UNIX world

406
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:53,230
the closest thing you have is you have

407
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:55,268
special provisions on your account which

408
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,430
special permissions means you can just

409
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:00,160
give yourself

410
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,479
access to any day so like you say if you

411
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,040
have special you could say okay I want

412
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,000
to have access you can issue commands to

413
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,790
say ok give me a

414
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,270
this users files you know it's done but

415
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:12,610
it's not like a one-and-done brute

416
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:14,260
historically passwords very weak and

417
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,780
hash functions have really sucked

418
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:20,319
they've gotten better in recent years

419
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,819
but a lot of many favours haven't

420
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,860
updated because they very much have a

421
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,080
philosophy like a lot of programmers and

422
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,700
admins of if it isn't broke don't fix it

423
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,140
we've gotten by just fine on each

424
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,960
character passwords for you know the

425
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:35,530
last 40 years while we updating now so

426
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,690
so something keep in mind now on the

427
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,850
platform your big programming languages

428
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:43,510
are going to be a stem where a lot of

429
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,940
stuff is still written in Z assembly

430
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,580
kobalava obviously it is a big one you

431
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:51,220
hear about in mainframe world pl-1 is

432
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,510
still fairly big Fortran seems to have

433
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,620
dropped off I seem less and less

434
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:58,900
mentions of it in IBM literature's

435
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,180
and then VA USS the UNIX system services

436
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:03,340
you also get access to java c is d plus

437
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,500
plus and more modern stuff and job is

438
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,910
very popular on the platform now the

439
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,160
scripting languages you have on a

440
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,780
mainframe the biggest one is JCL which

441
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,280
is job control language that's actually

442
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,170
the language you used to set up a batch

443
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,329
job and submit it to be processed and

444
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,829
we'll see some of it later there's

445
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,960
another format called C list which is

446
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,940
kind of like kinda like a dog bath on

447
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,300
windows or a bash script where it's just

448
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:27,310
a list of TSO commands it's not that

449
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,199
common anymore because it's Sox TSO is

450
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,719
very limited as we'll see a little later

451
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,130
Rex is much more popular let Rex in the

452
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,390
scripting language that's more

453
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:37,360
comfortable something like Perl or

454
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:39,189
Python it's a lot more powerful a lot

455
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,870
easier to read a lot easier to use and

456
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,790
that's like by far the most popular

457
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,100
scripting language versus frogs to do

458
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,569
their work in and there again with USS

459
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,310
you get access to a lot of stuff like

460
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,830
bash scripts Perl

461
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,089
TCL things like that and then in

462
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,920
particulars company called rocket

463
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:57,160
software that's ported Python a lot of

464
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,750
other stuff over the USS that a lot of

465
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,980
its free you can download from their FTP

466
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:05,500
site install it now briefly I will touch

467
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,089
on kicks and IMS so kick stands for

468
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:13,359
customer information control system and

469
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:15,819
in IMS there you go information

470
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,349
management system these are what are

471
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:18,730
called transaction managers Kix is

472
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:20,349
seems to be the way more popular than

473
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,019
IMS I see a lot of kicks ass and I do I

474
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:24,428
invest what you can think of it is it's

475
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:25,809
like a purpose-built application on the

476
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:27,759
mainframe so that you don't have to

477
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:31,750
teach the normies how to use TSO and I

478
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:33,549
SPF if you go into I think I was in a

479
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,380
hardware store recently and I highly

480
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:36,940
suspect that when I asked them where

481
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,799
something was they pulled up this black

482
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,750
screen here or typing stuff into these

483
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,490
like text form fields I highly suspect

484
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,809
that was probably a gigs application it

485
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,960
was probably a central mainframe that

486
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:48,549
they use for all their inventory you

487
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,649
also see them with like web front-ends

488
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:52,870
or like desktop application front ends

489
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:54,189
it's just like a purpose-built app so

490
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:57,820
that people could more easily learn how

491
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:59,590
to do mainframe stuff but really they

492
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,939
run over tea and 3270 like I said there

493
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,408
might be a web or a desktop app

494
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,269
front-end but on the backside of

495
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:06,850
speaking T and 3272 community into the

496
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:09,009
mainframe a lot of security is client

497
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:11,529
side it's relying on actual quirks of

498
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:13,210
the T and 3270 protocol so like hide

499
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:16,720
fields or say to do key you can edit

500
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:18,460
this but not that and much like most

501
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,529
client-side security it sucks there's

502
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,960
lots of ways to hack it but it's way too

503
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:25,240
big of a subject for me to cover I would

504
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,919
direct you to Dominic white it can be

505
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,710
seen she presented every concert with

506
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,360
know about kif security and then you LS

507
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,649
all has done some great work on the

508
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,699
subject if you wanna learn how about

509
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:40,000
kids happy but now what I want to show

510
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,370
you is a couple of demos just to see

511
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,330
what the mainframe looks like there's no

512
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:48,610
changes because the network here doesn't

513
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:55,649
want you to go to anything except 84 for

514
00:18:48,610 --> 00:19:06,279
free unless you're in a VPN play some

515
00:18:55,649 --> 00:19:13,120
videos alright first off here's a little

516
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:16,629
demo oh so sorry again I apologize for

517
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:20,018
the projectors hopefully you could read

518
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:21,759
this let's see so this is actually a

519
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:24,129
program this is called next 30 to 70

520
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:27,070
which is a x11 based

521
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:28,689
terminal application use on the Linux

522
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,740
Mac stuff like that there's other apps

523
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,870
for interacting

524
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,330
the iris even console apps like you can

525
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,949
do from with your terminal so I'm gonna

526
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,550
count to mainframe and here you can see

527
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,690
somehow nice

528
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:47,980
episode a cart hopefully you can make

529
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:50,500
that out turn the lights up there we go

530
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,400
okay sorry I'm so dark but hopefully

531
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,380
we'll pop a little more

532
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,750
so this is I'm actually connecting to an

533
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,800
IBM mainframe call it's it's part of a

534
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,030
program they do called master the

535
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,770
mainframe is their attempt to

536
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,178
desperately get kids interested in

537
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,559
mainframes because all the old main

538
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:05,260
breakers keep dying off and they need to

539
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,590
replace them it's their way to save the

540
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:10,360
endangered species and main framers so I

541
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,280
connected this is vtm so I take V team

542
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,080
right now it's kind of the portal and if

543
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,790
you're wondering what the hell in my a

544
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,669
detail or not you can hear this command

545
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:20,260
IBM test and hit enter and I've always

546
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:22,420
enter this little thing it says IBM echo

547
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,020
and then does a through Z in the numbers

548
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:28,870
it's just a debug test program obviously

549
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,100
so I'm on beat am and then usually the

550
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,750
message will tell you what options you

551
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,879
have and this one I can do log on and

552
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:39,870
then it's gonna ask me for my username

553
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:42,640
which in that format is z3 0 8 5 8 and

554
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:47,559
then here's the TSW login screen I'll

555
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:51,000
put in password and now that's the

556
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:53,020
message is it takes a minute to load up

557
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,130
some central time we'll see some more

558
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,129
pep sticker in a minute

559
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:10,009
there we go there's an exit Akari it's a

560
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,389
it's a little map of the world and it's

561
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:13,759
hard to make out with a little master

562
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:15,350
the mainframe logo in the center and so

563
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,820
tell me some messages this is also

564
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,289
really SYSPRO it's gonna like kind of

565
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,379
send me out like wall messages out to

566
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:26,750
users to tell them things and so I get

567
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:27,949
in there we go so that's the ispf menu

568
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,809
but we're gonna exit out of that real

569
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,789
quick and we're going to TSM so here I

570
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:33,860
am at the ready prompt just like a

571
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:35,840
freaking old Commodore 64

572
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,519
that's your prompted TSO if your says a

573
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,120
read ready and then you get our commands

574
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:43,159
so here I'm a new list user and then

575
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,989
that's just like running ID on yourself

576
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:47,480
so it's gonna print out some information

577
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:49,039
I see my username and show some esoteric

578
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,409
information about like my permissions

579
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,658
and stuff like that I can hit the clear

580
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:55,029
screen button with my little application

581
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:56,960
over here to clear the screen out

582
00:21:55,029 --> 00:22:00,200
there's no like clear command right in

583
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,299
Linux I can also use that same command

584
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,059
in a previous and so let's do a new Lu

585
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:06,830
and then I can run it and I'm gonna have

586
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:08,690
some options to it to get some more info

587
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:10,189
so like I asked them to show me my om vs

588
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,340
info so I can see like where my UNIX

589
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,330
home directory is and stuff like that

590
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,949
now I'm going to run profile which

591
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,750
profile is kind of like your batch or

592
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,159
see your badge profile it just kind of

593
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,769
has some information about like your

594
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,929
session one of the big things in there

595
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:25,039
is that your profile usually defined

596
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:25,789
that whenever you're interacting with

597
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,529
files

598
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:29,179
I should just automatically append my

599
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:30,919
username a dot my high-level qualifier

600
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:33,590
to everything because it kind of keeps

601
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:37,269
me in my little zone to keep you from

602
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,269
messing with like the higher-level files

603
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,129
now here's the here's a familiar command

604
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,779
I can actually run ping and it will

605
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:49,759
actually do that you know I can you know

606
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:50,779
Google's DNS server so you can run a

607
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,549
ping coming in from there and there's so

608
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:54,470
bro they're like you know tcp and unix

609
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:57,139
commands it imported over like netstat

610
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,840
oh so here's the thing when i reach the

611
00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:02,240
end of a screen in T and 3270 I'll get

612
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,230
three little asterisks and then from

613
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,610
there I just have to hit enter again

614
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,740
it'll clear the screen and like start

615
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:09,168
with the top there again it's it's very

616
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,269
old is there's a remnant of using an old

617
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:13,129
physical terminal but I can run Nets at

618
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:14,990
home and I can find my IP address it's

619
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:16,090
kind of equivalent of you running is

620
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:19,600
configured on me

621
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:21,399
I didn't clears it out and redress the

622
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,419
rest of that coming in since you know

623
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:27,580
Lubeck interfaces whatever so next up on

624
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:31,810
the list kat and that's gonna show all

625
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:35,409
the files here that like a the the COS

626
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:36,669
file system is very flat it's not like i

627
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,900
I think it's actually called

628
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,430
hierarchical file system but it's not

629
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,220
very hierarchical it doesn't work the

630
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:44,560
way like Windows and Linux file systems

631
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,910
work everything's kind of flat and you

632
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,290
use high level qualifiers to kind of

633
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,040
tell where things are supposed to be or

634
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,960
who they belong to

635
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,010
but like I said there's no like it's not

636
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,660
like things are like nested inside of

637
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,040
folders other than like those partition

638
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,440
datasets it's not the only kind of thing

639
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,730
so if I turn liscad the default program

640
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,050
my profile is it's just gonna list the

641
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,910
stuff that belongs to me so I'll stuff

642
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,080
with my high-level qualifier so here

643
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,940
I've got a bunch of scripts and files

644
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,909
and stuff in my home directory and now

645
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:09,520
we do lists yes on that JCL file so when

646
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:12,700
I just type GCL because my profile knows

647
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:16,570
automatically to start started with z30

648
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,670
8580 JCL so i a JCL but it knows it goes

649
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:20,350
to this file in my home directory and so

650
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,850
i do listen to yes just see some info

651
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:24,899
about it like i'll show me like how big

652
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,709
it is how many memory blocks it takes up

653
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,360
there again at the bottom of the screen

654
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,360
so I'll hit enter and clear it out and

655
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:36,100
then I can do lifty JCL the members just

656
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,380
give it some arguments so I can see that

657
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,179
it's a partitioned data set and it has

658
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,890
members in it so remember PD SS are kind

659
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:45,390
of like folders so here's like all the

660
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,390
other like little files that are inside

661
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:00,630
idealist cat again show that a clear

662
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:03,150
screen out now I can delete file so I

663
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:06,750
can you del I can delete this unit to

664
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:09,360
Eng CL thing run that it's gone

665
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:11,640
but list cat again you can see it was

666
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,320
here I'll list it again it's no longer

667
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:20,039
there so I pleated it out like you can

668
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,750
boss I can rename file so I'm gonna take

669
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:27,649
this test JC now and rename it to the

670
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:29,820
old file I deleted there it goes

671
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:39,570
Thank You Lizzie and see that it's been

672
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:44,100
renamed now there's no real equivalent

673
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:45,720
of cat in TCL world or type if you're

674
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,760
using link window like community of see

675
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,710
but what you can do is you can edit a

676
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,629
file and use the edit command to

677
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,760
actually take that file so I've opened

678
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,679
it up but now I'm in the edit interface

679
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,270
so now I have to tell some commands so

680
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,340
here I say edit I'm going to edit that

681
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,020
and also I showed you here with single

682
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:04,350
quotes I can give like the absolute path

683
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,610
of the file or a data set so I'm using

684
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,549
edit and you can see I'm opening that

685
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:11,760
unit between a JCL data set that I just

686
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:14,250
you know renate so I enter what type it

687
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,029
is and I do cntl that's telling you this

688
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:19,110
is a JCL

689
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:20,850
it's a job control language file so it's

690
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,379
opened up I can do list and that's kind

691
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,510
of running cat on it so now I'm going to

692
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,580
cat it out that's what JCL looks like

693
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:28,260
we'll see a better look of it in the

694
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,658
ispf section when it's like nice and

695
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,950
color coded I can end no save and then

696
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,929
I'll quit out of the editor and bring me

697
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,340
back to the regular TCO prompt that's

698
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:38,100
kind of how you list out file contents

699
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,809
it's very clunky here I'm going to look

700
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,449
at another file and this one is a text

701
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:43,950
file it's actually a wreck script so I'm

702
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,690
gonna look at it it's going to ask me

703
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,179
what this type of file is I'm gonna tell

704
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:51,870
it it's text and there again I'm gonna

705
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:54,120
do list after I clear the screen I'll do

706
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,709
list again and then you can see this is

707
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,320
a wreck script which hopefully looks a

708
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,789
lot more familiar to you know Windows or

709
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,439
Linux user you can see it's a scripting

710
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:03,990
language it's a lot more readable than

711
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,280
like jzl

712
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,020
I'm at the end of the day now okay on

713
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,350
you and no save to just close about do

714
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,850
anything and I'm done with that and now

715
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,550
I can next to keep that program with the

716
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,649
exact command I can run Rex script and

717
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:19,300
various other things so I'm gonna run

718
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:23,320
that and what this ball just does is it

719
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:25,570
prints out all of the Linux user sorry

720
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:28,450
the USS the units of service system

721
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:30,310
services users on this box which whoo

722
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,680
there's a lot of them on this big old

723
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:34,659
mainframe there's hundreds of users now

724
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,550
the equivalent of like hitting ctrl C to

725
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,200
like kill whatever you're in is the PA

726
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:40,870
one command which I have it on the

727
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,210
little virtual keyboard here it's also

728
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:45,159
depending on what kind of tea and 3270

729
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:50,080
emulator you're using it'll be mapped to

730
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:51,640
keys it's usually like yeah might be the

731
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,290
skate key it depends on the software

732
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,940
you're using or might be mapped to one

733
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:56,470
of the function keys so if I'm in a

734
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,510
program and I want to get the hell out I

735
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,220
just hit that key and then it's gonna

736
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,230
say are you do sure and it says enter

737
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:05,680
high to end and I enter high and so I

738
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:07,030
get out of it so now I'm an allocated

739
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,070
data set this is kind of like running

740
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:11,200
touch or you know something dirty or

741
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:13,090
something like that to make a file so

742
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,780
I'm gonna say allocated data set called

743
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:17,800
test data and make it like test JCL

744
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,570
that's about the easiest way to make a

745
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,030
file because allocating files is really

746
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,649
freaking clunky and hard in a framework

747
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:25,120
because you guys like you have to tell

748
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,530
it like how big it's going to eat you

749
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,050
think it's gonna be it's like making

750
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:31,570
freakin strings and C it's terrible so

751
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:32,020
anyway I just did that I made it like

752
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,950
that

753
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:38,010
actually I screwed up the first name so

754
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:40,420
there I made that test that data file

755
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:44,560
list es on it to show like how big it is

756
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:47,950
and then I'm gonna log off and that's

757
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:51,639
the end of that now I'll show you is PF

758
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:54,040
because no one really uses TSO I mean

759
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,130
most sis Prague's don't get into it

760
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:59,200
because it's just really old and archaic

761
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,820
TSO has a lot TIR looks like ispf has a

762
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,830
lot more features and is a lot more

763
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:05,189
complete so that's what the mostly I've

764
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:07,120
been spending time in cicero's

765
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:10,480
let me connect to the mainframe again

766
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:15,550
same one it's just the master the

767
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,750
mainframe login my wonderful eight

768
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,220
character password

769
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,080
with the only last three types of

770
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,330
special characters so this is the ispf

771
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,158
main menu and you see it's very very

772
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,629
easy to use very like number menu driven

773
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,130
you just enter the number of what you

774
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,510
want or they have a couple other

775
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,179
functions here for like little code

776
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:33,158
words to jump to stuff like I can do you

777
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:35,650
just jump into a unit show I can you ask

778
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:37,240
you to go to STS F which is like the

779
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,070
main like job control program to see

780
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,760
like see what jobs are running and view

781
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:45,010
their output or see at the minute so

782
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,379
first off I'm gonna run TSO I can run

783
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:49,840
that come here from here and then follow

784
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,340
it up with a TSO command and I'll run oh

785
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,418
you can't see it it'll run out like

786
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,770
right now the bottom screen they'll

787
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:56,890
start printing out to youzhou communis i

788
00:29:53,770 --> 00:30:03,549
just did list to show mine the datasets

789
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:13,360
the blog going user goes okay then here

790
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:14,740
I did three okay alright so I'm going to

791
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,780
do three which is I'm gonna go to

792
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:19,539
utilities menu as you can see this 3 is

793
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:22,120
utilities and then I'm going to go to to

794
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:24,460
4 which is DS list which is a program

795
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,668
for listing out files and stuff like

796
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,620
that so you can see here the the DS name

797
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:31,960
level is just automatically sent to my

798
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,889
users files and then I can get a listing

799
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,530
it's just like writing ballistic a

800
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:39,539
dagger but IPF has a built-in editor so

801
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:42,190
I'm gonna go over here to my JCL program

802
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:44,200
enter some gobbly gook and then here i

803
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:46,870
have this nice little visual editor kind

804
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,179
of a very kind of VI like to edit it in

805
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:51,820
so here's how the JCL job looks like it

806
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:53,260
starts off with the slash slashes with

807
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,570
some information that kind of tells like

808
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,370
what priority the jobs gonna be how it

809
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:59,049
should be sorted how important it is

810
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,580
what program it's going to use to

811
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:02,679
execute where it should take its input

812
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,899
where she writes output it's all very

813
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,030
esoteric and very fussy if you screw one

814
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:10,030
like freaking like space up in it it'll

815
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,770
box the whole job so it's very I don't

816
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,240
know I've even heard that like most this

817
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,950
products don't write JCL from scratch

818
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,510
they just keep well JC lecithin just

819
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:18,970
modified them accordingly because it's

820
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,320
so easy to screw up and this is just one

821
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:22,000
that's just gonna run some TSO commands

822
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,889
you can see it's gonna run lu for my

823
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,020
user and list my users info it's gonna

824
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:28,750
run its dan home to see our IP address

825
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,240
and then it's gonna run list c in order

826
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:33,440
to

827
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:35,510
without my home data sets so if you see

828
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,870
here I can actually go here and type in

829
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:42,799
D in that line numbering and hit enter

830
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:44,928
and I'll delete a line or I can type you

831
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,580
couldn't quite see it but I can 18 I can

832
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:48,110
add a line below it so you can add lines

833
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,490
you can also put numbers in and add like

834
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,709
10 lines below something

835
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,270
it's very configurable so then I'm going

836
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:57,350
to add that back in and now I'm just

837
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:58,520
gonna do save to save the file and then

838
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:03,168
I'm gonna do submit I'm gonna spit the

839
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:04,970
JCL now I'm gonna hit the the pf3 which

840
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:07,159
usually maps to the f3 function key when

841
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:09,260
you're using JCL this is based like the

842
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:12,049
back key so I'm gonna use it I'm gonna

843
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:18,830
go back to the main menu and here I'm

844
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:22,580
going to go into SDS f SDS F is where

845
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:24,110
you see all the mainframes jobs so I'm

846
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,970
going to dig into these menus I'm gonna

847
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:29,719
go find my job that ran so right there

848
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:32,539
it is the question mark to view it I'm

849
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,860
gonna go to the system printout and I'm

850
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:35,090
gonna take a look I'm gonna see it and

851
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,908
you can see here at Randy he'll you

852
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:41,449
command you go a little further ran that

853
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:43,899
stand up nest at home and then I ran

854
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:47,390
list C so I just ran all my jobs and

855
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:51,408
successfully completed thank yous s4

856
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:53,809
quit out of that and also you don't have

857
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:56,270
to do three utilities and then four

858
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:57,710
things you can do 3.4 and I'll tell it

859
00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:01,730
to go to the utilities menu go to the

860
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:02,960
fourth item so it's a little shortcut so

861
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,190
we jump right to that data list thing

862
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,710
we're gonna list files now I'm gonna

863
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,960
look at another JCL job and this one is

864
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,809
Ted T sub commands it's gonna do Unix

865
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,240
commands so as you see here it looks a

866
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:15,830
little different but the bird part is

867
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,950
the parameters it takes it's going to

868
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:21,379
tell the BP x batch program which is

869
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:23,000
just a program that runs unix jobs and

870
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:30,470
tell them to run the shell and run the

871
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:35,539
ID command and then that's Ted - H so

872
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:37,549
I'm gonna submit that job and then

873
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:41,090
here's another little time-saver I can

874
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:42,950
do semicolon and then do equal sign

875
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,749
which is kind of like saying go

876
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:47,389
to the top level and do this and so I'm

877
00:33:44,749 --> 00:33:49,489
gonna do the SD so that I can just jump

878
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:51,949
back to the main menu go to the SDS F

879
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:53,869
program then feed it more commands to

880
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:58,899
say ok then when you're inside Stas hi

881
00:33:53,869 --> 00:34:01,009
PST command to go to the list of jobs so

882
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:02,899
that's like the initial Lindos there's

883
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:04,070
lots of like you know command line time

884
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:06,289
saving that stuff you can do

885
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:08,869
and there's my age of you my unix job

886
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:10,909
and completed it showed the ID for my

887
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:17,869
user my you idea majority and they bring

888
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:20,629
out that's the information and then exit

889
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:24,379
out of that and now I'll show you guys

890
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:27,799
what unit looks like I'm gonna run TSO

891
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:30,859
I'm murdering the OMB s command so that

892
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:32,540
won't take me to the where's OBS is what

893
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:34,399
log main rivers called units inside

894
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,210
there this is the old name the open

895
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,129
Edition NDS

896
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:39,290
so here I get this UNIX shell for I

897
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:42,529
could submit commands so I spin ID I can

898
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:44,449
see my my UID and GID I could run you

899
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:46,879
name - AI could see the information it

900
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:48,649
still says OS 390 which was the last

901
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,299
name is EOS had I don't know why it

902
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:51,440
hasn't been updated because this isn't a

903
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:54,168
very this is this is a brand-new

904
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,599
mainframe not sure what's going on just

905
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:57,950
very slow to update those things and I

906
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:59,480
can have all sorts of normal unity stuff

907
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:04,578
like I can't list out there right the

908
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:08,569
contents of my home directory you see

909
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:09,920
you've got some files in there I can

910
00:35:08,569 --> 00:35:13,700
delete stuff like I'm going to delete

911
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,710
that Rex file now here's what's

912
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,569
interesting I'm gonna copy a file from

913
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,780
the MVS filesystem over to the UNIX

914
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:19,779
filesystem

915
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:30,230
so if you look here at a copy and then

916
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,910
in in double quotes I did slash slash

917
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,980
and then a single quotes I did the full

918
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:37,040
the whole or full path name I guess you

919
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,569
call it that my dataset so z30 if I'm a

920
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,160
doc hello doc Rex

921
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,720
that's a file do you said you solar here

922
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,129
is that Rex script I had I was like

923
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,959
sitting in one of the write scripts of a

924
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:48,319
sitting in my is because you call my

925
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,970
home directory on the MDS I it's telling

926
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:52,430
it I'm going to copy that from the MDS I

927
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,870
want copied over UNIX rename it hello

928
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:57,700
duck

929
00:35:52,870 --> 00:36:02,440
and lowercase so I do that and now I can

930
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:03,129
cat it out and gives a second and it'll

931
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,320
print it down

932
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:07,330
there's my little rake script I can also

933
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:11,640
run it as an executable I can do chmod

934
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:15,130
plus x and make it an executable file

935
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,810
and iBM has you know a UNIX based Rex

936
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,850
interpreter that can run it so I knew

937
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:22,450
just hello Rex and they'll just do just

938
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:24,009
prints hello world now also an EDX ID

939
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:26,230
that can also run TSO commands so

940
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:27,280
there's a very common it's I don't think

941
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,290
it's actually built in but it's a very

942
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,150
common everybody every in still has it

943
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:33,880
there's actually a reg script called TSO

944
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:35,680
CMD that just passes commands the MVS

945
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,300
size runs them agrees to the output bag

946
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,640
so here I'm gonna do TSO command and run

947
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,960
the list see it'll take a minute and

948
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,759
they're at ran list see and show the

949
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:49,710
contents of all my data says that I will

950
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:49,710
run the MVS side and then I can exit out

951
00:36:50,790 --> 00:37:03,190
and the jobs over and it'll kick me back

952
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:04,900
to you guys PS eventually and there you

953
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,850
go and that can do X and exit out and

954
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,250
it'll ask me because I since I generated

955
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:10,240
files through my jobs I submit it's like

956
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,320
hey what you want to do with them and

957
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,910
I'm like add just throwing away I'm

958
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,670
Noopur so other you action to to

959
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:32,770
delete data sets so the deleted I'm out

960
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:34,630
I log off and I'm done so alright so

961
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,380
before we get into hacking knee brace I

962
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:38,200
want to talk a little bit about

963
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,910
overcoming organizational obstacles to

964
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,279
mainframe pentesting that's probably the

965
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,540
biggest problem is getting it at

966
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,460
estimating frames that you were in a few

967
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,840
minutes so I'll start off by talking

968
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,260
about my first encounter with the

969
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:52,210
mainframe so I used to work for a very

970
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,070
large company near Louisville and we had

971
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:55,840
mainframes and at the time we were

972
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:57,820
looking at privileged Identity

973
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,170
Management solutions and so we were

974
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,270
looking like okay well we want to manage

975
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,530
our accounts on Linux too and a manager

976
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,450
deep domain admins

977
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,010
all sorts of different folks will be

978
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,180
like what their equivalent is

979
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:09,700
we'll see if we can find a product that

980
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:12,250
manages their stuff so me and another

981
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,629
guy who was also on the security team he

982
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,890
was a former IP a murder so he spoke

983
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:17,440
their language little more it was only

984
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:18,970
call with me and we call these two three

985
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,280
guys were overheard datacenter like way

986
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,750
out so I never knew who examine who it

987
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,640
was so the three guys on the call and I

988
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:27,340
don't remember whose voice was whose

989
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,930
name but like couple minutes in this

990
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,540
conversation one of these guys you

991
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:33,009
starts going off on us about how you

992
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,630
security people always try to get in

993
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,430
their business and if I can't get to my

994
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,680
you know if I can't get into my life

995
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:41,020
special accounts and be able to like you

996
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,759
know mess with jobs or and you're acting

997
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,259
up and if that mainframe goes down I

998
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,640
can't get in your company's all these

999
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,500
millions of dollars every second from

1000
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,540
loss transactions breach didn't need for

1001
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,530
like ten straight minutes and when I'm

1002
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,810
putting the phone on you and I'm

1003
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,910
cracking up and I'm chatting to to my

1004
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:58,359
colleague that like wow it's like I find

1005
00:38:54,910 --> 00:39:01,180
UNIX great girls for surly like many

1006
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:03,009
places from eventually we calmed it down

1007
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:05,980
or like look this is just exploratory do

1008
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:08,290
you don't buy my damn head off leash but

1009
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,369
that's kind of what she we counter some

1010
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:11,050
of them can be very set in their ways

1011
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:12,490
and they don't like you coming along and

1012
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,119
messing with her shed it's

1013
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:15,609
understandable

1014
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,170
oh but be from mainframe system I said

1015
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:20,710
because I might of mainframe is

1016
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:21,760
simultaneously this for my Fort Knox if

1017
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,010
you a doesn't know what that is the

1018
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,850
boolean repository mainframe is sudden

1019
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,520
take you see this

1020
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:29,230
and it's also this it's a hemophiliac

1021
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,450
baby in the middle of a room full of

1022
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:34,359
dominoes and Faberge eggs and good China

1023
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,649
it's like oh the mainframe is got the

1024
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:37,990
most high-end

1025
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,580
top up-to-date security from IBM it's

1026
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,229
completely impenetrable it's never been

1027
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,029
hacked but also it's my sweet little

1028
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,350
precious baby and if you so much as poke

1029
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,310
it it's gonna fall over and we're gonna

1030
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:47,200
lose a billion dollars in loss

1031
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:48,609
transactions it's like pick one you

1032
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,560
can't really have it both ways it's not

1033
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:53,850
alarm the other it really it's it's

1034
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,840
actually much more this than it is that

1035
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:58,080
so your first dog split

1036
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,430
really the main frankerz themselves

1037
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,350
mainframe knowledge is much more guarded

1038
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:05,109
is much less accessible because there is

1039
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:07,029
a barrier to entry to be to owning a

1040
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:09,549
mainframe and being a mainframe er you

1041
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:11,500
know I mean these are the low-end its

1042
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,270
millions of dollars over these days it's

1043
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,240
not as easy to get into and learn as

1044
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:17,380
like Linux and Windows our main framers

1045
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,700
are very much speak to their own culture

1046
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,450
in their own jargon like I mentioned

1047
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,399
these are very

1048
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,740
very old competing cultures that go all

1049
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,720
the way back to 60s and 50s

1050
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,368
thanks you a little older but items

1051
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,140
trying to fix that like I mentioned the

1052
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:30,460
master the mainframe program is

1053
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,990
something they promoted colleges to try

1054
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:35,589
to like save endangered name from your

1055
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:37,569
species they very often have a not broke

1056
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:39,339
don't fix it mentality if job to running

1057
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:41,558
fine they don't want to stop stuffing

1058
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:44,500
and risk updates that might work through

1059
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:47,650
the process it can be incredibly surly

1060
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,599
as I have encountered directly the

1061
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:53,079
biggest thing is just assure them that

1062
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,520
you respect their platform you respect

1063
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:56,680
how important to the business it is and

1064
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,630
that you're not there to like dunk on

1065
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,520
them or make them look crab you're there

1066
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,200
to help them improve their processes and

1067
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,400
brutal security that's the biggest thing

1068
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,879
is if you can get them on your side

1069
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,109
things will go a lot smoother obstacle

1070
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,670
to is the fear

1071
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:11,109
like I mentioned everybody's afraid that

1072
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:13,869
if you just so much as briefed on the

1073
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:16,900
mainframe it's gonna you know fall over

1074
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:18,849
and crash it's perhaps the biggest

1075
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,010
obstacle from main framers in management

1076
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:22,299
but especially management because many

1077
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,240
fingers know everything about the

1078
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:26,799
platform and upper management knows

1079
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,270
nothing all they know what the mainframe

1080
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:29,410
is what the main framers tell them and

1081
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,690
the whole the main framers tell them is

1082
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:33,129
doom and gloom if you touch it so that's

1083
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,960
the biggest obstacle whoever column is

1084
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,130
like these guys you know just billing

1085
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,390
management's heads with all we can touch

1086
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,829
the mainframe can't touch the mainframe

1087
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:41,950
no it's too it's too valuable it can

1088
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:43,690
touch it but the truth is it's just a

1089
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:46,689
 computer it's just like any

1090
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:48,400
other computer ok yeah it takes effort

1091
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,849
to prick a mainframe because for a

1092
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,250
computer

1093
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:53,500
it's a damn ungodly strong and reliable

1094
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:56,049
computer I mean these things have many

1095
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:59,500
are built for availability it takes a

1096
00:41:56,049 --> 00:42:01,180
lot to do as a mainframe trust me and

1097
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,130
also color because like any

1098
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:05,140
environment if it's that precious and

1099
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:08,410
valuable they've got you a they've got

1100
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:10,420
you know test environments that you can

1101
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,940
run in so if there won't even prod fine

1102
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:16,410
they've got QA l pars or Cuba or whole Q

1103
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:19,630
assists Lexa's that you can test it

1104
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:23,558
another one is gubrious especially if

1105
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:24,549
you do of IBM itself many favors can be

1106
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:27,579
very secure if they're configured

1107
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:30,670
probably but they do get hacked it has

1108
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:33,119
happened just because it's never happen

1109
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,980
in your org doesn't mean it won't

1110
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:40,769
his most high-profile one was a guy

1111
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:41,940
named refuge burn home he goes by a

1112
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:43,649
needle anakata he was one of the

1113
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,150
founders of the Pirate Bay to be like

1114
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,940
turning and you know a newbie hired

1115
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:49,200
Excite he was in hot water with the

1116
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,630
Sweden Swedish government was like

1117
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,470
hiding out in Thailand and he decided he

1118
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,089
was just gonna hack a bunch of

1119
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:56,519
Scandinavian countries to get back at

1120
00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:58,828
them so he had logica which is a big

1121
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:01,258
Swedish company he also hacked a Danish

1122
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:03,329
bank there was a third company in Norway

1123
00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:04,950
the heads mainframes hacked that I think

1124
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:06,480
they're still trying to prove he did it

1125
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:08,129
but it's like his pretty much thought he

1126
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,490
did but I haven't like definitively

1127
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:13,769
linked him to it he was able to edit to

1128
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:16,109
hack into them with like some some

1129
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:18,450
pretty like old school tricks that like

1130
00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:20,519
you know probably don't wouldn't work me

1131
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:21,960
back to was this the 2012

1132
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:23,669
like he was doing like kind of like old

1133
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,200
school like CGI hacks that like wouldn't

1134
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:28,380
work worked in 2012 I guess the most

1135
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,220
like Windows and Linux installs but me

1136
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,420
and Frank still had these problems

1137
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,089
because the main thing wasn't getting

1138
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,559
any scrutiny an IBM is all about

1139
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:36,720
security we have security they do not

1140
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,190
publish CDs they don't publish security

1141
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,558
advisories except through their private

1142
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:42,359
mailing lists and the only CD they

1143
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,369
actually have is a result of the logic

1144
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:47,160
of breach because basically the EU made

1145
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:48,569
them issue a CD and the CVE was even

1146
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,279
like they tried to claim it was a

1147
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:52,170
problem with Tivoli when the actual

1148
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:53,309
problem was with Suez itself so they

1149
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:57,749
were even dodging they made it were

1150
00:43:53,309 --> 00:44:00,299
actually forced about I mean so even if

1151
00:43:57,749 --> 00:44:01,950
you do drink the IBM kool-aid

1152
00:44:00,299 --> 00:44:03,420
then what's the harm in letting the

1153
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:05,189
pentesters have a crack at it you know

1154
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:07,109
if you believe that what IBM says that

1155
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:10,920
it's so secure there can't be had no

1156
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:12,390
Mustang in this dry so none of what

1157
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,450
you've all been waiting for is how do I

1158
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:16,739
have big dreams so I'm working through a

1159
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:19,140
little scenario and then Wapner video

1160
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:21,690
demonstrating it'll attack that and we

1161
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,999
first off go ahead and map it it's fine

1162
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:27,259
it'll live it won't fall over it won't

1163
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:30,149
die I think there was a problem with the

1164
00:44:27,259 --> 00:44:33,299
time to live on like city packets back

1165
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:36,569
in the day on like IBM z/os TCP stagger

1166
00:44:33,299 --> 00:44:38,009
Lee was my bonitas 400 edits problem but

1167
00:44:36,569 --> 00:44:39,239
I don't know you desk for under gos had

1168
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:41,489
a problem or like the time of the value

1169
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:43,230
unlike unlike sin ax was like I'm godly

1170
00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:45,160
long so like you could actually like sit

1171
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,810
in flooded just by for scanning it

1172
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,370
but that's they've been fixed for like

1173
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,509
30 years now so you don't have to worry

1174
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:51,009
about it they'll be fine if you in

1175
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:52,480
benefit because he doesn't want the

1176
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:54,340
stuff that lives on non-standard ports

1177
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,070
so be sure you can map every didn't use

1178
00:44:54,340 --> 00:45:00,550
- be - get all 2 to the 32nd power

1179
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:01,990
reports covered and if you have access

1180
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:03,100
to it if you're kind of like a red

1181
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:06,129
teaming scenario or you're just looking

1182
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,810
to do some OSINT take a look at their

1183
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,830
intranet knowledge sources because

1184
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,940
usually if you're doing a main different

1185
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,950
pen test you're probably doing an

1186
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,450
internal pen test because most companies

1187
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,460
aren't put these things out here yet

1188
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:17,560
some still are but you're probably an

1189
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:18,550
internal environment so you might be

1190
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,380
able to find their confluence or the

1191
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,770
SharePoint start searching for mainframe

1192
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,870
terms

1193
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:24,850
search for terms like it's l par TSO ID

1194
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:26,380
which I know some of you work at a

1195
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:28,839
company where your user name is called a

1196
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,970
TSO ID that's why it's because all your

1197
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,650
 was built for mainframes I also

1198
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:34,779
worked in another company where our user

1199
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:36,280
name was an e number it was a in a six

1200
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:38,500
digit number and it was also because of

1201
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:41,740
mainframes because of old racket like

1202
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:43,930
username constraints so anyway search

1203
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,819
the internet for terms like look for

1204
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,140
things like Attachmate kicks the

1205
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:49,390
mainframe terminology and maybe you can

1206
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,920
dig up some info and find out like about

1207
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:52,060
like maybe what they're naming scheme is

1208
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,640
for the mainframes what their user name

1209
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,720
scheme is like for them things like that

1210
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,890
if you've actually compromised for

1211
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,990
workstation like maybe in a Red Team

1212
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:00,430
scenario take a look and see if the

1213
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:02,049
mainframe or if you've compromised the

1214
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:03,419
mainframes laptop or somebody to use as

1215
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,590
the mainframe

1216
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:08,620
you might be able to find config files

1217
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:10,330
or scripts or hosts on demand jar or Cir

1218
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:12,970
documents or like your run book in big

1219
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:15,460
files which rumbas a big commercial team

1220
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,689
30 to 70 emulator is very popular you

1221
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,640
might be able to find passwords stored

1222
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,680
in there you might be able to find no

1223
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,140
majoring application names things like

1224
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,160
that so the things you do all the

1225
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,180
queries might look for the dull parts

1226
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,759
names and ip's

1227
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,080
excuse me you want to look for kicks

1228
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,170
region names if you're going after kicks

1229
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:34,529
applications username passwords and of

1230
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:36,880
course you know try to find some creds

1231
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:38,920
so there's an example output from that

1232
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,810
map I know that's very hard to read but

1233
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,820
some common ports you might see is FTP

1234
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:46,240
and SSH those are points in the UNIX

1235
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:49,000
side 423 will often have 30 to 70 or

1236
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,830
might be other like iterations of 23

1237
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,530
like port ten twenty three or twenty

1238
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:56,259
twenty three forty twenty three might be

1239
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:57,820
hosting different tan 30 to 70 portals

1240
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:01,180
on them

1241
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:02,890
you know 50 50 42 as we're like dp2

1242
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:04,600
lives that's very common to find TV to

1243
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:08,020
out of mainframe there's a lot to learn

1244
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,620
though so how do I get these cribs

1245
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:10,750
because

1246
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:13,569
happy you mainframe is pretty pointless

1247
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,920
without some kind of account there

1248
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:16,570
aren't a lot of ways to go from like

1249
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,280
zero access to getting in like there's

1250
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:19,810
not a lot I mean it's like Windows and

1251
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,940
Linux anymore you know it's hard to find

1252
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:23,440
those kind of ads so generally you want

1253
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:25,540
to try to find some kind of account even

1254
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,740
if it's low grid so one thing you can do

1255
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:30,000
is you furniture neural network is you

1256
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:33,850
can just snip because lots of T 30 to 70

1257
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,790
installs they can use SSL but like less

1258
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:38,080
than half do I think so you know that

1259
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:40,120
stuff's just flying over the ether just

1260
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,799
like telnet its unencrypted so if you

1261
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,509
can get man in the middle or get

1262
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,040
somewhere we can sniff that traffic you

1263
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:46,440
can listen you can listen in for it and

1264
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,520
just you know pull grits out of the air

1265
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,320
like I mentioned before and if you can

1266
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,420
steal amount of config files or four

1267
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,130
people's FTP scripts or key pass

1268
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:57,640
documents things like that you could

1269
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:59,470
fish them social engineering feel young

1270
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,819
the mainframe hacking researcher

1271
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:03,370
mentioned before has a tool called

1272
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,750
set and 3270 which is like social

1273
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:06,400
engineering toolkit where you can

1274
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:09,190
actually like man in the middle someone

1275
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,990
and put up a safety and 3217 like vtm

1276
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:14,110
login prompt and then fish infer

1277
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:15,520
credentials that way reuse is always a

1278
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:17,200
big thing because like i worked at

1279
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,360
companies where we had crept password

1280
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,560
requirements because it was lowest

1281
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,150
common denominator because they were

1282
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,070
syncing passwords between 80 and the

1283
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:25,600
mainframe so your password had like

1284
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:28,210
stupid requirements like it couldn't be

1285
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,279
longer than 8 characters it could only

1286
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:32,890
have like exclamation point ampersand

1287
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,570
and pound as the special symbol special

1288
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:36,790
characters and almost allowed things

1289
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:38,440
like that so check that if they're a TD

1290
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:39,700
pass if you've fished them in Windows

1291
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,130
creds and they look like it might fit

1292
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,919
the racket format try them out it might

1293
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:46,990
it might be syncing them you can route

1294
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,210
them but be very cautious because by

1295
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:51,040
default there's no lock out on

1296
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:52,150
mainframes but pretty much everyone has

1297
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,130
said it and it's usually pretty

1298
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,930
aggressive it's like three bad tries or

1299
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:57,490
five bad tries and you're locked out and

1300
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:59,259
it's not like windows where you can

1301
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:01,600
spray if you can try like one every

1302
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:03,730
couple hours and you know the lockout

1303
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,830
threshold reset after a while it's like

1304
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:07,270
if you do three bad times it's done

1305
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:09,009
you're locked you have to go get us this

1306
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:10,960
probably let you back in so if you're

1307
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:14,910
going to spray you have to be very very

1308
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,910
you can only do it like once or twice

1309
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:25,240
don't know l olam so oh if you miss

1310
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:26,800
Debra if you have to like go to like the

1311
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:29,500
physical terminal on the thing you go to

1312
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:32,440
the user service account but unlock it

1313
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:34,840
if it's that bad I guess and also that

1314
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,940
does apply to it SSH and FTP there's no

1315
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:39,460
loophole around that three bad attempts

1316
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:41,260
different logins SSH on the unit side it

1317
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:43,690
talks to rag if it locks you out

1318
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,770
so I even tried that to see if maybe I

1319
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,900
could get around it or even if you're

1320
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:49,120
logged in trying to do s you to switch

1321
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,710
to a different user same story three man

1322
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,350
attempts lockdown or here or whatever

1323
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:54,990
their policy set to so brute with

1324
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:57,640
caution

1325
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:59,890
so once you have targets and you know

1326
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,540
run detailed scans there's some

1327
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:04,930
enumeration options Phil Young has

1328
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:07,509
produced tons of net and map scripts for

1329
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:09,790
things like we're forcing all the vtm

1330
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:11,890
application IDs figuring out logical

1331
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:13,360
units which there's some trickery there

1332
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:15,430
you can't use logic means to be like

1333
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,900
having a session hijacking thing I'm not

1334
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,879
really gonna go into that but that's one

1335
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:22,960
thing you can do is look for those kicks

1336
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:25,000
transaction IDs TSO user ids TSO is nice

1337
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,560
enough to tell you if a username is

1338
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,970
valid or not I guess I mean that's where

1339
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,799
Microsoft got the idea of you know

1340
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:33,399
because if you have Windows stuff you

1341
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:35,020
know that like exchange and office 365

1342
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,050
are really nice and telling you that you

1343
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:39,520
know username is valid so TSO will tell

1344
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:41,740
you if username isn't good so it's very

1345
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,240
easy to enumerate usernames you can do

1346
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,770
that with scripts as let me just do the

1347
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,970
username a donator password you're fine

1348
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:48,160
you can just do that forever you will

1349
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:49,419
walk anybody out it only Ellie a lock

1350
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:53,740
someone out if you actually attempt to

1351
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:56,680
send a password so if you've got creds

1352
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:57,520
by this point just try logging in now

1353
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,129
there's one caveat

1354
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,020
some users my family have access to TSO

1355
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:04,270
or they might only have access to unix

1356
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:07,870
but not both and we'll see that scenario

1357
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:10,390
in the video the TSO is also nice enough

1358
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:13,029
to let let you know that your user ID is

1359
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:14,290
already logged in so if you enter it and

1360
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:16,360
it tells like oh you can't come in

1361
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:17,770
somebody's already logged in as you then

1362
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,300
you know they're on there but by the

1363
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:20,560
same token if you're logged in with

1364
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,450
their account and they try to log in

1365
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,250
they can see that somebody else that

1366
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:26,319
you're you know occupying their space

1367
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:27,640
so upstate consideration right there so

1368
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,780
you know it might affect like when you

1369
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,670
operate you might have to do stuff at

1370
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:33,550
night so you're not you know stepping on

1371
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:36,099
the toes abusers an SSH or FTP allows

1372
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:37,480
multiple logins as the same user so it's

1373
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:40,119
a little stealthier that way so if they

1374
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,040
do have access to both just do SSH

1375
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:43,510
they won't immediately but figure out

1376
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,930
that you're logged on that they come

1377
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:49,240
along later and try to get it so FTP is

1378
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:52,480
interesting on z/os because you can

1379
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:54,970
actually run JCL and SQL jobs from ftp

1380
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,830
by just uploading a clock which yeah

1381
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:59,290
sorry CT is a service it's very very

1382
00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:01,210
Canadian time so we'll use that later

1383
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:03,369
and in the video to actually get a

1384
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:04,660
foothold on a server and then there's

1385
00:52:03,369 --> 00:52:07,030
another there's some other options you

1386
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:08,410
have voice you have that they've written

1387
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:11,380
Metasploit modules in order to get

1388
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:13,149
shells through this there's lots of

1389
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:17,980
tools out there from filio and chatter

1390
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:19,960
because researchers in this area so once

1391
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:22,810
you get in and Genki is a network job

1392
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:25,030
entry so this is a way for people to

1393
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:26,740
submit jobs to different help ours or

1394
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:30,220
the different sis places coming you know

1395
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:32,439
I can take my user ID and just submit a

1396
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:34,000
job somewhere else so this port is open

1397
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,430
by default all you have to do is you

1398
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,530
have to know like the node name and then

1399
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:43,390
like a valid user name on the Box you

1400
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:45,220
can just submit jobs and also if there

1401
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:46,569
is usually enumerable because the njtv

1402
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,359
protocol will tell you with a node name

1403
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:51,490
is valid or not you can require it to

1404
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:53,348
set a password but it's a static data

1405
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:55,390
for everybody and it's very easy to bird

1406
00:52:53,349 --> 00:52:57,490
has no lockout threshold and then also

1407
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:59,259
if you break into one box you can go

1408
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:00,848
find that password and if in fig file in

1409
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,470
plaintext and you're just gonna use it

1410
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:04,510
to like log into every node that it's

1411
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:07,629
connected to so it makes loud movement

1412
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:08,619
very easy other reason njd kicks is

1413
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:10,150
another one where you usually need some

1414
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:12,130
kind of credits to log in to kids and

1415
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:13,990
there's lots of options that they have

1416
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,460
these very bad transactions and natives

1417
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:17,379
I will let you get shells and do all

1418
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:24,430
codes and stuff which I can't we going

1419
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:27,460
to but it's a topic to itself okay all

1420
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:28,720
right so web servers um web servers are

1421
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,310
always running on usually running on the

1422
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,049
UNIX side so just treat them like any

1423
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:33,019
web server try an ecto try to actually

1424
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:35,419
drew for saying

1425
00:53:33,019 --> 00:53:37,519
like that WebSphere and Tomcat are

1426
00:53:35,419 --> 00:53:39,169
common and the st. Patrick's apply if

1427
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:41,089
you can get into Tomcat you can upload a

1428
00:53:39,169 --> 00:53:42,558
job a war file and give yourself a good

1429
00:53:41,089 --> 00:53:44,899
job a shell

1430
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,159
older ones have crappy like CGI absolute

1431
00:53:44,899 --> 00:53:50,049
command injection and that's actually

1432
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:53,390
alchemy Hakata was able to hack logica

1433
00:53:50,049 --> 00:53:54,349
db2 is also on the mainframe i think

1434
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:55,759
this one needs a lot more attention

1435
00:53:54,349 --> 00:53:57,890
because i haven't found much stuff about

1436
00:53:55,759 --> 00:54:01,099
hacking db2 messing with like stored

1437
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:03,229
procedures and stuff i would love to do

1438
00:54:01,099 --> 00:54:04,429
more maven research but my comfort

1439
00:54:03,229 --> 00:54:07,489
company can't afford that

1440
00:54:04,429 --> 00:54:09,199
cuz they're just too damn expensive but

1441
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:10,519
if your company does and you want to get

1442
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:12,409
into this space that's a great place to

1443
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:14,508
look and do some researches look at the

1444
00:54:12,409 --> 00:54:15,829
integrity and there's other old suit in

1445
00:54:14,509 --> 00:54:17,749
Secours that you may find you might find

1446
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:19,609
network file shares we might find our

1447
00:54:17,749 --> 00:54:24,589
login still working on some places

1448
00:54:19,609 --> 00:54:25,819
oh so once you're in you might be able

1449
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:27,469
to stop right there you might not need

1450
00:54:25,819 --> 00:54:28,969
to get special because like anything

1451
00:54:27,469 --> 00:54:31,159
just check and see what you have access

1452
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:32,929
to you if you're just if you're on a

1453
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:34,159
more realistic mission you know you're

1454
00:54:32,929 --> 00:54:36,140
trying to break into the mainframe and

1455
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:37,579
grab sensitive data either you've

1456
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,709
compromised muttering you habit it might

1457
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:41,119
not be have special permissions you know

1458
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:43,698
which is basically like practice version

1459
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,929
of like having rude which might not need

1460
00:54:43,699 --> 00:54:47,630
it they might already have access to the

1461
00:54:44,929 --> 00:54:49,609
stuff you want like any time any like

1462
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:52,429
any been test once you're in a new ring

1463
00:54:49,609 --> 00:54:54,078
soon or um there's some great scripts

1464
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:55,880
inu is a great script to show you like

1465
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,989
all kinds of jobs you have access to or

1466
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:02,449
different types of files that may be

1467
00:54:56,989 --> 00:55:04,729
exploitable free to prove ask okay so a

1468
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:06,979
little pro tip for navigating around the

1469
00:55:04,729 --> 00:55:09,589
mainframe is for exfilling

1470
00:55:06,979 --> 00:55:11,928
ftp works really well alright secure

1471
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:14,089
copy works well and then it was that IMG

1472
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:16,399
file which is actually 18:37 using

1473
00:55:14,089 --> 00:55:19,279
built-in File Transfer Protocol that

1474
00:55:16,399 --> 00:55:21,439
works well SFTP does not I've had

1475
00:55:19,279 --> 00:55:22,969
terrible luck with St SMTP screwing up

1476
00:55:21,439 --> 00:55:25,009
trying to translate that's addicted to a

1477
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:30,529
skin bag report but for some reason that

1478
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:31,809
CV words I really don't know why there

1479
00:55:30,529 --> 00:55:33,739
we go okay

1480
00:55:31,809 --> 00:55:34,999
boon obviously if you've gotten this far

1481
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:36,079
word you want to get special right you

1482
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:37,729
want to hone them you want to get the

1483
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,309
equivalent of leg domain admin in the

1484
00:55:37,729 --> 00:55:42,319
mainframe wall so the MDS ID has some

1485
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:44,199
unique privacy options that are very

1486
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:47,150
unlike what you'll find anywhere else so

1487
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:49,430
one thing you can do is you can check

1488
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:51,200
about to see if they have the people the

1489
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:53,299
default super user enable which is IBM

1490
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,430
user usually as a bus password of sis

1491
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:58,400
one but you're probably not gonna find

1492
00:55:55,430 --> 00:56:00,529
that he's almost always disabled there

1493
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:04,010
her JCL surrogate profiles which which

1494
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:06,440
certain profiles let you submit jobs as

1495
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:07,580
another user so maybe you know the cysts

1496
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,870
products tired of being bugged by

1497
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,100
something you needed to submit a job for

1498
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,600
him with these special permissions so

1499
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,830
he's like I fine I was just surrogate so

1500
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,600
you can always submit this job as means

1501
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:16,220
well obviously if that person you can

1502
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,080
submit as you'll have elevated

1503
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,520
permissions you can exploit that to like

1504
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,150
you know change your own permissions

1505
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,650
give yourself a shell as that person etc

1506
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:26,990
there's also what they call supervisor

1507
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:29,480
calls and certain bed badly Rick ones

1508
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:30,919
are called magic supervisor calls but

1509
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,900
there are a type of like customized

1510
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,300
system call in in the mainframe lengths

1511
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,980
guts that lets you execute code in

1512
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:40,490
supervisor state which is basically like

1513
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:41,810
ring 0 so cos like I said very have the

1514
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:43,939
customizable even let you customize

1515
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:46,279
these like deep level system calls and

1516
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:47,810
so it's not uncommon to still find

1517
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,340
places where they had these really bad

1518
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:52,100
ones that are just like let you do

1519
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:53,510
anything I get the impression a lot of

1520
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,710
Isis ever route of those out we got rid

1521
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,960
of them and have much better security

1522
00:56:54,710 --> 00:57:00,890
but their scripts and stuff to be able

1523
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:04,970
to look for these magic s pcs and then

1524
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:06,920
there's also EPF operas libraries so a

1525
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:08,990
PDF scans for opera program facility and

1526
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:11,000
these APF libraries there are

1527
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:13,490
partitioned data sets that contain

1528
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,100
binaries that can roam kind of run code

1529
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:17,359
and supervisor state it's kinda like set

1530
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,610
UID in Linux world

1531
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:21,680
well like anybody can run it you know

1532
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:23,930
run kind surrogate like on behalf of the

1533
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,299
you know at an elevated level or elegans

1534
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:28,100
route the problem is is that a lot of

1535
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:30,200
times developers were putting lost up in

1536
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:33,440
these PDS these petitioned datasets to

1537
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:35,689
distribute them and maybe only one data

1538
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,950
set in that PDS really needs the EPF

1539
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:39,470
authorization to be able to do this

1540
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:40,819
elevated task but you can't set it at a

1541
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:42,560
granular level like that you have to

1542
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:44,630
blast the whole PDS and make an EPS

1543
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,890
authorized so they'll just do that and

1544
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:48,020
give you the whole thing and then maybe

1545
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:49,609
one of the files in there like you have

1546
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:51,500
ultra access to and be able to customize

1547
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:56,150
it and then you can just blast it and

1548
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:57,890
give yourself that now privilege from

1549
00:57:56,150 --> 00:58:00,290
the legislation on UNIX there's only a

1550
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:01,609
little more complicated because the

1551
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:03,440
usual

1552
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:05,000
all work here all the stuff you've done

1553
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,950
before to get written like Linux and

1554
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,740
UNIX stuff works you know abusing set

1555
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:12,109
you IDs that if they have studio bad

1556
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:14,359
pseudo permissions things like that but

1557
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:18,050
the problem is is they're owning USS

1558
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:19,550
does not mean you own MDS if your route

1559
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:21,800
on the UNIX side you're like you know

1560
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,780
you're the king there but like you still

1561
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,970
don't have permissions on the MDS side

1562
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:27,290
you're still screwed on that point right

1563
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:29,450
guy still controls all the user accounts

1564
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:31,279
even when you're rude so yeah you can

1565
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:33,049
pop your own USS but that doesn't give

1566
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,670
you special permissions or anything over

1567
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:37,850
a vsi you'll have to find other ways to

1568
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:40,850
get it which I'll show you one there are

1569
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:42,620
other ways around that the one I won't

1570
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:45,410
show you is there are actually also PDF

1571
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:47,120
authorized binaries in UNIX Chadwick and

1572
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:49,580
rude another big mainframe researcher is

1573
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,839
doing some work on that I've been

1574
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:53,090
bugging him when he's going to publish

1575
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:55,640
his stuff because the APF stuff is very

1576
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:57,320
well documented on the MDS side but not

1577
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,180
on the UNIX side so he has some like

1578
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,740
tricks for how to like abused EPF

1579
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:02,149
binaries on UNIX in order to give

1580
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:04,609
yourself like totally win each other

1581
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:07,120
game great but yeah watch that space

1582
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:08,930
it's it's still becoming me sometimes

1583
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:11,600
but what I'm going to show you actually

1584
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:15,890
is back toward Yoda the SIS cards

1585
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:17,390
account with SSH keys so a little bit

1586
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:18,230
about lateral movement once you get on

1587
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:22,730
and say you've got sufficient

1588
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:24,920
permissions just like on Windows or on

1589
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:26,750
Linux you can just dump the password

1590
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,280
database and start cracking so you

1591
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:31,010
remember there are very community up to

1592
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,450
bail they'll tell you where the raif

1593
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:34,850
database is what the name of that data

1594
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:36,290
set is and then you can you figure out

1595
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:37,850
the right permissions you know if you've

1596
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:39,620
elevated or sometimes they have bad

1597
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:41,270
permissions set on for the beginning you

1598
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:43,040
can next fill it and then go out

1599
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:47,690
cracking passwords do all that kind of

1600
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:50,180
nasty stuff John the Ripper understands

1601
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:52,730
rack F so it's trivial to crack those

1602
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:54,140
passwords also helps if it's an older is

1603
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:55,550
you know if it's one of those places

1604
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:59,660
that still only has like eight character

1605
00:59:55,550 --> 01:00:01,880
passwords okay also like I mentioned

1606
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:04,310
before you can also use nje because that

1607
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:05,960
passwords shared between all these users

1608
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:08,060
so if you get on one box with using the

1609
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,940
JD you can go that config file it's

1610
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:13,700
usually like sis one harm Lib is the PDS

1611
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:14,590
and it's a just two parm data set will

1612
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,480
have that password

1613
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:20,520
your text so you can use that you use NJ

1614
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:22,750
need to just go hop around the sysplex

1615
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:26,950
and now I'm going to show you a little

1616
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:36,400
hacking demo here showing how you can go

1617
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:38,020
from very few permissions to owning okay

1618
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:42,490
so I got two windows open I've got a

1619
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:49,180
UNIX window and I've got a tea and 3017

1620
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:50,680
window okay so this is a different

1621
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:52,480
mainframe than the mask of mainframe one

1622
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,419
I'm gonna connect it so I'm gonna try to

1623
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:57,790
log on is ease I'm trying to my password

1624
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:59,890
this is my password okay butt kicks p.m.

1625
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:02,440
says default account numbers could not

1626
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:04,180
be obtained so basically what it is is I

1627
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:07,000
don't have TSO permissions I'm not

1628
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:11,669
allowed to log into TSO but it's a balun

1629
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:19,270
cam okay this how about you are eunuchs

1630
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:21,400
so I try to SSH is eve so there goes its

1631
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:25,660
before I pass for a minute okay check

1632
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:26,050
the password in um vision 9 deny deny

1633
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:29,140
deny

1634
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:30,360
okay looks like you doesn't have you

1635
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:35,680
guys expirations either

1636
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:38,350
what about FTP though hey okay Eve good

1637
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:40,600
password in hey you can log into FTB all

1638
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:44,950
right so what's over here

1639
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:49,089
so here I'm on the MVS side of of FTP oh

1640
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:51,370
no sorry yes sir this is it okay so I

1641
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:54,310
started off over on the MVS side so you

1642
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:55,779
see my ABS data says but I can do CD to

1643
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:57,759
my home directory start a new slash user

1644
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:59,530
slash ease so it's each home director in

1645
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,610
UNIX and so now I can list there and I

1646
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:01,810
don't have anything in there right now

1647
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:05,260
but now I'm over on the UNIX filesystem

1648
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:06,549
side and then I'm a switch over this tab

1649
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:08,500
where I had Metasploit running and

1650
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:10,390
here's that memory I remember how I

1651
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:12,610
mentioned the JCL you can just submit

1652
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:15,069
JCL jobs on ftp and they'll run well

1653
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:16,330
this will do that to give me a show so

1654
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:23,020
I'm going to go around this handy-dandy

1655
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:25,600
little mess plate module so options here

1656
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:28,190
I've set all the options so I made it

1657
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:29,720
makes a little JCL car put some

1658
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:31,849
yes and all the fields and stuff like

1659
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:42,078
that to make your on someone go ahead

1660
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:44,990
and submit that run started reverse TCP

1661
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:48,680
handler it's actually connected all

1662
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:51,109
right so I have a mainframe UNIX session

1663
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:53,450
so there are an IDE and I can see if my

1664
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:56,119
units ID I grab passed print working

1665
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:57,828
directory see there and I have anything

1666
01:02:56,119 --> 01:03:01,700
about directories that the shell history

1667
01:02:57,829 --> 01:03:04,010
file so what I'm going to do is a

1668
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:06,500
classical tactic which is when you're on

1669
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:07,790
a box you looking to prove s I'm just

1670
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:10,280
gonna run fine I'm gonna look for

1671
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:14,839
everything with set UID permissions on

1672
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:18,140
it so I run that and I'm gonna see some

1673
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:19,759
stuff come back well this interesting

1674
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:21,710
one now this is inaccurate I did this

1675
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:24,829
with a person demonstration but the the

1676
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:26,839
find binary actually has citywide

1677
01:03:24,829 --> 01:03:29,390
operations it runs in route context over

1678
01:03:26,839 --> 01:03:30,920
who's using it so I did that just for

1679
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:32,299
the purpose of demonstration so I'm just

1680
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:34,520
gonna do an old trick you find that they

1681
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:36,290
feel if you seen it before if like

1682
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:38,240
people let people run find with pseudo

1683
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:40,430
or something you can abuse that to give

1684
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:43,899
yourself an elevated shell so I run the

1685
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:48,740
find command yeah the hotel to execute

1686
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:50,869
bin slash SAH to give us up shell and

1687
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:52,549
there now I have a shell is now I'm

1688
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:55,550
still as EE but you can see I have the

1689
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:58,030
extended UID as 0 which in this context

1690
01:03:55,550 --> 01:04:00,530
they call it start to or sis sis 1

1691
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:02,510
instead of route but it's UID 0 so it's

1692
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:05,150
word now if you just run the SU command

1693
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:06,410
and then give myself like proper rude so

1694
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:09,200
I'll run idea again you can see that

1695
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:13,009
that's my proper UID now as I start to

1696
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:14,839
this context now I'm going to run SSH

1697
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:16,460
key Jen and I'm gonna fast-forward a

1698
01:04:14,839 --> 01:04:18,049
little bit because this was an emulated

1699
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:22,130
mainframe and it took all the long ass

1700
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:26,780
time for this sh t to generate okay

1701
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:29,500
there we go ok so as we went on name it

1702
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,500
so I'm gonna give it a name

1703
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:34,839
I um I've got to get a beer or something

1704
01:04:38,849 --> 01:04:45,150
okay one more name it test word now oh

1705
01:04:48,329 --> 01:04:58,510
okay I just so they'll last nice you

1706
01:04:56,829 --> 01:05:03,339
have my key files but my key nyan in my

1707
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:05,859
public key so one trick here is that a

1708
01:05:03,339 --> 01:05:08,170
lot of times Prague's even though since

1709
01:05:05,859 --> 01:05:10,000
frogs usually have su permissions they

1710
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:11,710
can just issue the room they're so lazy

1711
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,349
that on the UNIX side they'll just give

1712
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:17,410
themselves the UID of 0 so that they

1713
01:05:14,349 --> 01:05:20,500
don't even have to use that's you so so

1714
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:22,089
in this instance it's very easy now if

1715
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,920
I've done some recon and I know what

1716
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:25,690
what usernames are the mainframe map to

1717
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,819
which users I can figure ok I know that

1718
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:29,740
Bob Smith is sis Prague I know it's

1719
01:05:27,819 --> 01:05:31,299
username so I know if I go get him I'll

1720
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:33,609
probably you know I'll be privy to root

1721
01:05:31,299 --> 01:05:34,779
on the unit side well a lot of times

1722
01:05:33,609 --> 01:05:36,700
they make it easy for you because you

1723
01:05:34,779 --> 01:05:38,200
just like you use like that write script

1724
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:40,000
I show before the prints all the UNIX

1725
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:44,470
users and you just look for all the guys

1726
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:46,750
that have 0 if their UID cuz up multiple

1727
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:47,890
level we'll just set it 0 so there we go

1728
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:57,160
I pulled down my keys

1729
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:58,680
oh okay yeah I pulled down the keys here

1730
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:01,538
[Applause]

1731
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:06,759
now I'm gonna CD into Bob's directory

1732
01:06:01,539 --> 01:06:11,230
2nd Bob's assist Pro so I'm gonna CD

1733
01:06:06,759 --> 01:06:13,059
into it says the state's directory there

1734
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:16,089
again old backdoor trick this is my sole

1735
01:06:13,059 --> 01:06:17,319
contribution to mainframe hacking this

1736
01:06:16,089 --> 01:06:19,480
was actually technique another like

1737
01:06:17,319 --> 01:06:20,710
filler contributor shed or sorry

1738
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:23,319
filly gone rich he had reconfigured

1739
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:25,059
reins those guys knew about so yes he's

1740
01:06:23,319 --> 01:06:26,079
authorized keys he's got this public key

1741
01:06:25,059 --> 01:06:28,089
in there so that you know you can use

1742
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:30,789
this key file to SSH into the mainframe

1743
01:06:28,089 --> 01:06:35,349
and so I'm just gonna take my public key

1744
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:40,349
and add to his authorized keys there we

1745
01:06:35,349 --> 01:06:43,890
go ok I bet make sure it wrote correctly

1746
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:43,890
it's all depended on

1747
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:04,260
very deep in there eventually I'll get

1748
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:04,890
out there we go okay so I exited out

1749
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:08,160
that session

1750
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:11,520
now I might SSH I already pulled down

1751
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:12,990
that key file with FTP so set the

1752
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,610
permissions on that key file correctly

1753
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:16,439
so that SSH doesn't yell at me and now

1754
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:18,570
an SSH in use that key file and I'm

1755
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:28,110
gonna do Bob at the idea dress of my

1756
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:35,100
mainframe and bam I'm in his Bob not

1757
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:37,560
only that but bob has he has special

1758
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:40,110
permission to see special and operations

1759
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:41,580
meaning he can he can change any

1760
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:42,240
permissions and he can do any file

1761
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:46,110
operation

1762
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:47,910
so bob is god over on the MDS side and

1763
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:55,200
now i just got access to that without

1764
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:57,180
having to know Bob's password so here I

1765
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,189
can list out east stuff and I see Eve

1766
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:01,140
has no attributes she does not have

1767
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:05,670
special or operations she's just a lowly

1768
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:08,819
you know nobody what I can do is I'm

1769
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:10,770
gonna run a little file here post

1770
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:12,120
exploitation shell script if u see my

1771
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:14,670
comment I said it's because I'm too lazy

1772
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:16,140
to rememorize all these commands so this

1773
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:17,910
is just a shell script that's just going

1774
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:20,670
to run the TSO command do a bunch of

1775
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:23,278
stuff to give Eve all these elevated

1776
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:27,180
permissions so it finishes and now if I

1777
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:29,580
run TSO command Leu Eve now I see that

1778
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:32,730
she does have special permissions

1779
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:36,390
everything right there so now Eve has

1780
01:08:32,729 --> 01:08:38,459
excess also part of that script I gave

1781
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:41,400
you the ability to log it over to use oh

1782
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:43,200
so I'll go back to R so you did volumes

1783
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:45,179
CSO so I'll go back to T and 3270 now

1784
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:56,858
IDs password and now she can jump right

1785
01:08:45,180 --> 01:09:06,279
into the mainframe and that's it alright

1786
01:08:56,859 --> 01:09:08,460
Oh enemies wandering my background is

1787
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:11,980
from an anime called sword art online

1788
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:15,009
which it's about like a it's about like

1789
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:16,568
a online video or something the computer

1790
01:09:15,009 --> 01:09:23,830
that runs the video game of the anime is

1791
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:25,060
mobile app Turkey an IBM so how can I

1792
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:28,330
start learning about mainframes other

1793
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:29,710
than attending this talk first thing you

1794
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:31,809
only need is you're going to need your

1795
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:34,240
own mainframe so if your company will

1796
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:36,370
let you do it use their mainframes if

1797
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:38,080
not IBM actually offers an official

1798
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:41,170
mainframe emulation package called ZD

1799
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:44,170
and T it is unfortunately very expensive

1800
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:45,549
and it's more so if you're a not an eidm

1801
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:48,370
customer which is why unfortunately my

1802
01:09:45,549 --> 01:09:50,410
company can't afford it we're not we

1803
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:51,818
don't buy an ad for IBM and it would

1804
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:53,858
just be prohibitively expensive to start

1805
01:09:51,819 --> 01:09:55,060
a contract with them but if you're at a

1806
01:09:53,859 --> 01:09:56,650
company that does and we just kind of

1807
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:59,860
research it's not too bad if you're

1808
01:09:56,650 --> 01:10:01,540
reading a contract there's also the

1809
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:03,490
i-beam mask of mainframe competition

1810
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:03,970
which I showed you it runs most of the

1811
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,769
year

1812
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:07,510
it's made for students but you can

1813
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:09,070
register anybody can register you just

1814
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:11,590
want me eligible for like the prizes and

1815
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:12,880
stuff they give out and it operates most

1816
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:14,350
of the year there'll be a few months

1817
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,790
when it'll go down and then they'll have

1818
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:18,370
to read register they'll bring it back

1819
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:19,840
up you can't hack on it but it's a nice

1820
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:21,250
way just to get on and they have some

1821
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,230
nice tutorials we'll just teach you how

1822
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:25,900
to use the mainframe their eyes are soft

1823
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:27,610
with it I also recommend just using the

1824
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:29,410
UNIX side if you're just more accustomed

1825
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:30,910
to Linux it's an easier way to kind of

1826
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:34,059
ease into the mainframe because you

1827
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:35,889
won't get lost so quickly another option

1828
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:39,430
is you can use Hercules which is an

1829
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:41,350
open-source mainframe emulator IBM hates

1830
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:45,520
Hercules as my little meme over there

1831
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:47,890
shows now the guy that currently he's

1832
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,900
not the guy who first wrote it but the

1833
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:51,550
current maintainer is J Maynard who old

1834
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:53,589
herein and heads will remember as Tron

1835
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:54,820
guy I think he's still around going to

1836
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:57,880
conventions and stuff he's the main

1837
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:59,469
maintainer of the Hercules project IBM

1838
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,930
kind of has a reason to hate Hercules

1839
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:04,060
like I guess like IBM custom employees

1840
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:05,200
are forbidden to use it and part of the

1841
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,750
reason is is because the original guy

1842
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:09,750
that wrote Hercules tried to set it up

1843
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:11,070
as a company and

1844
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:13,770
then what he tried to do is he tried to

1845
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:15,210
sue IBM into open sourcing z/os so they

1846
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,830
equally undercut their business but I

1847
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:18,810
like offering virtualized mainframes for

1848
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:20,910
cheaper and so like he lost his lawsuit

1849
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:24,720
and my IBM like they argue leads to a

1850
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:26,070
passion so the legal way is because main

1851
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,720
things are so old they're actually

1852
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:29,190
versions of the old MVS operating system

1853
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:31,370
that have laughed at the public domain

1854
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:34,080
and there's a couple of like hobbyist

1855
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:36,630
distros of them floating around like TK

1856
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:41,070
4 - is a very popular one that you can

1857
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:42,900
run it and the S is public domain but a

1858
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:44,370
lot of the stuff in it isn't so like

1859
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:47,250
they've had to write replacements for

1860
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:48,930
ispf and some of the programs and stuff

1861
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,920
like that but it's another good way to

1862
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:52,740
tell you these want to familiarize

1863
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,480
yourself with it or run your own fee not

1864
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:56,700
so legal way is to go on a torrent team

1865
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:59,129
site like Pirate Bay I'm like anakata

1866
01:11:56,700 --> 01:12:01,980
used to run and find yourself a dump of

1867
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:04,770
a legit cos install they're still

1868
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:07,200
floating around there honorable mention

1869
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:09,270
goes to zero as DF globe.com

1870
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:11,940
which is some strange company like it

1871
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:13,950
based in Canada and China that has like

1872
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:15,990
a public mainframe you can get access to

1873
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:19,710
I've never really used it but I'll just

1874
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:20,670
throw it out there with it the next

1875
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:22,010
thing you'll need this a terminal

1876
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:24,870
emulator which you have a couple options

1877
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:26,880
the one I use the most is X 30 to 70

1878
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:29,580
there's also C 30 to 70 which will run

1879
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,710
in a terminal and on Linux Mac it'll

1880
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:35,190
wreck inside

1881
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:38,070
wsl on windows there's a their paid

1882
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:39,780
options for mac and windows - there used

1883
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:42,570
to be another free one called teen 3G

1884
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:44,940
sending X for Mac but it just lapsed

1885
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:47,549
I'll support because catallena the

1886
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:49,980
newest version of Mac OS finally got rid

1887
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:51,660
of support for 32-bit binaries and this

1888
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:54,059
little team 30 to 70 X program added

1889
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:54,930
updates it's like 2013 so it doesn't

1890
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,490
work anymore

1891
01:12:54,930 --> 01:13:00,780
but next for you - something works great

1892
01:12:56,490 --> 01:13:02,490
you seen it to download X course and

1893
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:05,370
actually Vista team 32 so it needs a

1894
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:06,990
nice little program you can actually use

1895
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:08,670
it for free with the student license if

1896
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:11,150
you sign up for massive main break like

1897
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:13,050
a good student license to use it and

1898
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:15,929
then if you want some more resources

1899
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:17,820
here starter break stuff obviously my

1900
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:19,740
blog has some things master mainframe

1901
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:20,490
there's links to the tutorials and how

1902
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:23,040
to register

1903
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:23,429
IBM has tons of their documentation and

1904
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,130
stuff

1905
01:13:23,429 --> 01:13:27,449
you download PDFs of their red book

1906
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:30,059
series which will give you lots of

1907
01:13:27,449 --> 01:13:31,348
introductions to the mainframe if you

1908
01:13:30,059 --> 01:13:33,269
want to continue your mainframe hacking

1909
01:13:31,349 --> 01:13:35,789
learning I would HIGHLY highly recommend

1910
01:13:33,269 --> 01:13:37,650
Phil youngish a dripping Birds Eagle

1911
01:13:35,789 --> 01:13:39,360
mainframe course I went to the very

1912
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:42,570
first one that they offered in Charlotte

1913
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:44,969
and it's been done to recon they do in

1914
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:46,079
other places it's great it's a really

1915
01:13:44,969 --> 01:13:49,199
fun course they even have a mainframe

1916
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:50,699
CTF at the end which I really dig and

1917
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:52,049
then they also they actually gonna read

1918
01:13:50,699 --> 01:13:53,789
all that online material and our github

1919
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:55,829
page they have the slide deck on there

1920
01:13:53,789 --> 01:13:57,300
so you if there's no replacement for

1921
01:13:55,829 --> 01:13:58,650
