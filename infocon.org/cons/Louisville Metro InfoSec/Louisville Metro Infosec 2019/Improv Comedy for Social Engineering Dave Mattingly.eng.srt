been to an improv show in person of some

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,880
kind they're a lot of fun I like them I

43
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,548
I know I could not do stand-up that's

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,949
way too much pressure and memorizing and

45
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,379
how is this thing gonna be funny for for

46
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,829
everybody when they're all different and

47
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:16,969
that that is is really really are but

48
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:19,530
the improv is just a conversation

49
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:21,269
onstage with stuff that makes up it's

50
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,769
the things you do with the people that

51
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:30,829
sit around you all the time anyway you

52
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:30,829
know the the primary rule is yes Han

53
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,219
when you're an improv scene somebody

54
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,780
says oh well the building is on fire

55
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:40,918
what are we gonna do you can't decide

56
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,930
well no we're we're on a submarine no no

57
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,689
the building is on fire you have to join

58
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,239
what that's already been established yes

59
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:51,239
it is on fire and it's good thing we

60
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,549
have our more spell firing crossbows or

61
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,709
something yeah add something if you

62
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:59,879
accept what is there and then build on

63
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:03,209
it no idea gets shot down nothing is

64
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:07,469
wrong well they're all kind of wrong you

65
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:10,650
know but but that's the whole fun you

66
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:12,659
start by taking what you have at you

67
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,569
accept and that's one is to connect you

68
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:18,179
need to know who your audience is

69
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:22,379
if you know doing the improv in front of

70
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,909
a bunch of college students probably the

71
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:27,929
people might go different places that if

72
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:31,319
I was performing at a church or you know

73
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,090
at a RPV or something like that yeah I

74
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,369
know who you're talking to

75
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,370
nothing is never going to land with

76
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:43,189
everybody but you don't want to make

77
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:47,310
sure that nobody is gonna like it yeah

78
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:51,168
improv is is a team sport you need to

79
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:54,569
support your scene partner or partners

80
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:57,479
your partner comes up an idea wants to

81
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:59,159
you know help you carry this invisible

82
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,229
dejar app then you need to grab the

83
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:06,060
other end and help them carry the

84
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:08,579
invisible did drink having the improv

85
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,000
people split up in their their own

86
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:13,289
different things it's just been a

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,479
interview on the scene we do a lot easy

88
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:17,039
to use nobody's gonna have any time here

89
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:23,620
you're all they are doing the same thing

90
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:25,539
for some reason direct instead of just

91
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,620
I'm here and I'm talking you're sitting

92
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:29,080
there we're just talking back and forth

93
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:33,550
it's a lot more fun if we're moving if

94
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:36,430
we are building or doing or otherwise

95
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:40,990
making our bodies be parts of the scene

96
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:44,860
as well project and expect then this is

97
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:48,580
the the part that scares be follow the

98
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,630
fear as my final improv mentor a

99
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,948
appreciate soundtrack that's wonderful

100
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,990
[Laughter]

101
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:59,110
Mike improv coach always you say that

102
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:02,020
awesome is on the other side of fear so

103
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,389
yes it's scary when you think about it

104
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,150
or what you do it's the first time but

105
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:11,379
what it's done wow that was great

106
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:14,650
and the more you do it my comfort zone

107
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:18,969
will go from here to here to here you

108
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:22,029
get a little more used to it and maybe I

109
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:25,449
bomb myself that's fine it's all part of

110
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:27,430
life's respected you know and the sticks

111
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:29,949
are gifts there's a lot of times we'll

112
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,930
do something wrong well we'll get

113
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:35,620
somebody's name wrong or I'll forget

114
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:38,469
that we are in the getaway car and I

115
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,740
decided me to stop for a passenger or

116
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:44,440
something yeah let me do it wrong that's

117
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,550
just even funny people love it

118
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,949
especially your fellow improv performers

119
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:58,180
it it does sound scary but there are

120
00:05:50,949 --> 00:06:00,699
lots of ways to get involved there are

121
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:05,969
many ways to keep yourself keep your

122
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:09,159
brain fresh I had a stroke fifteen

123
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:10,990
sixteen years ago I had learned to walk

124
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:14,188
and talk again and things like this

125
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:17,710
helps make sure everything keeps firing

126
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:19,659
he keeps me thinking better which means

127
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:24,580
I can do all my other things a little

128
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:28,199
better there are in Louisville 3040

129
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:31,389
improv groups something like that

130
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:34,750
most nights of the week you can probably

131
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:36,529
find a five or ten to pick from click on

132
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,619
one check out

133
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:41,629
most of them are for general purpose in

134
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:43,609
problem but there are some that are

135
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:45,979
specialized though the hysterical x' is

136
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:49,089
an all-female troop because they're

137
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:53,119
funny plus the hysterical yep

138
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:56,179
that came from a biological that but

139
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:59,349
they're always a lot of fun there are

140
00:06:56,179 --> 00:07:01,489
other ways to keep yourself involved

141
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:05,299
creatively from a technical perspective

142
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:09,128
as well the 48 hour film project has

143
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:11,269
been happening for 20-some odd years

144
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,849
anybody ever worked on it we have a

145
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:16,069
release Bush we have two days to work on

146
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:20,029
my get this thing out it's like that

147
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:23,779
except you're making a film you get your

148
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:25,219
team together beforehand and you don't

149
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:28,879
know what you're gonna be doing so you

150
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:31,039
have to well what if we need a warehouse

151
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:34,039
why I know this thing out supporting us

152
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,259
we could make it genre film you're

153
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,628
making until you start on Friday you

154
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:40,639
draw it out of a hat you making a

155
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:45,369
musical or a silent film or a period

156
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,629
piece or time travel you get that

157
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:51,860
everybody has 48 hours to turn in a

158
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:54,619
finished film I've been in a few of

159
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:58,610
those they're always a huge they will

160
00:07:54,619 --> 00:08:01,129
show all these submissions at village 8

161
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,129
one of the local theaters the doggies

162
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:05,149
can vote and then the the organizers

163
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:07,519
help pick various winners things like

164
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:09,259
that but the other tricky is that

165
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,149

minute to play all right I have Horatio

193
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:42,589
Horatio would beat Cleopatra Pat Taney

194
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:44,660
or at poker or I figure skating and then

200
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:04,419
a car and as we're driving I have to

201
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,419
think I'll live at it

202
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:09,049
once upon a time as a car game you're

203
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:11,209
telling a story and you can interrupt a

204
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:12,529
little amma the card that says drag it

205
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:14,479
although you're doing this but then the

206
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,919
dragon shows up and you try to get out

207
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,730
of your cards first as you're telling

208
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:21,290
this common round-robin story word on

209

will tilt your mind stayed creativeness

213
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:35,239
you have to come up with answers a lot

214
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:37,488
one thing I like about say anything

215
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:39,649
there are a lot of of games that will

216
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:42,319
reward people who come with clever

217
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:44,089
answers in a lot of people a lot of

218
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:47,719
games will come up with people who are

219
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:50,089
good acts you know guessing a number or

220
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,709
reading people this is a little of both

221
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:57,049
I would draw a as judge around I'd say

222
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:58,910
in my opinion what it is and draw a card

223
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:01,309
another that's the best hair back or

224
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,180
something everybody would write

225
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:04,459
something

226
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,189
and I have to draw or I have to choose

227
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,810
among those which my favorite hair

228
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,270
babies it doesn't care what my I think

229
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:14,329
what I could pick from those than all of

230
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:16,280
you votes on what I picked so the person

231
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,320
that picked the one I guessed gets a

232
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,449
point and people who pick the one that

233
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:26,480
they thought I would pick also get so

234
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:28,640
pit Wars both kinds of players lots of

235
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,850
cool books to stimulate your creative

236
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:36,160
brain how would you move Mount Fuji this

237
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:38,780
is a a story interview question book

238
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,079
Microsoft and a lot of companies used to

239
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:44,810
use it might still use this as weird

240
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,400
interview questions just to see what

241
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:51,319
your thought processes and how would you

242
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:53,569
get to an answer how they make M&MS how

243
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,360
would you test a saltshaker counting

244
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:59,300
base negative to weird things like that

245
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,460
to keep your brain going several others

246
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:07,939
and I have links up on the site

247
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:12,260
Oh keep yourself created public speaking

248
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:14,240
at Toastmasters International I did that

249
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,760
for a very long time anybody ever been

250
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,820
to a Toastmasters meeting or or heard of

251
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,400
it it's a chance to practice public

252
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,570
speaking in front of other people who

253
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,400
are also trying to get better at public

254
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,710
speaking it's a very very friendly room

255
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,670
the nice thing is that you get instant

256
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:33,680
feedback from it everybody will write on

257
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,140
a little paper or you here's a comment

258
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,109
or note if they get it great so you get

259
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:41,630
no twenty little cool slips of a

260
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:44,180
feedback you haven't assigned evaluator

261
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,680
who says the goals of your particular

262
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,579
speech this time were to do this and

263
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,280
this and this

264
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,370
and you have a few paragraphs of written

265
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,720
v value then they also read out so

266
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,760
everybody else hears all of your

267
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,540
specific written feedback and can

268
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:03,080
improve their own speeches that we did

269
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:06,230
and they also have a people topic times

270
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:10,480
they call it the tabletop master will

271
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:14,900
call on people and ask them a question

272
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,810
you have one to two minutes to respond

273
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,850
that's a my time and it could be as

274
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,420
simple as what was your favorite

275
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,910
vacation or please describe the global

276
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,110
economy there's something like that you

277
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,790
never know what it's gonna be

278
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:34,100
which is nice play to make sure your

279
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:36,260
your brain gears are working the track

280
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,320
shut it spilled like pizza Kuja

281
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,210
pronounced muchacha is Japanese for

282
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,620
chitchat

283
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:48,380
it is a public speaking competition

284
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:50,630
what's the trick there is that your

285
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,350
slides autumn advance you have 20 slides

286
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:56,630
that paint on their own every 20 seconds

287
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,970
in Troopa talk to a style you don't even

288
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,170
see them there behind you you have to

289
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,800
know in your head you have to have the

290
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:05,870
rhythm it's very hard to do but if you

291
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:10,969
get you to one it is a thrilling

292
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:15,190
challenge and above all just go places

293
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:19,100
meet people learn things do stuff I I

294
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:20,330
dabble in a lot of different things I

295
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,640
still don't know what I want to do when

296
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,800
I grow a lot and there's just way too

297
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,060
much life out there for me to focus on

298
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,279
just one thing or two things

299
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,180

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:19,069
ball it's a little bigger it's it

330
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,420
wouldn't hurt as much if you already get

331
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,800
hit in the head it's a softball they do

332
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,079
this white ball then this is moral above

333
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,959
a kickball tight little squishy he has a

334
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,079
nice bounce to it basketball is kind of

335
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,890
I have a red ball and I'm going to throw

336
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:38,750
this as well to somebody

337
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:43,939
red ball he has a red ball you throw the

338
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:45,500
white ball I have a white ball you have

339
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:56,060
a red ball look somebody in the eye

340
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:57,560
throw them the red ball fine who's gonna

341
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,180
catch it look them in the eye when you

342
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:21,649
know they're ready for it then you can

343
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:22,750
throw the ball but it is very very light

344
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,140
is much like a beach

345
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,589
[Music]

346
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,820
because it's common color double our

347
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:31,250
this is not the kind of ball like that

348
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:34,070
waiting like like the white ball or

349
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,320
overseas if this one moves slowly in

350
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:43,189
Cabo on its own but it's also very easy

351
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:48,110
to catch the ball and I'm gonna throw

352
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:51,650
the blue ball there we go got it yeah I

353
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:54,610
got a big blue ball a banana so red and

354
00:17:51,650 --> 00:18:27,650
whites we keep on going this is the

355
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:29,659
first session of the day all right for

356
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,190
there's everybody hold on so so you know

357
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:35,090
where they are we able to lose them so

358
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:38,180
that they're hard to replace another

359
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,260
ball game that will sometimes do is to

360
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,360
get everybody in a circle we're not

361
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,650
gonna do that just now but we'll have

362
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,639
imaginary ball we just pass

363
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:49,280
person-to-person the trick is the ball

364
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,470
is made of whatever we want to be made

365
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,230
up so the ball might be made of

366
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,550
electricity and I give them that person

367
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,380
then they're carried the electric ball

368
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:02,540
and then give it to the next person and

369
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:04,070
we run around when it gets back to when

370
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,139
it gets back to the person before the

371
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,050
one who started they changes so now the

372
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:11,180
ball is made of tails

373
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:12,440
this is tickle ball of in this person

374
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:16,340
who's carrying a tickle ball and then

375
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,610
they give it you a lot of fun it's a

376
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,649
great way to Epsilon your co-workers to

377
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:24,399
impress your CEO possibly by giving a

378
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,400
tickle ball I don't know

379
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:31,660
but doing these things and besides the

380
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,770
improv groups who performed publicly

381
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:37,580
there are a lot of workshops improv jams

382
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:40,010
very informal

383
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:43,070
audience you just go and practice these

384
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:45,830
things with people in front 502 offers

385
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:48,080
one every week the alley theater used to

386
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:50,840
do it every week there they closed that

387
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,919
a while back the Bardstown occasionally

388
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,439
will do it like once a month haven't

389
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,630
improv Jam that's a great time if you've

390
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:03,500
never tried it before just to go and

391
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:07,700
practice so how does this interact with

392
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:10,220
social engineering any thoughts from

393
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,430
young as how this might help or Murph's

394
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:18,710
the ability to talk your way into or out

395
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:20,060
of something yes

396
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,690
you'll learn to come up with stuff

397
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:25,300
you're not waiting from a script if if

398
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,220
you're trying to break into a building

399
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,230
legally of course and the guard stops

400
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,390
using a lot I'm here to do this thing

401
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,530
didn't come up with that but he asked me

402
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:36,710
a question I wasn't prepared for

403
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:38,629
well obviously I'm here for this if you

404
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:41,480
have been doing this coming up with

405
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:45,100
weird answers off and on it is it really

406
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:50,120
as as scary to do to keep your composure

407
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:52,520
and it it comes off as a little more

408
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,370
sincere because you're not totally

409
00:20:52,520 --> 00:21:02,770
freaking out in nervous I'm just here to

410
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:02,770
fix the rubber thing how else

411
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,920
yeah well improv it it's not always

412
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,000
about making somebody laugh it's about

413
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,680
accepting you know the yes and another

414
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,010
reality well yeah yes yes I I am

415
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:18,410
supposed to have a badge and I will get

416
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:21,850
my badge because I'm a visitor my friend

417
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:24,710
is supposed to happen for me it's about

418
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:30,139
the more you do it the more natural it

419
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:34,570
all seems and feels it sounds scary but

420
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:37,520
it actually helps me to de-stress

421
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,710
anybody ever had an emergency at the

422
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,389
office oh no this thing is wrong what

423
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:47,600
are we gonna do this other thing it's

424
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:49,850
okay you know yesterday I was I was are

425
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,469
antics on a bicycle it's not a big deal

426
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:55,100
we'll just change this thing in

427
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:58,490
now it's alright the the outside

428
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:02,689
stresses don't seem as mere to me if I

429
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:06,380
make myself go through very low impacts

430
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:10,840
you know for for failure exercises it's

431
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:13,220
kind of a stress practice for me

432
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,740
anything could go wrong at the office or

433
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:19,250
in life or during travel but if I

434
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:22,990
practice weird funny terrible things a

435
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,990
lot they don't seem as bad

436
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:30,860
any other ideas on how this could help

437
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:36,500
with your social engineering techniques

438
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:37,209
a lot of ideas have to think on your

439
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:43,460
feet

440
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:46,010
mm-hmm yeah a big money to achieve an

441
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:49,940
answer regardless of what the question

442
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:51,770
is and it might be a wrong answer or a

443
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:55,039
stupid or silly answer

444
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:56,690
but you ever talk to a regular normal

445
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,720
person they got a wrong or stupid or

446
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:04,070
silly answer yeah happens to us all the

447
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:06,370
time but by not being freaked out about

448
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:09,320
being in a situation we're prepared for

449
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:12,610
it wasn't people help it's it's not as

450
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,610
as strange

451
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:24,770
let's try another good one for free

452
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:27,799
crowd that is well I'll give you another

453
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:31,010
one that we usually do get a circle it's

454
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:33,289
a great way to get to know people either

455
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,600
first thing that he does maybe you've

456
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:37,669
got ten people in a circle like Randy

457
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,219
volunteers if I want to come up and is

458
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:42,380
to be totally safe he's coming we're in

459
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:45,950

460
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:48,380
just lurking first names yeah come on up

461

00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:57,289
kind of keep an eye on us here a few

463
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:59,840
other folks Monaco it works best with

464
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:02,620
like six or more we get another couple

465
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,620
of volunteers up here

466
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:16,450

467
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,840
it to you over something no no no all

468

00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,949
because then you only really pay

492
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:41,889
attention the person next to you or

493
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:45,610
either side sometimes this is it cuts

494
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:47,200
around weird and then random you can

495
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,020
also use a word association kind of

496
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,360
thing that we're all in a circle I

497
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:55,090
picked something I picked the color blue

498
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:57,760
and I point to somebody and they say sky

499
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:00,668
and they point to somebody else we go

500
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,740
around so we've all picked something do

501
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:09,059
the same thing again you know blue then

502
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:11,710
sky work away around then I'll say blue

503
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:14,379
point person they'll say sky and while

504
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:16,600
that's happening I'll say Dave and I'll

505
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:19,990
point for Anthony

506
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:24,908
we have two different patterns our names

507
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:27,789
and our word associations going around a

508
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:33,309
very simple one but a great warm-up

509
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:36,190
improv exercise so looking at social

510
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:41,918
engineering and our rules we have yes

511
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:44,230
and whether you are doing a fishbone of

512
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,200
dish if you want to call out that this

513
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:49,360
makes a little more natural that aren't

514
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,970
you supposed to have that that code well

515
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,490
you can guess I am supposed to my

516
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:58,840
computer is rebooting right now and I'll

517
00:26:54,490 --> 00:27:01,690
have it in 20 30 seconds I think we

518
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:04,449
might be writing an email or texting

519
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:07,210
back and forth it might be in person

520
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,830
that I'm here to inspect the tapestries

521
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,330
I mean I'm here to look at your data

522
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,600
center to make sure there are no good

523
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:15,610
sex scrolling cards things like that

524
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,259
connecting you don't want to come up

525
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,269
with something that is weird for the

526
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:22,059
place that you were going into you or

527
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:25,929
that you're talking to if I'm trying to

528
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:27,730
get into a military base I probably

529
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:31,570
wouldn't come up with something weird

530
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:33,519
that I mind the new garbage man I'm here

531
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:37,960
to empty your dumpsters maybe I would do

532
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:41,320
that but it helps to know who you expect

533
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:46,120
to talk to and what kind of things they

534
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:48,850
are used to and they expect support your

535
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:51,758
partner if you have two people going in

536
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:56,559
working together you backed each other

537
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:59,340
up yeah I don't want to call Jim Joe

538
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:02,590
after I've called him Jim already

539
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:05,049
because we are obviously using aliases

540
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,730
because we belong here we aren't up

541
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:10,240
spirt where these people who work here

542
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:16,059
obviously you don't want to get your

543
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:18,549
your stories wrong midstream direct

544
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:21,879
focus on action if you are doing

545
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:24,220
something with your hands or I drop the

546
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:26,490
papers picking them up that will put the

547
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:28,809
focus on the thing that is happening

548
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:30,309
rather than looking you in the eye and

549
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:32,649
making you sweat

550
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:34,749
and wait a minute I thought yeah you're

551
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:37,359
not on those slips but if there is

552
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:43,210
something else happening it can act as a

553
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:45,789
distraction and follow the fear next it

554
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:49,119
is a scary to talk your way into a place

555
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:54,580
where you aren't supposed to be most of

556
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:58,809
us are honest if people but you want to

557
00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:01,809
get you know backstage at a concert you

558
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:04,690
know it says it isn't say a pen test job

559
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:09,570
a lot of things you might want to talk

560
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:14,950
our way into then doing things that are

561
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:17,489
scary and outside our norm that's when

562
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:21,399
it gets cool and fun doesn't always work

563
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:24,960
but that will give you a great story

564
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:28,119
suddenly you're alive at the end of it

565
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,099
yeah I said I think maybe Chris had me

566
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:31,928
he tells a story about going to a

567
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:34,299
military thing and hey once we go at

568
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:36,070
night and check this thing out and they

569
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:39,789
end up you know hands behind the head on

570
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:42,639
the knees guys with guns morning I would

571
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:45,009
want to be in that way what otherwise

572
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:46,928
trying to get someplace where you're not

573
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:51,759
supposed to be do something you're not

574
00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:53,969
supposed to is informative and fun and

575
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:57,549
then it also works in Reverse

576
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:59,529
if you've done some of this it's here

577
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:02,320
you're working the aren't you it comes a

578
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:05,529
little more obvious that oh you're just

579
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,320
making this up as you go I can tell you

580
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:10,179
aren't using the same kind of

581
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,460
terminology we usually use you aren't

582
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:17,070
doing it at the time of day we usually

583
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:20,919
do these sorts of things as you practice

584
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:24,460
improv or even just watch and read about

585
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:27,669
improv it's a good way to make sure that

586
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:30,519
you're on your guard and you can

587
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:35,109
recognize improv behavior in the wild

588
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:37,989
doesn't work there's an improv company

589
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:41,649
in New York that I love they're called

590
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:44,360
Improv Everywhere and instead of just

591
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:46,889
being a must a performing

592
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,240
the guy who founded it couldn't really

593
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:50,880
get an improv gig so you know I'm just

594
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,840
gonna get a couple friends well let's do

595
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,490
something kind of a flash mob in Perth

596
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,399
the first one they did which became so

597
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:02,880
popular is now an annual event is the No

598
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:06,750
Pants subway ride a guy would go to

599
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,940
Subway yeah a suit and tie nice shiny

a scary face just no grandpa he's riding

602
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:18,750
like normal next stop somebody else gets

603
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,250
on without pants feel like five six

604
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:25,860
stops and then something goes I'm silver

00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:56,670
to be a leader if you can take this

617
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:58,080
going to the ATM okay well just we'll

618
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:00,900
just don't do the parade and just follow

619
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,149

parade crying in and then go go -

623
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,490
expertly it's just a fun way to get some

624
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:18,720
creativity exercise give people story

625
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:20,940
they'll help remember also these things

626
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,680
like just happen to wear blue char some

627

lot of fun now I always like to watch

631
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,129
them and then see the creativity and

632
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:40,730
strange things they come up with years

633
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:44,190

712
00:36:54,530 --> 00:37:04,270
wouldn't even know and the mistakes are

713
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:07,040
gifts if you're on a pen test assignment

714
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:09,680
you want to get caught about you know

715
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,040
sort of you know that's the goal is to

716
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,700
teach

717
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,050
people to catch us it's great if we

718
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,879
could get two or three steps in say if

719
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:19,730
you are you know a couple things you can

720
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,250
confess but if they are totally on the

721
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:23,360
wall that is great news we failed

722
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:28,010
because they're awesome

723
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:29,810
and that has wonderful news to give a

724
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:33,790
lot of ways to find out information

725
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:38,330
about the targets oh if I was like the

726

talk at this conference I see you go

737
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:06,740

00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,770
auditor I'm walking through the building

740

hey I'm going to be looking at all the

741
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:16,580
trash things like that and then I

742
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:18,980
crumpled up a red post-it notes put in

743
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,990
the garbage bag crumpled the red yellow

744

where those came from

746
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:28,940
when I check the garbage tomorrow I know

747
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:31,250
which desk or which area and well this I

748
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,170
want to look for this specific

749
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:37,430
department I'll leave my little color

750
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:57,320
code things now I know our men don't

751
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:59,899
look at every man what are they

752
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,850
yeah but they they're almost always a

753
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,980
contractor they aren't usually employees

754
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:12,980
of whatever I'm just guessing just watch

755
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:15,320

760
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:35,390
Vanya's your hearts I'm going to hurt

761
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:37,730
myself watch yeah I'm kind of an omni

762
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:42,500
I'm all the works now yeah yeah I'm in

763
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:46,220
the intro in extroverts I switch back as

764
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:51,859
the I reckoned it getting in front of

765
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:55,038
people it's scary I realized in college

766
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:56,180
that I was afraid of public speaking but

767
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:00,529
all things considered was kind of a

768
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:02,240
silly thing be afraid up so I that's one

769
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:04,309
of the main reasons I got the job at the

770
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,890
campus radio well I'd love to see the

771
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:08,420
people I could probably talk to and and

772
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:11,269
then that was okay you know it worked

773
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:12,980
out alright and then got a job as a TA

774
00:40:11,269 --> 00:40:14,419
look if I know something they don't know

775
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:17,930
they're paying to be there to listen to

776
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:21,650
me I can probably do that and that went

777
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:25,250
okay then I could talk it's not that bad

778
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:27,619
baby they don't have maestro years ago I

779
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:30,140
had to learn how to get it all working

780
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:32,420
together in and Toastmasters helped me

781
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:34,640
with that I mean a little over 50

782
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,890
speeches in one year various places

783
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:42,170
around and that really helped me get my

784
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:45,230
rhythm my confidence my voice as a

785
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:48,819
speaker usually prepared speeches are

786
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:52,930
training sometimes off a cop I want a

787
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:57,200
citywide humor speaking contest or meet

788
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:59,808
random questions I think that

789
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,058
twenty-some-odd and Prince the the one

790
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:04,579
that got me advanced to the next round

791
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:07,720
was that the banner just put you in

792
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:11,359
charge of transportation for the city

793
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:13,959
what do you do so smooth out

794
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:17,029
Louisville's transportation problems I

795
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,009
knew I had to make it memorable and

796
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:20,980
interesting for people so they item this

797
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:23,269
is one of the guys who should advance

798
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,490
people would say you know buses like

799
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:27,979
radios changed for us no set once we

800
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:30,319
need septums you bring examples into the

801
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,910
city you know people hang onto bungees

802
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:34,250
and then you just float around where

803
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:35,029
they need and went on like that for a

804
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,510
couple minutes

805
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:41,510
and yeah - we'll let them go the next

806
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:44,050
round work his way up you know the

807
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:50,420
ridiculous can be fine

808
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:54,470
and the stranger you get when you

809
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:59,480
practice the easier it gets when you

810
00:41:54,470 --> 00:42:02,419
have to do it for real if you want to be

811
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,610
able to make more gestures or get more

812
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:08,030
body language in public that when you

813
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:11,440
practice I need to make wild gestures

814
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:13,520
and weird things just to get my body

815
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,850
okay so I want to do it for real

816
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,580
I'm like this seems a little more

817
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:22,940
natural a little more confident you know

818
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:25,700
I've done it's a point where you do key

819
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:28,640
notes you know an hour long thing on a

820
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:31,210
couple minutes notice most of my speech

821
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:35,779
s about like three little points and

822
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:38,270
kind of make it up from there I have fun

823
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:42,830
with my preaching because I usually

824
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:46,640
preach at weirdo events Comic Cons game

825
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:48,350
cons punk concerts or conventions things

826
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,230
like that so I get to preach about

827
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:54,290
zombies and pirates and aliens and weird

828
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:56,630
things which makes it fall I'm not gonna

829
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:59,570
make this all fit you find a way to be

830
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:02,590
creative and then do some things and

831
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:05,810
it's all about The Improv being

832
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:08,500
accepting the situation here in adding

833
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:12,310
to it making it stronger or better

834
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:16,430
improv comedy it's it's a very improv

835
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:20,060
not as much comedy they aren't trying to

836
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:22,759
be funny the scene is funny you don't

837
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:26,480
have to try to be funny because that's

838
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:29,900
what the environment provides it's all

839
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,950
about working with your scene partner or

840
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:35,810
partners and if I have to be four people

841
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:39,350
in the same scene just flip them back

842
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:42,259
and forth so when I get out into reality

843
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:46,160
and a happy social engineer my way into

844
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:48,670
or out of something yeah I've I've

845
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:52,910
already tried this 20 different ways

846
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:56,540
it's not as weird or as hard just like

847
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:59,540
with any muscle our brain is an organ

848
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:04,700
the more we use it the stronger it will

849
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:06,920
get as we as we come up with new ideas

850
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:10,759
and approaches we develop new neural

851
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:13,640
pathways the more that neurons fire down

852
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,490
that pathway the stronger it gets the

853
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,650
more natural it feels so I keep doing

854
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:20,799
everything the same way over and over

855
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:24,380
I've got this really strong mental rut

856
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,800
that's in me but if I try it a little

857
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:30,950
differently then I have a new way it's

858
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,220
not as strong but it's there I can do it

859
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:36,529
again

860
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:39,950
make it stronger how many of us drive to

861
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:46,060
and from work the same way all the time

862
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:49,100
I try to at least every couple of weeks

863
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:53,930
take a back road or some way I've never

864
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:54,680
been might be faster probably not it's

865
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:58,160
probably to be slower

866
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:00,799
I'll see you park the city or that maybe

867
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,399
I'll see very often throw detail yeah

868
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,530
exactly

869
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,260
come change rides yeah you know how

870
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:13,940
about a taxi yeah you never know who's

871
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:16,250
followed yet it's probably him it Furby

872
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:19,280
calm they've always have a happy worker

873
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:21,500
bee competition either you're buying a

874
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,100
real Derby hat or they'll give you have

875
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,490
achievement

876
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:28,819
you know $0.10 paisa cap you take this

877
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:31,700
plus whatever you have on hand and

878
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:34,190
decorate it some people will get all out

879
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,899
and a have won with mechanical parts you

880
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:39,110
know the pineapples or you know lighting

881
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:42,890
help disco things a few years ago I won

882
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:44,570
by taking police crime-scene tape that I

883
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:46,490
had my trunk will have please crunchy

884
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:48,530
favorite drops right and Nikita thought

885
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:50,569
trying that you know because it's all

886
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:52,760
about what you have on hand is part of

887
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:54,710
the competition to make business just a

888
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:58,700
way so he created with what you have

889
00:45:54,710 --> 00:46:01,460
around couple years ago I took a bunch

890
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,720
of derbies and staple them together in

891
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:05,750
sign-outs making each

892
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,580
all sighted hats it upside down and now

893
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:10,190
which I may be a reader be doubly feed

894
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:13,670
written hat that I could take off a role

895
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:15,349
with numbers on the inside did know

896
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,970
would work until I had finished stately

897
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:19,940
theater yes it fits and I can make it

898
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:23,359
see all I did things like that's making

899
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:27,260
it to help exercise the creative side of

900
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:29,869
our brain growing up I was an artist

901
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:32,570
squished American tech later but I also

902
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:33,890
minored in psychology and philosophy to

903
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:36,230
understand how the visual world works

904
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:37,848
and also how our brains work and also

905
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:41,210
how the Meno reality works

906
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:43,730
I still nobody have it but that's the

907
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:48,050
theory you know I try to use your left

908
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:52,250
and right half of your brains the skills

909
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:56,840
you develop in improv are creativity and

910
00:46:52,250 --> 00:47:01,130
communication and those are the two most

911
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:05,470
sought-after soft skills in this field

912
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:10,030
in almost any field getting new ideas

913
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:12,950
new approaches and ways to do things and

914
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:16,160
understanding and press it back out with

915
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:19,790
your teammates learning how to talk the

916
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:23,990
same language as my improv coach would

917
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:26,420
say improv improves every other area of

918
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:29,779
your life you might get we're selling a

919
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:33,160
little but not that much I don't make my

920
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:35,150
improving my creativity Nicator skills

921
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:40,640
it's a lot easier to get ahead at the

922
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:44,750
office it's easier to to trick my kids

923
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:47,420
into handing easier to go out you can

924
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:52,040
say easier to have managed my own life

925
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:55,760
and tendencies easier to manage projects

926
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:58,520
and goals because I've I've had

927
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:02,710
experience at looking at things many

928
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:11,450
different ways the more I do that the

929
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:13,460
more natural it feels and my coach I

930
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:15,600
said puffier awesome is on the other

931
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,800
side of here

932
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,950
a lot of things I've never done before

933
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,320
because I've never done this bottle why

934
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:24,270
not try you know never thought it would

935
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,670
be in a movie I never thought I would

936
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:29,690
write a play I never thought would write

937
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:33,210
a book I never thought I would found

938
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:36,480
several companies never thought I would

939
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:40,010
do I mean nobody people most of the time

940
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:45,780
so it's kind of a new surprise every day

941
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:52,170
but by intentionally doing things odd or

942
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:55,230
strange or unusual that way I don't have

943
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:57,690
the same you know ten ruts in my neural

944
00:48:55,230 --> 00:49:02,400
pathways doing the same stuff the same

945
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:04,380
way all the time my last job I was at

946
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,530
the same company but I had five

947
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:11,280
different jobs in the five years I was

948
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:14,730
there from developer to scrum master to

949
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,700
master data manager to QA on the tech

950
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:21,690
side and I think something else very

951
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:23,600
different parts of IT while I jump back

952
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:25,470
and forth between them all because I

953
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:32,100
have learned to do things a little

954
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:34,770
differently as I go any thoughts on the

955
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:41,220
social engineering and how improv might

956
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:42,930
help as we get ready to close yes I can

957
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,730
see how socially how this would be

958
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:46,290
important to be able to get outside of

959
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:48,570
your comfort zone and learning how to do

960
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:50,430
that to be able to do social engineer is

961
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:52,620
that the biggest firm unless you think

962
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:55,230
for first times ocean engineering is

963
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:57,089
especially on a face to face basis like

964
00:49:55,230 --> 00:50:00,770
trying to get into a building or is it

965
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:03,780
something else it is feeling comfortable

966
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:09,030
inside your own skin and a role I think

967
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:12,270
is the main fit if you look nervous then

968
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:13,470
you actually nervous you can see if

969
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:15,600
you're nervous that makes you feel

970
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:18,480
warmer of us and it feeds on itself

971
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:20,759
but if it's just hey I'm here to help

972
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,500
Bob with the thing I'll be there 20

973
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,650
minutes how do you here before you know

974
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,540
it

975
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:30,619
then this is a lot easier to get things

976
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:33,200
done those having a safe practice area

977
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:35,330
before you have to take it out and put

978
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:39,200
yourself on the line it'll help to both

979
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:40,910
the confidence the the creativity to

980
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:46,460
come up with something as you need

981
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:49,430
because you do it all time I think the

982
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:54,200
distraction works really well in social

983
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:57,319
engineering seems like the more things

984
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,990
that are going on the less time somebody

985
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:09,680
has to focus on this same thing you know

986
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:14,118
portion of it around here on fire it

987
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:18,368
does have a lot anybody in law

988
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:21,680
enforcement or rotations a lot of

989
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:24,440
criminal duo's will I'm trying to rob

990
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,419
the jewelry store my last couple of

991
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,160
questions have reached that thing behind

992
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,020
the counter and turn his back so my park

993
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:33,009
over here can do this other thing

994
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:35,300
because they're all busy or I'll

995
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:38,089
accidentally you know knock over the

996
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:40,220
speeding rack of things oh no hope you

997
00:51:38,089 --> 00:51:42,970
pick them up and while we're looking

998
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:46,310
there something else is going on yeah

999
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:48,109
that they have you know that is their

1000
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:54,440
job is to steal things by distracting

1001
00:51:48,109 --> 00:52:00,049
and we can learn from them as well I saw

1002
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:05,180
you two was start where years back and

1003
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:07,760
you have lady there reporter and she's a

1004
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:10,700
social engineer and he told him she

1005
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:14,540
could probably figure out you know where

1006
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:16,819
these bank account was and so you know

1007
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:18,710
the whole scenario he said well you know

1008
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,930
I don't think and you know my bags

1009
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:23,300
pretty good and then I first open and

1010
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:25,970
every day when she went in and she

1011
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:28,910
called the bank and claimed to be his

1012
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:30,740
wife and then said you know you she's

1013
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:33,290
got her phone and she gets to say her

1014
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:34,169
phone I've been behind sound you know

1015
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,540
baby crying

1016
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:37,940
I'm sorry if she starts getting a little

1017
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:40,620
upset on the phone

1018
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:43,770
my husband told me to do this tonight

1019
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:45,000
you know and I I don't know what I'm I'm

1020
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:46,680
so sad for six years

1021
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,870
I'm gonna get in trouble get out what

1022
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:54,960
baby's driving all this stuff is going

1023
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:58,350
on and they literally gave the system

1024
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,660
now she has full rise to going Chase's

1025
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:05,430
password you know what that's like what

1026
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:09,600
yeah so I mean you know it all those

1027
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:11,970
tools you know work yeah that's a client

1028
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,410
but look up I think voice fish baby

1029
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:17,850
crying or something and you'll find that

1030
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:20,730
one it's like a lot of success long yeah

1031
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:23,190
I was wondering if you practice with the

1032
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:25,950
voice changer software

1033
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:29,490
I don't although I don't tend to focus

1034
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:31,529
on the voice I'm more in person well I

1035
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:35,430
know but you're talking so you have to

1036
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:51,210
pick words that a woman would say Oh to

1037
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:56,370
masquerade as a woman okay yeah I know

1038
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:57,890
on Chris on social engineer dot-org

1039
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:01,710
lots and lots of great information there

1040
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:04,560
he found that women are like 80% more

1041
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:04,890
effective than men on voice calls or

1042
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,350
something

1043
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:08,640
so now women do all the things at his

1044
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:13,740
company when it talks when it goes to

1045
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:16,740
fishing and then it's also a good thing

1046
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:19,399
for parts of the country and accents

1047
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:22,680
things like that you want to try to a

1048
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:26,580
New York person in Texas would stand out

1049
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:28,410
the way they talk vice versa Kentucky we

1050
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:31,170
sound like we don't have shoes on matter

1051
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:33,180
where we go you know not that much meat

1052
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:37,920
we can that can help with that

1053
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:39,990
but except travel and experience going

1054
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,770
learning doing now that is was that I

1055
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:47,129
help all of us with all eventually any

1056
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:49,440
one last question before we close here

1057
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:51,680
all right well then go for thing and I

1058
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,140
mix them up

1059
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,009
[Applause]
