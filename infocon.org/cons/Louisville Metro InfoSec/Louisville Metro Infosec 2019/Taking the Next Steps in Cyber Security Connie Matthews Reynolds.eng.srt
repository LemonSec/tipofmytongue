1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,670
according give a few seconds we're going

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:14,750
in ambient audio so to speak loudly good

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,310
morning everyone how's everyone doing

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,960
good just making sure we're talking

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,799
about career path so this picture I was

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,980
in the wrong room

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,529
rumor anyways so so this is hey what

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,910
were you be talking about today taking

9
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,359
the next steps in your cybersecurity

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,619
InfoSec career one of the things is we

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,719
want to talk about is how do we manage

12
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,239
your hair what are the next steps

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,559
whether you're starting new or you've

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,449
been in the industry for a while

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,760
and then we'll talk a little bit about

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,010
training certifications and boot camps

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,440
and different ways you can continue to

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,550
skill yourself and then finally how

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,860
important soft skills finding a mentor

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,569
coach and really having someone to back

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,910
you in your development of your career

22
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,840
so just by show of hands how many people

23
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:06,360
in here are nudists ooh InfoSec

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:08,549
cybersecurity and then how many people

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,110
have five plus 10 plus years of

26
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,729
experience okay so good mix and I really

27
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,110
want this to be interactive so feel free

28
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,360
to ask any questions as we're going

29
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,240
through I'm happy to answer anything you

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,340
have um so this is help a little bit

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,970
about myself my name is Connie Matthews

32
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,920
I'm the CEO and founder of Renkin

33
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,509
educational services and training I'm

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,060
super excited I actually am from the

35
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,890
host Ohio the second women-owned

36
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,820
cybersecurity company in the state of

37
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:42,119
Ohio so I was really excited to open the

38
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:45,210
company I'm very much about advocating

39
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,700
careers in stem of a huge mentor and

40
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,548
coach I have probably in my 17 years

41
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,670
have probably been turd I don't know 100

42
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,830
150 people and I continue to do that

43
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,080
because they feel it's really important

44
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:00,420
and then I also sit on advisory roles

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,420
for colleges and universities to build

46
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,570
our cybersecurity program thank you and

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:10,949
I said you can see on several boards I

48
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,359
also sit on the central Ohio is a board

49
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:16,500
I've been on that 13 years has anyone

50
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,050
ever gone to caucus InfoSec summit the

51
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,570
people from Columbus of course so so we

52
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,710
also have a summit very similar in comas

53
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,739
Ohio and you guys should come and join

54
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:29,640
us okay then all right

55
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:32,100
so managing your career when you look at

56
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,200
this list how many people agree that

57
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,210
when you're in cybersecurity it's

58
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,200
something that you constantly need to

59
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:42,090
learn so do you think it's a career

60
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,339
where you can just be stagnant and never

61
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,310
open a book or read so obviously that's

62
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,420
good we're all in the same page there I

63
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,370
also think it either willing to be

64
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,559
willing to challenge yourself because I

65
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,200
think about when I started 17 years ago

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,180
to now especially with the movement of

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,579
the cloud which is a cloud a lot of

68
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,739
times is really a big application and a

69
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,090
lot of people in cybersecurity started

70
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,550
with more of an infrastructure

71
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,290
background so there's all these debates

72
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,880
whether you should be a full stack

73
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,250
developer to be an information security

74
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,530
I don't believe that but I also feel

75
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,780
like how many of you know how to script

76
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,260
and write some basic scripting and maybe

77
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,300
some Python or things like that I should

78
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,950
get good because a lot of the new

79
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,580
technologies require some of those

80
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,780
skills I think you need to be assertive

81
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,610
and one of the biggest things that I

82
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,070
think is very very important it's tough

83
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,260
awareness I think there's a lot of

84
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,660
people in our industry they're super

85
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,760
smart but I also feel that if you're not

86
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,829
aware of who you are and where your

87
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,149
strengths and weaknesses are you really

88
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,610
can't grow would you agree with that

89
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,900
statement because I like for me there

90
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,489
are some things I'll never be good at

91
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,170
and I totally fully admit that's myself

92
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,390
but that I try to surround myself with

93
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,790
people that are strong in those areas

94
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,679
where I can learn from them never will

95
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:00,420
be the same ism but it's just a constant

96
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,650
learning path so since there's a good

97
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,329
combination we'll talk a little bit

98
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,040
about both of these so a lot of people

99
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,100
will ask me if I want to go into

100
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,480
cybersecurity what should you do

101
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,430
and when I say this I'm not against

102
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,280
anyone going to college but I think the

103
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,380
things you have to take in consideration

104
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,690
is if you're going to go to college you

105
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,108
need to find a college that combines

106
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,880
theory and practice so a lot of articles

107
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,430
have come out where like the big four or

108
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,289
the FBI and a lot of big companies are

109
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,150
removing the 4-year degree because

110
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:32,909
they're losing out on amazing candidates

111
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,890
that didn't potentially go to college so

112
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,950
I sit on tipping University which is in

113
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,320
Ohio and I love their program and is an

114
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:43,200
advisor for them they actually teach

115
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,659
they have they go to stock the network

116
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,610
operation center and their students

117
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,710
actually work as part of their

118
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,419
curriculum in there

119
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,430
they bring in like capture the flags

120
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,200
they do a lot of rural experience they

121
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,960
have to do internships their junior and

122
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,630
senior year and I will say that they

123
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,150
graduate 35 to 50 kids and generally

124
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,460
when they graduate they all have giant

125
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,070
jobs in cybersecurity with no experience

126
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,080
within 30 or 60 days which is really

127
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,430
kind of unheard of so I think if you're

128
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,690
going to do that make sure you do your

129
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:18,390
research on the programs if you're more

130
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,160
of a seasoned person a lot of people

131
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,140
will tend to go and get their degree so

132
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,880
they can get into a leadership role and

133
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,320
then that by that time of your career

134
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,440
you know how to kind of balance theory

135
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,650
in practice obviously there's security

136
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,060
training courses boot camps all kinds of

137
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,140
certifications and we'll talk a little

138
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,510
bit about that later and then one of the

139
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,729
questions I ask people when I mentor

140
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,349
them that don't have experience what my

141
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:45,210
first question is do you have a lab at

142
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:49,530
your house so for the people that are

143
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,060
new do you have a lab in your home so I

144
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,380
would recommend you do that and you

145
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,960
don't have to go out and buy a bunch of

146
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,479
equipment you can do virtualization but

147
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,479
I've helped a lot of young people with

148
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,310
no experience where they built labs and

149
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,380
they can actually talk about the

150
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,539
methodologies of using the tool being

151
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,060
able to kind of rationalize and go

152
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:10,979
through how they're securing maybe their

153
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,229
own home network and at the end of the

154
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,419
day it's a lot it's the same thing where

155
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:17,550
they're securing two things or a

156
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:19,169
thousand things the process is generally

157
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,449
very similar

158
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:23,248
I'll see the larger gets the more issues

159
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:27,030
you have but just kind of understanding

160
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:28,499
how to do that as important how many

161
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,628
have you done with us don't be afraid to

162
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:32,069
break things

163
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:33,270
so in cybersecurity I think if you're

164
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:34,729
afraid to break things you're going to

165
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,438
probably be in a little bit of trouble

166
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:40,370
because I look at cybersecurity InfoSec

167
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,870
is reverse engineering everything and

168
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:46,710
then I think it's really important to

169
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,939
understand and learn fundamentals how

170
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,620
many people think it would be easy to

171
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:51,330
secure a firewall if you didn't know how

172
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,120
to configure a fire while you do nothing

173
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:57,120
about it or how would you secure a

174
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,590
server if you don't know how to set up a

175
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,469
server or how would you secure wireless

176
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,938
if you don't understand how it works and

177
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:04,620
I said this earlier but I really truly

178
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,800
believe security a lot of times is

179
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,750
reverse engineering and then practical

180
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,000
experience so if you can't do

181
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,610
internships and you don't have an

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,560
opportunity that whole self-study and

183
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,919
creating your own lab could be huge and

184
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,629
your opportunities for fighting and then

185
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:23,628
how many of you have a mentor or coach

186
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:28,319
so the ones that did raise your hand I

187
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:30,599
would HIGHLY highly encourage that you

188
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,879
find one my whole entire career I've

189
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:35,430
always had mentors and coaches they are

190
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,819
great advocates for you and it can open

191
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,199
up a lot of opportunities for the view

192
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,029
of it don't have them into our coaches

193
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,089
it because are you afraid to ask someone

194
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:47,099
to mentor coach you so that's good

195
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,830
because a lot of people are but I will

196
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,180
say I'm not as familiar with this

197
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,310
community because I guess and I'm from

198
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,169
Columbus but I know some other people

199
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,969
the audience are Columbus we're really

200
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:59,549
good if someone comes up and says hey

201
00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:00,960
and we grab coffee or can we bring you

202
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,240
to Rome about stuff can you look at my

203
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,219
resume we tend to be a community that

204
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,990
does that and I hear that you guys are

205
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:09,120
this way here too so I would encourage

206
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,129
for the people in the room that are more

207
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,080
seasoned to reach out to some of the

208
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:16,039
younger people and we can learn from

209
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:20,219
them too so it's not always just one way

210
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:22,289
and then when you talk about seasoned I

211
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:25,110
mean the list is obviously pretty

212
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:27,959
similar security training courses boot

213
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:32,460
camps certifications constant learning

214
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:34,049
being assertive asking questions college

215
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,090
degree program like I mentioned a lot of

216
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:38,219
times people will go back to college if

217
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,740
they want a leadership role and then

218
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,860
again finding a mentor another people

219
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,850
that are seasoned do you still think

220
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,560
once you have five plus years of

221
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,400
experience it's good to have a mentor or

222
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,530
coach you guys are quiet it's not to

223
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,910
family and you got coffee so I mean

224
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,699
completely did you guys have questions

225
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,469
please let me know all right so we're

226
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,720
gonna talk a little bit about training

227
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,920
certifications are available I will tell

228
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,660
you I don't have everything on these

229
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,069
sites because there's there would be

230
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,680
just too many things I just want to give

231
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,520
you some ideas of what's out there so

232
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,040
we're going to kind of break them down

233
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,439
into governance risk compliance network

234
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,310
security and app development and

235
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,680
security side a lot of people get really

236
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,599
weird about a lot of times they say GRC

237
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,069
but I know people would govern sitting

238
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,960
up people on risk and compliance and

239
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,490
they get hairy about what those words

240
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,370
start so that's why I have it separated

241
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,450
but there is a lot of overlap and then

242
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,550
we're gonna talk about security

243
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,710
awareness training security training

244
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:38,550
there's a whole leadership skills and

245
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:39,530
soft skills so you think about

246
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,569
governance

247
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:44,069
obviously these are I all aisaka

248
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,320
certifications and there's more than

249
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:49,590
this but does anyone in the room have

250
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:54,650
any of these three certifications which

251
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:57,000
one do you have okay anyway oh okay so

252
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,220
these are attendant these will tend to

253
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,320
like on risk jobs and governance and

254
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,940
compliance jobs these are typical

255
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,040
sometimes of the certifications they'll

256
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,570
be asking and again this is not a

257
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,689
catch-all so it's and everything but

258
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:12,570
just an idea and then risk and

259
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:15,360
compliance here's what I mean obviously

260
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:18,930
there's some PCI there's PMI how do you

261
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,570
how many people have a PMP so a lot of

262
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,370
people in security I mean a PMP is a

263
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,750
good because when you guys when we do

264
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,890
large projects is always good to have

265
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,920
someone that kind of holds it all

266
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,810
together and then you know there's the

267
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,120
cap in the sea risk again the is d

268
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:40,349
squared does anyone want to throw anyone

269
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:41,850
out that they think would be good this

270
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,770
is if it means I'm doing a good job if

271
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,160
everyone doesn't have any questions from

272
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,530
that

273
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,230
so then when you get into network

274
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,990
security these are probably the more

275
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:55,200
common ones are is anyone familiar with

276
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:57,900
most of these like PC or AC council Lyle

277
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,490
- those tend to be more of in the

278
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,340
CompTIA those tend to be more of like

279
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,510
the pentesting vulnerability assessments

280
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,240
those things so these are definitely

281
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,490
more of the technical this y-axis P

282
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,670
isn't necessarily so technical anyone

283
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,200
have that so that's a pretty common one

284
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,870
and that really covers all of their

285
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,000
domains in cybersecurity I think is that

286
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,470
five years they always changers at seven

287
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,140
now but you have to have years of

288
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,750
experience five okay so you have to have

289
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,150
five years of documented experience to

290
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,580
take this cert but if you're new I would

291
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:31,920
really recommend you look like maybe

292
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,600
taking a class or getting the book

293
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,729
because it covers all the domains in

294
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,320
security and it really does help you

295
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,340
kind of understand fully like what

296
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:44,550
security looks like and then we have

297
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:48,240
application security any app security

298
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:50,699
people in the audience one person this

299
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,720
is probably the biggest area we need

300
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,640
help

301
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,680
alright you have you guys heard like

302
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,050
five years ago we had about a quarter of

303
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,880
a million shortage in cybersecurity now

304
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,790
it's up to four million and it continues

305
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:06,300
to grow so if you have interested in the

306
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:08,250
application side I will tell you Absalon

307
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,829
calling and I'm not all about money but

308
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,940
they're probably the most high paid

309
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:15,810
positions and security because it's

310
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:18,660
almost impossible to find them and right

311
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,859
now with the way we're trending if you

312
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,870
have an interest I would highly

313
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:27,330
recommend because that needs going to

314
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:30,360
just continue to grow and grow and then

315
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:34,140
security awareness again there's a lot

316
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,870
more than this so there's no before our

317
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:39,510
media Pro fence stands and then there's

318
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,910
a concert as a ton of like proof point I

319
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,500
think happens so areas of security

320
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,589
awareness so secured awareness is not

321
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,780
hard to find and I'm also seeing a very

322
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:51,270
large trend with their companies they

323
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,640
have a whole entire team that's devoted

324
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:56,069
to security awareness and building that

325
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,050
out because studies show I mean I think

326
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,670
we can all agree I think

327
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,800
sometimes in security we tend to be good

328
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,870
cop bad cop and we're almost like the

329
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,269
parent telling people you shouldn't do

330
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,370
this and slapping their hands and really

331
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:09,899
in my opinion a security awareness is

332
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,779
more of a behavioral issue and

333
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:15,750
psychological vs. doing things so how do

334
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:17,910
we relate to the people that were trying

335
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,560
to get this message out to also make

336
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,199
good decisions but it which in turn

337
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:27,149
makes us our jobs a lot easier to be

338
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:28,560
honest so again these are kind of some

339
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:32,100
of things there's just some other

340
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,469
examples of training inserts I would say

341
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,810
like it seems like a lot of people will

342
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:40,290
like the sea eh which is the certified

343
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:41,459
ethical hacker sans has a quote under

344
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,250
cuz how many people have taken this

345
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,479
against class and can you kind of throw

346
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:58,079
out numbers how much did you pay for

347
00:13:45,480 --> 00:14:02,820
this class with travel and was that for

348
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:06,270
a five-day or for this is six okay and

349
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,459
I'm not saying that sanz's bad but if

350
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:11,970
for any of you or any of you leaders or

351
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:13,979
man to manage groups of people so I mean

352
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,410
can you afford that if you have a team

353
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:22,800
of 60 can you afford to send 60 people

354
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:26,520
to a 12 grand Wow and that's not the tip

355
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,199
above board yeah and the thing that I do

356
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,510
find that I think is interesting is

357
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,060
again say I have a lot of friends or

358
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,529
sans instructors great great courses but

359
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,649
there's a lot of other things out there

360
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:40,439
that are way less expensive and how do

361
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:43,250
you have options so most companies can't

362
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,440
send 60 people got that kind of money

363
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:48,630
and I know they've recently changed ii

364
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,779
like to get your CPE do you now have to

365
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:54,510
take sans courses to get them so it's

366
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:57,180
this constant battle like if you have to

367
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:59,339
go back every year and spend 12 grand I

368
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,689
don't know if that's really feasible so

369
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,930
a lot of people I know we're actually

370
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,430
stopping their sand suits because their

371
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,339
companies aren't going to pay 12 grand

372
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,750
every year to to do a course and

373
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,200
everything if you do it online like in

374
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,700
the state of

375
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,340
how they have a subscription and then

376
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,870
you think it's like 10% discount so they

377
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,600
don't have the travel but it's not even

378
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:23,330
very and it's pre-recorded stuff that

379
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:27,210
people watch so leadership skills

380
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:28,770
obviously there's several and I think

381
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,960
we're going to talk a little bit about

382
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:33,410
soft skills and how important they are

383
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:36,030
but if you want to grow in your career

384
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,280
these are our areas and some sorts that

385
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:40,260
you can look at and I would definitely

386
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,990
recommend having a mentor or a coach

387
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,420
again because I think it's a lot easier

388
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:51,600
to have someone you can run ideas and a

389
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:53,339
trusted advisor okay soft skills so I

390
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,950
have pretty good relationships with most

391
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:59,190
of the systems in Kaunas and we have

392
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,450
this conversation all the time and we

393
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,120
are actually talking about this upstairs

394
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:05,760
in the speaker room critical thinking

395
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,220
problem-solving strong communication

396
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,230
skills being able to write teamwork

397
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,260
taking initiative and understanding

398
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:15,320
business so if I asked you are you guys

399
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,550
all familiar with Asian or insurance

400
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,680
alright so if I asked you what is

401
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:25,770
nationwide most critical asset they want

402
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:30,140
to protect what would you say what kind

403
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:32,699
of data okay anybody else

404
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:35,819
so actually what nationwide protects

405
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,870
more than anything is they make majority

406
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,400
of all their money on real estate

407
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,850
they've owned almost all of downtown

408
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:44,100
called us Ohio and the research they do

409
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,260
in the market analysis that they do and

410
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,990
what they decide to buy cost a lot of

411
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,330
money so if someone can still all of

412
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,580
their R&D dia all of their intellectual

413
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,870
property to make those decisions they

414
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:59,730
can bid higher because they didn't have

415
00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:01,590
to pay that another one would be have

416
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,540
you guys ever heard of you know Scott's

417
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,800
an Oracle bro

418
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:13,020
so what do you think they're trying to

419
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:15,839
protect most okay so that is really

420
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,879
important but they actually have one of

421
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,159
the best distributions in the world and

422
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,930
that's what they want to protect because

423
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,730
if someone else can duplicate and steal

424
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:27,000
that then that's a

425
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:29,910
and the reason I'm driving this point as

426
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,460
a security practitioner how can you make

427
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,470
decisions to secure the companies you

428
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,610
work for when people don't understand

429
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,850
the business already

430
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:40,110
do you think that's a fair statement

431
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,750
because I mean when you protect our

432
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,549
homes we know it's the values that we're

433
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,140
trying to protect and it's the same

434
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:48,389
thing as the crown jewels and what's

435
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,640
important and we also have to make

436
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:52,410
decisions based on risk and what those

437
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,210
risks are within organizations so

438
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,510
understanding the business side is very

439
00:17:54,210 --> 00:18:02,610
important the other thing I will also

440
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:03,990
say if I was hiring someone and I would

441
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,639
by show of hands would you rather hire

442
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,860
someone that thinks they know everything

443
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,320
and they're not going to learn or

444
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,959
someone that is eager to learn that

445
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,879
shows initiative to learn and you know

446
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,429
that you can kind of train and develop

447
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,900
them to what you need so how many wants

448
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:22,520
how many people want to hire the first

449
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:26,720
person I just said no one that's a great

450
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:30,360
how many would hire the second person so

451
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,580
when when I talk to systems and hiring

452
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,129
managers again I would say critical

453
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,260
thinking and problem-solving are two of

454
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:42,059
the most important things you should

455
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:43,290
work on we also are in an industry we're

456
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:46,260
never going to be able to solve the

457
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,990
problem so we also have to be patient

458
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,400
but we can make differences so for us

459
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,140
that have been in the industry when I

460
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,780
started to come here to now we've made

461
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,190
huge strides but we still have a lot of

462
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,570
strikes so every time we kind of figure

463
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,059
this out there's something else that

464
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,340
comes and I might show hands how many

465
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:04,678
people think all of the breaches that

466
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:08,939
have occurred really thought think that

467
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:12,120
they were this really crazy inventive

468
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:16,020
like never heard of breach how people

469
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:18,620
think that that's happened how many

470
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:21,540
people say that it's fundamentals like

471
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:24,639
never patching never changing the

472
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,170
default passwords never

473
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,929
then everyone's how you're doing this

474
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,520
for 17 years I've been on the Sales and

475
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:32,650
Business Development and I probably sold

476
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,889
thousands and thousands those security

477
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:37,690
assessments and every single time we've

478
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:40,950
got administrative rights it's over

479
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:43,720
silly silly things and so we continue to

480
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:46,330
invest in all of these expensive tools

481
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,100
and not I'm not saying we don't need

482
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:51,850
tools but we need to look at

483
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,469
fundamentals so thinking about would you

484
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,129
build a million-dollar home on a

485
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,000
sinkhole

486
00:19:54,130 --> 00:20:01,210
I mean security kind of has the same

487
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,820
thing where we need to understand the

488
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:07,570
fundamentals because every pendant is

489
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:10,059
anybody a pen tester in here okay so as

490
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,860
a pen tester if I know I can bypass any

491
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:17,350
tool and get administrative rights to

492
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:20,080
the tool help an organization so it

493
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,129
doesn't so it's really if all night in

494
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,770
my advice is when you're learning

495
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,390
security really focus on fundamentals

496
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:28,150
companies don't always want to focus on

497
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,830
those but it's a really important

498
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,809
question because a lot of the breaches

499
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,970
that have occurred if we would have

500
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:35,200
focused on fundamentals they would not

501
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,000
have happened the way they are now I

502
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,169
will argue once we get those

503
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,750
fundamentals taken there will be

504
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:42,790
something else but you know and I'm one

505
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,780
of my favorite thing is security is a

506
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,780
journey it's not a destination

507
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:52,270
and then I've said this many times

508
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,490
signing a mentor or coach the power of

509
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:58,418
networking making sure you leverage your

510
00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:01,540
network this is a perfect way are most

511
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:04,390
of you members of Issa I saw is C

512
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,730
squared so I know there are several

513
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,350
people in learned that I know like Jeff

514
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,350
in the back were both on the ISIS a

515
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:14,049
board palm helps with our summit and

516
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,659
would you guys say that getting involved

517
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:20,190
has helped you grow a shin ships and

518
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,190
have you found vendors and coaches

519
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:42,309
and then I also say makrooh the movers

520
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:44,950
and shakers in the industry following

521
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:46,899
like LinkedIn Twitter follow some of the

522
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,879
people that are really wrong respected

523
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:54,100
now I will tell you sometimes you have

524
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:56,230
to get through some egos but I kind of

525
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,730
read things in if you kind of start to

526
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,710
see patterns and you see it all the time

527
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,269
you can generally make some safe

528
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:05,200
assumptions that what they're singing is

529
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:07,389
somewhat correct but Brian Krebs is

530
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,879
probably one of the most famous bloggers

531
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:11,049
in the cybersecurity space we were very

532
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:12,939
fortunate we actually was it two years

533
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:16,539
ago that we got him more than last year

534
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:19,629
too so we have Brian Krebs is one of our

535
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:21,789
keynotes in Columbus and it was just

536
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:24,340
really interesting to your story and a

537
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:25,809
lot of people have like will say that

538
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,149
he's a little arrogant but I will tell

539
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:29,649
you I got a lot of time to meet him and

540
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:32,258
sit down with him and he was just a

541
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:33,879
great guy and they have any of you guys

542
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:36,429
ever watch to catch me if you can

543
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:39,039
so Frank a Miguel he also is a keynote

544
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:40,570
and just phenomenal and so it's like

545
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,299
when you hear these people say these are

546
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,918
great people you can go out and you know

547
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:47,830
endless and really kind of read their

548
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,899
links that means in and Twitter and

549
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,539
don't be afraid like if you have someone

550
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:55,889
on LinkedIn that's really connected to

551
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:59,799
leverage some of those relationships do

552
00:22:55,889 --> 00:23:01,600
and then I'm not sure they distribute it

553
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:04,570
but I just wanted I put a few links in

554
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,009
here that people can use that kind of

555
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,470
give different opinions some of these

556
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:11,559
will actually talk about what are the

557
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,999
most sought-after certifications no what

558
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,600
I will tell you is depending on where

559
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:18,100
you go those rotate a little bit

560
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,469
some of them focus on my soccer stars

561
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,629
some of them focus more on the technical

562
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,279
search so not to say that me these are

563
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:25,840
100 percent right but it kind of gives

564
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:28,840
you an idea of what people are looking

565
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:33,519
for and then are any of you familiar

566
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:35,199
with a nice framework so that's it and I

567
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,070
don't think I put that on here oh I

568
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,830
didn't this is a really good one so nice

569
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:43,590
is kind of a standard for training that

570
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:45,120
a lot of organizations are using if this

571
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,129
came out of NIST in the federal

572
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,260
government what able to tell you it's

573
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:52,110
heavily having a line to certifications

574
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,550
so you can take that with a grain of

575
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,040
salt and I'm not saying you should run

576
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:59,669
out and pay for a ton of certs but it

577
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:01,920
can give you some ideas of what types of

578
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:05,400
resources and kind of what people are

579
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,320
looking for and it kind of helps with

580
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,650
just kind of seeing where things are

581
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:13,200
going and again I feel like we have

582
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:17,160
buzzword bingo in our industry how many

583
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:21,180
of you are know about the minor attack

584
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,680
framework have you heard of it so the

585
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:25,620
minor attack dream work is a relatively

586
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:29,010
new framework that it's spelt like MIT

587
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,840
are I think but it's they I don't think

588
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:33,920
there's an ampersand or something in it

589
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,480
and when you look it up online but

590
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,100
that's a framework I feel like everybody

591
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,540
like every big company I'm working with

592
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,449
his on Ben we're getting with it so I'm

593
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,500
not saying to focus on going into all

594
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,570
these different things because they do

595
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,770
change but those are good resources to

596
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:52,770
kind of look in review to get

597
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:56,670
information on and then getting involved

598
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:59,190
I think is crucial so I know I'm not

599
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:02,520
sure how active these are but I've kind

600
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,970
of put what's in in this area um I don't

601
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,860
know

602
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,720
someone tell me what the triangle is

603
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:11,419
because I'm not pressure is it just like

604
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:22,140
a geographic area maybe I don't know ah

605
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:24,510
squared yeah so the idea was okay I kind

606
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:28,440
of figured it was geographical thing it

607
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:30,090
was heard but um so and I'm sorry I

608
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,830
thought it took the central Ohio one off

609
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,689
cause I've done this presentation quite

610
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,199
a few times but these are all different

611
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,660
groups

612
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,010
I think locally I'm not sure how active

613
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:41,970
they are but these are groups that you

614
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:43,710
can potentially get involved in and I

615
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,410
found the assignment this is just a

616
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:49,230
shameless plug for the top one I'm a

617
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:52,169
founding member of I'm a huge person

618
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:56,309
versity and working with women and

619
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:58,290
minorities and so we are we just started

620
00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:00,629
a Midwest which I could I mean I know

621
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:03,990
Kentucky do you guys consider Kentucky

622
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:06,240
South or because I hear different things

623
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,220
so I don't want to offend anyone but I

624
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,600
am in Kentucky I would say it's a

625
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,169
three-hour drive so we're not talking to

626
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,270
you but we are having a gala on January

627
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:17,130
31st in Columbus Ohio and is celebrating

628
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:20,340
women and it's all about diversity

629
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:21,929
inclusion so we want men and women it

630
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,280
doesn't matter your sexual preference

631
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:26,070
your color of your skin it's really

632
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:29,280
about empowering all of us and building

633
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:31,230
networks and building apps and are one

634
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,240
of our goals is in 2021 we're going to

635
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,919
be doing scholarships for women in

636
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,419
cybersecurity we think we'll have around

637
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:39,809
seventy-five to a hundred thousand

638
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:41,880
dollars to giving scholarships so how

639
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:46,410
many of you think that we need more

640
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:48,960
diversity in security and honestly we're

641
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,540
missing a whole group of people by doing

642
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,130
that so like I said I've been a huge

643
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:58,559
advocate talking about this all the time

644
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:03,240
and then this is my contact information

645
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:04,500
I'm on Twitter and on LinkedIn so feel

646
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,140
free to connect if you have any

647
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,470
questions I'm not really sure but I was

648
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,880
named one of the top women in

649
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:14,580
cybersecurity to follow on Twitter of

650
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,660
189 women not really sure how I got that

651
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,490
to be honest because I don't really use

652
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,790
Twitter that much what I'm trying to get

653
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,580
better

654
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:23,879
oh I was someone just limited my game

655
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,649
but certainly reach out happy to help

656
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,450
but I think I got through this

657
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:32,910
presentation pretty fast so does anybody

658
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:54,660
have any questions don't do that good

659
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:57,179
for job yeah yeah I know the part of the

660
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,970
reason that I honestly it was myself and

661
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:02,490
eight other ladies that started it and I

662
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:05,040
always feel like all of the stuff is

663
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:07,559
they're in the DC area or California and

664
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:11,370
most companies aren't gonna pay to send

665
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:13,770
someone else or a dinner or gala and my

666
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,750
crazy stuff I went on LinkedIn and said

667
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:18,629
hey what do you guys think about doing a

668
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:21,090
Midwest and I think over 15,000 people

669
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:23,309
looked at my host and probably four or

670
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,559
five hundred messages and text messages

671
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:28,530
so literally three months ago we decided

672
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:30,960
to do this and or January 31st we're

673
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:32,970
having it so I would encourage it's

674
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,040
really not that farm and drive and

675
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:37,920
there's going to be a lot of amazing

676
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,870
women that want to mentor and coach in

677
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,390
fact we're doing a silent auction and I

678
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:44,699
have three sisto's that are we're going

679
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:48,750
to auction off for to sit and have

680
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:50,850
coffee with them in our piece and I mean

681
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,920
can you imagine like it's specially for

682
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:54,750
people that are new you're going to be

683
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,940
around a lot of really powerful people

684
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,290
that have accomplished a lot so it's

685
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,140
really about giving back to the

686
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,730
community and the first year we know

687
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,040
we'll have most people from Columbus but

688
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:09,410
the goal is to make it Midwest so that

689
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:17,850
we can outreach just Ohio as well did

690
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:21,150
what do you feel about the so that's

691
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,889
another talk that I do when you look at

692
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,809
all their domains in cyber you don't

693
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:26,940
have to have a technical background so a

694
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:28,649
lot of times you can come in is a

695
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,990
project like so you said you're a

696
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:34,110
project manager is that kind of what got

697
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:36,570
your foot into cyber or were you in

698
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:39,809
cyber we're already in Pennington so

699
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:42,750
it's not even technical and but given so

700
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:44,879
much engineering work flow it just

701
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:47,100
became like an advisor for the part that

702
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,830
we conceived of had an image reservation

703
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,260
in today so that's a perfect transition

704
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:54,149
where because you probably became really

705
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:56,190
familiar with the terms and you had to

706
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,870
start to understand what those things

707
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,880
were wrapped around projects and what

708
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,649
that looked like so to be a good project

709
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,600
manager you'd understand those things so

710
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:06,590
it was it's probably somewhat of an

711
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:11,159
easier transition for you the chimú um

712
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:12,030
the have any of you guys ever heard of

713
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,399
Helen Patton

714
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:17,349
it's either the name I don't call so she

715
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:22,029
basically the system for the Ohio State

716
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:23,889
University go bucs I'm sorry but but she

717
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,190
her and I had this conversation all the

718
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:27,968
time

719
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:30,159
and she hates when we say to women that

720
00:30:27,969 --> 00:30:32,019
you don't have to be technical to go

721
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,330
into cybersecurity and I agree with that

722
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:38,440
so there's been many times when an

723
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:40,869
adventure young girls and their dads and

724
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,119
their older people have said to him oh

725
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:44,949
you just need to go in sales not saying

726
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:46,539
there's anything against sales but I

727
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,940
want I think part of it is we need to

728
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:50,950
encourage people regardless of their

729
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,169
background that they can make those

730
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:55,539
moves and you know people that have

731
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:58,149
worked at a help desk a lot of people

732
00:30:55,539 --> 00:31:00,399
started as a help desk person and then

733
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:04,199
they moved into the sock so some of the

734
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,199
older people where did you guys start

735
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:21,399
well people know I hold and did you did

736
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:23,830
you find that having those fundamental

737
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:25,418
basics really helped you in security

738
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:29,769
because you understood those basics and

739
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:36,039
you can just pad on 30 yes so my current

740
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:38,559
role in sales but there's something more

741
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:40,629
frustrating than talking to a sales

742
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,359
engineer who really doesn't understand

743
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:44,289
the technical aspects of what the of the

744
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,718
product that they're selling

745
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:48,789
yeah and then when you do ask technical

746
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:50,999
aspects of what they are selling

747
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:56,889
bohemian so they have to bring in a

748
00:31:50,999 --> 00:32:00,070
another engineer who may or may not be

749
00:31:56,889 --> 00:32:02,408
knowledgeable about this is a platform

750
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:05,439
that you're trying to get information

751
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:07,419
about so not saying that you don't have

752
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,029
to have the security background to

753
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:13,479
participate in two domains yeah cyber

754
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:16,929
but it helps when you definitely have

755
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:20,009
that base level fundamental

756
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:24,629
understanding of not only technology but

757
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:28,149
of what you're even selling for a vendor

758
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:28,899
engagement standpoint now you know I've

759
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:31,359
met

760
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:35,109
programmers and again vaidya's

761
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:37,049
programmers but that programmers you

762
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:39,939
don't even know what l that means and

763
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:42,908
how are you get a program an application

764
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,889
that has LDAP to enter into Active

765
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:46,450
Directory you have absolutely no

766
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:49,418
understanding what that protocol does

767
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:51,940
how important it is for you to not party

768
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:55,389
and tell that password to your

769
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,769
application well anything so when I also

770
00:32:55,389 --> 00:32:59,349
talking about communication they didn't

771
00:32:56,769 --> 00:33:01,450
cover this I think sometimes we in

772
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:03,549
security we tend to want audience to

773
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:05,559
understand security and that's the let's

774
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:08,679
be quite frank they don't but it would

775
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:10,690
be like me asking one of you to do open

776
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:11,799
heart surgery on your kids I had one

777
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,330
person tell me they were going to

778
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:15,009
YouTube it and I was like I'm pretty

779
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:18,399
sure your wife is not gonna allow you to

780
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:20,739
have open-heart surgery and so I think

781
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,238
we speak a lot of language and for us

782
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:25,029
that have been around there are so many

783
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:25,809
acronyms in every industry that mean the

784
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:27,460
same thing

785
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:29,080
completely opposite things in different

786
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,239
industry so when you're talking to a

787
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,739
business person you may use an acronym

788
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:33,999
they have no idea what you're talking

789
00:33:32,739 --> 00:33:35,109
about and they think it's completely and

790
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:37,119
they're like completely lost because it

791
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:40,418
has nothing for security

792
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,529
so understanding the business but and

793
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:47,759
then how many are you familiar with the

794
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:51,279
boss so if you look at the last 15 years

795
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:54,330
the top reason why apps get broken into

796
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:58,179
how much do you think that's changed

797
00:33:54,330 --> 00:34:01,418
it's pretty much zero they've had to

798
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:03,669
combine things because there's more but

799
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:06,399
like sequel injection and buffer buffer

800
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:07,659
overflows Cross's scripting easy things

801
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,520
that we shouldn't be talking about but

802
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:12,520
part of the poem is application

803
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,009
developers a lot of the programs they

804
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,839
don't teach secure coding so they teach

805
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,490
people on a code and I've never

806
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:20,710
understood why we're I mean having these

807
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:22,868
conversations because where all the

808
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:25,809
information you want to protect is

809
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:28,599
either in the app or the database and so

810
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:30,940
if we're not building secure apps you

811
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,919
know by the way where do we get a lot of

812
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,139
it we go to libraries so I see this all

813
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:38,138
the time where they pull the library

814
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:40,149
they bring someone in to do a test they

815
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,720
fix all that but guess what they never

816
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:43,909
go back to the libraries and

817
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:46,158
solvents vulnerabilities and so this is

818
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:49,429
why I'm saying if you have interest in

819
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,470
the app app security it's definitely a

820
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:53,750
great way to go because that's where

821
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:56,388
most of the data is and so I think it's

822
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:58,010
really important to understand that and

823
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:00,050
then you know and like what you were

824
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,390
saying it's true and I think part of us

825
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:04,790
our security as security experts is when

826
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,859
they don't understand we need to have a

827
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:09,500
conversation with them and explain to

828
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:11,480
them but in a way that is meaningful and

829
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,330
useful for both parties

830
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,760
because how many of you like being told

831
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:18,049
that you're dumb or stupid we have no

832
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,830
idea what you're doing or you're

833
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,599
incompetent

834
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:23,119
I'm pretty sure none of us want to have

835
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,760
that conversation and sometimes the way

836
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,770
security people approach other people in

837
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,750
the business that's how they made you

838
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,560
sell and for people that have worked on

839
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,960
helpdesk

840
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,250
I mean God you love anyone that's worked

841
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,180
on it helped us a long time because you

842
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:40,369
have to do it a lot of crazy but if you

843
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,919
treat people well to help them in

844
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:44,240
security operation centers I mean

845
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,470
they're like that she was at hugest

846
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,379
advocates from the security perspective

847
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:50,240
because they see everything and they

848
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,420
also know what's normal and what's a

849
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,180
banal most of us in security we don't

850
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:58,310
really know that other than logs and you

851
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:01,399
fine tune them but if someone completely

852
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:02,869
rewrote an application to do something

853
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,550
different lustre people would never know

854
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:06,800
and so unless someone called us and said

855
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:09,200
okay something's not looking right so

856
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,619
having those relationships that cross

857
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,049
the lanes rather and the security

858
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:18,040
operations the business side is going

859
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:21,190
important so that answer your person

860
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,190
anybody else

861
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,370
[Music]

862
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:48,310
our chapter was actually to show how we

863
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,310
were doing it

864
00:36:54,150 --> 00:37:02,460
have patience security yourself that's

865
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:06,510
the number one driver it might because

866
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:11,099
if you don't love this you're not going

867
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:15,809
to stay in it's just that you think you

868
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:17,670
know we're losing people at rapid speed

869
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:21,390
and they think one of the reasons that I

870
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:23,130
wanted to do this talk is within in

871
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:25,500
small room as you drive this profit with

872
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:29,190
large organizations how many of you are

873
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:32,160
at risk and then it and how many people

874
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:34,230
are more on the technical side in most

875
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,828
large organizations those two groups are

876
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:40,369
the thought or there's that kind of

877
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:42,329
weirdness between what that looks like

878
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:44,339
in one of the things that I've been

879
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:45,839
working with a lot of really large

880
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:48,390
companies is how do we start

881
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,009
cross-training people not that I want to

882
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:52,440
take a pen tester and make them a risk

883
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,210
person or vice versa but can you imagine

884
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,660
what the conversations would look like

885
00:37:54,210 --> 00:38:00,299
if you both understood both sides what

886
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:03,000
that rule was what that requirement is

887
00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:05,190
and compliance and security are two

888
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,440
different things but they do meet in the

889
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,000
middle and they do integrate in my

890
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,520
opinion some people will say that it's

891
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,650
off but the way we do business is to

892
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,259
because this security was built on

893
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:18,059
checking boxes and how many of you how

894
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,579
many of the breaches do you think I show

895
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:23,880
hands where people actually compliant

896
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:25,349
when the breach happened and with PCI

897
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,640
you're only compliant to the moment of

898
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:28,650
the brief so technically you were

899
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,240
complaining now what the breach happened

900
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,970
one second later you're not removing it

901
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,740
but if you think about all that a lot of

902
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:37,618
them could check the boxes and say we

903
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:40,109
did all of these things so it's if I

904
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:41,520
think part of learning and growing is

905
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,270
understanding the different areas of

906
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,029
security

907
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:47,809
I mean having physical security a lot of

908
00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:51,270
times is completely segmented from

909
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:53,369
operations from IT from security

910
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:56,210
whatever however it's grouped and I

911
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:58,440
think think about like physical security

912
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:03,539
does everything and physical security

913
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,250
have an IP it does so if we're not

914
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:07,730
looking at physical screen who can name

915
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:13,430
a breach where physicals

916
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:15,109
was issue yeah t.j.maxx two of the

917
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:18,890
wireless who there was their guests

918
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:20,029
wireless so you know and that's not just

919
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,009
that completely it's not a hunter

920
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:24,560
percent physical but being able to have

921
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:26,600
that access from the outside to end so

922
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,640
if the better conversations we can have

923
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,920
and I think there's a big push right now

924
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,930
to cross chain people so we can have

925
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:36,410
better conversations and I do you think

926
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:39,410
it'll help us on our journey because

927
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:40,970
when you think about organized I think

928
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,368
cyber security to organized crime it's

929
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:44,990
the new mafia today but it's not people

930
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:47,900
going out necessarily shooting people

931
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:50,589
but um but if you think about the damage

932
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:53,900
that can be done from a security

933
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:57,650
incident can be huge I mean if they

934
00:39:53,900 --> 00:40:00,440
could shut down ATMs for more than 48

935
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:02,330
hours we shut down our food line people

936
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:05,180
will lose their excuse me things they'll

937
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:08,859
lose their and but that's all

938
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:12,890
backed by an IP and technology and so

939
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:15,200
how many people think that people

940
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:17,720
process and technology problem or a

941
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:22,330
technology process and people or any

942
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,330
mixture what would you say security is

943
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:31,220
so in my opinion I think people process

944
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,410
and technology are the order because if

945
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,450
you have only one of those it doesn't

946
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:38,629
work so they don't need to work together

947
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:40,899
and does technology do pretty much

948
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:43,609
exactly what you tell it to do

949
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:51,619
so when breaches occur is in a human

950
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:54,950
error or is it a technology err great

951
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:56,570
and so and is not that all people are

952
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:59,180
bad but we're human the guy I remember

953
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:00,560
this has many years ago worked with

954
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:04,430
other than the largest blue cross group

955
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,680
skills and they spent I think almost 1

956
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:09,080
billion dollar other data center and

957
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,190
their physical security and the company

958
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,580
I worked for at the time when they

959
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:16,580
brought us in we dressed up as Verizon

960
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:19,580
the person at the front desk led us into

961
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,920
their server room we had complete

962
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,170
administrative rights of

963
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,030
all over the data center and they also

964
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:27,370
forgot to turn the firewall on between

965
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:31,660
the data center and their corporate and

966
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:33,549
we owned both within five minutes so was

967
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:37,240
that a technology problem or was that

968
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:38,560
icky and I was not one of the most

969
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,390
uncomfortable meetings when I was

970
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,279
sitting with their executives and trying

971
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,660
to get not everyone to get fired and I

972
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,570
basically said this is a learning

973
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:48,069
exercise and they fixed it but and it

974
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,530
wasn't on purpose and you may have this

975
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:52,720
huge deadline and it just got forgot it

976
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,770
just was forgotten so that's why I think

977
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,230
we always have to make sure we

978
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:59,850
communicate and talk and that constant

979
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,850
learning is a huge component of that

980
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:25,150
there's something I mean not everyone

981
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:27,610
agrees with me on this but I'm a firm

982
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,930
believer like I've always been in sales

983
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,340
and business development and one of the

984
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,259
things I've always is really tried to

985
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:35,290
understand the industry and I'm not

986
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:38,320
extremely technical but I don't I think

987
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:40,540
it's difficult to manage or help drive a

988
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:44,620
project or do anything if you don't

989
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:47,080
understand what you're doing so I mean I

990
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:49,770
get I actually just I've been talking to

991
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:53,410
a lot of colleges or they have different

992
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:55,620
teams and I get asked all the time would

993
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:59,799
you recommend getting my master's degree

994
00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:01,810
before I have you having training and of

995
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,920
course I was when I'm in colleges I'm

996
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,799
like how do I say that

997
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,270
 even something in trouble but

998
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,570
you know what I always tell people is if

999
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:12,610
someone's paying for it but not that I

1000
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:14,820
would say go for it because that may not

1001
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:17,770
always be paid for in the future

1002
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:19,750
but I would recommend going getting

1003
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:22,509
experience and almost every major

1004
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,920
company can write off five thousand two

1005
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:27,400
hundred fifty dollars for tuition

1006
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,860
reimbursement and they work with

1007
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,120
non-traditional colleges they don't even

1008
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:34,280
really care if you're getting a degree

1009
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:37,250
but use someone else's dollars

1010
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,830
because I mean I don't know how people

1011
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:41,420
do anything the average cost for a

1012
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:43,490
four-year degree is a hundred to three

1013
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,350
hundred thousand dollars and I don't

1014
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:47,990
know about any of you but by the time I

1015
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:50,150
was 16 to the time I was 18 there was no

1016
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:51,410
way I could potentially ever make an 8

1017
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,230
the Bassam

1018
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:56,240
so I think I think you have to really

1019
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:59,810
figure out what your destiny destiny is

1020
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:03,680
I would also argue that very rarely do I

1021
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:05,509
see a master's degree required for cyber

1022
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,839
security growth and even a lot of system

1023
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:10,520
roles required to sebastio lowers so I

1024
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,500
think it's just really what you're up to

1025
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,750
and I would again at Mozza me college

1026
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,760
education is not a good thing it's just

1027
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:20,330
I think you have to look at what that

1028
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,880
looks like and you either want to be 152

1029
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:25,460
toters and enter 300 or 400 thousand

1030
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,720
before you have your first job and a lot

1031
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,550
of times when people get masters they

1032
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,859
also assume that they're going to get

1033
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,240
paid a huge amount of money and when you

1034
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,220
don't have experience you generally

1035
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,140
aren't going to be able to yield really

1036
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:40,120
high I mean you can get there but your

1037
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:40,120
first job isn't gonna generally do that

1038
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:51,950
yeah a week but you're at the top of

1039
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:54,530
your game it's very sloppy and even I

1040
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:56,419
would say like the people promise we

1041
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:59,750
have a girl named Marissa ball she works

1042
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:01,280
at American Electric Power before she

1043
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:04,390
got in service to kids she actually just

1044
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,560
did blood samples at Ohio health and

1045
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:08,420
she's self-taught herself she taught

1046
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:12,049
herself how to do Linux she set up a lab

1047
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:14,390
and when she was interviewed at AEP they

1048
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:17,270
interviewed 35 people and all of them

1049
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:19,759
had experience she had no experience and

1050
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:21,500
she was one of their top choices because

1051
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,050
of all the initiative she took tumor on

1052
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,640
her own and one of the things when I

1053
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:28,480
mentor people and I would encourage you

1054
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:31,040
in this Center one of my requirements is

1055
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,050
if you're if anyone is a bucket and

1056
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,360
there's a huge saying about paying

1057
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:38,450
forward and I'm a huge component of that

1058
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:40,670
so if you had mentors in your life that

1059
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:42,919
have helped you then you also need to do

1060
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:45,140
that because if everyone mentored one

1061
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,359
person we could really change

1062
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:50,150
some of the idea dynamics of what our

1063
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:52,549
industry looks like and I just feel like

1064
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:55,609
it's I think it's important to give back

1065
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:57,950
because if all you do is take then your

1066
00:45:55,609 --> 00:46:00,589
opportunities are limited so all for all

1067
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:02,569
of you working in cyber did you apply

1068
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:07,578
blindly it might show me hands did you

1069
00:46:02,569 --> 00:46:09,829
just apply for job and get it okay but I

1070
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:12,109
mean it does happen and then how many of

1071
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:13,700
you have jobs because you use someone

1072
00:46:12,109 --> 00:46:15,220
and they recommended you or refers you

1073
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:19,220
or told you about it

1074
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:24,169
so that's kind of the norm and I will

1075
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:26,419
say I think when you get involved just

1076
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:28,430
getting to know different people like

1077
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:31,190
Paula and I used to work together and I

1078
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:33,140
encouraged him like because he was great

1079
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:37,000
in siren I'm like we need to bring you

1080
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:38,690
to the good side it's really fun um and

1081
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,609
you know I mean you have any

1082
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:42,740
conversations did you and I have about

1083
00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:45,170
that we talked about at the time and now

1084
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:47,629
you're doing phenomenal in the industry

1085
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:50,630
but sometimes it's finding that person

1086
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:52,519
to encourage you to take the risk but

1087
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:57,369
being willing to hope you open and learn

1088
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:57,368
is important was this helpful

1089
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:03,759
Constance do you have any information on

1090
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:03,759
youth programs

1091
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:20,598
young girls that are stem well I could

1092
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:23,089
do some research if you want to email me

1093
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:25,009
I didn't know hi OED so I also am I

1094
00:47:23,089 --> 00:47:27,980
found a member of Ohio cyber women and

1095
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:30,500
our focus is taking sixth grade girls to

1096
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,990
12th grade girls and we've done to

1097
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:35,240
caption we call them cyber games because

1098
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:38,569
another thing that's interesting in

1099
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,399
cyber for the women in the audience when

1100
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:42,380
you look at descriptions do you feel

1101
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:47,299
like they're written more for a man

1102
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:49,759
versus alone so I was just at this huge

1103
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:51,920
conference for our Ohio jobs and I

1104
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:54,289
brought this up where there's all these

1105
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,769
studies that Givaudan job descriptions

1106
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:58,760
they're written more from a masculine

1107
00:47:57,769 --> 00:48:01,970
perspectives

1108
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:04,250
and so a lot of women tend to not apply

1109
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:07,850
for jobs unless they come 80 100 % of

1110
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:09,590
the requirements most men will lecornu

1111
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:12,529
studies will apply for a job with 30

1112
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:13,700
percent of requirements so and I'm not

1113
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:15,530
saying that's good or better or

1114
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:18,890
indifferent but it's just the reality of

1115
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:22,940
it so there are a lot of organizations

1116
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:25,940
popping up now there is another one that

1117
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:27,109
I also am on the board of and whereas

1118
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,000
the reason I'm on these boards is

1119
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:31,090
because I'm passionate about giving back

1120
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,770
and and trying to work with the problem

1121
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:36,590
and I don't know thought anyone in this

1122
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:38,720
area of it is called ICM CP which is the

1123
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:40,310
international consortium of minority and

1124
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,100
women in cybersecurity and there's

1125
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:47,180
scholarships for that and so even like

1126
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:49,580
the empower group part of our goal is to

1127
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:51,640
give new people scholarships to to

1128
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:54,140
encourage them to go into the industry

1129
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,810
so I'll look and see if there's any here

1130
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:59,420
locally and we have a ton in Columbus

1131
00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:01,490
that are kind of popping them and I know

1132
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:03,740
or do they do this here because I know

1133
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:07,490
everyone's different legen Dublin Ohio

1134
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:09,919
which is a suburb they which isn't more

1135
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:12,109
of an upscale suburb they actually took

1136
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,400
an old Verizon building and turned it

1137
00:49:12,109 --> 00:49:19,160
into a stem program in cybersecurity in

1138
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,440
technology and science and math are so

1139
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,629
they're not giving the typical curve

1140
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,550
like pathways that you wouldn't

1141
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:28,490
generally in high school where are these

1142
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:30,770
kids which only have internships and get

1143
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:32,479
involved do they do that in any of the

1144
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:35,810
schools here they're starting to do that

1145
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:41,780
more and more in Columbus you can do you

1146
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:48,259
got school here's you can do coops where

1147
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:51,020
you already pitched your requirements to

1148
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:53,420
graduate and you have fruit berries you

1149
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:55,790
know it's a co-op program and then they

1150
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:59,090
have partnerships with businesses that

1151
00:49:55,790 --> 00:50:01,369
you know - but they're from what I see

1152
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:02,930
they're limited yeah so you can't just

1153
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:04,220
choose whatever you want unless you

1154
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:07,779
actually think the initiative to go out

1155
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:11,799
and say I want to go this place new

1156
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:14,020
my coop and go through the process of

1157
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:17,410
getting it vetted and prove out School

1158
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:22,870
Board which is hardly to do it

1159
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:26,770
especially when it comes to a field that

1160
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:29,170
is it predominantly and you know men our

1161
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:32,830
woman's music so like my daughter for

1162
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:37,510
example you know she she likes Tim she

1163
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:41,650
loves school and she's expressed desire

1164
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:42,190
to to do this and Harry Potter coated

1165
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:44,740
wine

1166
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:47,290
yeah and I'm like okay this is

1167
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:49,209
interesting you know and I'm not that

1168
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:51,130
type of parent or psychology to do

1169
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:53,610
anything as it usually that she chose

1170
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:58,000
this because she's never done anything

1171
00:50:53,610 --> 00:51:01,180
not aspect before and it's something

1172
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,830
that she wants to grow into and I want

1173
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:07,060
to foster that there's no organization

1174
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:13,000
later of in the Lexington area or young

1175
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:16,900
women or for youth for that example for

1176
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,390
youth at all in regards to security to

1177
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:22,780
call me brown until you get flight

1178
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:25,120
middle school Hospital so well and when

1179
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:28,300
I come interesting is that the studies

1180
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,920
are also showing I don't know about you

1181
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,690
news but when I was in sixth grade I was

1182
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,160
not thinking about what I was gonna do

1183
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:35,200
secretly

1184
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,730
but this days are showing that kids by

1185
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,669
sixth grade know what they're gonna do

1186
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:42,010
which that just blows me away I think it

1187
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:44,320
changes a lot I mean it depends on

1188
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:46,930
hearings but I mean you should maybe

1189
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:50,560
talk to I'm not trying to throw the is a

1190
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:53,140
board or work but um you have to talk to

1191
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,910
some of the groups in see if you can do

1192
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:57,100
something like that because thinking I'm

1193
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:58,750
just doing like that so I when we do I

1194
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:00,670
capture the flag for love

1195
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,530
sixth grade girls which is predominantly

1196
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:05,470
sixth grade we buy them all raspberry

1197
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:07,840
pies and we teach them out of low tone

1198
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:10,439
we teach them how their code a few games

1199
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:12,970
and we teach them some basic Linux code

1200
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,580
moving out like a lock-picking village

1201
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:17,980
we loved we had old computers that were

1202
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:20,330
donated they start pulling those apart

1203
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:22,430
and we walk through the parts

1204
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:24,770
we sold both of the classes out in

1205
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:27,379
seminary basically we didn't sell we was

1206
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:29,720
free but kept filled with classes in 72

1207
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:32,690
hours and the girls when they left they

1208
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:34,370
were so excited I mean over like we're

1209
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:36,260
going to see you and you know five or

1210
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:38,029
six years since I grew security and

1211
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,650
we're trying to keep in touch with them

1212
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:42,260
so we're trying to make sure these girls

1213
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:43,640
and encouraged them to go and I mean for

1214
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:46,280
me I'm about mentoring everyone I'm

1215
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,049
really about inclusion versus separation

1216
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,960
because I think regardless of where

1217
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:52,520
people on the spectrum of how we think

1218
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,520
we have to figure out ways to work

1219
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:58,820
together so I would see if maybe you

1220
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:01,820
could talk to some of the groups and

1221
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:03,620
maybe a host like two of them a year

1222
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:05,810
because it's not I mean you need a

1223
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:07,759
little bit of money but you I'm pretty

1224
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:10,340
sure most companies have money for

1225
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,850
diversity inclusion and we have had no

1226
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:17,630
problem getting sponsorship out there

1227
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:20,600
even for like the Women's gala within a

1228
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:23,450
week of us putting it out we had like 20

1229
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:26,540
sponsors because people wanted to

1230
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:28,700
support what we were doing so you could

1231
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:30,980
basically get sponsors to pay for it and

1232
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,359
a lot of time going Cisco and some of

1233
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:35,750
the hardware people a lot of time you

1234
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:37,850
just donate hardware to so we need to

1235
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:39,230
take some orchestration but I would

1236
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:41,000
encourage that some of the things you

1237
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:42,920
can talk amongst the community and see

1238
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,710
if you guys have to do anything and

1239
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,390
start off slow because you want to you

1240
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:49,880
know you don't want to go from 0 to 100

1241
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:53,000
but start with 1 see where it's going

1242
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:55,820
and and yeah that's just one step

1243
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,160
towards the right direction but all we

1244
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:00,470
can see if I can find anything I'm just

1245
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,879
not familiar with this area but I mean

1246
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:05,890
if I can find something happy to say

1247
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:14,360
that you any other questions

1248
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:15,950
well thank you for yeah I don't think

1249
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,980
they do much of the security space there

1250
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:21,259
or for any games and things like that

1251
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:23,360
yeah they like girls that code and yeah

1252
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:25,310
yeah so I mean that's a good way it's up

1253
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,110
cyber security but it's kind of getting

1254
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:29,360
them in that stem and then they could

1255
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:31,610
potentially move in I'm good I think the

1256
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,350
other struggle is I don't know how many

1257
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:34,070
companies are gonna hire a high school

1258
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:34,910
kid

1259
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,460
just out of high school in the

1260
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:40,609
cybersecurity job they need to get some

1261
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:43,760
fundamentals but you know I do in Ohio

1262
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:45,980
I don't know polarizations test or it's

1263
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,260
getting close but they're requiring like

1264
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:50,270
cyber cleansing from kindergarten to

1265
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:53,240
twelfth grades to cybersecurity is going

1266
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:55,759
to be built in to curriculum it is more

1267
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:58,609
about more like teaching kids good

1268
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:01,220
habits online because obviously with

1269
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:02,660
bullying and everything else so we're

1270
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:04,310
trying to introduce one of those

1271
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:06,259
concepts that the goal is and hopefully

1272
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:10,250
that someone will find interest about

1273
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:12,430
cyber security space well thank you for

1274
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:12,430
coming
