1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:10,440
and you're good all right well I want to

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,380
welcome you to welcome to the keeping

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,928
your head in the clouds like your feet

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,340
on the ground well I'm going to do today

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:24,390
somebody walk you through some career

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,960
paths but I want you to think about a

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:33,120
little bit and what I want you to think

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:37,440
about right now is what is your and I'm

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,940
going to use the term dream job to each

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,280
one of us it's something a little

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:47,820
different for one person that may be

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:51,020
going after that pen test position for

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,390
somebody else it may be something in

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:56,910
management well I will tell you though

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,550
is no matter what you do there's work

16
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,529
involved and getting to that dream job

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:08,369
and I learned a long time ago though

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:12,119
that if you fail to plan that's a plan

19
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:16,229
to fail and what I would suggest to you

20
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:21,210
today is that right now during this time

21
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:23,850
period I want you to put on that idea of

22
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,089
a dream what do I want to do in the

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,570
future how can i mentor other people in

24
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:35,759
the future and help them to understand

25
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:39,479
what they want there it's an uphill

26
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:45,299
battle to get education it's uphill

27
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:46,979
battle to try to seek out the type of

28
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,210
education that you want need for that

29
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,600
dream job you need Mentors and I think

30
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,490
that during those uphill battles

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,070
you learn it's a it's a journey right

32
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,919
it's not just a destination it's a

33
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,798
journey you can really enjoy information

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,710
security I have for the past 17 years

35
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,740
I've really enjoyed it but I've only

36
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,859
enjoyed it because I learned that

37
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:17,840
every situation that you need The

38
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,250
Situation's themselves they will pass

39
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,530
but it's the relationships that you

40
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,640
build this is a networking that you have

41
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:31,530
is the opportunities that you take in

42
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:35,519
during those events there really build a

43
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:40,050
career so with that being said it's

44
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:43,560
awful bit about what I see is what's

45
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,970
happened in my life just briefly now I'm

46
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,920
going to tell you I'm just a good old

47
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:51,270
country boy from Kentucky

48
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:57,420
right I just happen to fall into this

49
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:59,580
job at this global corporation and it

50
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,859
just happened right it's just I walk in

51
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:06,930
they gave you know we all know that's

52
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:08,010
not bad I had a dream when I was back in

53
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:14,370
Berea

54
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:17,700
I I can remember in high school I hadn't

55
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,290
even seen a computer before but all of

56
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,320
my career planning things I wrote down

57
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:26,730
all of our Melek tropics I'll learn

58
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:29,340
about computers and I got a call I said

59
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,000
hey I've been laid off the job I was

60
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:37,230
working I got a call to say hey come to

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,650
Louisville Kentucky so I left my little

62
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,929
hometown my safety area and I moved up

63
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,510
here and I got a degree in Computer

64
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:49,830
Engineering and I thought man if I could

65
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:52,709
just get a job being a technician at a

66
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,690
big company you know maybe they'll give

67
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:57,300
me an opportunity and I thought that's

68
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:01,200
what I'll try to do so I said they go

69
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:03,120
I get bored real quick if you know me at

70
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,950
all you'll find out that get bored

71
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:11,310
really quickly being a being at the

72
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,200
computer technician level is great but

73
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,630
then I wanted to expand I wanted to set

74
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,690
up facilities I wanted to set up

75
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:24,200
networks I wanted to do the types of

76
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:29,850
things that helped me expand the company

77
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:31,680
so I literally literally for three years

78
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:36,000
I've traveled on the road setting up

79
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,740
facilities guess what if you've ever

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,490
worked on traveling on the road for

81
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,730
three years

82
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,080
egg is old and if you don't believe me I

83
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:47,430
got some friends in the back you can

84
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:49,380
testify to that the point I want to make

85
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,900
to you is while I was out there

86
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,900
traveling on the road I was building my

87
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,179
career I was thinking what do I need to

88
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,969
know about in order to make the next

89
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,700
level the next step I want to go into

90
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,680
management I didn't want to go into just

91
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,000
any management I would go with the

92
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,250
information security

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,760
I had actually applied for a position in

94
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:19,590
physical security and my management team

95
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:22,530
being mentors to me created position for

96
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:25,469
me knowing my background and said you

97
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:29,190
created all these holes now we want you

98
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:32,580
to figure out how to fix all of it now

99
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,920
in 2002 that's about when that started

100
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,190
you know what I'll tell you is they send

101
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,300
me the training I got some training I

102
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,270
immediately came back to Louisville and

103
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,580
started working with a group of people

104
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:47,099
who worked in information security to

105
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,870
form the Issa chapter here locally

106
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,900
I remember given the first twenty

107
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:55,290
dollars during a meeting and saying here

108
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:59,310
let's get this thing started and the

109
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:02,640
point I wanna drive to you is I do it

110
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:05,250
for selfish reasons I wanted to learn

111
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:10,159
from other people and there's nothing

112
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:15,480
wrong with that as long as you give back

113
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,820
now when I start thinking about all the

114
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:22,590
different experiences I've had as a

115
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:25,140
result of being with the ISA actually

116
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:28,919
helped start the eye I see squared

117
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:33,599
chapter here I actually helped to work

118
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:35,969
with at one time at a wasp chapter I'm

119
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,909
definitely a member of F regard I

120
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:41,639
volved in the community what I suggest

121
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:44,938
to you is if you have a plan to be in

122
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:48,329
the InfoSec career field get involved

123
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:50,249
with these if you fail to reach out

124
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:51,839
beyond the company you work for today

125
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:56,849
don't blame your company for not

126
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:59,610
promoting it's up to you to get your own

127
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:02,849
education and we'll talk about that a

128
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:05,729
little bit more why I will tell you is

129
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:08,610
after three decades of a career with

130
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:13,318
companies I met I have the opportunity

131
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:17,129
to retire and I'm retiring on my own

132
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,779
I know it's my choice you know what I

133
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:22,169
retired I can go out and get another job

134
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:26,329
pretty quickly it should be pretty easy

135
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:31,229
well guess what that's not by accident I

136
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:33,629
put myself out there and what I'm

137
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:37,079
encouraging you to do just think about

138
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:40,229
what are you doing today to help

139
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:45,360
yourself move towards that next job the

140
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:47,699
next career goal that you have and I'm

141
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,139
going to show you some pictures of some

142
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,339
things that we may overlook sometimes

143
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,300
when you think about technology and

144
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,829
you're saying well I don't know what I

145
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,469
need a study I don't know what I need to

146
00:07:55,829 --> 00:08:05,059
do the vehicle here is an uber

147
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:05,058
Z mine what this vehicle represents

148
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:13,979
there we go uh its autonomous okay well

149
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:19,339
guess what it didn't exist five years

150
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:22,979
ago ten years not not like this right

151
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:26,699
uber is investing in the neighborhood of

152
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:32,429
simply I think it's like 7.5 billion

153
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:37,889
dollars into this why why would you

154
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:42,448
invest into that yep guess what there's

155
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:45,149
people that can't drive today it's for

156
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:47,849
some companies it's a high cost the

157
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:49,410
company I happened to work for we have

158
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:54,180
trouble finding drivers

159
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:57,900
we're going to replace drivers when you

160
00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:00,689
look at the second picture up here it's

161
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:04,140
gentleman is working in Washington DC to

162
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:08,100
get legislation passed so that we can

163
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:09,780
have quote-unquote autonomous vehicles

164
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,070
driving on the interstate next to you

165
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:17,280
and you're on vacation I want you to

166
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:21,630
think about that let that soak in we

167
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,959
can't get drivers we're going to take

168
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:28,070
care of business in a different way

169
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,070
that's not what we're used to

170
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,380
I am bringing up some things that UPS is

171
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,260
doing and I want you to understand that

172
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:40,350
I've seen changes over the past 34 years

173
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:44,460
that you can't even imagine I remember

174
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:48,060
us using machines with tubes in tow and

175
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:51,960
now we're the first company to have an

176
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:55,680
authorized by the FAA it's uh it's uh

177
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,810
it's basically a drone airline and we're

178
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,900
already using this I'm not talking about

179
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:05,219
tomorrow I'm talking about it's already

180
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:11,850
been going on in fact we got into this a

181
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:15,210
few years ago we started delivering

182
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:18,680
blood supplies to remote parts of the

183
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:23,520
world to help out third world countries

184
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:26,160
before we did this so I have some

185
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:29,220
insight track on some of this right the

186
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,589
company you work at may or may not but

187
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,490
you're in the room with peers that may

188
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:38,850
know some of this stuff you can dream

189
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,230
for a security job but you need to have

190
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,120
some foundation and that's why I'm

191
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,490
talking about keeping your feet on the

192
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,870
ground you need to do some research you

193
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:50,250
need to understand what's going on with

194
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:54,360
it a little bit the picture right in the

195
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:57,690
middle is a warehouse how employees do

196
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:01,770
you see in the warehouse do you know

197
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:03,180
what that is it's an amazon fulfillment

198
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:08,410
center

199
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:13,030
that's automated today amazon has over a

200
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:16,719
hundred thousand robotic workers that go

201
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:20,110
and pick up devices oh I say devices

202
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,420
packages now I want you to think about

203
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,940
that for a minute how many of you must

204
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,680
see a raised hand here how many of you

205
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,810
have received the package from Amazon

206
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,670
[Music]

207
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:34,810
why is it why did you gonna have a

208
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:40,630
Walmart why didn't you go over to Sears

209
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:43,689
and buy that from them it's easier

210
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:49,240
how about cheaper a lot of times I find

211
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:51,610
things cheaper yeah the point I want to

212
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:56,610
make with this slide again it's

213
00:11:51,610 --> 00:12:04,240
efficient do the robots get sleepy

214
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:08,410
are they hackable what if I pack this

215
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,500
drone or this warehouse or this

216
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:14,589
automated system that's driving down the

217
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,570
road beside you who's taking care of

218
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,000
those things this is all stuff that's

219
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,430
happening today I'm not talking about

220
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,760
like far off into the future this is

221
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:30,400
today are you there are you studying to

222
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,970
learn some of this and when I say it

223
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:37,840
that way is this something you desire to

224
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:41,020
do a lot of us have heard of something

225
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,300
called blockchain in back in 2017

226
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,400
Joaquin was just the rage their

227
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,010
blockchain is blockchain that blocking

228
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,470
it but died down right how many of you

229
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:53,610
all hear about blockchain today you all

230
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:57,160
hear about it yeah it's like where to go

231
00:12:53,610 --> 00:13:00,100
I'll tell you where it went there was a

232
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,050
lot of people who jumped on board they

233
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,260
jumped on board to you know make that

234
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:08,500
fast dollar but they've had out their

235
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:11,170
way well what has happened is there some

236
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,210
frameworks that came out of that there's

237
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:16,240
some tools that have come out of that

238
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,670
that have survived that initial

239
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,029
bubble of everybody trying to go do

240
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,889
something now I could sit here and

241
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:27,189
describe all of these to you but I want

242
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:29,050
you to remember hyper ledger and I want

243
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:31,629
you to go through I want you to look at

244
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:34,618
the hyper ledger you know and what it

245
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:38,230
actually does it's it's basically

246
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:41,649
allowing us to see how lakhtin can be

247
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:46,389
put into work for businesses how can I

248
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:50,350
take that technology and improve the

249
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:53,170
workflow at my business creating a safer

250
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,540
business I can tell you right now that's

251
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,670
already in use in India they have a

252
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,459
problem they have a few people over

253
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:05,559
there and it's hard to keep track of all

254
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:08,529
those individuals two years ago they

255
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:11,730
implemented information security through

256
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:17,769
blockchain to help protect themselves

257
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:19,209
against fraud two years ago letting you

258
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:22,959
know about blockchain and how it's been

259
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:26,079
implemented today I can tell you my

260
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:29,138
company is implementing yet already in a

261
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,939
lot of different ways if you don't know

262
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:34,480
what's going on in the world of

263
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:36,759
blockchain I would submit to you as a

264
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,079
security professional for somebody

265
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:43,600
looking to get into it what is going to

266
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:46,929
happen when this type of the system

267
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,819
comes in to your environment in your ass

268
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:50,769
to make sure it's secure

269
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:55,509
you're asked about it you're asked to do

270
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:59,740
those things that you did if you don't

271
00:14:55,509 --> 00:15:02,079
know it's going to be hard to keep up

272
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:07,480
well you can't learn it tomorrow you

273
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:10,479
need to start today the next slide I'm

274
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:14,499
going to show you is the one that most

275
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:18,309
people they're like well how do I go

276
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:24,069
about getting there and this is how you

277
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:28,179
go you step back for a minute and you

278
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:33,069
drink you think to yourself what do I

279
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:35,429
want to do in the next two years the

280
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:37,990
next five years

281
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:40,629
do I want to retire when I get to a

282
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:44,889
certain age you have to have a plan for

283
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:47,889
that right if I want to be a security

284
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:50,649
professional in a particular area I need

285
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:53,679
to do research in it I need to do what

286
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:57,809
it takes to move forward in that

287
00:15:53,679 --> 00:16:01,499
particular area it starts with a dream

288
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:04,990
remember I want to be a technician I

289
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:06,610
didn't want to stay attached I'm sure

290
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,730
that each of you probably don't want to

291
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:13,389
stay in the role you're in today some

292
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:16,299
may that's fine but for most of us we

293
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:20,230
want to do different things we want

294
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:23,439
different experiences you have to set

295
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:27,519
goals you have to dream a little bit so

296
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:29,110
right now during this session I want you

297
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:35,259
pull your phone out I know you've got

298
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:38,860
one and I want you to write down two or

299
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:42,459
three goals maybe maybe one something

300
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,829
that you would like to learn about okay

301
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:47,919
go ahead start doing it

302
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:49,899
don't you know will embarrass me go

303
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,790
ahead and start writing now something

304
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:53,290
that you'd like to learn about as I go

305
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,949
through the presentation maybe will give

306
00:16:53,290 --> 00:17:01,899
you some other ideas as you write those

307
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:06,760
things down think about three steps it

308
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:12,599
might take to get yourself moving

309
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:14,490
towards that goal three steps

310
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,188
and then the last thing I want to ask

311
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:20,659
you to do during this session is to set

312
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:23,759
a calendar event for his calendar

313
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:27,449
reminder to act on one of those three

314
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:30,590
things and if you'll take the time to do

315
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:34,139
that right now what's going to happen is

316
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:36,779
you're more likely to go ahead and start

317
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:40,559
doing that than people who don't write

318
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:43,409
it down I've built three houses guess

319
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:46,789
what I had to do I had to start with the

320
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:49,559
blueprints I had to get the idea right

321
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:54,269
this is what you're doing when you start

322
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:58,649
writing down what you want to do there's

323
00:17:54,269 --> 00:18:00,149
a little fella that I met years ago who

324
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:05,239
did the exact same thing I'm talking

325
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:08,178
about you all know who witness he is

326
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:13,429
who knows can you have yeah

327
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:13,429
who's witness he's part of the team that

328
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,720
absolutely without his contributions we

329
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,210
wouldn't be in here today most likely

330
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,320
because Internet wouldn't exist and we

331
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,960
wouldn't be able to do what we're doing

332
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,700
today it's pretty and it's pretty

333
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,860
interesting

334
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:35,690
you got Lifetime Achievement Awards and

335
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:40,258
some years back right like 10 years ago

336
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:43,049
why don't suggest to you is this what

337
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:46,620
does it take to learn what what does it

338
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:50,129
take to become an expert there are

339
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:56,158
individuals who tell us experience the

340
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:58,709
70% of knowledge experiences that if you

341
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,539
wrote down a goal and you're not working

342
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,970
towards that goal you're not figuring

343
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:07,980
out a way to get education towards that

344
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:10,549
goal right you're missing out on 70% of

345
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,129
the knowledge base that you could have

346
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:16,769
it's true that you can go to a mentor

347
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:21,320
take a little class you want to say take

348
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:24,760
a little class you know you take a

349
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,679
five-week course on how to do something

350
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,530
and you have a project that you put

351
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,180
together from it you're going to get 20%

352
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:33,370
cuz it's hands-on you're getting a

353
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,200
little bit of that I can tell you

354
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,840
there's people who think I didn't go to

355
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,030
that savings class because I didn't go

356
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,129
that sans class that's formal training

357
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,560
and they tell you everything they feed

358
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,970
it to you like the fire goes right

359
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,040
because I didn't go that sans class I'm

360
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:51,070
not qualified

361
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:53,500
well I'll submit to you it is i must

362
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,770
rather have somebody who's taking time

363
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:00,880
to go their home lab and in their home

364
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:04,360
lab developed understanding developed

365
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:08,710
the skill set on their own or with

366
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,840
friends so that they truly have the

367
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,870
ability to do the security that they're

368
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,990
thinking about doing I can't tell you

369
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:21,189
how many people that I've run into

370
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:22,540
during interviews who come in and I'll

371
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,130
ask them what are you doing to improve

372
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,190
yourself on a daily basis

373
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:30,760
the answer is locked up this class back

374
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:33,640
six months ago and lucky done with the

375
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,890
answers I haven't done anything I'm like

376
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,830
why you're missing the golden

377
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:41,230
opportunity here each of us have people

378
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,730
around us and if we don't we need to

379
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,840
figure out how to make friends and get

380
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:49,750
those folks close to us if you want to

381
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,060
advance your security career you can't

382
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,690
live in a vacuum and be a security

383
00:20:52,060 --> 00:21:00,450
professional it doesn't work that way

384
00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:05,530
now what if I told you with after he got

385
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:08,100
into his professional if I would guess

386
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:11,470
what what's doing today

387
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:16,870
any guesses so have you been in the

388
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:23,470
heard this before Witt is working in

389
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:26,189
China what did he create encryption for

390
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,690
the internet he's working in China to do

391
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:35,080
training students and universities over

392
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:36,870
there he's just a hippie the one doubt

393
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,990
do the NSA

394
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:43,600
and he's had fun too and now he's out

395
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,580
enjoying live food doing something else

396
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,139
that he wants today

397
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:51,370
the point again I want to drive to you

398
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:53,430
is you can have fun with this but you've

399
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,810
got to start you've got to get motivated

400
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:57,820
in the motivation you can't look at

401
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:02,110
somebody else and blame them this guy

402
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:03,790
starts from within so are most of us in

403
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:07,330
here security professionals kind of see

404
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:10,659
aresia hands yeah I'm not trying to make

405
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:12,870
you feel bad but I do want to ask you

406
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,790
some questions and see where you're at

407
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,870
mobile device knowledge does everybody

408
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:21,580
understand that

409
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:25,510
computers are dying the use of a laptop

410
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:27,790
is going away now is it going to go away

411
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:31,120
completely probably not there's gonna be

412
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:34,180
a handful them out there but I can tell

413
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:38,649
you just like that uber style car that

414
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:41,500
we saw I own a company that just

415
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:44,230
recently announced you can make 23

416
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:48,160
dollars an hour if you'll bring your car

417
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:49,120
and go deliver packages for us how is

418
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,680
that possible

419
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:56,949
I can go deliver packages with my car

420
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:59,380
it's on mobile device this mobile device

421
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:05,050
is enabling people who have a mobile

422
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:07,600
device to go out and make money if you

423
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:10,870
is a security practitioner don't

424
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,550
understand how mobile devices work my

425
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:17,379
question to you guys how can you secure

426
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:19,659
them especially when your companies are

427
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,750
starting to lean towards this mmm-hmm

428
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:27,840
now I happen to be a big advocate of

429
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:32,380
using guess what operating system on

430
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:36,480
mobile Android why it's the most

431
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:39,580
insecure thing out there right or is it

432
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,900
now let's think about business for a

433
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:48,710
minute how many people outside of the

434
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:53,510
United States have an iPhone

435
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:56,160
oh so now I'm looking globally right

436
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:59,820
should I think in my security career

437
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:03,450
about global expansion or just logo it's

438
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,620
up to you right I'm going to tell you

439
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:08,270
that you probably need to be thinking

440
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:13,050
global because the sock I work with

441
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:16,129
guess what they don't work in a building

442
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:18,510
anymore they work from their homes in

443
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:23,810
fact is they can probably work from a

444
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:26,010
phone at some point work a tablet is

445
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:29,520
what's going to keep the rest of the

446
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:31,830
world from doing this when you start

447
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,010
talking about managed services and I

448
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:37,020
know we saw here in the keynote upstairs

449
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:41,280
the use of mobile devices is far

450
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:44,670
surpassed the ability for asset

451
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:47,520
management you want to say that I can't

452
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:51,090
keep up with every single device so

453
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:56,070
maybe my security model needs to be a

454
00:24:51,090 --> 00:25:00,110
little different and making things at

455
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:02,520
the server in a little more secure maybe

456
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:08,360
maybe I need to think about that zero

457
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:12,960
trust model to a degree but I can't I

458
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:15,689
can't understand what that end user in

459
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,520
India who's on their Android device is

460
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,310
going to be doing or what somebody else

461
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,480
is doing to their system I have to make

462
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:28,290
sure my stuff is hard enough that theirs

463
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,360
is not going to affect me that's a

464
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,040
little different way of looking at it

465
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,429
we're going back to the centralized

466
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:39,389
model to a degree so just want to keep

467
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:42,570
keep those kinds of things in mind bring

468
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:44,780
your own device I I don't know that

469
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:47,990
we're ever going to get away from it I

470
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:50,670
think that what you're going to see is

471
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:54,420
this is only going to increase and as

472
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:57,780
time goes on companies aren't gonna

473
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:00,480
supply equipment to people companies are

474
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,860
going to supply the opportunity the

475
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,540
people are going to do where

476
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:09,000
they want to do will have restrictions

477
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:12,960
but the fact is if you're not thinking

478
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,190
this way you're living in yesterday and

479
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:20,820
you're going to be like the blacksmith

480
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:23,790
who shoots horses what did Henry Ford

481
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:26,250
say if I ask people what they want they

482
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:32,149
would have told me they want faster

483
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:35,460
horses not cars what I'm telling you is

484
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:38,070
the future of technology is not going to

485
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,460
look like it did yesterday and that's

486
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:46,200
where we're living right now a lot of us

487
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:51,510
so with that let's talk about SAS

488
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:53,880
solutions real quick SAS solutions when

489
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,370
I say SAS everybody gets excited because

490
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,600
it's really cool right it's in the cloud

491
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:02,870
I don't have to mess with it anymore

492
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,719
well let me tell you something about SAS

493
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:09,449
if you look at this slide what does it

494
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,900
tell you about power what do you see

495
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,900
here

496
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:19,790
well I'll tell you is and it's not

497
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:24,570
apples to apples comparison necessarily

498
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:28,889
but can you imagine your company getting

499
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:36,409
an application that turns around and in

500
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:40,740
19 days has 50 million users 50 million

501
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:45,260
19 days can you handle that you guys got

502
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:50,850
the servers ready plus the answer

503
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:53,910
there's no way it's already happy my

504
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:58,080
point is if you're living back you know

505
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:59,490
10 years ago you gotta you gotta break

506
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,559
this train of thought

507
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:06,390
you've got to get it to where you're

508
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:07,918
thinking how fast is business with you

509
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:10,710
probably didn't think about this too

510
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,710
much but when you signed up for this

511
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:16,169
conference you SAS

512
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:19,279
you think about when you were putting

513
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:22,919
your credentials in did you think about

514
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:25,909
who's securing that did the guys here at

515
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:31,590
the conference secure that so it's okay

516
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:33,929
I'm askin do you think they did who

517
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:38,459
checked it out it's one of the top 25

518
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:41,070
growing SAS applications out there I was

519
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:44,070
I was amazed by the diversity of the

520
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:46,820
people who are here today and I was told

521
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:51,178
it's because we use the event bright

522
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:52,649
because we used it it appeal to a

523
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,080
different audience than what we always

524
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:59,699
see at the approach that confidence

525
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:03,090
which is pretty cool if you're not into

526
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:06,720
what's cool and SAS as a security

527
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:09,629
professional I'm going to suggest that

528
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,240
you start looking because the truth of

529
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:17,659
the matter is this is what we're going

530
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,659
to be securing today and into the future

531
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,559
Wow

532
00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:31,600
the top providers or vice familiar the

533
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:34,879
AWFS your vice familiar with Azure right

534
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,830
what I would suggest is that there's new

535
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:39,850
technologies there even coming to what

536
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:45,019
we're familiar with from a standpoint of

537
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:47,959
cloud security I happen to be one of the

538
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:50,029
lucky few that gets to go down to

539
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,850
Florida every once a while and help

540
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:55,929
write test questions or exam questions

541
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:59,809
for the certified cloud security

542
00:29:55,929 --> 00:30:03,679
practitioner professional well guess

543
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:05,779
what if you're not studying about the

544
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,980
cloud how the cloud functions and how

545
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:10,580
it's actually different than the

546
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:13,100
full-time infrastructure and when I say

547
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:17,110
that if you're trying to say well it's

548
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:20,178
just outsourcing you're missing a boat

549
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:23,600
cloud is a totally different world of

550
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:26,779
technology if you haven't invested some

551
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:30,139
time in to study how containers can be

552
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:32,179
used to run an application for the split

553
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:34,279
second that it's needed to process an

554
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:36,950
order and then it goes away

555
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:38,509
and then the logging that you would have

556
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:41,899
to do is maintained

557
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:43,159
what happens within that process because

558
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:44,360
you can't go back and get the machine

559
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:47,179
and look at the laws on the machine

560
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:50,629
cheating's gone oh there was never a

561
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:54,799
machine it was just a container how do

562
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:57,049
you how do you keep up that if you're

563
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:01,309
not studying and keeping up with what's

564
00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:02,990
going on in the world of I can tell you

565
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:06,080
that nobody in this room can keep up

566
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:09,019
with all the technologies ok these are

567
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,889
things you can choose from I will tell

568
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:18,110
you that as we keep moving forward there

569
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:22,008
is a solution there's a solution called

570
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:26,779
artificial intelligence I was recently

571
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:30,980
at a meeting where some I was talking

572
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:33,019
about Google and Google doing some back

573
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,320
story know if you guys have heard of

574
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:37,090
this technology or not it's not like

575
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,350
crazy great

576
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:43,490
but if you've ever used the SEM tool

577
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:45,199
that does event management and you've

578
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:49,190
done a search to figure out whether or

579
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:52,640
not the how I say this whether or not an

580
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:55,370
indicator of compromise is out there and

581
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,130
it takes 20 minutes or 30 minutes or 12

582
00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:01,639
hours to produce the report that you

583
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:05,920
need to get that well the claim of

584
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:08,390
backstory is they can do it the seconds

585
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:14,920
what's what's the definition of

586
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:18,110
improvement faster better yeah cheaper

587
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:23,000
Wow if I could replace an entire

588
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:24,830
technology let's say of sim with a

589
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,660
different technology that renders faster

590
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:32,060
results what if I can tie that into AI

591
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:34,820
life that AI how many of you have a home

592
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,540
security system right now I'm gonna ask

593
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,189
you that question

594
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:40,700
does anybody have a home security system

595
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:45,230
yeah do you think there's somebody

596
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:46,630
monitoring a call center right waiting

597
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:52,160
for your alarm to go off

598
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:55,250
is that efficient probably not what may

599
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:58,550
they actually be doing they may have AI

600
00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:02,180
running that in the background I know

601
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:05,330
that what we do in some of our

602
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:08,000
technologies is we use AI for this

603
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:11,270
purpose in looking for those kinds of

604
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,240
anomalies stop everything it's not the

605
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:19,940
only answer but what I would ask you is

606
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:24,950
how do you secure a tie how do you know

607
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:26,510
what is doing it so I came up to you and

608
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:29,180
said hey I've got this new project I

609
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:32,270
need you to if you're not studying about

610
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:34,390
it a little bit now you're not going to

611
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:36,350
be ready when that opportunity knocks

612
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:38,540
you're not going to be the one who's

613
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,870
gonna be able to step up and say this is

614
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,870
what I know

615
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:50,679
now all of us irken testers but I want

616
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:52,539
to throw out to you Kali Linux is

617
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:55,030
everybody fairly familiar with this

618
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:58,230
knows what it is what's the what's the

619
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,230
slogan here

620
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:07,360
zing buy know the slogan for golly the

621
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:12,899
quieter I become the more I can hear in

622
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:16,060
other words when I am really stealthy I

623
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:21,009
end up learning more about what's going

624
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:24,159
on I may be able to bring process not

625
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:27,060
just the technology and working with

626
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:32,099
Jeremy and some of our pentesting team

627
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:36,940
our motto was not break into a machine

628
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:40,510
our motto is burn it to the ground burn

629
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:42,450
the systems to ground because if I burn

630
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:49,300
the system to the ground

631
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:51,279
yes what happens things change but how

632
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:55,030
can I safely burn something to the

633
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,220
ground I have to know the details about

634
00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:00,490
what I'm doing I have to know how it

635
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:03,430
functions this is why web application

636
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:09,848
security this is why pen testing skill

637
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:11,950
sets or so is so hard to come by because

638
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:16,030
you really have to know these things

639
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:20,379
at a detailed level what I would submit

640
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:22,480
to you is you don't have to dive in to

641
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:26,050
Kali Linux and know everything there is

642
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,560
to know about as a security practitioner

643
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:31,390
you need to know what pen testers do you

644
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:35,380
need to be able to take what their

645
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:37,930
results are and be able to explain those

646
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:41,020
to others so that they can understand

647
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:42,810
the risk involved and as a pen tester if

648
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:45,070
all they're doing is showing you a hole

649
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:47,849
they're not doing a service to your

650
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:51,060
company a pen tester should be giving

651
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:55,150
resolution to the hole that they found

652
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,859
so that it can be fixed I don't know how

653
00:35:55,150 --> 00:36:00,279
many pen tests I've looked at

654
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:02,769
from outside parties who've told me you

655
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:05,259
got this problem well that's great

656
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:08,019
anybody tending I've got a problem but

657
00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:10,989
tell me how to fix the problem the

658
00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:14,499
waterway don't just tell me all I took

659
00:36:10,989 --> 00:36:18,309
all of your credit card numbers tell me

660
00:36:14,499 --> 00:36:19,808
how can you help me fix so that my

661
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:24,609
credit card numbers don't get taken less

662
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:29,200
somebody else and then ensure that you

663
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:31,630
come back and test it to see that I did

664
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,209
what you recommended that should be

665
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,619
written into every pen test not just

666
00:36:34,209 --> 00:36:37,419
that hey we've been to us didn't we

667
00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:40,269
checked up you got these problems go fix

668
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:43,690
over it drives me nuts when I see that

669
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:47,799
happening in the industry I'll get away

670
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:51,579
from that cloud security alliance

671
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:53,529
anybody heard of this yeah well the

672
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:58,930
cloud security Alliance came up with

673
00:36:53,529 --> 00:37:03,670
this list of security controls that they

674
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:06,969
would have you to implement they are not

675
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:09,849
shoot that I used to say wow look at

676
00:37:06,969 --> 00:37:11,130
that involved with the ISIS a get to do

677
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:14,440
this

678
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:18,209
they then teamed up with IC square

679
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:23,380
created the CCSP that I mentioned and

680
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:28,629
the CCSP is heavily tracking towards the

681
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:32,369
control matrix that they have that has

682
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:37,029
been out that particular certification

683
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:42,489
it came out in 2015 that's four years

684
00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:45,999
ago if you're a cloud security

685
00:37:42,489 --> 00:37:48,369
professional right do you think anybody

686
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:50,078
wants you do you think anybody would

687
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:55,150
want somebody who knows about cloud

688
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:57,219
security yeah they want if you want to

689
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,499
go down the path this is very bad

690
00:37:57,219 --> 00:38:06,839
I'll be honest with you if you have a

691
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:06,839
cyst be this this is easy to get

692
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:15,140
my point this is for Career Development

693
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:17,540
if you have your sis P and you don't

694
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:20,600
have your cloud security professional go

695
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:22,930
ahead and get it it's a very low-cost

696
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,770
way to get your foot in the door and

697
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:31,609
opportunities that you would not imagine

698
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:34,210
it'll be open up to you okay everybody's

699
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:36,200
probably familiar with in this framework

700
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:40,280
I'm not going to tell you what your

701
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:43,549
dream is what I will tell you is here's

702
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,020
a foundation that you can look at and

703
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:47,420
when you look at the framework

704
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:50,990
you've got very distinct areas you can

705
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:54,340
go into I've been extremely fortunate in

706
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:56,689
the role that I played in my past years

707
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:59,750
that I've had the opportunity to be in

708
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:03,980
almost every one of those areas you know

709
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:06,350
when I say that I volunteered to change

710
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:09,050
my role I didn't want to you know it's

711
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:11,960
great to find the pin desk guy the

712
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:15,760
manager the pin test team or the manager

713
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:18,700
of the vulnerability management group or

714
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,240
the web application security group

715
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,359
that's great

716
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:27,799
what do you know about this management

717
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:29,810
what do you know about ID management to

718
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:34,430
be a well-rounded security professional

719
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:37,640
you need to have your finger across all

720
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:39,230
of those and what I would tell you if

721
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,410
you're looking to onto management at

722
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:46,490
some point I would highly suggest that

723
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:51,200
you definitely get diversity in your

724
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:56,299
career with that in the presentation

725
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,470
I've got some links and they describe

726
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:01,040
some things you're probably familiar

727
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:06,379
with they go into a little bit more

728
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:09,680
detail with blockchain Android fax and

729
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:13,280
things of that nature I would suggest

730
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,049
that you take the opportunity to

731
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,590
research some of these items the ones

732
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:20,540
that you think are great and if you've

733
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:24,420
got passion for

734
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:29,130
drive towards those if you don't have

735
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:32,550
passion for it forget it because if you

736
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:35,640
don't have passion in security you're

737
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:38,040
going to stop then just you'd have to

738
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:41,339
have powder because it's not something

739
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:44,130
you do just to make money you have to

740
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:48,780
have a desire to learn and love the

741
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:50,280
industry and when I say it that way the

742
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,680
people who are disgruntled the people

743
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,350
who don't like their jobs those are the

744
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,290
ones that don't have passion so if

745
00:40:55,350 --> 00:41:01,670
you're in that boat right now

746
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:05,520
my suggestion is dream a little dream

747
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:06,840
put your head in the clouds keep your

748
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,940
feet on the ground with a good solid

749
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,940
player and with that
