00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,639
hello everybody thanks for coming today

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:16,430
I am Jeremy Duran I'm a principal

3
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:18,210
architect local company and mainly

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:24,750
penetration testing and application

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:26,490
security and run our programs that such

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,119
as bug bounty and penetration testing

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,639
and things like that

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,590
and also on the locusts information

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,120
security here locally and have a couple

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,399
of projects if you're interested in

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,899
information security or this talk today

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,020
you may want to check out the YouTube

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:43,860
channel I've already pre uploaded the

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,510
entire series of videos on basics of

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,280
password cracking advanced password

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,559
cracking and using the tools that we'll

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,870
be talking about in here so that I think

18
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,239
it's about 15 or 20 video series up

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,468
there for you and with me today I have

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,538
eric jackson also a nutrition analyst

21
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,460
for a similar logistic company if you

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,280
guys they might be the same one maybe

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,040
maybe not I worked with networks and web

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,439
applications web service mostly Red Team

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,510
either one will do assessments but my

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,639
prior life I was a up dev and project

27
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,650
management person I have a penance if

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,540
you want to talk about again and we have

29
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,720
also open source contributor a nice

30
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,299
people on different couple of a projects

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,929
include the US Army knife and a couple

32
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,689
of fishy and exfiltration mask

33
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:34,290
Thanks so when you're doing a

34
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,419
penetration test it's a lot like a

35
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,060
regular hacker who's trying to get into

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,710
the system that's actually the point

37
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,210
sometimes it's called threat simulation

38
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,589
adversarial simulation but you're

39
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,619
basically trying to recreate or

40
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,439
replicate the conditions of a hack and

41
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,850
then you'll break down what happened all

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,169
the bad things that happened during that

43
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,270
sequence of events and you can go about

44
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,030
trying to patch those different points

45
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,009
in that change and penetration testing

46
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,020
is unlike regular hacking in that you

47
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,649
have a very short window to get the work

48
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,240
done so you you get a small scope to

49
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,550
work on typically and you've got maybe

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,378
one week maybe two weeks at the outside

51
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,940
to get the job done

52
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,480
and at that point it's time for your

53
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,120
right

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,349
so there's no there's no hanging around

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,060
for months and months and months and

56
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:19,590
figuring stuff out you basically got to

57
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,819
get in there get the job that I get out

58
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,709
and therefore automation is very

59
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,049
important to us because there's a lot of

60
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:30,360
repetitive tasks and one of those

61
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,459
particular repetitive tasks is password

62
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,830
cracking and I'll share with you some of

63
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:38,700
what we learned in trying to automate

64
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,830
that particular piece of the puzzle now

65
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,899
ideally I'd really like to get to this

66
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,090
point and we're working on it we haven't

67
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,580
quite got there yet so right now what we

68
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,290
have is a series of the steps automated

69
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,489
and like I said one of those this

70
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,709
password cracking and then we've also

71
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:57,200
made some efforts to automate the report

72
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,200
writing and some other parts as well

73
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:02,730
well the first question is is is this

74
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:05,400
task one of those ones that can be

75
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,399
automated and at first it looks really

76
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,079
good because you have a very predictable

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,760
sequence of steps that you're going

78
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:13,890
through now it's complex there's

79
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,140
hundreds of steps but nonetheless the

80
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,018
same steps over and over again you start

81
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,399
with this word list and try to add and

82
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,959
then you try this dictionary in

83
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,280
combination with this role of this other

84
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,780
dictionary in combination with the same

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,250
role in those dictionaries with the

86
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,959
different rules and so on and so forth

87
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,109
and by the time you get done there's

88
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,239
probably on a basic password cracking

89
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:36,810
engagement you're looking at around 130

90
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,690
to 150 steps but again very predictable

91
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,150
so that's in our favor the problem is

92
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,510
that with any particular set of

93
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,310
passwords context matters and that's

94
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,358
where the automation is to be a little

95
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:56,130
bit tricky the contest context is things

96
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:57,660
like the password policy also you have a

97
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,150
certain set of users and they speak a

98
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,569
certain language or a set of languages

99
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,310
by and large the password policy itself

100
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,589
dictates things like the minimum

101
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,019
password length the complexity that it

102
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:13,319
has to detain and the expiration date

103
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:15,720
and all of those induce some sort of

104
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:18,269
pattern some kind of behavior on the

105
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,358
users that are using the system so if

106
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,460
you take the rules and dictionaries that

107
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,840
you tried for one set of passwords that

108
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,489
maybe works really well maybe you got

109
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,039
be personable practice this had a

110
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,900
fantastic time of it you can take that

111
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,240
exact same scenario and apply it to the

112
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,270
next pin test and not get any passwords

113
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,979
at all because of this context that's

114
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:44,169
built in so what you end up doing or at

115
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:45,430
least what we ended up doing was we

116
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:48,969
tried to figure out if there were

117
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,580
certain patterns that were applicable

118
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:54,520
across all the password sets and it

119
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:57,070
turns out not really there was some

120
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,010
research done in this area by CoreLogic

121
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,950
and they did a great job of figuring out

122
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:06,010
what the most common 100 patterns are

123
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:08,770
and they published that work under their

124
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:12,039
half well project which you can check

125
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,659
out is still online and they they

126
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,910
figured out that there's basically a

127
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:19,990
hundred different patterns that people

128
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:23,620
follow fun average and I want to say

129
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:25,270
they got about 50% of passwords covered

130
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,360
in these hundred items they they came up

131
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:31,659
with so that's pretty good but that was

132
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,610
based on a large set of passwords across

133
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,110
the whole lot of systems it wasn't

134
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,220
necessarily about the system you're

135
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,880
working on today

136
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:42,430
so depending on how the system in front

137
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,159
of you is behaving that type of general

138
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,710
research maybe is a great fit or maybe

139
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:52,090
it's not it's just going to be a matter

140
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:55,539
of luck so then we said okay is there a

141
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,969
way to kind of redo this research that

142
00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:00,340
they were doing but do it on the fly for

143
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,810
the system that's in front of you so for

144
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,299
this particular engagement can you

145
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,800
effectively come up with the same

146
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,160
patterns that are going to be effective

147
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,660
but do it in real time and have a tool

148
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,729
that can repeat this process over and

149
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,169
over again because again two weeks from

150
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,609
now you'll be done with this test you

151
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:17,469
write your report and you're on to the

152
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,380
next test and you'll be faced in a bit

153
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:23,349
totally different adversary potentially

154
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:25,090
possibly a different language even for

155
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:28,750
the set certainly probably a different

156
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:31,210
password policy also let's say that you

157
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:35,260
can find these patterns does it do any

158
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:36,669
good do people behave a light just

159
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,289
because you know the patterns that

160
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:39,159
people are using to make their passwords

161
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:41,130
doesn't mean

162
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,450
that everyone is acting the same way

163
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,610
because if people are not acting the

164
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,630
same then finding a pattern doesn't give

165
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,310
you a lot of good and you might get one

166
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:51,130
person's password but maybe they're not

167
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:52,450
the admin and so maybe that one doesn't

168
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,180
help you as much as you would like and

169
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:59,380
so can you apply this to large groups of

170
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:01,420
people it's a little bit of background

171
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,180
when I say a pattern I'm talking about

172
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,330
the sequence of cat characters that make

173
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,860
up a password now it doesn't have to be

174
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,550
any particular letter or any particular

175
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,230
number

176
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,050
I just mean things like what the word

177
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:16,060
pass one exclamation point we started

178
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,820
with an uppercase and then we had three

179
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,740
lowers in a row we got a digit and then

180
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,020
finally we have a symbol on the end so

181
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,510
this would be a pretty common pattern is

182
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,359
to have some series of letters that are

183
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:31,210
uppercase and then some number and some

184
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,710
symbol is a common pattern and you see a

185
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,180
couple of other examples here with the

186
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,549
one two three four five six which is all

187
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:42,040
digits and then the rollerball one which

188
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:44,890
is this ten digits and as far as the

189
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,020
nomenclature we use we can borrow the

190
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,840
syntax use popular password cracking

191
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,909
programs like John the Ripper and hash

192
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,650
cat that have the question mark followed

193
00:07:51,910 --> 00:08:00,700
by and L UV or s depending on if it's a

194
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,830
upper lower digit symbol and the a is

195
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,510
kind of a catch-all so it just means it

196
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,190
could be a lower case or an upper case

197
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,530
or a digit or a simple it's basically

198
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:11,050
any printable character is what the ad

199
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:16,599
so it seems a superset of all those come

200
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:20,200
on together once you know about the

201
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:23,770
patterns the next thing thing about is

202
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:27,700
the idea of a percentile in other words

203
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:30,880
how many patterns would cover some

204
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:33,039
percent of a given set of passwords so

205
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,900
say like I wanted to get twenty five

206
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,729
percent or at least have a pretty good

207
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,669
chance of getting 25 percent of

208
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:42,550
passwords in a big giant set of password

209
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:46,510
hashes how many patterns is it going to

210
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:48,459
take in order to get that many passwords

211
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,680
out of the set or you might even extend

212
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:53,050
this to say 50 percent so on and so

213
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,510
forth what you'll find is is that

214
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:58,150
the number of patterns required for a

215
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,950
given set of passwords follows this type

216
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,790
of curve here which is an exponential

217
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:05,980
distribution depending on the system and

218
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,540
how good your password cracking isn't so

219
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,280
forth the curve is going to kind of move

220
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,310
over that one way the other but it's

221
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,360
generally going to be a ski slope and it

222
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:17,560
may have a little bit of a funny shape

223
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,770
depending on the situation so I got a

224
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,359
quiz for you and if you've got my

225
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,579
presentation on bypass this is a

226
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,630
different example so that answer won't

227
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:30,250
work so take 72 million passwords take

228
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,600
in just from a whole lot of different

229
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,480
systems so we're talking pretty generic

230
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,360
here and let's say that I set the

231
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,270
percentile for you at 50% so that means

232
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,360
you need to figure out what patterns it

233
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:46,000
takes to get 50% of those 72 million

234
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,550
passwords which is about 36 million give

235
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,290
or take how many patterns would you all

236
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:57,729
guess it takes to get that huge group of

237
00:09:52,290 --> 00:10:00,069
passwords any ideas starting number 5 5

238
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:06,460
ok we got 5 to start with Optimus I like

239
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:10,870
it 100 it's pretty good guess 2 3 oh man

240
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:17,050
you have way more faces do good I won't

241
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:19,060
go there deliver so any other guesses we

242
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:25,750
have got the right answer yet but but

243
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:27,430
you're surrounding it all right so it

244
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,130
actually takes about 21 patterns to

245
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:33,219
cover 36 million so the optimists

246
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:35,890
definitely win and what we end up seeing

247
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,630
is if if you really only need like a

248
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:40,990
whole bunch of passwords but not even

249
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:45,400
half then really about 6 patterns of you

250
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:49,300
because we hit the 25% mark when we

251
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:55,150
reach pattern number 6 now these

252
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:58,030
statistics are highest in one way these

253
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:01,750
passwords that were used in this example

254
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:03,819
were taken from a huge number of past

255
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,380
work reaches which means you had a whole

256
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,010
lot of different password policies a

257
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,920
whole lot of different user

258
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:12,890
all coming together and what that tends

259
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,640
to do is it tends to make it to where

260
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:19,250
you actually need more patterns than

261
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,870
less because you have a larger group of

262
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,900
password policies and stuff that you're

263
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:26,300
trying to cover so if you thought it was

264
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:29,780
bad when you first saw this slide it's

265
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,579
really bad when you hear that this is

266
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,410
actually made up from a whole bunch of

267
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,660
different systems and theoretically we

268
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,890
should need to earn more kind of to kind

269
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,750
of compensate for the fact that

270
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:42,880
different systems were contributing

271
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:47,300
their passwords so what this tells us is

272
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,850
not only do people kind of act alike but

273
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,270
even the people who are designing the

274
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:56,930
password policies kind of think alike

275
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:59,329
right they all tend to come up with use

276
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:02,120
eight characters and let's use a an

277
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:05,090
upper and a lower or let's use two out

278
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,610
of four like you have to have two upper

279
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,770
lower symbol digits you know that kind

280
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,870
of thing and people are kind of

281
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,010
mimicking each other when they set up

282
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,900
these systems when they pick their

283
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,000
passport policies which kind of makes

284
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,560
sense because if you're a system admin

285
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and you're about ready to implement some

286
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,060
kind of policy what's the first thing

287
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,380
you do when you want to know what policy

288
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:31,069
you should use Google exactly and what

289
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:34,189
you'll get is by the nature of Google

290
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:36,680
itself is you'll get a consensus right

291
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,770
because that's kind of what Google does

292
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,989
in a sense is it brings up the most

293
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:44,480
relevant search results according to its

294
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,940
algorithm which most people are going to

295
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,580
see and so you sort of end up getting

296
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,460
this confirmation bias built in where

297
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:55,970
people start acting alike and these

298
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:58,340
these were certainly no exception if we

299
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,870
break down that set into a picture we

300
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:03,010
get a diagram that looks kind of like

301
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:05,570
this so you can kind of imagine the

302
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:08,390
distribution curve here and the part

303
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,540
that's colored in there on the left that

304
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:16,069
thin little part that's colored in is

305
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:19,099
the 50% and you can see compared to the

306
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,840
entire width of that curve how narrow

307
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,610
that

308
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,560
and is but we kind of already knew that

309
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:27,370
right because we already knew that it

310
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,900
only took 21 patterns out of hundreds of

311
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:33,040
thousands of patterns in order to

312
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:35,050
represent the 50% what's really

313
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,060
interesting is if take a look at how

314
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:39,279
many patterns that are there's four

315
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:42,040
hundred and twelve thousand patterns

316
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,050
needed to cover 72 million passwords so

317
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,660
there's a whole lot of people that have

318
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,370
a unique password in that set we would

319
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,959
agree because we see that there's just a

320
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:54,610
tremendous number of patterns

321
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:56,200
represented but realistically if you're

322
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,200
doing a pin test do you care about

323
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,520
cracking all the passwords no not really

324
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,500
right you just need to get in you're

325
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,270
just trying to get access any one will

326
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,040
do as long as it's got sufficient

327
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:09,610
privileges as long as it's you know at

328
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,920
least a user account if not an admin

329
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:15,160
account would be nice but you know at

330
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,529
least a user account right and so if

331
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,540
you're trying to win a password cracking

332
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:21,700
contest you're kind of worried about the

333
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,800
long tail on this curve but if you're

334
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:27,370
just trying to get in and you don't care

335
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:32,469
how you get in the colored region in

336
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:35,380
there on the left will do just fine and

337
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:37,750
what that ends up teaching us when with

338
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,180
what we were working with is that when

339
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:43,960
it got to about right here we just

340
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:46,989
stopped caring because from the hundred

341
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:50,320
xxx pattern over to the 400,000 pattern

342
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,580
are just 1 Z 2 Z's like and they're not

343
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,530
going to help us they don't really make

344
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,230
any difference so we can ignore those

345
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:58,329
and we can focus in on just the little

346
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,440
common patterns and that's definitely to

347
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,210
our advantage because again two-week

348
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,850
engagement you're in a hurry you gotta

349
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,810
get this stuff really really fast and

350
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,080
cracking passwords is not the point

351
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,670
right

352
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,959
the point is is getting in and finding

353
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:12,130
vulnerabilities so you can help your

354
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:15,459
customer fix the problems well it turns

355
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:17,220
out this pattern actually holds up you

356
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:20,050
might say well that only works because

357
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,339
you are looking at all these passwords

358
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,620
brought together and there's just this

359
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:25,300
massive number of those passwords and

360
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,230
it's just such a huge sample and it

361
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:32,339
worked out but I looked at small samples

362
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,750
like Facebook

363
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,810
and hotmail dumps that we're out there

364
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,990
and I looked at some bigger samples like

365
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:43,500
the singles org and the myspace and also

366
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:45,060
took a look at some other combinations

367
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,880
the rocking dictionary that's so popular

368
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:51,540
and it doesn't matter which one you look

369
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:55,170
at the general shape of the curve holds

370
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:57,630
up and by and large if you find the top

371
00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:00,390
ten patterns you'll end up seeing that

372
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:03,839
the top ten patterns tends to fall right

373
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:11,310
about near the middle of the curve or

374
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:13,380
the curve has its tangent point so I got

375
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:26,420
a demo for you to kind of illustrate

376
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:26,420
some of this see if I can wake this up

377
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:38,290
so I went to ride those the site he has

378
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:40,000
some password dumps that were already

379
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,550
turned into text files that you could

380
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,990
just download his site is school

381
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:48,579
security calm and I grabbed some of

382
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,010
those ones that I showed you plus a

383
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:57,040
couple of other ones also went out to

384
00:16:51,010 --> 00:17:00,670
mark Burnett's site and grab his I guess

385
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,390
you pronounce it Zeta it's X ATO that's

386
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:07,990
where I ended up getting the 72 million

387
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:10,059
password set and so appreciate those two

388
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:14,109
folks putting those out there so that

389
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:17,770
could grab those the software package

390
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:20,198
that we wrote based on what we learned

391
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:23,319
is called bypass and bypass will

392
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,540
automatically take a set of hashes it

393
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,270
will run through those hundred and

394
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:30,159
thirty steps I described get as many

395
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,110
passwords as I can based on several

396
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,840
different languages and a whole lot of

397
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:37,629
different rules and then it will apply

398
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,020
this analysis to figure out what the

399
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:45,490
patterns are so they can go about taking

400
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:47,350
it to the next level the program that is

401
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,230
inside of the bypass package that does

402
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,300
the actual analysis for bypass is called

403
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,300
pass time and so I'll show you pass time

404
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:58,120
and this is all available for free on

405
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,500
the github and I'll share my contact

406
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,090
information with you at the end if

407
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:05,050
you're interested in going out to get up

408
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:08,139
and grabbing that so on this first one

409
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:11,860
we take a look at the hotmail at 50

410
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,540
percent so the first thing that

411
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:17,229
past-time does is it'll draw an

412
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,870
approximation roughly of the exponential

413
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,610
distribution curve now it's is an ASCII

414
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,419
art so it's really crude but it gives

415
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:27,610
you a general idea and we can see that

416
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,140
the first pattern that's worth nine

417
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,490
percent all by itself and then the

418
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,200
second pairing teach you another about

419
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,170
seven percent so you're already up to 50

420
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:38,160
percent just in a couple patterns I had

421
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:40,660
told him that I was interested in a 50%

422
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,480
percentile that's what the point 5

423
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,399
represents and so these

424
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,070
these man patterns are the ones that you

425
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:50,620
would need in order to get half of that

426
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,559
set and then it actually goes about the

427
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:55,750
business of telling you what those

428
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,029
patterns are so in this particular set

429
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,710
it was these this series of lowers

430
00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:02,559
couple more lowers for the second one

431
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:04,840
one less lower for the third one a bunch

432
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,379
of digits you can kind of tell that that

433
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:11,230
password set has not a great pattern to

434
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,120
it and one thing about users is they

435
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,960
will definitely live down to your

436
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,469
expectations

437
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,840
so whatever pattern you pick is pretty

438
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,990
much gonna be the pattern that's going

439
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,418
to be number one in the percentile so if

440
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:29,080
if you tell folks hey you've got to pick

441
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:32,950
upper lower and digit and you tell them

442
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:35,199
that has to be nine characters you can

443
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:38,679
bet pattern number one or number two is

444
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,720
going to be you lllll for seven times

445
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:45,639
and then followed by or eight times nine

446
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,139
ID because not only do users do exactly

447
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:48,158
what you tell them even though you're

448
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:49,830
not really trying to tell them something

449
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:53,320
with the password policy but you are

450
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:55,449
they literally keep it in order so they

451
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,668
always do the upper first on average

452
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,559
followed by the lowers on average and

453
00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:02,760
then followed by the digits on average

454
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:05,590
of the symbols on average so

455
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,450
unfortunately they are somewhat

456
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,709
predictable as a as a group now an

457
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,669
individual that's a whole different

458
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:15,940
story so what you'll notice is that when

459
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:19,450
hackers go after particular people

460
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,250
they're not so predictable and that's

461
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,130
why you'll see things like spearfishing

462
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,669
and other techniques being used because

463
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:29,950
guessing a particular person's password

464
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:34,960
not that easy like guessing what the

465
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:38,500
group did on average very easy they'll

466
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,240
just follow the path exactly you'll see

467
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,059
the actual mass printed out down here at

468
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,409
the bottom and that's mainly just in

469
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:48,340
case you can even then inform of the

470
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:50,740
list all right so now let's take it up

471
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:54,309
to the to the 90th percentile so I'll

472
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:56,379
show you the ninety percent of the same

473
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:56,940
set and it's pretty remarkable what

474
00:20:56,379 --> 00:21:00,580
happened

475
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,590
get this huge number of patterns that

476
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,290
you have to have to get to the to the

477
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:11,199
90th percentile so what's basically

478
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:14,139
happening here is on average people that

479
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:19,090
plural do behave somewhat alike but

480
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:20,380
persons don't so as you get lower as you

481
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,850
get trying to cover more and more

482
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,470
passwords you're running into more and

483
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,600
more unique individuals who don't act

484
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,790
like the herd and you're picking those

485
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,520
up and you're getting that long tail on

486
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:32,230
that exponential distribution curve so

487
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,110
the pattern holds up really well right

488
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:38,460
down through the 50th percentile that's

489
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:42,729
here under this the CP column CP is the

490
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:49,090
cumulative and but in order to go from

491
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:50,380
50 to 90 you really got to work hard now

492
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,000
again if you're trying to get all the

493
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,550
passwords that would be important in

494
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,740
your buddy if you're just doing pin

495
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,810
testing and you just need some don't

496
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,390
worry about it just focusing on the top

497
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:06,850
10 patterns you get the access you need

498
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:12,700
and move on with your test so another

499
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:14,709
another set is MySpace and this one is

500
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,140
this one's getting a little bit dated

501
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:20,100
now but it's got a lot of passwords in

502
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:23,080
it so I kind of like it for that reason

503
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:27,219
but they did I mean the policy is is old

504
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:33,310
because myspace is old in this case that

505
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:36,430
took 12 and we're figuring out that the

506
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:38,649
12 patterns mean that they had a little

507
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:41,530
bit better of a policy at that time

508
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:44,980
compared to what the hotmail did at

509
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:46,750
their time of course hot mails policy is

510
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,980
it's better now in fact they have to

511
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:52,150
factor today but this is years ago and

512
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,300
it's but it's still not that many more

513
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:59,080
to give to 50th percentile so we try to

514
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:02,080
take it out to the the 90th and again

515
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:05,020
just an absolutely huge number and it

516
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,090
just continues to emphasize that a big

517
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,840
chunk of users will behave exactly like

518
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:12,330
each other in any large user community

519
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,820
and then the individuals start to stand

520
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:19,289
out after you get to about 250

521
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:23,609
percentile mark so what do we learn from

522
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:26,429
this well we learned this is a useful

523
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:27,599
technique to use if you're just trying

524
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:28,889
to get a few passwords and you don't

525
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,849
care about getting all of them works

526
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:35,668
great and that's exactly how bad pass

527
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:38,729
was able to automate most of the

528
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:40,409
password cracking is it simply gets as

529
00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:42,299
many passwords as it possibly can using

530
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:45,269
all the conventional techniques every

531
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:47,609
which way every which combo it tries

532
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:51,299
everything and it gets as many as it can

533
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:52,859
then it recycles the passwords which

534
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:55,799
I'll let Eric tell you a little bit more

535
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:59,129
about and after the recycling is done it

536
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:02,279
uses that information all those

537
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:04,738
passwords there crack let's pass time do

538
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:07,830
the analysis on it has handles say hey

539
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:10,589
bypass try these nine ten twelve

540
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:13,529
patterns and see how that works so to

541
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:16,049
give you some idea of how effective it

542
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:17,519
is if you have a set of about 2,000

543
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:20,908
passwords out of a pretty large of that

544
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:24,049
hashes and you run this analysis on it

545
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:27,619
it typically will be able to get around

546
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:30,629
250,000 more from that 2,000 so it has a

547
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:32,999
pretty good amplification factor on and

548
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:35,908
again it's because people who really do

549
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:37,529
behave alike the other thing we learned

550
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:40,830
from this from a defenders point of view

551
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:45,089
is we need something better for our

552
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:46,830
users than passwords so the main thing

553
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:49,559
that we can give them today is

554
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:53,460
two-factor authentication do you think

555
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:56,309
about popular social media sites online

556
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:59,969
email and a whole lot of major brands

557
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:02,339
you have Apple Facebook all the

558
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:04,139
different Google properties all the

559
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:07,168
different Microsoft properties including

560
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:08,639
hotmail and outlook and now the

561
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:11,849
different Amazon properties even the

562
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:14,129
Amazon store now has free two-factor

563
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:16,830
authentication and all you have to do is

564
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:18,658
opt-in it's real easy to do and you kind

565
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,009
of do have to have a mobile phone but

566
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:23,429
that's where I'm really much of a

567
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:25,739
barrier for our users today

568
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:28,679
also if you're getting two factor for

569
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:31,349
your own company the price of

570
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,809
implementing that has really come on

571
00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:37,200
factors there's actually a few free

572
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:38,908
solutions that are okay of course free

573
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,070
means that you better have a lot of time

574
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:43,109
on your hands in order to implement it

575
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,658
but even the paid solutions haven't

576
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:48,809
really come down to price flavor now

577
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:52,229
let's say that you've got some sites

578
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:54,899
left over after you do to factor so you

579
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:57,599
go home you go through all your social

580
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:59,218
media Twitter LinkedIn Facebook the

581
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,599
whole nine yards and you get all your

582
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:02,279
two factors set up on those so you go

583
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:03,779
through all your email accounts get it

584
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:05,759
set up on those and you've done

585
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:07,710
everything you can you still got a few

586
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,659
sites left over at the end of the day

587
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:12,869
and they don't have to factor available

588
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:14,759
for you which you can back down to is

589
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:17,009
using a password manager so you can get

590
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:18,960
a password manager like a LastPass or

591
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:21,599
one password or whatever brand you want

592
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,210
and you can let those tools generate the

593
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,879
password for you they effectively

594
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:29,099
generate more or less random passwords

595
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:31,799
so they're not going to fit any kind of

596
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:34,049
a pattern like you would see those in in

597
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:36,119
here today and because of that you won't

598
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:39,119
be able to use techniques like this in

599
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:41,039
order to get that now I still would

600
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,988
recommend to factor because we're only

601
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,289
talking about one particular attack that

602
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:48,649
we're talking about just guessing the

603
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:50,580
password effectively right there's still

604
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:52,949
interception they're still fishing

605
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,379
there's other ways to get passwords

606
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,539
besides just this one technique so you

607
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:59,399
still want to have that two-factor just

608
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:04,349
having a random password won't save you

609
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:05,908
from interception or disclosure but on

610
00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:08,039
the sites that can't support two-factor

611
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:10,950
the best thing you can do is is try to

612
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:12,479
get the password manager set up and then

613
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,830
you can use these crazy passwords that

614
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:16,289
you would never build remember a million

615
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:19,619
years anyway and and left the password

616
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:20,969
manager handle the storage naturally you

617
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:22,799
would have to have to factor on the

618
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:24,749
password manager but most of them pretty

619
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:29,609
well force it on you nowadays they they

620
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:31,080
nag you until you do it so alright and I

621
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:32,189
didn't leave out a little bit about that

622
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,779
recycling techniques

623
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,990
let me get over to turn it over to Eric

624
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:38,820
and he'll explain recycling thank you

625
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,289
working with this product on this

626
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,960
project with Jeremy it was great because

627
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:45,450
we share loves same interests and this

628
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,520
was what we can kind of collaborate I'd

629
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,100
already put some effort and bypass

630
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,110
before mostly because my daughter told

631
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,549
me when I told her why I did she's like

632
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,110
I can think of a path where you can't

633
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:57,270
guess and she was right she came up with

634
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,010
a enemy character because what my pesto

635
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:03,418
has am a dictionary so you can think my

636
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:06,330
daughter's what we wanted to do with

637
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:07,649
automates has work right as we said and

638
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,750
this is Jeremy's mentioned before in

639
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:11,639
different presentations pen testers are

640
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,159
lazy in a good way we want to make it

641
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,500
the best use of our time is we have to

642
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,169
focus very clearly in the deadlines we

643
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,510
have the recycle technique that was

644
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:23,220
proposed was we would generate guesses

645
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,950
from passwords that were re cracked and

646
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,990
by generate new words that would be

647
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:30,450
assumed new entities the rules will

648
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:32,490
apply on is sort of a magical alchemy

649
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:35,250
where we're taking something of nothing

650
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:36,809
and gain more from it by mean by that we

651
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:39,210
have look at this password here we're

652
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:41,370
chopping things off right in each time

653
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,740
we do that's a new character our new

654
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:46,139
word it also can be made into some

655
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:48,179
additional words it could be Morgan's

656
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,950
and we have a root word for example the

657
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:52,830
word years password which also could be

658
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:55,590
every word or our Lord is as we put

659
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:57,029
these words together we were removing a

660
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:59,340
sort of duplicates and those were put

661
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:00,779
back into the password was there's a lot

662
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,178
to unpack there so let's really talk

663
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:06,059
about what we did and how we applied it

664
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:08,580
well we're both are scientists apart we

665
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:09,870
want to apply this because we knew

666
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,439
something was there but we want to find

667
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:15,870
out how effective our theory was and

668
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,340
where was the most effective so the best

669
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,379
thing to do is you know it's time to

670
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,908
pick method you have your baseline your

671
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,070
control group and then you control for

672
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:24,929
variables if you want to do the sim

673
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:27,178
here's this a procedure I'm sure

674
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:30,059
everyone will do that tonight right no

675
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:31,860
okay well when you do you obtain John

676
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,299
John the Ripper get the jumbo version

677
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,428
and they're going to put my passing so

678
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:36,840
make sure right now and will include one

679
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:38,700
bill to roll them all in the

680
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,139
configuration which I'll explain it to

681
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,350
you in a bit if you've nothing later

682
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:46,210
with rolls we'll do a quick overview

683
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:47,590
then a simple large dictionary the what

684
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,420
since we took all the dictionaries of

685
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:52,480
run by pence combine them into one

686
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:55,410
massive uber dictionary unique then

687
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,260
sorted to get rid of a sore to his horn

688
00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:01,680
passwords it over then we took baseline

689
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:04,510
counts for what was correct but public

690
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,160
public dumps from LinkedIn and eHarmony

691
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:08,710
now in case you're not aware these

692
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,140
public dumps do not include aimless ID

693
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,840
with them they're just ashes so we're

694
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,670
not like finding IDs and going off and

695
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,409
spending people's money this is just a

696
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:19,000
way for us to pay slowing the process

697
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:21,460
pretty standard way if you're going to

698
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,340
test out a rule we're just going in so

699
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,240
they exist if you're very - directly

700
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,639
you're 12

701
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,530
use our gigantic word list one rules

702
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,190
rule them all and then what we're

703
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:35,050
cracking that's pretty basic think about

704
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:37,330
the rounds what we tested and this is

705
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:39,370
the experimental rate is how many we

706
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,840
would chop up for the right and being

707
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,070
the number that we're gonna chop off and

708
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,129
that would also be the name of the round

709
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,689
so we thought this do five rounds I'll

710
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,070
keep you spoiler it didn't take it's

711
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,920
more of the five rounds to figure out

712
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:53,139
where it was most efficient we maybe you

713
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,300
were list within those many characters

714
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,770
trimmed from the right that become more

715
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,210
for the length then the password

716
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:00,220
obviously it was not included in the

717
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:02,710
list we would calculate the lowercase

718
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:05,680
root word and lower case of the word and

719
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:08,170
store unique it and removed Java Quixote

720
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,520
to attack it again if you're not

721
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,900
familiar with John the Ripper I don't

722
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,879
know any was experienced it here with

723
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:16,810
John Walker checking why we were removed

724
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,300
John Doherty because that's holds all

725
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,590
the hedges of being cramped so John's

726
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,460
like a wasting time with a hash has

727
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:23,709
already been cracked

728
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:26,680
we won't know the numbers they happen so

729
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,240
we removed the hashes a heavy crack I'm

730
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,100
rewriting again then we will see how

731
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,420
many more for crack there's several ways

732
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,370
to apply it but that's that's a way that

733
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,930
we did it this is going does anyone know

734
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:37,300
what's called John Doe Quixote instead

735
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:39,370
of like John Donne tht is originally

736
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,220
going to be called Jack like Jack the

737
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:45,399
Ripper but the name would be jacked up

738
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,780
poet you know I guess InfoSec humor but

739
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,940
kind of interesting trivia if you have

740
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:52,180
trivia night and you're InfoSec pub you

741
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:54,220
can win definitely same bad password

742
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,050
type is before so just looking from here

743
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,360
we could bind the password let's combine

744
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:59,649
them into the super password list unique

745
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,620
it sorted

746
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:08,500
- John jumbo same thing except the big

747
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:11,709
differences they always wanted to use

748
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:14,980
this we're adding that additional is

749
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:17,170
recycling back into the bigger list you

750
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,690
might realize that list is going to get

751
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:22,390
increasingly bigger every round so which

752
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,770
is true it will but what we're doing has

753
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:26,320
for a list are hard to come by if you're

754
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:29,080
like using cool to take stuff I'll pay

755
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,780
out and cwl to get all thumb password

756
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,159
list off a person's website how can you

757
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,960
get more customers you can use an

758
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,560
existing password dictionaries that's

759
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,240
what I'm saying

760
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,389
that we're doing sort of an alchemy

761
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,280
we're taking something and making it we

762
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,760
had so you're greater at chopping off

763
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,760
from the right

764
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,700
John the Ripper using one rule to rule

765
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:51,129
them all if you're not familiar with

766
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,110
rules the idea is that you mangle these

767
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,940
entities mangles of work people don't

768
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:57,129
like it's the official word though where

769
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:00,100
expands the password is somewhat changes

770
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:02,590
a case as numbers said symbol supplies

771
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,389
those patterns of we just saw the one

772
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,310
hole to roll them all rule was put

773
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:08,890
together by a group called not so secure

774
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:11,860
I think it's a group them again huh they

775
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:14,320
took the top 25 percent performing rules

776
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,570
from all the best rules as it could it

777
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,360
results in that gigantic world it takes

778
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:21,370
forever for your browser to physically

779
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,770
best to curl it down to your PC and it

780
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:25,870
does include your config runs a longer

781
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:26,860
longer time but that's how we're running

782
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,830
it for our baseline so when you're

783
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:33,149
working with 25% best rolls so in this

784
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:35,649
this way of determining what works best

785
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:39,270
again these rules apply individually to

786
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:41,590
each one of those so when you look at

787
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:44,680
each one of those words is no baby it

788
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:46,870
into a entity unto itself meaning that

789
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:49,720
each role will apply yourself that's the

790
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:51,010
magic to it so I'm going to show you a

791
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,770
bunch of numbers here don't worry this

792
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:56,350
is not really slide on the results down

793
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,420
on the right or the left you'll see the

794
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:02,409
different hazard else we use linked at

795
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:04,000
any harm the numbers are exact and how

796
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,690
much we solve from total which is

797
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,520
interesting

798
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:08,918
well you really want to look at is the

799
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,469
yellow part across an each realm that we

800
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:12,500
did you can see immediately I'm just

801
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:15,439
chopping one word

802
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,599
character off the right a 14% increase

803
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,470
just from what we have cracked normally

804
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,060
and harmony that's 23% and I want to

805
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:24,589
emphasize that's basically from nothing

806
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,109
that's for free just by changing

807
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:31,280
something a little bit look at the nice

808
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:32,750
little again additional increased from

809
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,909
the previous one which are going to

810
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:38,810
detail the moment and the total 21

811
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:40,669
percent from LinkedIn and 35% increased

812
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:43,009
amount of passwords just by doing that

813
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:44,299
those first three rounds you can see I

814
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:47,990
mean right here

815
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:50,720
forty percent increase from three rooms

816
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:53,388
which is fantastic I would take that I'm

817
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:56,209
an additional 40% asterisk right now

818
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:57,650
with all things watches why when you

819
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,660
spend money on it actually you get

820
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:01,520
diminishing returns we want to see where

821
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,950
the diminishing return is and you can

822
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,259
kind of see it already a 10-4 a mid

823
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:10,098
nineties five night leveling off this

824
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:12,020
shows 24 to 25 to 25 percent really not

825
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:14,119
that great there because not really

826
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,770
seeing clear on these curves and we

827
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:18,560
would anticipate if you generalize this

828
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:20,750
to other data sets or reproduce it

829
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,450
yourself we was I we would expect the

830
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:26,150
same type of curve but first three and

831
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:28,160
minus one a nice unit at my three are

832
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:31,030
worthwhile investments because we were

833
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,730
keen additional data for his additional

834
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:37,910
hashes crack it levels off very clearly

835
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:41,210
with both of those datasets illicit old

836
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:43,368
crank around look at the increase from

837
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:45,680
though on the percent increase parental

838
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:47,810
is determined by I mean crack did we

839
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,669
cracked this one subtract that from one

840
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:51,710
week right before and divided by what we

841
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:55,190
correct before to get an efficiency

842
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:57,440
rating around this is actually how much

843
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,330
more for the baseline how much remember

844
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,490
if we didn't actually do this recycle

845
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:03,348
technique you can see that this average

846
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,790
line there is exactly where we're going

847
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:07,580
to stay on this curve looks kind of

848
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:09,950
similar to the old one and the levels

849
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:11,240
off very clearly on the N minus one a

850
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,549
nice to minimize where you see a

851
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,129
definite effect right there on that

852
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,900
middle one where you have a right at 30

853
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,760
percent crack on average is what we

854
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,240
would anticipate just by doing this

855
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,240
additional

856
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,779
now what to show the customers its

857
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:29,940
effectiveness I was on the pen test that

858
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:32,819
we did this on but we have heard out a

859
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:35,579
PC before cracking passwords see you

860
00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:37,140
it's a very intense process if you use

861
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:39,299
hash Kevin lo it has a temperature

862
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:41,879
monitor this is a reasonable knife it

863
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:44,369
runs very hard on the processor and they

864
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,710
can harm your processor be runnin too

865
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:49,319
long so you want to know not just from

866
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:51,210
the time perspective but processor

867
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:52,470
expensive perspective point your

868
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,630
expenses aren't what you're getting for

869
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:58,019
it if you look at this graph here you

870
00:36:54,630 --> 00:37:01,349
can see that we have a increasing cost

871
00:36:58,019 --> 00:37:04,819
not a very fast acceleration it's about

872
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:07,740
80% of the previous increase each time

873
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:08,700
and you can see them right generally

874
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,220
right here it looks like we're getting

875
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,569
something for it you can barely see

876
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,430
anything but the costs that we're

877
00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:18,119
getting here and we're going a lot more

878
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:22,470
overhead to it I really like this just

879
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:25,140
to play around with it so yeah so yeah

880
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:28,379
it's very surprised when I say that we

881
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:30,690
recommended three additional recycles

882
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,640
the way this would be incorporated and

883
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,660
bypass which might resentenced Jeremy

884
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,538
our findings he incorporated to bypass

885
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:41,640
really quickly Chopin rerun the password

886
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:43,920
listen weekend place in the bypass and

887
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,470
attack your John Jimbo remember the

888
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,809
whole point bypasses made John were very

889
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:50,519
easier for you and save your time at you

890
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:53,549
time for even very short amount of time

891
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:54,988
you have to attack a system this doesn't

892
00:37:53,549 --> 00:37:58,759
have an additional much additional time

893
00:37:54,989 --> 00:38:01,200
and gives you so many more passwords

894
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:03,089
close I said recommend rounds for

895
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,788
efficacy three additional rents were

896
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:07,470
recycled your averages and increase

897
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:09,720
effectiveness should be somewhere around

898
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,399
the thirty five percent range of course

899
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,799
your mileage may vary depending on your

900
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,779
targets depending on people's practices

901
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:17,609
and strengths if people have really

902
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:19,170
difficult policies maybe they'll be

903
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:20,819
harder for you to get through but they

904
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:23,489
have really easy ones you should have an

905
00:38:20,819 --> 00:38:24,900
even bigger increase but generally

906
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:27,390
speaking on an average of thirty five

907
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:30,239
percent is what we live imagine see but

908
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:32,038
even a 10-1 the crease with twenty

909
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,259
percent additional passwords who's that

910
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:36,599
going to that I take 20 percent right

911
00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:37,369
now and how often do you get something

912
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,400
for free

913
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:43,549
like this is best one the great things

914
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:47,390
now here is something where we took the

915
00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:48,229
recycle technique and put pen against

916
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,670
harmony

917
00:38:48,229 --> 00:38:52,069
what kind of passwords would you have

918
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:59,059
for a harmony probably things like I

919
00:38:52,069 --> 00:39:02,960
love you i lu vu i WV u vu uh so painful

920
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:04,880
but we put them all in there and you ran

921
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,930
them through to see how much would crack

922
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:11,390
now if you look right here we cracked

923
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:15,190
55-minute in the initial run just

924
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:19,368
without recycling anything with recycle

925
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:21,529
this is nearly 2000 more credit just by

926
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:24,380
recycling that way about the percentage

927
00:39:21,529 --> 00:39:26,210
and that is great because we're using a

928
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:29,839
bunch of different additional patents

929
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:31,940
and using bypass for wide tons that is

930
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,229
astonishing and that's that's when we do

931
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,410
that we really have something to show

932
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:37,700
you how do you run this know what what's

933
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:39,288
the big difference between script kitty

934
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,968
and professional we know as a

935
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:42,859
professional hell of the tools are used

936
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:44,719
so we're giving you this just the

937
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:48,049
statistics you know the scientific

938
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:50,960
reasoning but we also wanna make it easy

939
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:52,999
for you so just have a - art lab and the

940
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,279
bypass and we'll do a recycle technique

941
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:57,379
for you and do the full realms you don't

942
00:39:55,279 --> 00:40:09,739
have to specify anything further it will

943
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:11,960
run everything quickly so go and throw

944
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:16,369
our combined contact information up here

945
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:18,170
and the github is the is my same handle

946
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:19,969
the weaponized handle same as the

947
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:23,210
YouTube channel and same this Twitter as

948
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:24,019
well and while we'll leave this up here

949
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:27,460
and we'll go ahead and take any

950
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:27,459
questions that you might have

951
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,690
yes mention the process is pretty

952
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:35,479
computationally expensive for processors

953
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:37,190
and stuff yeah so I didn't know if like

954
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:40,939
you had like considered like CUDA

955
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:43,549
framework to immediately make it a

956
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:46,640
capacitor or like maybe table to the

957
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:48,259
processor yes we looked into it pretty

958
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,259
expensive

959
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,640
and I think the GPU prices went up

960
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,710
because people are using them for like

961
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,600
crypto mining and stuff like that and it

962
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,970
kind of got out of hand there for a

963
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,700
while and they're still pretty expensive

964
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:07,490
so definitely looked into that also

965
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:11,089
looked into using hash pad so so trusted

966
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:14,629
SEC has already written a tool based on

967
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:16,160
Martin pauses research that effectively

968
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:19,400
does the same thing it's not pass clip

969
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,899
fresh cat so if you do use GPUs if you

970
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,770
have access to them and you have the

971
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:26,119
funds to back it up we don't if you do

972
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:28,640
nephew can use that first of all I would

973
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:31,010
switch - get and secondly I would use a

974
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,670
martin stool or the tool that they built

975
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:37,520
based on on what martin had explained

976
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:39,770
because it's designed for GPU use our

977
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,609
budget was a little bit lower we had

978
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:47,119
zero dollars wishes and a hearty

979
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:51,500
handshake and and so with that we turned

980
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:54,440
that into we built a VM and we ran the

981
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:56,390
VM on a laptop the first one which their

982
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,609
commission we Fred so now we're running

983
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:01,790
on the second one and it's just a

984
00:41:58,609 --> 00:42:04,520
leftover laptop running virtual boxer

985
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:06,020
will or whatever and that's why it was

986
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,590
so important that High Pass worked

987
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:11,660
really smart because we don't have a lot

988
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:13,550
of horsepower to just reinforce our way

989
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,740
through it and so we're gonna we

990
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:17,540
literally have millions of less CPU

991
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,669
cycles than what you're talking about

992
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:21,859
having available and because of that we

993
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,020
had to be really careful with how we use

994
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:26,180
those CPU cycles and that was the

995
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,400
original driver behind why we got into

996
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:32,290
doing all this in the first place is

997
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:39,560
figuring out how they do moreover plus

998
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:41,630
any other questions awesome well if if

999
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,759
you're curious about how to use bat

1000
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:47,810
paths and you didn't catch our talk on

1001
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:51,520
bypass specifically you can go out to

1002
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:55,160
the YouTube I've got about I don't know

1003
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:59,490
425 or whatever videos out there now and

1004
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:02,580
about 20 of them are on a two tour

1005
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:05,250
series that slowly walks you through how

1006
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:07,259
do I use John how do I install John how

1007
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:09,770
do I install that pass how do I use my

1008
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:13,650
pass with John so on so forth

1009
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:15,630
included in that series is a subset of

1010
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:18,300
videos that covers using past time to

1011
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,920
show exactly what we show today and that

1012
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,560
both of those tools are included in the

1013
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:27,230
same get up again it's the weaponized

1014
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,230
get up alright well thank you very much
