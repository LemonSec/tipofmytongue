all right I am gonna get started I have

2
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:18,770
minimal time and about a 90 minute slide

deck we're compressing so we're gonna

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,720
fly right through this so you're here

5
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:26,570
for digital transformation is security

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,520
transformation my name is Alan crow you

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,110

we're sharing with f5 I can talk a

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,649
little bit about this but I could talk

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,360
all day so if you're interested in Exim

12

I'm gonna blast through this agenda

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,360
there's a lot of content to put in I'm

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,430
very interested in your questions I

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,800
would love to talk with you but I don't

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,030
have a lot of time to do it now so at

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,650
the end if I have time for questions

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,570
I'll be happy to take them otherwise

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:06,289
come see me and we can chat in more

23
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:08,450
detail so as we start talking about

24
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,310
digital transformation we really want to

25
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,040
talk about what is digital

26
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,680
transformation so trying to figure out

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,360
what this means can be dependent on who

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,180
you're talking to what market you're

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,520
talking to and what part of the business

30
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,190
you're talking to wikipedia defines

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,009
digital transformation has the use of

32
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:30,560
new fast and frequently changing digital

33
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:33,440
technology to solve problems often

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,720
utilizing cloud computing reducing

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,830
reliance on user owned hardware but

36
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,260
increasing reliance on

37
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,298
subscription-based cloud services does

38
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,030
that clear it up for everybody everyone

39
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:47,630
good with that you can respond it's ok

40
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,700
you've had some time for coffee the fun

41
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,470
thing about this is with Wikipedia as

42
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,510
with everything on Wikipedia you can

43
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,520
change the definition if you want to and

44
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,380
so there's a lot of conversation about

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,750
what wikipedia says about digital

46
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,399
transformation the problem being it's

47
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,960
out of date every time someone writes

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,820
about it because someone then goes and

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,239
changes it to fit what they think

50
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,068
digital transformation is so I used to

51
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,110
work for a digital signage company and

52
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:13,939
we worked with everything from fortune

53
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,389
50 clients all the way down to places

54
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:19,279
with one or two shops and with those

55
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:21,770
they talk digital transformation all the

56
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:24,200
time that could be something as as

57
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,540
big as working with a fortune 50 company

58
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,100
to create a signage system that allows

59
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,650
them to update their menu board across

60
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,980
the globe enforce brand standards bring

61
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,680
in video and animation to really drive a

62
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,209
customer interaction it can also mean

63
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,220
talking with someone who used to write

64
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,540
their menu on a chalkboard and they took

65
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,390
a picture of that chalkboard and they

66
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,799
want to put that on a TV and both of

67
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,470
those groups would talk about that as

68
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,090
being a digital transformation so as we

69
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,920
start digging into this we really have

70
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,470
to look at what does that mean to the

71
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,299
clients that we're interacting with and

72
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,950
so for me I like to think of digital

73
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,160
transformation as transforming a

74
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,079
business's engagement with their clients

75
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,450
utilizing technology so overall the

76
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,300
process of digital transformation can be

77
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,880
reliant on technology and thus reliant

78
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,430
on us as IT but it shouldn't be driven

79
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,269
by us this really is a business decision

80
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:19,640
on how they drive it so there's no

81
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,530
specific product that is going to do

82
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,959
digital transformation for everybody all

83
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,930
the time and in fact as we talk digital

84
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,850
transformation there is no product that

85
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,010
does digital transformation there's

86
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,109
products that help with it but overall

87
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:39,170
this is an architecture and a solution

88
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:41,540
not a product and so what does this mean

89
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,820
to us as IT and for those of us in

90
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,340
security as IT security professionals

91
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,170
see if we think back a few years before

92
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,959
this started to be the buzzword the

93
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,640
driving force behind us we had these

94
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,760
wonderful things that were starting to

95
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,859
be stable we had ITIL that were giving

96
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,130
us standards for how we worked we had

97
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,590
enforced change control we had set solid

98
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,890
release cycles that people didn't get to

99
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:10,220
violate and then this comes up and we

100
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:12,589
start to see a shift where IT starts to

101
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,709
lose control of technology within the

102
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:18,620
business CIT had controlled the

103
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,510
technology spend budget right we had

104
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,120
that if it was technology it came

105
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,820
through IT and as something new came up

106
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,280
where a business unit said hey I really

107
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,590
want to try this new thing the the

108
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,090
common response I know that we certainly

109
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,590
gave was well it's not

110
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,530
budget this year we'll have to look at

111
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,270
it next year or well our release cycles

112
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,169
locked for this time but we can look at

113
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,080
it for next time

114
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:44,659
and so digital transformation came in a

115
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,180
business units start saying hey you're

116
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,800
not responding fast enough we need to do

117
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,620
this and we need to do this now to stay

118
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,510
to stay relevant and so our business

119
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,430
owners are starting to come to us with

120
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:59,510
technology suggestions right

121
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:01,280
I want the app to do this I want I need

122
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,349
to be able to release things faster than

123
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,789
every month I need to be able to tie our

124
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,620
services in with our business partners

125
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:10,070
and it needs to happen seamlessly behind

126
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,110
the scenes I can't have my app pop up

127
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,849
and now take me to this other person and

128
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,690
lose that brand capture that I already

129
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,760
had with my client and if IT can't help

130
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,650
them deliver these things they'll go off

131
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,820
and do it on their own all right anybody

132
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:27,138
heard of shadow IT nobody one person in

133
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,540
the back all right

134
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:34,970
we're gonna do buzzword bingo later I

135
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:36,740
mean no wow so they're no longer the

136
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,240
businesses no longer happy with us

137
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,000
saying hey we did the best we could

138
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,220
we'll try again next month right they

139
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,260
now want to see validated results how

140
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,390
did you do this how did they respond

141
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,060
what was the interaction change and

142
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:53,060
we're seeing more and more technologists

143
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,250
move out of IT into those business units

144
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,430
so business units are starting to own

145
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:01,880
their own technology pieces so the CRM

146
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:04,610
right is not managed by IT much anymore

147
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,100
it's managed by marketing or it's

148
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,590
managed by sales operations it's not an

149
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,800
IT IT needs to start providing that

150
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:14,900
framework that allows the bill a bit as

151
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:20,300
how do we mitigate this risk how do we

152
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:21,919
handle this risk and so later on today

153
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,990
you're gonna have a keynote on zero

154
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,280
trust I was kind of hoping it was in

155
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,900
front of mine so that I could skip

156
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,169
through some of my slides as a review

157
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,549
but you know this is what we've got zero

158
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:35,000
trust is the first piece of the

159
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:37,360
architecture I see us NIT using to help

160
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,220
build this framework for our businesses

161
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,810
zero trust is very buzzword e right now

162
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,510
right everybody's talking about zero

163
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,730
trust zero trust this is your trust that

164
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:50,090
my product will enable you to do zero

165
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:52,610
trust which is an absolute lie if

166
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,650
anybody says my product does zero trust

167
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,440
for you they don't understand what zero

168
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:00,140
trust is which luckily NIST recently

169
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,440
released their paper on zero trust

170
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:06,950
architecture and so you can google this

171
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,770
so it's nist SP 800 - 27 you can get a

172
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,539
PDF it's still in comment phase so

173
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,039
they're looking for feedback they're

174
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,350
looking for that information but you can

175
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,900
get it and see what they say and the

176
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,310
good thing for me is that they're very

177
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:23,840
explicit that zero trust is not a

178
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:25,940
product it's an architecture and it's an

179
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,640
architecture for eliminating uncertainty

180
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,070
in enforcing accurate access decisions

181
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:35,030
and so we're going to dig into this a

182
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:37,490
little bit more as we do that again I'm

183
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:39,200
gonna hit on this and and I'm an

184
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,330
engineer right so I don't get paid to

185
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,940
sell product I get paid to make stuff

186
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,849
work and I get paid to build stuff that

187
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,070
works and a lot of manufacturers are

188
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,910
saying they're they're trying to define

189
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:56,330
zero trust into what they sell and

190
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:58,280
that's just not the case so to really

191
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,500
get there in fact you're probably gonna

192
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,460
have to wholesale replace a whole chunk

193
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,040
of your architecture

194
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,049
unless you've been been lucky to you

195
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,390
know be building towards it over the

196
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,890
last 10 years or so there's a lot of

197
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,800
stuff that's going to go into zero trust

198
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:15,590
and how zero trust works but ultimately

199
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,210
the goal here is that the sum of what

200
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,460
you have the whole of your architecture

201
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,799
is better than all of the pieces put

202
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,440
together you get that synergistic effect

203
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,060
that you know used to be the buzzword

204
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,450
and today zero Trust is really where

205
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,010
you're gonna realize that but part of

206
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,140
this is you're gonna have to be flexible

207
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,990
you're gonna have to take a step back

208
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,150
and be able to solve this problem of how

209
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:41,799
do I effectively authenticate people as

210
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:44,870
well as applications data consumers

211
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,969
api's how do i authenticate them in a

212
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,400
way that's secure that I understand that

213
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,590
it's more than just a particular person

214
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,420
in fact we have to do that in an

215
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,090
environment that's becoming inherently

216
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,020
more and more hostile including your

217
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,190
internal network

218
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,829
if you

219
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:05,060
have one of those anymore I'm a remote

220
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:06,140
employee so mmm I would hope that 90% of

221
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,170
the time I'm working out of my house

222
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:13,370
let's give it a good 75 right but of

223
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:15,260
that point in time I'm not on VPN so I'm

224
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,330
working with clients I'm working in my

225
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,490
internal systems and to be able to

226
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:22,970
authenticate me so that I can so that I

227
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:26,480
can function properly you know that's

228
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:28,190
the internal network these days and so a

229
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,070
lot of the pieces that go into this is

230
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:34,120
things like contextualization so no

231
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:36,500
longer is a username and password enough

232
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,100
so this needs to take an account

233
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,050
location am i here in Louisville am i up

234
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,060
at my home office in Ohio am I in my

235
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,709
headquarters in Chicago or is my

236
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,469
authentication coming out of Sen Jen

237
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,930
China right these are all pieces that

238
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,990
feed in and then you start taking in

239
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,689
time of access so what time of day is it

240
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,650
is it 4:00 a.m. where I'm at

241
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,570
unfortunately that's not a good

242
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:02,870
definition for me because I work

243
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:05,000
whenever I work but did I just

244
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,070
authenticate in Ohio and now two minutes

245
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,860
later I'm trying to authenticate out of

246
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,540
somewhere overseas so those kind of

247
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,790
things as you start to put together that

248
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,310
contextualization surrounding any

249
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:18,920
authentication that's becoming important

250
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,599
we're talking about our back role based

251
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,120
access control we'll dig into that a

252
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,520
little bit more least privileged or

253
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,190
strict access control and it's

254
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,510
operational as well as preventive it's

255
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,400
no longer good enough to just have

256
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,680
preventative measures you have to have

257
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,500
the operational pieces behind it to

258
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,479
monitor log and then respond to

259
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:42,350
authentication attempts and potential

260
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,060
anomalies and the biggest thing zero

261
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,730
Trust is never done you've never

262
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,069
finished implementing zero trust you

263
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,170
need to constantly be checking out

264
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,790
what's going on as your threat

265
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,949
environment shifts you need to be able

266
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:57,140
to tune your systems and tune your

267
00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:00,830
controls that surround those to match

268
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,480
what your threat environment is today so

269
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,830
the first piece of the zero trust that

270
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,260
we're going to talk about is going to be

271
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,760
strong authentication and that doesn't

272
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,520
just mean you're also using a

273
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,600
multi-factor piece so multi-factor is

274
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,910
helpful

275
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,130
but you also need to look at things like

276
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,260
mutual authentication where rather than

277
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,880
just a one-sided authentication the

278
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,340
other side is also going to authenticate

279
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,710
back and check both things it's

280
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,080
contextual so that's again it's beyond

281
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:29,990
just their credentials its location its

282
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:32,810
time of day it's unusual times it's

283
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:35,120
checking for time travel multiple logins

284
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:38,540
all of those pieces feed into that

285
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:42,140
context surrounding the authentication

286
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:45,050
request and it really needs to support

287
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,470
non human transactions so what do I mean

288
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,760
things like cryptographic exchanges

289
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:53,330
challenge response within system to

290
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,270
system authentication and API keys and

291
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,950
or API authentication right so all of

292
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,930
those pieces get it need to come

293
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,990
together so that we can have that strong

294
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,910
authentication once you're authenticated

295
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,400
you've got to move into least privilege

296
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,589
so least privilege model is going to

297
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,250
give you the the least amount of things

298
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:16,870
that you can do on a regular basis right

299
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:20,000
so it's a relatively simple concept and

300
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:22,880
the way that I think about it is user

301
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,280
account verse administrator access right

302
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,230
so day to day I can use a my standard

303
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,790
user account if I need to do email if I

304
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,740
need to write documents if I need to

305
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,410
work on slide decks that put everybody

306
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,600
to sleep that can all be done via my

307
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,459
user account but then there's occasions

308
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,140
where hey I really need to get in to do

309
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,150
this so I need to set a route on my

310
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,270
laptop because my client over my client

311
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,920
IDs overlap my IPS or they didn't set up

312
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,710
DNS entries for the routers I need to

313
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,689
get to right so at that point I need to

314
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,510
have some level administrative access

315
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,940
and that can be as simple as on a Linux

316
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,100
based machine being able to do on a

317
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:01,160
Windows machine run as administrator'

318
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,930
right or in some cases login to a

319
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,010
dedicated administrator account that's

320
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:09,709
only accessible within a secondary login

321
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:13,280
and so this way on a day to day basis

322
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:14,810
I'm not actually exposing those

323
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,630
administrative accounts those

324
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:21,339
administrative privileges unnecessarily

325
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:24,530
and so the fun that we have with this as

326
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,470
especially on the IT side is how does an

327
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:29,880
organization

328
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:33,210
balanced least privilege with the

329
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,790
ability to maintain and run that system

330
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:37,800
on an ongoing basis so if eyes

331
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,780
administrator have to log in 15

332
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,430
different times with a 34 character

333
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,050
password that has to have at least five

334
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,750
uppercase lowercase non matching

335
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,790
characters three special characters and

336
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,590
four numbers that don't match anything

337
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,230
else and I haven't used it in the past

338
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,480
six and a half years it's a little bit

339
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:58,110
of a challenge right so there's a

340
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,440
balance that has to be done here and so

341
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,750
as we we start to look at least

342
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,660
privileged it has to be implemented

343
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:09,510
within the tools within the applications

344
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:12,380
this has to be built into it which all

345
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:14,880
ties us into role based access control

346
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:17,189
so role based access has anybody heard

347
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,230
of role based access control hey there

348
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,830
we go you're waking up all right our

349
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:25,830
back so our back is gonna get you into

350
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,560
fine-grained access control your role

351
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,360
tells you what you can do in the system

352
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,089
your group tells you where you can do it

353
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:37,110
right so your role may be guest may be

354
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:38,580
user may be editor may be admin the

355
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,250
group then gives it four specific

356
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,440
functions right all this ties together

357
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:47,220
the groups then tie this together and

358
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:51,330
you assign access users to those groups

359
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:53,610
and see if you don't do this you start

360
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,200
to lose control how many of you used to

361
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:58,620
assign privileges to specific user

362
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,390
accounts I'll come on raise your hand we

363
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,460
all did at one point all right before

364
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,900
grouping started to come in now how much

365
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:08,100
fun was it when someone said hey we've

366
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:09,900
got 50 new users right so being able to

367
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,990
group this out allows us to maintain

368
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:16,319
control the fun then becomes when

369
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,760
someone says hey we just contracted with

370
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,410
this third-party agency and they're

371
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,730
gonna manage all of this for us we need

372
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,890
you to be able to let them in and give

373
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:25,110
them access how many of you want to add

374
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:30,150
that company and their entire directory

375
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:31,290
to your systems anyone know right so

376
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:35,040
this is where we start to talk about

377
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:37,260
federated identity so we we allow

378
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,339
federated identity to build that trust

379
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,830
relationship with other end

380
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,720
whether that's a third party whether

381
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,580
that's a contractor whether that's

382
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,610
internal divisions that we have

383
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:50,200
separation of access from right because

384
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,850
what fun is it when you give someone

385
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,800
administrative access and then you find

386
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,360
out six months later how that guy hasn't

387
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,280
been here forever

388
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,500
he was fired because he was doing bad

389
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,839
things and his admin account has still

390
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,310
been valid the entire time how much fun

391
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,140
is that who wants to go back and do that

392
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:09,819
data check to make sure nothing's been

393
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:12,490
done right and so what we have to do is

394
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:15,400
establish trusts and relationships with

395
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:18,970
other groups and make them through that

396
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:21,040
trusted delegation actually handle the

397
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,680
pieces of authentication while we

398
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,310
maintain control over the over what they

399
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,469
do and see this is all necessary for

400
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,420
agility right as we start talking

401
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,220
through what these things do for us is

402
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,680
it gives us the business agility

403
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,910
necessary so that we don't have to

404
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,150
manage and maintain and become a

405
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,150
roadblock

406
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:46,149
and so as we start looking at this you

407
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,130
know identity as a concept beginning

408
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:50,199
continues to expand on what we're

409
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,660
actually talking about it's no longer

410
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:56,229
just username and password and maybe it

411
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,089
may be a a group that they're a part of

412
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,709
and their original we start to talk

413
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:02,380
about things like background dossiers

414
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:04,149
being part of identity or in healthcare

415
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,650
systems some certain amount of health

416
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,720
care information being part of that

417
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,630
identity that's now shared and federated

418
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,669
between the two organizations and it's a

419
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,770
pretty cool relatively extensible

420
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:16,780
framework as you start looking at these

421
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,668
things more and more data can be used to

422
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,549
exchange as part of that federated

423
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:24,220
identity between the two but you have to

424
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:26,799
then realize that that identity now

425
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,720
needs to be protected itself it's no

426
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,220
longer just a username and all we need

427
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,230
to hash the password so that they don't

428
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,790
know the password we've got a whole lot

429
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,000
more data that now we're having to

430
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,830
protect and so while we have the ability

431
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,470
to define this we also have to have the

432
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:44,230
ability to manage it and to work with

433
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,970
third parties without breaking it all

434
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,580
right and so as we start looking at this

435
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,020
a good way that we can do that is

436
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:53,909
through the concept of micro

437
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:56,679
segmentation so we can have our system

438
00:17:53,910 --> 00:18:00,280
that interacts with third party ap is

439
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:02,230
that has databases has large complex

440
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,899
applications built on top of multiple

441
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,970
modules and all of those pieces and the

442
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,880
only thing we expose to our user is one

443
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:11,799
web port right gone are the days where

444
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,270
we had to open up certain database ports

445
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,679
so that the database can interact with

446
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,030
the JavaScript so that they could build

447
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,880
the page so that they can pull the data

448
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,710
so they could see the price right all of

449
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,750
that's done on the back end and with

450
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:26,290
micro segmentation all of those touch

451
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:28,780
points become our edge become our

452
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,850
security edge where now we're actually

453
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,700
defining our security interactions at

454
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:35,740
each of those touch points right so

455
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,780
those these foreign api's that we're

456
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,299
building into and that we're working

457
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,270
with as our third-party interactions are

458
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:46,780
actually secured in and of themselves

459
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:49,120
unique to that interaction this allows

460
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:52,240
us to do things like determine what

461
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,629
access apply least privilege to the API

462
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,970
integrations with our

463
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,830
and systems B whether that's user

464
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,470
application infrastructure management

465
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,830
all those pieces to hi together and can

466
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:05,840
be secured individually and uniquely and

467
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,790
this allows us to prevent east-west or

468
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,939
lateral movement when there's an

469
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:13,700
indicator of compromise because as

470
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,530
should something get compromised or as

471
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,240
it gets compromised ultimately

472
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:20,629
everything will be compromised if it's

473
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,400
left alone right we're gonna start to

474
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,860
see flags hit because we're gonna hit

475
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,050
more and more security policies so our

476
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,510
web front-end is exploited someone

477
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,280
managed us to hit it right and as they

478
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,170
try to reach back to the database to get

479
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,760
the actual information we're going to

480
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,470
see flags because they're doing it in a

481
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,400
manner that is not consistent with how

482
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:43,130
the application operates and so ideally

483
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,300
that IRA team is going to see that and

484
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,280
they're gonna respond and they're gonna

485
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,139
be able to do it faster because there's

486
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,389
more flags that get thrown the deeper

487
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,330
they try to go and this is gonna limit

488
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,830
something hopefully to just being an

489
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,610
exploit before it actually becomes a

490
00:19:54,830 --> 00:20:00,909
true data breach and so all of this ties

491
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:03,919
in now to our security operations team

492
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:06,080
right so our set off steam is gonna be

493
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,570
responsible for you know detection

494
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,990
response because no preventive control

495
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:14,629
is perfect given enough time everything

496
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:17,090
will get hacked given enough exposure

497
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,610
everything will get cracked right and

498
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,580
mistakes happen anybody heard of

499
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,719
phishing

500
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,870
Verizon's report this year said last

501
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,610
year 32% of all the all of the data

502
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:32,659
breaches were started with a phishing of

503
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:34,550
some form it's a full third and I'd say

504
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,110
probably another half of what's left was

505
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:39,560
really fishing but people just didn't

506
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:42,320
accept it see apps and devices get

507
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,970
misconfigured entropy happens people set

508
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,110
something up once and just expect it to

509
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:51,230
keep working the entire time tools crash

510
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:52,280
logs get dropped and see is what we need

511
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,490
to have is the ability to identify

512
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,470
situations where we have an application

513
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,720
an environment or a trust relationship

514
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,690
that doesn't actually match our

515
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,880
organization's risk foster right what's

516
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,800
acceptable risk for the organization and

517
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,020
how do we document that

518
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,930
and we need to have an exception process

519
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:14,300
when something doesn't fit that process

520
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,730
you know doesn't fit our standard stance

521
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,919
on how we secure things we need to have

522
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,780
an exception process to allow for a non

523
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,060
adversarial relationship with our

524
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,700
business folks to allow that to happen

525
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:27,110
how many of you ever had to set up an

526
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:32,110
IPSec tunnel between you and a third

527
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:34,370
party provider one maybe one and a half

528
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:37,340
all right

529
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:39,800
that's always fun setting up SEC tunnels

530
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:42,260
between two businesses it's more than

531
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,389
just a hey let's here's your IP here's

532
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,920
your password there's an IP overlap

533
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,420
you've got to talk about policy you've

534
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,100
got to talk about who can access what

535
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,590
where can you access it how can you

536
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,909
access it right that always and then you

537
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:56,330
always have to wait for the change

538
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:58,670
control to go through and so I know I

539
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,110
certainly in the my former life when I

540
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,700
was setting up tunnels that could be a

541
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,740
one to two month process if I'm talking

542
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,210
about a fortune 50 company to get an

543
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,740
IPSec tunnel up so that I can actually

544
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:10,070
provide them with the services that

545
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:12,380
they're paying me to provide them and so

546
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,090
having that exception handling process

547
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,590
how do we do this faster how do we

548
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:19,580
enable our business to be able to

549
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:22,520
accelerate their innovation becomes a

550
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:25,820
key point and so now we can also start

551
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:27,560
to to proactively work together once

552
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:30,409
it's in place we put an exception in

553
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,450
place we need to then come back and fix

554
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,180
that exception right so we'll give you

555
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,800
an exception for a month but at the end

556
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,360
of that month we're gonna re-evaluate

557
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,560
this and figure out why it's still an

558
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,929
exception and part of that then becomes

559
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,300
putting compensating controls around

560
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,830
that exception so yes you have an

561
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,510
exception we're gonna give you a month

562
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,370
to figure out why you can't go through

563
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:54,680
our standardized process but we're gonna

564
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:57,530
log the crap out of every exchange that

565
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,270
you do with us because we need to make

566
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,020
sure that we still understand you're not

567
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:04,760
trying to get outside of your lane and

568
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,660
this really needs to be documented in

569
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,430
some fashion

570
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,870
and it needs to be documented over time

571
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,640
you're gonna you should have and we'll

572
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,949
talk about in a second governance system

573
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,260
that allows you to manage these

574
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:18,200
interactions over time and be able to

575
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,940
report back on them we had 15 exceptions

576
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,450
last month they came up on their due

577
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,370
date this

578
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,380
month this is the logging this is what

579
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:26,479
we saw and this is how we resolved half

580
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,740
of them the other half art resolved

581
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:35,690
we're going to resolve them next month

582
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:39,610
with this process makes sense anyone but

583
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:41,780
I put you all to sleep working on it

584
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,610
let's talk about one of the biggest

585
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,740
tools in our toolbox as we do this and

586
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,719
that's the sim right so security

587
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,360
information event management system and

588
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,850
this started off is a simple thing of

589
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,919
hey we need to aggregate all of these

590
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,659
logs we need to put all these logs in

591
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,480
one place so that we make sure that we

592
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,220
have them stored off box so that if that

593
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,400
box hits compromised we still have all

594
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:07,580
the logs and then they started moving

595
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,370
into correlating events right so hey our

596
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:13,490
firewall saw this our end point system

597
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:17,510
saw this maybe those mean the same thing

598
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:20,810
right and then starting to add in things

599
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,790
like threat feeds all right so being

600
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,320
able to see those outside feeds to say

601
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,750
hey we know this is becoming a bigger

602
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,179
and bigger problem for people or we know

603
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,400
seeing this over here and this this

604
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,890
group of people they saw this so it led

605
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,660
to an indicator of compromise that might

606
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:38,870
be the same over here that matches yours

607
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:41,210
and see now they're able to correlate

608
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:43,580
multiple input data sets all that your

609
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:45,490
devices can feed in this your sim if you

610
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:49,040
can afford to pay the sim per item fee

611
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:50,900
right we can get threat intelligence all

612
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,670
kinds of fun and cool things that those

613
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,280
sims are starting to do and they're

614
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:57,470
gonna try the the best place sim is

615
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,200
going to be tuned where it's feeding out

616
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:02,060
it's feeding all of the noise in it's

617
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,450
throwing the noise out and it's alerting

618
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:07,460
on the things that become important and

619
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,670
so this allows you to keep your false

620
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:12,620
positives low right so false positives

621
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,740
making sure the stuff that looks bad

622
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,330
actually isn't we want to keep that low

623
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,220
and we want to keep our false negatives

624
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,409
even lower those are the things that

625
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,260
actually are bad but don't look bad

626
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:25,700
because it's an isolated case right no

627
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,410
longer we're talking day one we're

628
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,810
talking day zero we're talking minute

629
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:31,910
zero right we don't want to be the first

630
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:33,320
person who sees an exploit because

631
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,669
chances are it means our system isn't

632
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,340
going to catch

633
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:40,470
but we want to keep those low they can

634
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,000
also be camouflaged right so the

635
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:44,730
wonderful thing about machine learning

636
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,409
is the bad guys can use it too and they

637
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:49,740
can change and they can understand those

638
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:51,480
systems so all of this leads us to

639
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:55,019
better be able to better deploy our

640
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,460
resources so rather than chasing logs or

641
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:59,460
chasing things how many of you used to

642
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,909
any of you used to read logs let's look

643
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:05,370
at yesterday's logs and see what popped

644
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:10,380
anybody nobody ever looked at firewall

645
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:11,668
counters nobody Wow maybe that's a good

646
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,809
thing because now you're looking at your

647
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:16,139
sim and you're seeing the alerts from

648
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:20,460
the sim anybody nobody either Wow

649
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:22,229
okay that's fine the other fun thing

650
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,389
we're starting to see in the sim world

651
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:27,840
as we're starting to see vendors build

652
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:30,360
sims into their own ecosystems right so

653
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,370
we had one client that deployed an e an

654
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,820
ecosystem sim surrounding there and tied

655
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:37,979
their firewall environments and when

656
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,620
they did that the logs that they were

657
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:43,679
actually sending to their sim dropped by

658
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,539
40% and it allowed them to see that only

659
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,510
the important alerts from the firewall

660
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:50,970
in the sim itself which allowed the sim

661
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:54,179
to better focus on just aggregating and

662
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:56,130
correlating events and so there's

663
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:58,649
opportunities here to take advantage of

664
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:01,350
what becomes a multi-stage process right

665
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:03,178
multistage sim starts to allow you to

666
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:06,149
kind of funnel down the most important

667
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:08,039
stuff and then the sim the endpoint sim

668
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:10,889
is only going to pop the things that

669
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:12,450
become really important the fun with

670
00:27:10,889 --> 00:27:14,299
that is making sure you're not over

671
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,950
tuning it to where you're tuning out

672
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,809
those those pops that we haven't seen

673
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,039
before

674
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:21,720
and probably the last thing that's not

675
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:25,710
on the slide but probably should be is

676
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,110
sim is not a magic bullet sims require a

677
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:30,299
lot of ongoing care and feeding

678
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:33,000
they require someone to actually look at

679
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:34,918
them we've gone into clients before and

680
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,990
said so how's your sim operating and

681
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:40,710
they said oh great when was the last

682
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:44,130
time you looked at it well when were you

683
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,809
here last right if you're not looking at

684
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,950
your sim if you're not seeing the alerts

685
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:47,539
that are coming out of it

686
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,600
it

687
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:52,609
becomes a great log aggregator that is

688
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,428
there when for when you get breached and

689
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:57,259
someone has to do investigation and

690
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:58,399
really that's not how you want to use it

691
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:02,629
you want to pull it into that

692
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:05,779
preventative side of things all right

693
00:28:02,629 --> 00:28:09,978
one last piece on zero trust and that's

694
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:12,859
governance so all of these pieces are

695
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:15,619
going to come together right and now we

696
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:17,949
have to ensure that as we start doing

697
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:20,720
rapid deployment of new applications

698
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:23,570
whether they're our own or third-party

699
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,299
services that they fit within our risk

700
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,979
tolerances right so this includes

701
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:31,009
specific controls surrounding

702
00:28:27,979 --> 00:28:33,200
authentication and segmentation defining

703
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:35,330
our acceptable risk defining our risk

704
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,399
tolerances within a system that allows

705
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:39,070
us to then correlate and aggregate all

706
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:41,809
of our build-outs

707
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:44,599
see it's no longer good enough to have

708
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:47,090
that before you go live you have to

709
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:50,119
follow this procedure and you have to

710
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:52,399
pass this security scan anybody dealt

711
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:55,849
with that no go live till you pass a

712
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:58,279
pass a security scan one in the back two

713
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:59,779
in the back right so it's that's no

714
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,609
longer good enough because people are

715
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,830
trying to constantly deploy more and

716
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:05,720
more and as we talk about systems and

717
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:08,330
we'll get to it here in a second the

718
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,389
cloud the cloud is no longer utilizing a

719
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:13,519
monolithic system right we don't if we

720
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:15,830
need more access we're not adding CPU

721
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,599
and memory to a machine if we need more

722
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:21,678
bandwidth we're not ordering a bigger

723
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:23,479
pipe from our ISP and so we need to have

724
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,450
the system a governance system that is

725
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:28,999
it lay in a Buhl's us to track and and

726
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:32,450
accelerate our business but stay within

727
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:34,759
our risk tolerances see we have to

728
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:37,789
define and monitor our key controls and

729
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:39,349
these are high-level checks these

730
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:40,940
high-level checks the key controls

731
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:43,489
aren't going to be the ones that say hey

732
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:46,159
by the way on the 93rd line of this

733
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:47,899
particular module you have a variable

734
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,249
that's undefined that will be allowed to

735
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:51,498
be exploited through a cross-site

736
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:53,359
scripting error right that's not a key

737
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:54,950
control a key controls gonna say hey

738
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,259
there's a problem somewhere in here and

739
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,909
that's going to be that high level point

740
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:00,460
to enable you to say hey we need to dig

741
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:03,260
into this

742
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,320
all right anything more than that we

743
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,390
start to lose the fight with agility and

744
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:11,110
so this then ties back into how do we

745
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:13,880
handle that acceleration that agility

746
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:15,830
when there's a problem so having that

747
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:20,300
exception and the compensating controls

748
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:22,159
P as piece and part of this the fun of

749
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,950
this is just like security awareness

750
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:28,130
only worse and what we're looking for

751
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:31,070
here is not just compliance because

752
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,809
compliance means I will check a box fast

753
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,639
enough to get you out of my way so that

754
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:36,889
I can do what I need to do we're looking

755
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,390
for buy-in we're looking for buy-in from

756
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:40,780
business we're looking for buy-in from

757
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:43,580
developers from the engineering teams

758
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:46,280
because buy-in says I understand why

759
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,770
this is important and I want to build

760
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,170
this into my entire process so that I

761
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:54,200
don't have to do things at the end how

762
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:56,240
many of you have written code how many

763
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,929
of you have documented your code after

764
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,990
you were done writing it how many of you

765
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:05,780
documented your code as you went yeah a

766
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:06,950
whole lot less there right how many of

767
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,290
you got to the end of writing your

768
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:13,670
module and you go I don't remember what

769
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:15,740
I was doing here right so making sure

770
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,660
that it's done as you're rolling through

771
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:22,790
makes it easier for everybody in the

772
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:26,090
long run so that's zero trust in a

773
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:28,820
nutshell high-level points here right

774
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:30,620
architecture not a product we're

775
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,570
confident that the identity is where

776
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:35,330
we're is who would they say there are

777
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,860
but while we're confident we're keeping

778
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:40,159
them to only the things they need to do

779
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:43,459
we're isolating systems and applications

780
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:45,770
from each other and we're combining that

781
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,020
with operational visibility and having a

782
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:51,070
governance process in place so we can

783
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,070
keep the whole thing running

784
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:59,479
let's talk about the cloud the clouds a

785
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:05,029
fun one because if you'll pardon the pun

786
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:07,130
it's a little bit of morphus see and

787
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:08,570
when it comes down to here as we start

788
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,909
talking about cloud and true cloud

789
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:14,210
adoption we're talking about everything

790
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:16,640
as a service when cloud came out it was

791
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,140
rainbows puppies kittens and unicorns it

792
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,529
was gonna save the day

793
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:23,029
anybody here that anybody I can get rid

794
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:25,490
of my data center because I'm moving to

795
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:28,100
the cloud we're gonna save money because

796
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:29,289
we're moving to the cloud nobody heard

797
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:34,360
any of those things

798
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:40,190
anybody have cloud conversations okay

799
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:44,649
right so everything is a service cloud

800
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,649
has become the most overused term in IT

801
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:50,690
and what we're talking about here are

802
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:53,059
multi tenant applications and third

803
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,919
party hosted IT infrastructure that's

804
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:57,799
the biggest piece when we start talking

805
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:59,750
about cloud of what we really mean so

806
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:03,679
let's talk about is infrastructure as a

807
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:05,750
service right at the end of the day this

808
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,730
is their core infrastructure it's your

809
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:12,320
IT environment they're handling

810
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:14,149
everything below the VM however I am

811
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,470
putting this in caps because I am

812
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:20,299
yelling it I just won't do it through a

813
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:22,940
microphone to save you you own your

814
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:25,010
security the security that they put in

815
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:28,100
place is to protect their infrastructure

816
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:31,789
from you as the client that's the goal

817
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:34,519
in an I as with a cloud vendor so cloud

818
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:37,100
can be an incumbent

819
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:39,320
VMs containers or workloads as they'll

820
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,779
call them release him and then we also

821
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:45,080
add in relational data services IOT

822
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:46,909
serverless computing storage we have

823
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,039
clients to say we're moving to the cloud

824
00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:51,769
we're moving all of our stuff up to AWS

825
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:55,908
and our answer is are you moving to the

826
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:58,010
cloud or are you move into ec2 because

827
00:33:55,909 --> 00:34:00,679
ec2 is just server computing up in

828
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:03,080
someone else's data center right they're

829
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:05,230
converting their current physical boxes

830
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,418
to a VM that runs up and

831
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,770
and they've moved to the cloud but at

832
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:10,270
the end of the day if that's as far as

833
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,129
they're going they're not taking

834
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:15,879
advantage of what the cloud can actually

835
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:17,259
offer to them and one of those things

836
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:20,770
that we get to deal with is there's

837
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:23,409
still an edge in the cloud and in fact I

838
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,909
would say there's a lot more edges in a

839
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:27,869
cloud environment that there are then

840
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:32,440
there are in a data center environment

841
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:34,119
so we have to put things in a lot of the

842
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,859
breaches and a lot of the things that we

843
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:37,300
see are people that don't think they

844
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:39,489
need to protect their edge when it's

845
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,679
moved up into the cloud so they p2v2

846
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:43,689
server physical to virtual the server

847
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,190
they moved it up into Amazon and say all

848
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,500
right we're good to go we're in the

849
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,629
cloud and they forgot to deploy a

850
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,389
security control or they forgot to

851
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:55,029
deploy a virtual edition firewall or Wow

852
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:56,320
and now all of a sudden all those things

853
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,480
that used to be protected because the

854
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,400
security team handled them are wide and

855
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,560
open to the Internet we have to remember

856
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,480
the least privileged so if you put your

857
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,828
database server directly on the internet

858
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:13,450
you are not using lease privilege that

859
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:14,020
usually gets at least a giggle I mean

860
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:18,879
come on

861
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:20,740
nothing so AWS has an awesome rback

862
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,160
system but you have to actually use it

863
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,990
for it to work we have to make sure our

864
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,170
operational governments is still at play

865
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:31,209
we need to use MFA for console access if

866
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:33,579
you're not using multi-factor to secure

867
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:35,470
that to secure that interaction with a

868
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:39,069
console in the cloud you're going to

869
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:41,078
have problems data encryption so

870
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:43,779
built-in features look at the cloud

871
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:45,670
system you're about to utilize use the

872
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,980
security features built into it as

873
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:50,260
you're beat the rest of the major cloud

874
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,930
providers to providing a cloud native

875
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:56,380
sim we really didn't think it would be

876
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:58,839
Microsoft that got there first we

877
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,060
thought AWS was going to release their

878
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:03,609
cloud native sim first Microsoft beat

879
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:06,328
them I'm very happy that Azure actually

880
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:10,960
has it because it is a Microsoft product

881
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:12,880
no giggles Wow all right as we get into

882
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,069
this - we need a monitor log and analyze

883
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,200
so you're gonna have a whole lot of

884
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:18,750
telemetry coming in from the different

885
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,660
pieces of the cloud and it

886
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:23,340
looks different this is new telemetry we

887
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,350
don't understand what these things are

888
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,330
but as we start diving into them we

889
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:29,339
realize in a lot of cases it's the same

890
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:31,890
as the logs we're familiar with it's

891
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,330
very similar to a firewall log right so

892
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,950
the telemetry we're getting out of the

893
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:37,009
cloud routers as we start looking at

894
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:40,620
them or similar to firewall systems or

895
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:42,990
VPNs so we can understand that telemetry

896
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,089
within that light and then realize how

897
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:46,799
we're going to utilize it because at the

898
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:53,120
end of the day there's more security

899
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:55,740
operations so let's talk about app sec

900
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,390
the fun that we have as we move up to

901
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,459
the cloud is if we're not able to find

902
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:01,770
what we're trying to do is a service

903
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,450
from someone else chances are there's

904
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:05,280
custom code that's going to be involved

905
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:11,129
here or custom functionality that we

906
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:14,040
need and so we need to remember here the

907
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:16,080
cloud secure vendors are not going to

908
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,540
protect you you have to protect yourself

909
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,950
I will say that again and again and

910
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,080
again because we see it with too many

911
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:24,120
clients that think because there was a

912
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:28,259
cloud provider they don't have to deal

913
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:30,540
with security so things like Mis

914
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,630
configuration happens anybody heard of

915
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,580
s3 bucket exposures someone puts puts

916
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,990
their files up in s3 and they are good

917
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:40,319
to go because their data is in the cloud

918
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:42,209
and they forgot to secure it so as we

919
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,810
talk about capital ones breach from not

920
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:49,620
too long ago that was a cloud security

921
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:51,509
failure and they what they did they had

922
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,670
a malicious admin so it was user based

923
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,830
and they were able to trick one back-end

924
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,270
service into believing another back-end

925
00:37:55,830 --> 00:38:00,960
service and requesting data that it

926
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:04,470
wasn't able to happen which on one hand

927
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,630
talks will talk about API security but

928
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,980
if they if they missed that they were

929
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,020
missing some of the operational

930
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,680
components that need to go into that API

931
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:15,480
security side of things a lot of times

932
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,399
we have security group failures because

933
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,810
we assign those privileges just to get

934
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,290
something working because we need it

935
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:23,970
right now and then we leave it open I

936
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:25,920
won't tell you how many firewalls I've

937
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:29,330
got into that have all kinds of security

938
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,520
policy and the last one is allow any any

939
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:33,960
right crate firewall you're allowing

940
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,560
everything through that you didn't think

941
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,330
of right so it happens and and it

942
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,430
happens a lot as we start to move into

943
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:43,319
the cloud because we're starting to use

944
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:45,629
services that we don't necessarily

945
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,310
understand we turn on a feature because

946
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,930
someone says that our work we've read it

947
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,480
in a white paper on the internet after

948
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,980
we googled how to get this thing working

949
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,920
right so we turn this service on because

950
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,990
it fixes it that got it working for me

951
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,940
and we don't understand what we actually

952
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:03,750
turned on and how we allows how we

953
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:07,140
allowed unexposed systems to now be

954
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:08,310
exposed through a back-end way I really

955
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:15,330
wonder how many breach investigations

956
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:17,279
start with but I thought right so it's

957
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,840
not that the person wasn't well intended

958
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,850
they were trying to get things working

959
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,910
they may have even had all the security

960
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:25,680
controls in place but due to unexpected

961
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,899
consequences of turning on of twisting

962
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,220
that knob or flipping that switch now

963
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,680
they've done something that they didn't

964
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:33,959
know that they were dealing with and so

965
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,569
we have all of those pieces going on and

966
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,070
we haven't even written our code we've

967
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:40,740
just set up an environment where we can

968
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:42,330
put our code out there so now as we

969
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,520
start talking about software

970
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:46,650
vulnerabilities it's those things that

971
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,830
we create as well as the things that we

972
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:54,540
import how many of you use libraries and

973
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:57,210
code that you didn't write no one no one

974
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:59,279
out there writes code alright so there's

975
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:02,010
these things called libraries someone

976
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,420
else writes them and I decide I need to

977
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,790
use the function that they're providing

978
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:08,100
so I use that library if I don't

979
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:09,990
understand the source of that library if

980
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,150
I don't trust the source of that library

981
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:14,580
they can write whatever code they want

982
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:16,140
and it's in a little black box and as

983
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,810
long as it spits out the at the end

984
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:21,060
Explorer that I expect I think it's good

985
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:22,770
the fact that on the backend it's a hack

986
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,570
library this is a manual middle attacked

987
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:27,150
after before I checked it out a git and

988
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:30,660
it's also sending all of my data over to

989
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:32,550
their server wall you know unless I'm

990
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:36,089
checking for that I don't know that's

991
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:38,490
what's going on right so we have to make

992
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:42,210
sure we are including security in our

993
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:43,950
software development lifecycle so things

994
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:46,680
like third-party libraries container

995
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:48,839
layers databases or actually

996
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,990
using tools that build right into our

997
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:54,000
IDE we're testing it check in to make

998
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:56,549
sure there we're scanning it check in to

999
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,550
check and see what's going on right

1000
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:02,550
we're talking about dev sack ops it's no

1001
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:04,290
longer just dev ops it's no longer just

1002
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:06,930
sec ops we've got to put all of that

1003
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:08,880
together at the same thing and then

1004
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:11,279
we're also doing runtime operational

1005
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,550
checks so we have a laugh that front

1006
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,840
ends our application that checks for

1007
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:20,880
those kind of unexpected things hitting

1008
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,770
and on the back end we need to have API

1009
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,480
gateways which is really just a wife for

1010
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:29,550
your api's right and then monitoring so

1011
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,560
this needs to feed into our sim to make

1012
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:33,560
sure we understand what's going on so

1013
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:41,250
let's briefly talk about AP eyes so ap

1014
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:42,779
eyes are away are their entire goal is

1015
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:45,240
to integrate and communicate between

1016
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:47,040
different systems but we have to protect

1017
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,600
them because if we don't they will

1018
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,540
integrate and communicate between

1019
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:56,400
different disparate systems that's their

1020
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:58,320
job right so we have to they're all

1021
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,090
about the data they're not presenting

1022
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,520
the data they are just feeding the data

1023
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:04,770
right so we've we've abstracted the UI

1024
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,980
from the data and that API is what

1025
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:09,930
allows those two to connect there's two

1026
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:12,900
major types simple object access

1027
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:17,310
protocol or the soap API this is a

1028
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:18,960
standardised formalized API which is

1029
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:20,549
really good because it's standardized

1030
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,020
and formalized the problem is when you

1031
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:24,990
use it you have to use it all you have

1032
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:26,660
to accept the entire standard so that

1033
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:29,129
drives us into a representative

1034
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,540
representative state transfer a restful

1035
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,000
interface everybody heard of a rest

1036
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:36,570
interface anybody use a restful

1037
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,030
interface anybody okay a couple of you

1038
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:41,520
right this is much more popular because

1039
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:43,620
it's convention based and what that

1040
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,450
allows it to do is quickly adapt and be

1041
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,799
structured so that it can adapt to

1042
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:51,470
whatever needs to be handled through the

1043
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:54,620
API and we need to start talking about

1044
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:57,569
identity delegation or access delegation

1045
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:59,220
which is we can talk about OAuth where

1046
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,300
I'm not handling the actual

1047
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,680
authentication

1048
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,240
I passed that out to someone else

1049
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,399
someone else handles the authentication

1050
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,609
and then passes Bank says yeah they're

1051
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,950
good I still control what they can do

1052
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:12,870
within the system but I don't have to

1053
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:14,430
handle the username password credentials

1054
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:16,080
multi-factor authentication with a

1055
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:19,169
CAPTCHA that I can't ever quite click

1056
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:21,720
all the little traffic lights all right

1057
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,890
traffic lights traffic signs and you

1058
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,299
click where are the mountains the

1059
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:27,750
mountain ones are fun because I will

1060
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,720
what's a mountain to you right co-op

1061
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:32,340
declares my consent

1062
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:35,189
ooofff allows for consent so I'm allowed

1063
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:38,360
to send someone to the bank for me but

1064
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:41,970
the bank still decides what they can do

1065
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:43,710
and again to talk back to that Capital

1066
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:47,459
One breach it was a failure within API

1067
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:49,590
security so it was a server side request

1068
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,840
forgery was all server-side back-end API

1069
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:54,180
stuff and the admin was able to convince

1070
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,800
a different database system to give them

1071
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,000
the information that they wanted even

1072
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,130
though they weren't actually allowed to

1073
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:05,330
have it so your app sec rule still plays

1074
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:08,430
and as we talk about things like non IP

1075
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:09,810
service security agent right so now how

1076
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,660
can we do network security if there's no

1077
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:15,960
network as we start talking cloud cloud

1078
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:17,399
services are usually done via URI so now

1079
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,020
we're not we don't have a network that

1080
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,110
we can put a firewall on how do we

1081
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,880
handle that so that's where the cloud

1082
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:26,430
native tools really come into play

1083
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,780
because they're designed to be

1084
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:32,700
implemented in those kind of

1085
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:37,620
interactions IOT anybody heard of IOT

1086
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:40,410
out there a few of you that if I if I

1087
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:42,990
wait more hands will go up if nothing

1088
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:47,220
else just to get me to keep moving right

1089
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:48,839
so IOT is fun because it's on one hand

1090
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,379
you have the operational side of things

1091
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,950
right

1092
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:55,590
the the SCADA folks who if they put a

1093
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:58,410
firewall between two to two robots and

1094
00:44:55,590 --> 00:45:01,050
that introduces five milliseconds of lag

1095
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:02,940
that's gonna car as a bolt to go through

1096
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:06,090
the middle of an of a windshield as

1097
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:09,360
opposed into the side of the the a the a

1098
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:11,730
beam right so those are the on the the

1099
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,549
manufacturing side security within that

1100
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,259
manufacturing

1101
00:45:12,549 --> 00:45:17,259
where it becomes a problem because it's

1102
00:45:14,259 --> 00:45:19,929
meant to be so real time and it's not

1103
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:21,489
real time as US Network folks think

1104
00:45:19,929 --> 00:45:25,299
which is a plus or minus ten

1105
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:26,709
milliseconds of lag we're fine right the

1106
00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:28,989
second side of things and the reason why

1107
00:45:26,709 --> 00:45:30,698
I ot has become such a buzz phrase and

1108
00:45:28,989 --> 00:45:32,079
security is because everybody wants to

1109
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:33,849
have their camera plugged into their

1110
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,049
network so they can see what their dogs

1111
00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:38,349
are doing at home when they're not there

1112
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:41,769
and the guy who's selling the dog camera

1113
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:43,719
that he bought the the chip off of you

1114
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:45,788
know someone out of Shenzhen China who

1115
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:47,679
may or may not have actually developed

1116
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:49,929
that chip and they may or may not have

1117
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:52,029
stuck a tracking module within that ship

1118
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:54,400
that nobody knows about hello super

1119
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:56,769
micro but you know they allow these

1120
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,689
things to happen so IOT devices are made

1121
00:45:56,769 --> 00:46:00,160
for rapid deployment the problem with

1122
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:02,529
that becomes they don't have the

1123
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,890
infrastructure underlying that hardware

1124
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:09,130
or software to actually be able to

1125
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:11,109
support security controls I cannot tell

1126
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:13,059
you how many cameras I've talked with

1127
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:17,319
with people and they go well we allow a

1128
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:19,959
username and password well okay does

1129
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:20,979
that authenticate anywhere you do it off

1130
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:23,939
box authentication

1131
00:46:20,979 --> 00:46:27,069
well we allow a username and password

1132
00:46:23,939 --> 00:46:34,420
right they don't have the ability to add

1133
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:38,619
those controls containers so anybody

1134
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:40,509
heard of containerization right the

1135
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:42,219
short version is you have a base image

1136
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:44,439
you layer containers on top of it to

1137
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:46,479
build out your system just like with API

1138
00:46:44,439 --> 00:46:48,129
is just like with code libraries you

1139
00:46:46,479 --> 00:46:49,538
need to trust where those different

1140
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:51,880
layers in your container environment

1141
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:53,319
come from you need to secure those you

1142
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:56,559
also need to secure your container

1143
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:58,449
environment so as you go through this

1144
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:01,059
there's a supply chain that you have to

1145
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:02,949
make sure you're securing don't forget

1146
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:04,390
your sec ops don't forget your app sack

1147
00:47:02,949 --> 00:47:06,689
don't forget your least privilege an

1148
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:06,689
hour back

1149
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:14,440
all right we're coming into last few

1150
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:17,470
minutes I got 13 slides left so that's

1151
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,000
not happening but what we've got here is

1152
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,319
as we talk about things like DevOps

1153
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,799
continuous integration continuous

1154
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,890
deployment this is all about agility

1155
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:27,880
anybody heard of agile development

1156
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:30,339
all right who's heard of waterfall

1157
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,760
development all right we're getting

1158
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:33,460
there

1159
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,470
right so this is the heart of IT this is

1160
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:37,390
we're talking about pets versus cattle

1161
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:39,819
anybody even hurt a pet versus cattle

1162
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:41,710
analogy of the cloud how many of you

1163
00:47:39,819 --> 00:47:45,130
want to take a pet out and put a pet

1164
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:47,079
down all right how many how many of you

1165
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:48,309
think when you're raising cattle they

1166
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:52,960
care very much about putting a

1167
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:54,970
particular animal down right so pets

1168
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,790
those are the things that we care we

1169
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:59,049
feed for we maintain those the server's

1170
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:01,750
that were the only thing we're looking

1171
00:47:59,049 --> 00:48:03,549
for is how much uptime can I have who

1172
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:05,710
here is turned off some kind of device

1173
00:48:03,549 --> 00:48:06,670
that had over a year of uptime and you

1174
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,900
almost cried a little

1175
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:14,380
I had one router I had a routing system

1176
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:16,900
that had six years three months and 23

1177
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:19,420
days with a few hours tacked onto it and

1178
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:21,099
we had to shut it down and we all kind

1179
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,740
of took screenshots of the thing saying

1180
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:26,109
yeah it was up that long right so those

1181
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:27,490
are our pets our cattle our autoscale

1182
00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:29,529
groups within the cloud that allow to

1183
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:34,899
expand and contract as necessary for

1184
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:36,730
passing data software as a service so

1185
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:40,119
this is being able to utilize what

1186
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:42,549
someone else has written to perform the

1187
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:44,920
operations we need this is your CRM this

1188
00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:46,599
is your ERP these started off really

1189
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,490
small they were a little piece of what

1190
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:51,670
we needed to do and they moved into

1191
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:56,770
being a core piece of our infrastructure

1192
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:58,809
and we lose visibility with these right

1193
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:01,210
if we're implementing Salesforce as our

1194
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:02,859
CRM do you think you get to see what

1195
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:04,180
Salesforce does within their data center

1196
00:49:02,859 --> 00:49:05,650
between and the interactions between

1197
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,290
their front-end interfaces and their

1198
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:10,480
back-end interfaces nope that's what you

1199
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:12,279
pay them for so making sure that your

1200
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,170
sass provider can provide you with a

1201
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,819
report of what their controls are and

1202
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:18,640
what their adherence to those controls

1203
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:22,799
are so like a sock to type to your

1204
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,799
report of how they adhere to their stuff

1205
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:30,890
that ties into Cosby right so cloud

1206
00:49:29,029 --> 00:49:32,420
access these are the original guys who

1207
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:35,629
are tying all of this security together

1208
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:41,119
for us their cloud-based tools

1209
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:43,210
monitoring cloud-based tools and now I'm

1210
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,999
going to end on the cloud in a nutshell

1211
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:49,940
because otherwise I can blow through the

1212
00:49:46,999 --> 00:49:51,649
eroded edge the cloud a nutshell is

1213
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,660
there is no cloud it's just someone

1214
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:57,140
else's computer and we're trusting that

1215
00:49:53,660 --> 00:50:00,049
person as far as we are gonna put

1216
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:04,490
controls around to run an art things the

1217
00:50:00,049 --> 00:50:05,990
way we say we run on right all right the

1218
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:08,899
last piece that we didn't get to is

1219
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:10,549
eroded edge and that's talking about how

1220
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,559
the fact that has anybody heard that

1221
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:16,759
there you no longer have a security

1222
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:18,650
perimeter anybody heard that it's a

1223
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:20,150
great thing to make you think you don't

1224
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,039
need to buy a firewall anymore the

1225
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:24,819
problem with it is you still have a

1226
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:27,589
perimeter you just have a lot more

1227
00:50:24,819 --> 00:50:29,779
perimeters every one of your users is

1228
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:31,578
now a security perimeter every one of

1229
00:50:29,779 --> 00:50:34,069
your applications is now a security

1230
00:50:31,579 --> 00:50:35,749
perimeter or more than one so

1231
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:37,640
understanding what that eroded edge

1232
00:50:35,749 --> 00:50:42,078
looks like and how you play with it over

1233
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:47,239
time is really important and the last

1234
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:50,239
slide since for some reason it won't let

1235
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:51,619
me jump through is a lot of times I get

1236
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,220
asked when I get to the end of this will

1237
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:56,269
you didn't say anything about automation

1238
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:58,788
don't you need to automate some of the

1239
00:50:56,269 --> 00:51:01,220
stuff and the key here is all of this

1240
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:03,950
stuff should be automated your

1241
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:06,890
automation should play into every bit of

1242
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:10,549
what you do your network as you define

1243
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:13,098
it is defined as code your security

1244
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:14,660
controls are defined your access is

1245
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:19,299
defined your sim is feeding into a

1246
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:19,299
source system to automatically respond

1247
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:24,819
so automation is through all of it

1248
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:31,110
any questions in the 30 seconds or so

1249
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:33,900
that I think we have left or that I went

1250
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:36,240
over come down and see me I'm downstairs

1251
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,990
Nexen has a booth with our friends f5

1252
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,990
who help provide
