1
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:10,380
so I'd like to say good afternoon

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,920
everyone and hope you're having fun

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,379
fun time today is this everybody's first

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,770
time being or how many people is their

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,060
first time being here just a couple of

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,560
them yeah I've only been here once

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:28,529
before so it's pretty pretty cool so my

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,070
name is John servant and my partner here

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,110
is Don Wolfe and we're gonna do talk

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,870
today about why breaches occurred and

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,200
I'm not gonna claim to know everything

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,459
about that but I have a few opinions I

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,059
was hoping this would be more of a

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,120
discussion but it might be kind of hard

15
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:54,629
to do that without because of such a big

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:57,839
room and stuff so but so we met in a MBA

17
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,789
program which is a joint program it's an

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,059
Executive MBA program that's held by

19
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,030
Louisville air Louisville and Lexington

20
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:07,860
in the UK and so we were both students

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,700
of that program and so we've we've

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:16,020
started this little startup it's called

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,689
three 3w security and the product is a

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,380
reconciler but I still have a full-time

25
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:25,830
job so anyway it's just a little bit

26
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,080
about us as a background we have an

27
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,548
interesting combination Don once you

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,570
start off and tell a little bit about

29
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,290
yourself first

30
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,449
alright so I'm uh guitar girl Donna what

31
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,200
we retired is that colonel Special

32
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:44,610
Forces girl I've done counterterrorism

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:48,960
around the globe I have a Middle Eastern

34
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:51,000
expert I speak Arabic when John

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,829
approached me about this concept it's

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,490
like maybe I don't understand

37
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:57,949
this is I'm not a tech I'm an actually

38
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,110
yeah and he said no you know you've got

39
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,479
some world of experience and security

40
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,509
and I think the principles apply so we

41
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,759
started talking and when you consider

42
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:10,130
security can they make how many

43
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:16,550
differences between physical security

44
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:26,540
and internet security anybody that went

45
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:31,640
online was not a lot of people seem to

46
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:33,380
overlook is mindset and so for security

47
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,559
it's really easy if you break it down

48
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:40,069
into people process and technology and

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,310
IT security is no different the

50
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:45,980
difference between a guy walking or get

51
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:49,519
ready to assault into a room or into a

52
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,018
building or come off of a helicopter you

53
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,569
guys have seen Black Hawk Down and all

54
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:55,519
that stuff

55
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:57,859
situational awareness has got to be

56
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,340
maintained because your personal safety

57
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,930
depends on so you have to be aware 360

58
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,940
degrees to get them who's on your left

59
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,489
who's on your right what you're doing

60
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,829
all those really basic elements and you

61
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:12,500
think about it it's like okay I got it's

62
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:15,650
a constant mindset but when you talk

63
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,630
about IT security that's when you think

64
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,340
is it really relevant all the time

65
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,700
because when you're setting behind a

66
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:25,069
computer in the comfort of your warm

67
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,350
office or cold offices I didn't sum up

68
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:29,119
my not cold it gets and they don't even

69
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,100
like put the space heaters underneath

70
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,540
the desks anymore for safety reasons I

71
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:38,060
get it but it's no different and what is

72
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:42,620
different is that you get that sense of

73
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:45,260
comfort and so most IT security managers

74
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:48,530
have checklists on timeline you have to

75
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,910
maintain there's like

76
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,920
they need a phone call and you get

77
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,019
distracted and then a day or two later

78
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,220
to ask they'll need to do them and then

79
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:57,950
before you know it you've got a breach

80
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,599
or something happens or you go to a

81
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,000
printer and you leave personally

82
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,738
identifiable information on the printer

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,940
and this is the safety officer

84
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:07,400
somebody's coming to you saying hey

85
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,099
what's going on well through our

86
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,950
conversations we realized that by

87
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:15,798
combining people process and technology

88
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,599
into our product we believe that we can

89
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,548
really differentiate and make a

90
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,419
difference in companies that need to

91
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:25,909
ensure their risk is mitigated and so

92
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:28,370
what we're going to talk about today is

93
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,020
about how to prevent breaches and we're

94
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,250
not just going to do a product sell and

95
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,710
talk about our company we're going to

96
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,090
talk about the actual process so with

97
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,549
that said I'll turn it back over to

98
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,700
Johnny so yeah so mock back background

99
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,560
you know Don has all this national

100
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:46,960
security experience then I have the IT

101
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,940
experience so I've been through like

102
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,400
process of integrating nine different

103
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,190
acquisitions into our security program

104
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,840
and then we were purchased by a

105
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,610
multinational company and integrated

106
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,609
into their security program and so I've

107
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:04,340
seen how startups do it and then how the

108
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,780
more advanced companies do it and I've

109
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,239
learned a lot through that there's

110
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,700
there's there's things that startups do

111
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,410
well there's things that the the larger

112
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:18,530
organizations do well so while the

113
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:21,380
breaches occur I must start off by just

114
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,270
like put yourself in the situation I

115
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,150
mean this is the thing that we none of

116
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,400
us want to happen okay but let's just

117
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:32,299
pretend for a minute you're the CEO its

118
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,310
September 7th 2017 and you have to

119
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:38,389
announce to the the whole country that

120
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:42,860
their records were breached the next day

121
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:46,729
your stock plunge is 14% a couple days

122
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,880
later to senior executives retire and

123
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:53,690
then you have to offer another polish

124
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,270
apology couple days later your chief

125
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:59,960
information officer retires and then

126
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,440
your chief security officer retires now

127
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,140
you're left holding the bag

128
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,800
and a couple weeks later you're the CEO

129
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:10,620
and you're fired

130
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,210
so if that's all it was was just a quick

131
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,690
event and it stopped right there maybe

132
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:17,280
you could get over it I don't know but

133
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,750
even today it's still going on there's

134
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,539
there's like a 700 million dollar

135
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,510
settlement and executives who've lost

136
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:28,320
their bonuses then people were accused

137
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:31,740
of insider trading and future employment

138
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,200
would be pretty difficult I guess after

139
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:41,360
that so anybody knows what the company

140
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:46,340
is somebody knows I'm gonna take a guess

141
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,300
yeah it was so I'm picking on our

142
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:52,440
competitor a little bit but you know

143
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,810
honestly they it could happen to anyone

144
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,240
and that's kind of my what I'm trying to

145
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:00,240
get across today is to kind of explore

146
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,660
why this might have happened so the

147
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,770
Equifax was they had a vulnerability

148
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:10,530
called Apache struts and you know I'm a

149
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,390
very technical person and understand a

150
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,840
lot of these vulnerabilities but I don't

151
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:18,180
think I even knew about this at the time

152
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,599
but I wasn't responsible for that area

153
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,700
either but it was a published

154
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,360
vulnerability and it set out there

155
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:29,669
unfixed for a while and so there was

156
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,760
like a lot of a lot of risk there that

157
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:35,250
that happened that didn't need to happen

158
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:38,550
and so again I'm going to ask the same

159
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:42,990
question again why did that happen

160
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:46,860
and if you like wasn't a people problem

161
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:53,040
was it a process that a process fail was

162
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:54,780
a technology enough funding what I'll

163
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,150
just take a poll and see what people

164
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:04,369
think between those areas who thinks it

165
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:04,370
was a people problem okay couple process

166
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:15,090
see technology may be funding funny

167
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,850
product and honestly I don't know

168
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,219
the answer and I and I don't think that

169
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:24,780
I would necessarily trust what the

170
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:26,550
official answer was you know when these

171
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,380
you get in these big companies there's a

172
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,139
lot of politics and there's a lot of

173
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,969
leadership decisions and knobby not

174
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:36,089
always the right people are making the

175
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:38,610
right decisions and so there's one of my

176
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:42,390
biggest questions is did was this risk

177
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:44,190
made known to the Equifax board so the

178
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,040
board is the board members their

179
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,500
responsibility is to protect the value

180
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,939
of the shareholders and you know to help

181
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,200
the company make money or whatever but

182
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,390
they're the ones that's supposed to be

183
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,210
looking out for this type of thing the

184
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,890
problem is is who in this room would

185
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:02,339
want to go to a board member and try to

186
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:06,689
tell them about Apache stress I mean

187
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:09,750
it's just but but at some point in time

188
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:12,089
if that message is not reaching that

189
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,520
level of management then there's a

190
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:16,440
problem and I guess the point that I'm

191
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,230
trying to say is if the board members

192
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,360
knew that this level of risk was out

193
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:27,720
there you can bet you can be sure that

194
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:31,290
they would have addressed it and so my

195
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:34,529
theory is that it probably was somewhere

196
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:37,439
between the directors the managers and

197
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:41,459
the executives within the company

198
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:48,779
somewhere that didn't that message

199
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:50,760
didn't get shared and so I mean what can

200
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:53,100
we do in our organizations to fix that

201
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,029
problem and it's a it's a hard thing to

202
00:09:53,100 --> 00:10:00,330
do because if you're under the CEO how

203
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:02,700
do you share that message you know or if

204
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,060
you are the CEO how can you encourage

205
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,580
your employees to tell you about things

206
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:12,000
without you know open your door every

207
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:15,089
day for a long discussion so here's

208
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,200
another example the Marriott I mean all

209
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:20,480
these poor people did is they bought

210
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,680
Starwood it had already been breached

211
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,589
I'm sure they did a bunch of due

212
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,140
diligence and stuff but I don't know how

213
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:28,350
you could it's hard enough to know if

214
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,180
you

215
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,510
own companies breached without buying

216
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:36,660
another company that's already had the

217
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:38,370
problem so what do the experts say and

218
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,770
so kind of you know I've talked about us

219
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,120
trying to come up with this these this

220
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,620
new product and so we've been

221
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,050
interviewing a bunch of people to try to

222
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,390
figure out where they think the problems

223
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,969
are in the security programs and so I've

224
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:53,610
come up with five areas and it's this is

225
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,580
similar I guess to the the top five sans

226
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,410
type of stuff that you keep hearing but

227
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,630
but I've tried to make it more of an

228
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,000
interview with people so I'm curious

229
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,490
just to get feedback on this if you want

230
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,960
to tell me afterwards or even if you

231
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,620
have a comment you could always come up

232
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:13,620
here Don has a mic so the very biggest

233
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,830
area that I think is the the management

234
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,750
and culture of an organization as I told

235
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:22,980
you about the different startups that I

236
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:25,590
worked in and and one of them earlier

237
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,570
companies that I worked with there was a

238
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,460
guy that he was a brilliant businessman

239
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,110
and he said we're just going to design

240
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,640
all these products and we're gonna throw

241
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,310
them up against the wall I see what

242
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,290
sticks and when we find what sticks

243
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,670
we're gonna we'll go with that and we're

244
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,110
not gonna worry about any information

245
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,510
security or anything like that right now

246
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,830
as soon as we know what sticks and it

247
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,860
starts working we're gonna go back and

248
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,960
fix all the security stuff whoa

249
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,840
sure do you don't know where this is

250
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,150
going I mean you've worked in this some

251
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,930
of you worked in this field awhile so I

252
00:11:54,150 --> 00:12:00,120
see a few Snickers come they didn't

253
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,770
really go back and fix the security

254
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,600
stuff once they found out what stuck

255
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:06,480
because then they were so excited about

256
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,010
the new features and announced I don't

257
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,190
want to say that they didn't go back and

258
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,660
fix it eventually but it didn't really

259
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,870
happen the way the story was originally

260
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:19,079
told so that's one way one thing about

261
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:23,100
your culture the organizations that that

262
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:25,020
I'm working for now is actually they're

263
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,900
totally different I mean security is

264
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,640
like one of the number-one goals of you

265
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,699
know the top three goals every year it's

266
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,620
it's way at the top and I mean the

267
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,880
executives in that company they know

268
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,400
what IDs is and firewalls and

269
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,050
and you know this technology stuff it's

270
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,240
crazy the only I'm talking about the

271
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,250
CEOs can sit there and talk about

272
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,640
administrator rights and stuff like that

273
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:51,560
so you know these some of these leaders

274
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,720
are getting it in their understanding

275
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,640
but you know when you're at a start-up

276
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,220
you really don't have that luxury you

277
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,380
think about it well you just you created

278
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,300
a company yesterday and now you have to

279
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,710
figure out if you can make money you

280
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,469
don't have time to build a security

281
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:09,590
program so that happens over time but

282
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,840
anyways the number one thing I think is

283
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:14,960
getting that culture right making sure

284
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:18,830
that people know that you know security

285
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,450
is everyone's job yeah so people is

286
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,600
there's one part of the problem

287
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:27,260
processes the other how many people know

288
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,060
that there's products out there that you

289
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,330
can purchase it would make your job

290
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:34,670
easier to make their company safer

291
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:37,010
anybody and then what does that become a

292
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,180
question whether or not your company

293
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,819
buys it it's a question of priorities

294
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,620
right but it's also a question of of

295
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,590
understanding does your executives

296
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:48,440
understand exactly what it so whose role

297
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,670
and responsibility is to make that make

298
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,070
those executives or those

299
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:55,610
decision-makers understand that priority

300
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:58,010
it's got to be the IT security guy so in

301
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:02,320
a lot of a lot of organizations the

302
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:05,270
culture does not promote open

303
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,770
information exchange and they'll tell

304
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,360
you you know I mean I was in the Army it

305
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,939
doesn't get any more credit than that

306
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,590
and we have a pong process the program

307
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,630
objective memorandum this time of the

308
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:18,020
President's budget and you literally

309
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:21,050
have to be five years outside of the

310
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:24,500
purchasing lifecycle in order to get a

311
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:27,380
new requisition for five years later

312
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,840
it's ridiculous now they can expedite it

313
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,340
obviously the speed have changed a lot

314
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,980
of that has changed and they talk about

315
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:36,170
using soft bickerman soft a special

316
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,210
operations force procurement because we

317
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,920
just go out buy cots commercial

318
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,559
off-the-shelf

319
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,329
because we're here to solve problems

320
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:47,040
we're not here to deal with the

321
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:50,319
bureaucracy of the pond the budget cycle

322
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,209
so that can't be the reality so you have

323
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:55,089
to recognize what is our culture and

324
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:57,219
then really the most successful IT

325
00:14:55,089 --> 00:15:00,910
security managers are both are those

326
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:03,669
that fully understand the process and no

327
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,589
timing when when is the best time to go

328
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:08,019
talk to an executive about security

329
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:10,869
shortfalls is it during a monthly update

330
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:13,149
is it at the end of the year when extra

331
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:16,269
money comes around four nd year span or

332
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:18,189
whatever you call it but there's it's

333
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:20,129
it's always the combination of people

334
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:24,279
and when I say people I mean mindset and

335
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:27,459
process I mean is it easy to use yeah

336
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:29,709
and so the next area I'll talk about is

337
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:35,768
asset management this one is what drives

338
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:38,258
me trust me crazy but you know it's

339
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:42,009
impossible to secure something if you

340
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:43,660
don't know that it exists and so you

341
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:46,029
know a lot of companies struggle with

342
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:49,209
this especially when you get to a much

343
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:52,329
larger size but you know you really have

344
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:54,699
to do this right you might bite just by

345
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:58,089
accident secure something if you don't

346
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:59,889
know that it exists but anyways that's

347
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:01,929
you know how do you know that all of

348
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:04,119
your different security processes are

349
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:06,549
being done across this asset if you

350
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:08,169
don't know that it exists now I'm sure I

351
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:10,329
mean you guys work in this so you

352
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:12,309
probably know that then there's the the

353
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:15,669
technical challenges was a really big

354
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:17,290
area to I mean this is you know that

355
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:21,100
maybe that's what happened on this

356
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,689
Equifax thing is that there was a piece

357
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,160
of software had to be rewritten or

358
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:27,459
something like that how many times have

359
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,829
you heard that but again if you have

360
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:32,109
this communication path that's going up

361
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:35,618
to the executives in this level of trust

362
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:36,999
that that you can you can say something

363
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,610
and they're going to believe you and

364
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:41,730
you're not just like

365
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:44,610
complaining or whatever you can you can

366
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:48,119
bet that if that issue required a

367
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:50,069
software rewrite that developer would

368
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:51,209
you know all the other priorities would

369
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:54,049
be dropped and they would have taken

370
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:54,049
care of that one

371
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,519
access control I mean this one everybody

372
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:05,069
kind of knows that I mean it only takes

373
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:07,740
one account that this is just you know

374
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:09,449
an awful problem to try to fix and then

375
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,399
understanding the risk we've kind of

376
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:15,000
already talked on this before but at the

377
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:17,729
end of the day these the executives that

378
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,619
are making these decisions when you come

379
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,659
to them with the issue the main thing

380
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,698
they want to know is like is this

381
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:26,399
something I need to be worried about or

382
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:29,820
not they don't really care what it does

383
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:31,260
and how your explanation of it is but

384
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,799
they just want to know is this something

385
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:37,529
I need to be worried about and the thing

386
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,539
about this is is there's a lot of us in

387
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:41,880
security I think we've all done it at

388
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:45,330
some point in time but some more than

389
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:48,779
others is you know if you're the type

390
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:51,029
that's always worried about we're not

391
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:53,370
following this best practice and it's a

392
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:55,679
really big problem and or you know the

393
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,120
right way to do this is XY and Z and

394
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,769
it's just you know you're really upset

395
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,459
about that all the time if you're always

396
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:04,440
complaining and and about things that

397
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,960
are little issues then it's kind of like

398
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,480
crying wolf and so when the real issue

399
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,990
comes along and you try to bring it up

400
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:16,799
to one of the higher managers they may

401
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:19,679
not believe you and it doesn't even have

402
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,940
to be you who was the one that was

403
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,919
crying wolf it could have been someone

404
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,809
else because some of the executives I've

405
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,080
worked with they they just they're tired

406
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:29,519
of just hearing from security people I

407
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:35,189
just I'm just saying that's just what it

408
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:38,940
is so this is just like a little note

409
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:42,809
that I found online about Congress they

410
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:45,809
basically in their opinion that Equifax

411
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:48,020
and the Marriott just what they were

412
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:51,139
negligent basically

413
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:54,440
and you know I I have to think that

414
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,690
those two companies were doing what they

415
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,820
thought was best at least the security

416
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,700
people in those companies were doing as

417
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:05,450
best job as what they knew how I have to

418
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:07,490
believe that and but that kind of puts

419
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,290
us in a scary position too because how

420
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:13,070
many of us are trying to do the right

421
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:16,909
things you know it could happen to us

422
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:18,470
and so I really think that's why it goes

423
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,390
back to these other issues you know

424
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,010
getting that leadership right and you

425
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,809
might not be able to fix the leadership

426
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:27,770
but you can have the conversations to

427
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:29,629
try to help he'll help make a change so

428
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,280
what are the top causes of reach this

429
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:36,140
was just like a little study that I did

430
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:40,070
to kind of see the HIPAA wall of shame

431
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:43,280
this was from 2017 to 2019 I kind of put

432
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:47,300
some through some categories together

433
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:50,240
but the majority could see is hacking

434
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,580
incidents there was some theft and some

435
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,970
loss and I think like when this first

436
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:59,570
came out from what I remember it was the

437
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:01,940
the DLP the loss of devices was one of

438
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,830
the biggest areas and I think a lot of

439
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,230
companies have have kind of gotten a

440
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,270
handle on that so I don't I don't see

441
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:12,950
that numbers so the hacking is a lot

442
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:14,870
higher now and then I pulled this is

443
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,540
another list of breaches off of

444
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:20,689
Wikipedia it was not conclusive at all

445
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:26,149
but again here you can see the same

446
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:30,760
trend of a lot of hacking incidents lost

447
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,760
and stolen stolen meeting media

448
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,010
and then of course the types of

449
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,810
organizations are all those

450
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:40,060
organizations that have either credit

451
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:45,040
cards or some kind of personal

452
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:48,250
information or whatnot John did you make

453
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:51,430
any correlation between the types of

454
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,420
organization of information that's being

455
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:56,890
stolen

456
00:20:52,420 --> 00:21:01,840
no I didn't I do know this is a this is

457
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:03,220
an interesting thing because I worked in

458
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,830
a healthcare couple of these where

459
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,960
healthcare startups and stuff and wait

460
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:10,000
this is I've been in this business a

461
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,180
long time so this these leaders are long

462
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,950
gone but they used to say a lot of them

463
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:18,250
you're like healthcare information who

464
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:20,050
would want to steal that you know why

465
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,750
would anybody even want to steal that so

466
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:26,440
they thought the HIPAA was just just a

467
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:28,450
ridiculous set of legislation but I mean

468
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,640
as many of you guys know these days is

469
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,490
it's the more valuable of all the data

470
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,340
right now so you know what I just

471
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:41,260
thought that was kind of interesting but

472
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:44,409
those leaders are long gone so okay so

473
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:48,190
here's the thing this is what we're all

474
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:50,430
doing right audits pin tests I mean not

475
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:53,260
everybody can even afford the pen test

476
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:58,150
or of a monthly vulnerability scanning

477
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:59,260
tool but my point is as I bet that a lot

478
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,080
of these companies that are being

479
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,480
breached are still using I mean this is

480
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,199
what they're doing so that's my little

481
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,060
joke here the definition of insanity if

482
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,540
we keep on doing these same things and

483
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:15,460
we don't adopt some of these other tools

484
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:18,250
then you know we're going to end up in

485
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,890
the same place and I can't say you know

486
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,350
there's some I don't know all the

487
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:25,840
vendors that were down downstairs but

488
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,870
there were some pretty cool technologies

489
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,610
that are out there you can't buy all of

490
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:35,508
them but I do know that there are some

491
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:39,979
some neat needs technologies coming up

492
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:39,980
so what's the problem with pen testing

493
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:47,039
well it happens does anybody do like

494
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:50,070
after you do an important change on the

495
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:53,070
network you have a pen test does anybody

496
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:56,220
do that there's what I mean you're

497
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:57,779
supposed to four PCI everybody that does

498
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,970
that you're supposed to have it tested

499
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:03,659
after after changes and stuff like that

500
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:05,370
but it's just not unless you're you

501
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:07,080
unless you have an in-house team you

502
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:11,008
can't do that very discreet like

503
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,689
cost-prohibitive and so really that's

504
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:18,080
the big problem with pen testing is

505
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:20,429
let's say you set up a new machine and

506
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,470
you know it has a vulnerability or

507
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:25,529
something like that well it might be

508
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:27,000
half a year for it gets found and I'm

509
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,309
gonna tell I'm going to tell it myself

510
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,740
on here for one thing this is a little

511
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:35,428
embarrassing but this having a long long

512
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:40,500
time ago but just to show you like when

513
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:42,419
you have a mistake let me just so I set

514
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,429
up this logging server and it showed

515
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:46,289
like all of our active directory logs so

516
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:48,600
be all of our user accounts our machine

517
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:50,970
names and all these things and I was

518
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,209
excited about it and I put it out in the

519
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:56,909
firewall in a firewall group and it was

520
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:59,970
like our webserver group and it was for

521
00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:04,799
internal web servers or whatever but it

522
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:07,799
allowed port 80 and it just so happens

523
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,950
that it also set in a firewall rule that

524
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:15,950
had an at address like I used an IP that

525
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:18,389
was had been used in the past so I

526
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:20,549
didn't know there was already a rule out

527
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:23,820
there or that had that IP address in it

528
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:27,210
and I didn't know about this until a pen

529
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:31,700
test about six months later so that's my

530
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:34,049
point is and I'm if you know me I'm very

531
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,850
detail-oriented and I'm always like

532
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:38,850
being real careful and stuff like that

533
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:40,980
or at least I thought so and but the

534
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:43,019
thing is without having some sort of

535
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,850
tool to be able to detect that type of

536
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:52,450
stuff then you

537
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:54,040
you know exposing yourself so is anybody

538
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:58,360
I'm just curious does anybody heard of

539
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:01,659
attack surface mapping the Horde see a

540
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,850
couple nos that's that's that's it's

541
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:06,220
kind of like an automated pin test in a

542
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:08,290
way and that's that's one of that's our

543
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:15,700
project that we're working on it's to

544
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:18,250
solve problems like that see now you

545
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,110
could say well I'm not worried about the

546
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:23,500
pin testing all the time because I'm

547
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:24,909
going to do ability scans and I think

548
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,000
we're they're getting a lot better with

549
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:29,500
vulnerability scans these days but one

550
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,420
of the problems with vulnerability scans

551
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,300
is it doesn't necessarily address the

552
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:36,400
risk very well you know you got there

553
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,919
you know Qualis at some of these other

554
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,450
vendors they'll have one through ten or

555
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,640
one through five or something like that

556
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,530
but it doesn't really you don't really

557
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,690
have the context and the metadata that

558
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,790
goes along with that like what product

559
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,490
does this go to what's the name of it

560
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:54,460
sometimes the name is missing and maybe

561
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:56,620
it's a high vulnerability from one

562
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:00,700
perspective but it's not even on your

563
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:02,590
network so this kind of problems with

564
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,640
the with that part of our business and

565
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:08,830
then of course sometimes you might even

566
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,070
have a vulnerability scanner that's not

567
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:14,649
even you don't even have the network

568
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:17,340
being scanned so I don't have anybody

569
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,340
ever done that before

570
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:24,340
I'm telling about all the mistakes that

571
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:26,110
I've had here in public but see so and

572
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:30,100
then the asset management we talked

573
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:34,540
about this a little bit already but you

574
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:37,209
know is your is your external inventory

575
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:39,430
is it accurate do you know about things

576
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:43,030
which would you know if somebody set up

577
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:45,790
a new business in the cloud and linked

578
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:49,080
it to your site or would you know if

579
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:53,950
somebody that was like a an IT person

580
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,870
set up a new ftp site for their own

581
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,620
personal usage or whatever I mean that

582
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:00,309
type of thing does

583
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:03,100
happen very very often but there's a lot

584
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:05,649
of different things like that that if we

585
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,719
if we're not actively looking at these

586
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:10,630
things then it becomes a problem and

587
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,980
then I hate to even mention this back on

588
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:16,090
the vulnerability scans I just

589
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:18,190
remembered this this one right here

590
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:20,500
how many of you have ever had

591
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:24,280
vulnerability scans much too much but

592
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:27,540
you don't ever look at the scans anybody

593
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:30,309
ever done that I mean they get they get

594
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:32,889
it gets tedious and you and you're

595
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:35,050
trying to run in all these directions

596
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,640
and you've got all these fancy network

597
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,928
tools that you've installed you've got

598
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,600
all these checklists that you're

599
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:42,300
following and you know sometimes that

600
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,909
feels like you're playing a game of

601
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:50,980
freeze tag with Lamar Jackson and I just

602
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:54,030
can't she can't kind of catch him has

603
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:56,980
anybody been watching Lamar Jackson play

604
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:59,020
he's incredible and he was the

605
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,840
Louisville quarterback for those who

606
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:04,270
don't know and I'm a big UK fan but I

607
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,639
still love to watch him he's he's

608
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:10,030
playing for the Ravens now and nobody

609
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,250
nobody drafted him until it was like the

610
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:14,080
last day of the draft you know he won

611
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:17,350
the Heisman Trophy which is the the

612
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,030
highest rank you know and in football

613
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:22,449
the year before but there was a bunch of

614
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,889
there's three guys that they were kind

615
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,929
of like they're thinking maybe they're

616
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,520
gonna be the next Tom Brady so the Marg

617
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:34,720
accident was on the very bottom of that

618
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:39,250
whole list but now he's killing it so

619
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:41,830
anyways so how do you set up a program

620
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:44,410
you know how do you how do you set up a

621
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,970
program that's not going to fail and I

622
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:49,240
mean we're all still trying to figure

623
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:51,760
this out right but this is kind of what

624
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,679
this is what I've come up with it's you

625
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,540
have to have that leadership foundation

626
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:02,740
first I mean you'd have to be able to

627
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:04,149
trust you know you know the leaders have

628
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,400
to be able to trust you and you have to

629
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:08,650
be able to trust the leaders I mean you

630
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,010
could probably say something about that

631
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:15,850
do you have anything to talk about that

632
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:20,020
no no he's got a story for everything so

633
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:23,330
as we talk about mindset and culture you

634
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:25,940
know if your leaders focusing on IT

635
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:26,780
security the whole organization probably

636
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:31,880
is right

637
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:35,030
well what if well let me go back to the

638
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,400
reasons that you get reached so we

639
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:39,410
talked about the ways that you've

640
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,750
reached and we talked about the types of

641
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,760
organizations well let's talk about the

642
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,400
hacker because this is one of those

643
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,230
leadership mindset things that people

644
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,240
forget that the enemy gets a boat and

645
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,549
depending on the way the enemy or in

646
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,640
this case that hacker react is going to

647
00:29:52,549 --> 00:30:02,000
drive your reaction right so what's the

648
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:04,549
hacker going after why they doing do

649
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,900
they have a specific purpose maybe

650
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:07,370
didn't kill the credibility of a

651
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,260
competitor or something maybe they're

652
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:11,600
harder to do that I mean you can only

653
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:16,270
think of a thousand reasons you know

654
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:20,178
what most targets get attacked anybody

655
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:21,590
because they're easy you're easy targets

656
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:24,610
you ever heard the concept of a hard

657
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:28,070
target a hard target has layers of

658
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:31,040
security around it you've got far

659
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:35,330
security which is maybe road bumps

660
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:37,250
leading up to the White House and then

661
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:38,360
you're going through and remember how

662
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,580
you should be able to just drive

663
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,799
straight through open gates well now

664
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,809
they have snakes they have big barriers

665
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,660
put up in force you to slow down and go

666
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:50,690
through you know why that happens number

667
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,340
the bombing in Beirut in Lebanon I mean

668
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,169
that truck got all the way into the

669
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:58,280
Marine Corps barracks and killed 178

670
00:30:54,169 --> 00:31:00,770
Marines so you got to slow down and then

671
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,540
when you slow them down now you can fix

672
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:05,900
them there's a targeting methodology

673
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:10,399
it's called f3 EA d5 fix finished

674
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:11,660
exploit analyze decide the enemy the

675
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,000
hackers are going through the same

676
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:17,080
process but it really

677
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:20,080
- how hard is it easy and a lot of we're

678
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,600
just targets of opportunity and so the

679
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,120
leadership foundation that you need to

680
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:29,080
have is no more than creating a security

681
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:31,479
mindset and if you focus on allocating

682
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,070
resources you know I got a question for

683
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,770
you town so you've talked about how

684
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:38,049
expensive some of the software is you

685
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:41,650
talked about how expensive the pen

686
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:45,429
testing is what if you need both how

687
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:50,530
does the leaders make those decisions so

688
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:53,380
my perspective is that if if you train

689
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:56,770
your teams to learn more of the

690
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:59,260
background code you pay that price you

691
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:02,200
know teach them how to use Python teach

692
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:04,330
them how to get a little bit get their

693
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,580
hands dirty and not just use all the GUI

694
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,590
tools that you can actually save a lot

695
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,658
of money I mean you at the end of the

696
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,850
day you can't buy all the tools you have

697
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:14,350
to figure out which ones so if you can't

698
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,820
if you're you know if you don't want to

699
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,459
do that you don't want to teach

700
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:22,510
everybody Python and stuff I understand

701
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:24,400
but then really risk management I mean

702
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:27,429
that's that's it you've got to figure

703
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,890
out of those tools which which one

704
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:34,179
really protects you and a lot of times

705
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:37,299
you can do things that are don't cost a

706
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:40,929
lot of money it just requires a little

707
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:43,929
bit of change your mindset so like let's

708
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:45,640
say you got an FTP server and you got

709
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:48,130
all these different accounts and stuff

710
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,500
and somebody somebody says well let's

711
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:53,710
you know we want to we don't want to put

712
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,929
a firewall on an FTP server well instead

713
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:57,940
you end up buying some fancier FTP

714
00:32:55,929 --> 00:32:59,890
server that does blacklisting and all

715
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,110
these other things you could have just

716
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:04,900
put a firewall on it and just done it

717
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:07,389
take that extra step I've only allowing

718
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:11,770
each each customer to connect with that

719
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:14,320
FTP server so that's an example of of

720
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:16,809
making the right decisions and saving

721
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,120
some money so in terms of risk

722
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:20,220
mitigation

723
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:23,340
when you say that all security measures

724
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:24,840
come at a cost they do now here's

725
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,600
another thing I tell you what one of the

726
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:32,428
CEOs that I worked with I learned so so

727
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,590
much for he would say what is the what

728
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:36,840
where can I get the most bang for my

729
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,580
buck because he would only give me five

730
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,709
things he's like you don't come anyway

731
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,080
with 20 things over just give me five

732
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,970
and I want to know of all these things

733
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,059
where do I get the most bang for my buck

734
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:50,630
that's the easiest to cheat so one of

735
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:53,789
the big things that we did was okay

736
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:56,850
we're gonna block all other countries

737
00:33:53,789 --> 00:34:00,480
with the firewall and so we put in

738
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:03,059
checkpoints software for that and yeah I

739
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,649
mean you still have everybody's address

740
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,210
in the United States here but at least

741
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:08,190
all those other countries that are

742
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,310
scanning out there

743
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:13,560
they didn't didn't see us so that's an

744
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:15,779
example of risk management and focusing

745
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:20,279
on areas where you can make big

746
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:21,869
improvements fast so there's a lot of

747
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,690
organizations out there that just don't

748
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:27,899
have the budget to support a lot of the

749
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:30,780
things that we're talking about but its

750
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:32,460
mindset cost anything here they didn't

751
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,419
cost anything maybe in terms of

752
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:39,960
onboarding or training and development

753
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:43,279
but really if you have women the mindset

754
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:46,770
of security as a precautionary measure

755
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,839
as a standard operating procedure that

756
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:50,190
costs you nothing or it might cost an

757
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:53,219
hour to out of me

758
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:55,980
but in terms of being able to buy the

759
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:57,569
appropriate security software negative

760
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:01,349
and exponential numbers and then the

761
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:03,060
services to implement those and then the

762
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:06,690
time that you're taking your workforce

763
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:08,730
to learn those new tools so you know you

764
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:11,339
can often tell your bosses it's like you

765
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:13,500
can't afford not to invest in this stuff

766
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:16,650
because when you compare it to all of

767
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:20,670
the other areas that we could mitigate

768
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,550
risk from this is an array and it all

769
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:25,750
comes down to

770
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:28,750
set culture prevention of loss in terms

771
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:31,330
of people and equipment and you really

772
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:34,150
got to understand the process but a lot

773
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:35,529
of people think is all the process and I

774
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,360
always argue when it starts with people

775
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:40,210
I have a favor saying that we talk about

776
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,670
all the time mission first people always

777
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:45,730
well the mission for IT security manners

778
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:47,100
managers to protect your information and

779
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:50,620
your network

780
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:52,210
what does people mean people means you

781
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,650
got to educate people on what that

782
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:57,430
security what those security measures

783
00:35:53,650 --> 00:36:01,210
are why it's important for them and so

784
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:03,490
if you really implement the principles

785
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:04,900
of security and you think about it is

786
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,879
simple and you gotta simplify everything

787
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:09,520
so just simply people process and

788
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,180
technology but if you buy expensive

789
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,180
technology

790
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,350
and you don't pay for the implementation

791
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,609
and the proper training then it's not

792
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,339
going to matter to the people and it's

793
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:31,830
definitely gonna hurt your organization

794
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:33,480
so Don was asking me as we were kind of

795
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:36,690
going through this the other the other

796
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,340
day he was I was talking about the issue

797
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:40,560
with the you know the executive teams

798
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:43,440
don't always understand these technology

799
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,480
issues are and he's like well don't we

800
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,280
don't you do security training every

801
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,160
every year or something like it I was

802
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,020
like yep but not to understand the type

803
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,210
of stuff that we're dealing with but it

804
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:57,960
gave me an idea you know it's like what

805
00:36:54,210 --> 00:37:00,420
if you had better training that you

806
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,000
could provide to your executive teams or

807
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:07,040
you know I'm assuming most of everybody

808
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,570
in here isn't CEOs but you might be I

809
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,250
mean what if that didn't cost anything

810
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,890
other than a little bit of time and

811
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,840
maybe putting together some material and

812
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,730
see if they're interested in learning

813
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,610
just a little bit of basics about

814
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:22,740
security you know it's just it's another

815
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:24,750
thing that you can do in thinking out of

816
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:28,799
the box a little bit and not necessarily

817
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:31,020
cost some money so the other thing

818
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,470
besides the leaders leadership is the

819
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:37,770
layered approach in a minute Don I might

820
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:39,180
ask you about that but what I wanted to

821
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:41,520
say about this because we talked about

822
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,290
this equifax issue and and I don't know

823
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,320
if this is common with other people or

824
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:49,050
not but I've been in organizations in

825
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:52,460
situations where I felt like I wanted to

826
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:56,420
say something about a risk but it's it's

827
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:58,770
it involves going around my direct

828
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:02,940
reporting relationship or something like

829
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:06,450
that and so you know there's there's

830
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,580
different managers that may approach

831
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,350
things different ways and that's okay

832
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,700
we might have different opinions it

833
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,170
doesn't mean that you know that they

834
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,390
don't care about the risks that means

835
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:17,070
that they're handling it different but

836
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,710
if you have different layers in

837
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:22,470
different ways for that information to

838
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:24,240
channel up to executives then they can

839
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:26,580
make those decisions now I don't know

840
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,009
exactly how you do that but I'm sure

841
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:32,250
that in the different organizations that

842
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:35,490
we're in their situations where people

843
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:38,100
at lower levels know about risk that the

844
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:40,589
upper levels don't know about so setting

845
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,000
up some kind of a feedback loop there to

846
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:44,310
where those type of things could be

847
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,340
communicated I think is valuable because

848
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:50,790
I mean I've seen that type of thing in a

849
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:53,520
lot of situations you know so what does

850
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:59,190
layered approach mean like in in the

851
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:04,170
national security well what do you think

852
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:06,680
layered approach meets anybody during

853
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:09,750
the terms of Pat and least resistance

854
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,910
when somebody's coming into an area like

855
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:15,030
I talked about before you know there's

856
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:17,490
going to be signs or indicators that a

857
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:20,910
there's people watching you know you

858
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:23,399
pull into a strip mall or something if

859
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,319
you see cameras on the corners and then

860
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,450
you go inside a building and there may

861
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,090
or may not be someone there a security

862
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:32,279
guard and then there might be a security

863
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:35,610
guard with a wad who's waiting you in

864
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,490
you know checking for Medellin there

865
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:40,860
could be two or three guards past them

866
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:43,290
that are now armed and standing right by

867
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:45,810
the elevator so there's different layers

868
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:48,870
of security that you would use in a

869
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:49,710
physical security case but for IT

870
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,569
security

871
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:54,060
once again if you if you take on the

872
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:57,390
mindset of what is the easiest way for

873
00:39:54,060 --> 00:40:00,029
hackers to find or get into your network

874
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:02,160
and and what is it I mean we talked

875
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:07,560
briefly talked about attack surface

876
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:11,960
mapping if your assets are vulnerable

877
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:15,330
either through open portals or unchecked

878
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,160
areas they're just probing they're just

879
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,560
looking to see what I can get at him and

880
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,359
so if they get in that first layer okay

881
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,620
that's good then they hit a firewall and

882
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,780
now you stop them to know what are they

883
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,700
doing they're going to find another

884
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,430
they're gonna go to probe somewhere else

885
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:33,330
so a layered approach is just simply a

886
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:35,850
mindset to slow down and detect and

887
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:38,069
monitor your system so that you can

888
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:43,830
ultimately prevent any issues to your

889
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:47,910
network and so you know obviously the

890
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:50,160
keeping good metrics and KPIs are good

891
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:52,980
but you still have to have that element

892
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,980
of trust so that you can share these

893
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:58,940
issues we've already talked a lot about

894
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:04,440
asset management so I'll skip that but

895
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:05,970
the risk management framework one of the

896
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,410
companies I worked at I'm kind of

897
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:09,540
laughing because we would have this risk

898
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:11,940
committee that we would meet every month

899
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,350
and and we would talk about it and

900
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:17,310
everybody would agree that we had these

901
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:19,080
risks and then we would leave it was

902
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,850
like a counseling session we come back

903
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:25,410
the next month and we'd have the same

904
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:28,080
thing and you know committees are great

905
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:29,790
but if there's nobody that's there to

906
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,560
actually make a decision then that's

907
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:34,470
kind of a problem because we didn't we

908
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:37,020
didn't have the executive leaders taking

909
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:39,629
part in this and these are the type of

910
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:42,860
mistakes that that organizations might

911
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:45,600
make as they're growing older and it's

912
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:48,260
it's our job as security professionals

913
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:51,360
to try to identify those things and

914
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:54,180
gracefully address those those issues I

915
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,020
mean I don't know if some of these

916
00:41:54,180 --> 00:42:01,140
problems are hard to address if you're

917
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:03,060
not the leader and they're even I mean

918
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:05,370
that or if you don't have a good trust

919
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,870
and a good relationship with the leader

920
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:09,930
so that you could tell them about this

921
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:12,569
issue but it's well worth your time to

922
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:14,430
try to establish that relationship and

923
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:16,020
spend a little bit of time and try to

924
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:19,080
think you know how can I communicate

925
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:21,960
this in a way that they'll be able to

926
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:25,590
understand what I'm saying and in that

927
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,670
they'll get it because you know as long

928
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,560
as you're not just complaining

929
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,760
complaining about something that's

930
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,009
probably not going to happen that's

931
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,740
actually not even important to them as

932
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:36,600
long as you can actually explain in a

933
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:38,580
way that they actually understand it and

934
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,900
get it then

935
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:44,040
I mean you've kind of achieved the goal

936
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:46,470
there kind of hit that top it there so

937
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,180
are we doing enough I guess there's

938
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:51,660
there's obviously some things that we

939
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:53,669
could do more again I think that there

940
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:58,290
are some some really neat technologies

941
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:59,310
that are out there these days you know I

942
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:01,740
don't I don't

943
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,270
does anybody have any any suggestions or

944
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:07,109
any things that you've seen that you

945
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:10,710
think is really more cutting-edge like I

946
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,940
know that there's a some kind of a TiVo

947
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,260
or something like that I don't remember

948
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,430
what the name of the product was where

949
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,230
they have these honey pots that are

950
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:18,870
sitting out there I think that's a

951
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:21,600
really good technology a lot of that

952
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:24,150
stuff around access control like the

953
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:27,960
octa is a great thing because you can

954
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:30,120
really eliminate accounts from a lot of

955
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,040
different places and so there are some

956
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:35,540
technologies does anybody have any that

957
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,540
you think you're just awesome these days

958
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:48,120
that's fine it's probably not good

959
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:53,129
Avenue to say it but um anyways so I

960
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:55,080
guess Don I mean I leave you this one

961
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,870
thing can you tell us tell them about

962
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:00,480
no-fail security with our no failed

963
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:04,620
mission and so there's a national

964
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,390
elements within the military the

965
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:10,650
Department of Defense in the National

966
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:14,520
Security Agency that essentially are to

967
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:16,530
protect and defend and prevent threats

968
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:20,120
against the United States and our

969
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:23,100
national interests abroad they literally

970
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,049
there's a handful of organizations that

971
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:27,739
literally

972
00:44:24,049 --> 00:44:30,469
the two words no fail in those missions

973
00:44:27,739 --> 00:44:32,319
and I was honored enough to command one

974
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:36,469
of those organizations for a while and

975
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:41,630
the difference between a regular army

976
00:44:36,469 --> 00:44:47,529
unit and our unit anybody tell me what

977
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:51,140
we think those differences are training

978
00:44:47,529 --> 00:44:55,160
what else it really comes down to two

979
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:58,640
simple things resourcing and equipping

980
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,439
and so you've got and actually later on

981
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,118
in my life I had I worked for the

982
00:45:00,439 --> 00:45:04,670
Special Operations Command as an

983
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:10,189
assessment officer and we got one of

984
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:11,809
those genius questions from from the

985
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:14,618
House Intelligence Committee or

986
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:18,410
somewhere somewhere in DC as politicians

987
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:21,859
asking the question of why does a an

988
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:24,649
operator where level for body armor with

989
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:29,359
porcelain plates that protect up to a 76

990
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:33,160
2 shot and our truck drivers are wearing

991
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:38,359
pink World War two vintage strap

992
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:42,009
shrapnel jackets blackness and can

993
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:45,558
anybody figure out what the differences

994
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:47,900
we're talking about the cost like so I

995
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:50,959
am literally the operator on the ground

996
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:52,549
on the staff posture now but I was given

997
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:55,009
that job because of my practical

998
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:56,569
experience as an operator and so I was

999
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:59,630
saying it okay how do you tell laymen

1000
00:45:56,569 --> 00:46:02,749
the difference between me and the truck

1001
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:04,640
driver that got me started I started

1002
00:46:02,749 --> 00:46:07,578
thinking about Emily rented the

1003
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,578
apartment so it all totally came down to

1004
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:14,239
and the way we satisfied that answer was

1005
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:16,789
it became proximity to target risk

1006
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:18,709
mitigation I'm going in the fatal funnel

1007
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:21,130
I'm going in to kill capture rescue

1008
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:24,769
someone so I'm more likely to get shot

1009
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:26,220
in that truck driver is so it really

1010
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:28,109
became proximity

1011
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:31,169
with the distance how close what's the

1012
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:33,720
one heard the percentage or the

1013
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:35,880
likelihood you get hurt or shot correct

1014
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,910
and so that's what it came down to IT

1015
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,580
security is the same thing what's more

1016
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:44,600
important to protect the network or to

1017
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:50,600
prevent an attack against the network

1018
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:50,600
has been then go out to prevent and then

1019
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:56,730
culture ask them that same question you

1020
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:58,950
can be as rhetorical or direct as you

1021
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:01,680
want to talking about security but you

1022
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:04,140
cannot deny that the conversation needs

1023
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:10,620
to happen and if you make it as simple

1024
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:14,009
as process you know protect defend deter

1025
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:16,380
detect I mean it really is too cynical

1026
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:18,120
life cycle and if you really understand

1027
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,950
the principles of security it doesn't

1028
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,560
matter if it's IT security or principles

1029
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:22,890
or physical security it's all the same

1030
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,049
thing

1031
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:27,450
but if you're not thinking about it and

1032
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:29,970
putting those resources in terms of time

1033
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:33,750
training or money towards equipping and

1034
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:37,169
buying the right products then you're

1035
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:39,570
just trying to put a patch on a problem

1036
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:41,310
that's gonna continue to exist so

1037
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:43,410
anyways we're just about out of time but

1038
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:46,650
I hope we've kind of made people think

1039
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:48,680
about some things I just like you know

1040
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:52,440
the comparison of national security

1041
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:54,980
failures not an option so how can we do

1042
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,980
that with
