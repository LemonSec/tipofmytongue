1
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:28,198
but yourselves automata I'm sorry I like

2
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:31,140
yours up well thank you

3
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:35,820
it started out with the dr. Strangelove

4
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,180
reference ship so are you all ready

5
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,670
excellent

6
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,220
so first off I want to thank everyone

7
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,470
involved in this conference for setting

8
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,440
this up in part buddy to come down here

9
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:50,110
to meet some new friends and to share

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,750
some knowledge before I get started this

11
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:55,470
is actually a DLP's much dated

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:59,350
governor's talk you have been warned a

13
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,540
little bit about myself I'm Micah Kate

14
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,150
Brown I am out of the Cincinnati area I

15
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,760
work through my nine-to-five with new

16
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,640
degree I also serve as the vice

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,040
president for the Greater Cincinnati

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,350
Issa chapter this is about like second

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,229
year doing some talks I make all of my

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,509
talks free and open source so you can

21
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:22,270
just go to my github right there and you

22
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:25,180
can download any of my three existing

23
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:28,630
talks and I'm working on some really

24
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:32,290
cool ones for the upcoming years that

25
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:34,330
being said I do have high cissp and I

26
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,390
was fortunate enough to be honored with

27
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,550
presenting this year's Derby con and let

28
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,700
me tell you that was a great experience

29
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,950
now guys I'm not a vendor I have nothing

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,350
to sell you except to invest in yourself

31
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,900
in since many we have four great IT

32
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,539
security organizations that all work

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,630
together to provide a better environment

34
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,610
for our IT security practitioners so if

35
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,979
you're ever in Cincinnati we'd love to

36
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:04,810
have you on any and are all of our

37
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:07,299
events that being said this talk is for

38
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,769
you if you have any questions please

39
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:11,470
feel free to raise your hand

40
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:13,060
shadowmap or curl roots or vegetables

41
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,720
without rain just abandoned in my

42
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:20,650
general direction that being said what

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,620
is DLP daven loss prevention it's not a

44
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,989
model of the policy stack anymore it's

45
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,730
not designed to stop a sufficiently

46
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:30,190
advanced adversary

47
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:33,760
it is not digital rights management is

48
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:36,050
not is user behavior analytics and it is

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,899
not a silver bullet but

50
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,480
ELP is is it's between a feature of a

51
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,860
lot of diverse and different tools that

52
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,899
you may have or you may choose to

53
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,330
implement in your environment it's

54
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,460
designed to help enable proper data

55
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,190
ownership data stewardship within your

56
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,550
organization in my personal mind

57
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:59,329
I believe that DLP is a business tool

58
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:01,850
that may be operated by IT and IT

59
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:05,420
security I think it's very key that we

60
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:08,120
think of it in that scope I think it's a

61
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,609
collection of tools that allow the

62
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,730
business to define controls on how they

63
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:17,300
store process and transmit data in our

64
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,649
environment and so that's exactly what

65
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,330
we're going to go through and we're talk

66
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,490
about how can we go through and apply

67
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:26,680
controls on how we store how many

68
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:30,440
process and how we transmit data now

69
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,150
your tools that may vary but in general

70
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,710
you'll have a couple common components

71
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,360
the first one is going to be the deal to

72
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,100
client so this was a small piece of

73
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,710
software that sits on each one of your

74
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,400
client systems and it goes through and

75
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:45,770
it performs DLP activities on how your

76
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,090
users are interacting with their machine

77
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,850
with your data

78
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,860
the next is a DLP network scanning

79
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:55,670
device so this is kind of reading IDs or

80
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,040
IPs in our environment except looking

81
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,769
since I'm looking for the actual

82
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,620
malicious attack signatures it's looking

83
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,640
at potentially sensitive information

84
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,950
traversing the network they can feed it

85
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,140
now you can feed these devices generally

86
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,750
you can use spam ports you can use

87
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,458
network tabs or you can use packet

88
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,720
aggregators the last ones really where

89
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,860
you want to be because that's really

90
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,260
going to help out and we'll talk about

91
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,209
that in just a little bit the deal

92
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,719
people posit or Iskandar is that so this

93
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,040
is the server or service they'll go

94
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,860
through and you can point at a

95
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,169
particular data storage location this

96
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,550
could be a share this could be an as it

97
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:35,240
could be a saying it could be a database

98
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:38,390
it could be something like a web storage

99
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,730
unit but basically it goes through its

100
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:44,000
gates every piece of data every file on

101
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:46,550
that repository and they'll give you

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
back a report as to what potentially

103
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:52,180
sensitive information it thinks

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,120
you have there now I'm not cool thing

105
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,310
about this is some of these repository

106
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,530
scammers they do allow you to go through

107
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,380
and to take actionable information so

108
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,989
for example if you had documents that

109
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,550
were classified as top secret and you're

110
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,620
skimming Sam public's here you can take

111
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,210
any document I find that is labeled top

112
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,520
secret please move it over to this

113
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,739
security area so that's something kind

114
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,080
of cool that I'm playing around with

115
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,860
professionally at least in my mind the

116
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,650
next major component is DLP MN so this

117
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,080
is a server or service that interacts

118
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:29,620
with your nails so and it'll go through

119
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,260
the skin both incoming and outgoing and

120
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:36,760
I know I get challenged by this all the

121
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:38,919
time data loss prevention we really care

122
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,810
about what's going on well yes that's

123
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,330
true I also want to know be able to

124
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:46,060
identify what's coming in that's

125
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,010
particularly sensitive coming into a

126
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,050
suboptimal path that way I can privately

127
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,300
reach out to the business and start a

128
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,660
dialogue not only as an education but

129
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:59,020
being in an any more of business when

130
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,450
that trust that we often have so hard

131
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,780
the time is now bringing value to the

132
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,229
business

133
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:08,710
DLP web it works in much the same way as

134
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:13,870
the DLT email usually it's through a WCC

135
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:17,380
P link between your web proxy and your

136
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,250
or in the DLP web device and this allows

137
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,040
you to do

138
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,510
DLP activities on all type coming into

139
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,720
your network and out of your network

140
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:27,669
once again I do believe that DLP both

141
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,380
directions is preferable so that we can

142
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:32,320
start to have those educational

143
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,750
conversations and finally there's the

144
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,909
DLT management console and guys this one

145
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,760
is the scariest of all of them just

146
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,520
think about it DLP is designed to go

147
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,169
through and to catch some of our most

148
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,659
sensitive information in our environment

149
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:49,479
and when we do find a violation what we

150
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,880
do we create an incident we create an

151
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,789
alert and that incident that alert it's

152
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,680
going to have generated a copy of the

153
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,410
primary information if not the whole

154
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,660
file as to what was flag but it's also

155
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:05,860
going to have secondary information

156
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:10,030
so if I am an adversary and I realize

157
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:12,370
that there is a DLP environment if I get

158
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,200
access to those incident om I'm going to

159
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,020
be able to ask it hey you showed me all

160
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,150
incidents with credit card numbers but

161
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,060
I'm also going to get the meta tag the

162
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,530
who created the who acted on it but

163
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,440
where was that originally stored in

164
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:29,580
Galilee if I find a single spreadsheet

165
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,650
that has 5 10 15 credit cards in that

166
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,390
file server over there what's the chance

167
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,520
are there going to be other sensitive

168
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:38,800
Isles there it's pretty high actually

169
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,810
and so when it comes to your DLP

170
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,820
management console we need to make sure

171
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,250
that you are securing it in a way that

172
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,680
is defendable from all the rules laws

173
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:51,610
and regulations that apply to your

174
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,860
environment so let's talk about how

175
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:57,970
these components interact the first one

176
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,380
the DLP client on your mini systems this

177
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,510
one can be really problematic because

178
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,820
the moment that you go through and you

179
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,950
put a DLP control on your client

180
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,659
endpoints people are going to go through

181
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,490
and whenever there's a performance

182
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,640
degradation they're going to say it has

183
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:16,660
to be DLP now to address this what we

184
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:19,060
did is we used a fairly well known per

185
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,850
process monitoring we installed it on a

186
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,320
couple of our IT security of

187
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:26,560
workstations that we use every day and

188
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:29,409
it would go through an image screen per

189
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,099
process compute cuff CPU memory disk i/o

190
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:35,229
network i/o so that when somebody came

191
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,750
to us that hey we think deal piece

192
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:42,039
causing a problem week actually had raw

193
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:44,800
X to say we do see that on average the

194
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,920
actual CPU cost is between 0.5 and 1

195
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:52,479
point 5 percent C Q being the maximum

196
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,579
spike that I observed but we don't think

197
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,000
it's really us because we're seeing you

198
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:00,250
know chrome and ie and Microsoft are

199
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,730
much heavier burden on the compute

200
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:06,940
Kasabian system likewise I've been very

201
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:10,120
upfront and paranoid as moving as much

202
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,370
off of the actual DLP client as possible

203
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,660
I'm taking it from the DLP client onto

204
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,540
what I call the DLP in our

205
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:19,510
or the rest of the dl key stat because i

206
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,310
do want to be sensitive to decline the

207
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:24,819
or the client performance of our client

208
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:28,000
systems and that is one thing that we've

209
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,250
taken very seriously originally we were

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,120
planning to go through and do DLP web

211
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:37,420
inspection on the clients but uh nothing

212
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,780
happened I came into work one day and I

213
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,790
got a bunch of calls from helped if they

214
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,400
say they might know we think something's

215
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,689
going wrong no one or we've been getting

216
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
a significant amount of calls that

217
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,230
people aren't able to open up rowm

218
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,810
and so i start to dig into it they've

219
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,880
done what I found out is is I believe

220
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,890
that Google is doing a really good job

221
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,160
with a bunch of their efforts out there

222
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:04,210
and chrome it's a great browser however

223
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,010
the first time that my DLT provider gets

224
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,560
the new version of Chrome is the same

225
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:12,189
day that my users and because there

226
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,619
isn't a clear integration or clear away

227
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,240
from my DLP vendor to hook into chrome

228
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,330
they actually have to reverse engineer

229
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,890
their hooks to figure out how to go

230
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:24,960
through and how to intercept and how to

231
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:27,400
perform DLP so of course what happened

232
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,020
Google went through with Amina additions

233
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,209
to Chrome they made modifications that

234
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,730
changed those hooks so that every time

235
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:37,240
my users were going through and they

236
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,830
were trying to open it our DLP cloud was

237
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,920
actually crashing it that's one reason

238
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:45,610
why he chose to go through and move the

239
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,949
DLP web off of the client system and up

240
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,890
into the network layer another thing I'm

241
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:54,070
very cognizant of is keeping our

242
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,870
classifications as lightweight as simple

243
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,910
as needed keep in mind every new

244
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,380
classification every new addition to a

245
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,230
text dictionary every new addiction

246
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,600
addition to a regular expression

247
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:07,300
dictionary that has a quantifiable cost

248
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,910
in computer resources every time that

249
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,459
DLP check is happening so we need to

250
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:16,079
strike a balance between having a

251
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:18,550
reasonable amount of control and is

252
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,190
lightweight about the cost on our end

253
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:23,740
user client systems as possible they

254
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,330
going to face problems like you do with

255
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,600
any of our other controls up on our

256
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:29,300
client systems

257
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,430
I work for an insurance company we have

258
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,040
road warriors that take it as a battle

259
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:36,290
of pride to be out of the office for two

260
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,520
three four weeks at a time and not

261
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:42,349
connect back to VPN so our meeting our

262
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,630
updates are they gave their data

263
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,340
signatures that's a real problem that

264
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:49,460
you're going to have to only evaluate

265
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:52,130
and come up with the solution around the

266
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:56,060
client might not even be on every server

267
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:58,520
so we use a MSSP to help us go through

268
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,459
to push this client out then I would

269
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,319
have to go through and run remediations

270
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:06,110
reports and say okay how many clients

271
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,390
are active on our network ie they

272
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,250
communicated in two weeks but do not

273
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,470
have a client okay these are the ones

274
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,720
that we missed and slowly work our way

275
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,310
down until we got a fairly high

276
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,140
assurance level so you're going to need

277
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:21,439
to build in those basic controls into

278
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:24,080
your program likewise the DLP network

279
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,600
you can actually overlap depending on

280
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:30,110
what segments you're sending it with DLP

281
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:33,470
web and DLP email so my suggestion here

282
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:36,680
is to pick the tool that will do the

283
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:40,690
best inspection and to limit it to only

284
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:43,430
that tool doing that X in spec ssin

285
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,390
honestly if we don't do that guys then

286
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,670
we're just going to go through and

287
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,800
Parcells with duplicate things that it's

288
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:51,740
created for the same event and that

289
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,439
doesn't do any of us any help keep in

290
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:57,110
mind as I said before we need to be very

291
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,630
careful with access and the protection

292
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,970
of the DLP management console and make

293
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,800
sure every time we go or when we set it

294
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,720
up and when we run it then we can meet

295
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,250
every rule law and regulation for the

296
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,240
data that we go through and are

297
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:14,030
collecting and by me when I started with

298
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,090
this DLP project I landed on a DLP

299
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:21,380
project with five years of lead engineer

300
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:26,120
no sign of needing it but with that

301
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:27,830
being said every time or I'm sorry I

302
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:32,030
used to think that we were going to go

303
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:37,280
through and be a single DLP scan engine

304
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:38,420
shop now I'm up to four possibly a fifth

305
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,889
one coming in

306
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,479
and there's a high cost of the

307
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:42,889
fragmentation of policies when we're

308
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,230
dealing with multiple different scan

309
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:51,339
engines and we'll address that in just a

310
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:55,850
little bit so let's move forward so I

311
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:58,940
often joke within my organization that

312
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:03,350
the biggest problem data loss prevention

313
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:05,540
has is the name if you think about it we

314
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,550
are going through and near inundated

315
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:11,290
with stories of various theater breaches

316
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:14,359
in fact I just saw one last night for a

317
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:17,209
company that has burro habit which there

318
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,300
for several years pretty sensitive

319
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:23,359
information was leaked and so when our

320
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,430
senior management starts seeing that and

321
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,079
that started to come around and they

322
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,880
really have started to come around to

323
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:30,800
the whole IT and IT security and I

324
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,430
attribute that directly back to what

325
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,959
happened with the target investigation

326
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:39,229
then they see a product that says data

327
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:41,300
loss prevention their thought says this

328
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:45,800
is going to stop all data leaves and

329
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:48,709
it's not it stops the basic the

330
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,290
accidental it helps you put controls but

331
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:53,689
it will not stop a sufficiently advanced

332
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:59,149
adversary and we'll talk about that in a

333
00:14:53,690 --> 00:15:01,430
bit now we're in this project in with

334
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:03,350
many different leaders first we have a

335
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,569
program coordinator that wanted to be a

336
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,010
program coordinator half the time and

337
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,649
half the time wanted to be a product

338
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:12,910
manager loved it one of the actual

339
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:15,680
challenges there is when me as the

340
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:17,390
engineers as an analyst or going through

341
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,120
and working and building we would

342
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:22,459
provide one update up one level and just

343
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,760
like you gave up telephone when it got

344
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:28,040
retold it wasn't the exact same message

345
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,180
and so now senior management is thinking

346
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,130
that we're doing one thing when we're

347
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,800
actually doing another thing and then

348
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,769
the feedback also went through that same

349
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,500
game of telephone we then went through

350
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:42,260
and for a period of time I went through

351
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,829
and I accepted the project manager role

352
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,899
- guys I'm a terrible project manager

353
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:48,859
but I'm a good engineer so I took a

354
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:51,110
little hack

355
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,520
Emeril's have engineering rules and when

356
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,770
I was able to go through and speak

357
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,180
directly with senior management when I

358
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,920
was able to clearly define and

359
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,020
articulate one of the possibilities but

360
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,560
the true costs were we were able to make

361
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,150
progress relatively quickly compared to

362
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,939
what we were in the past

363
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,380
when we went from just this being rolled

364
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,060
out to the North and South America

365
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,730
companies - lovely

366
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:17,329
he had a formal p.m. and it did take us

367
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:20,930
a little while to learn her up on the

368
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:23,870
technology on the lingo on the cost but

369
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:27,140
once we went through and did that

370
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,760
education it worked pretty well but when

371
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,280
it comes to running this type of a

372
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,980
project I really think that we need as

373
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,530
engineers as analyst need to lead from

374
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:39,700
the ground up and make sure that when we

375
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:43,459
are going to our senior management for

376
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:48,680
the decisions the scoping the banners

377
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:49,910
but the true costs are so that brings me

378
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,819
to the next point we need to clearly

379
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:55,160
define what this in scope and what is

380
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:58,310
absolutely I cannot tell you how many

381
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,610
times in a week where my scope of change

382
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:05,690
three to four significant times in one

383
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:10,160
week guys it's very hard to hit a moving

384
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:13,070
target DOP one of my favorite questions

385
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,010
on DOP is is this part of your active

386
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:17,929
defense toolset or is this just a

387
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,609
historical system of what happened and

388
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,610
what I'm trying to illustrate to

389
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:25,760
management is do we treat this like in

390
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:27,770
IDs or every alert that meets a certain

391
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,760
threshold we have to have an analyst

392
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,639
eyes on there to make sure that

393
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,950
something didn't go wrong or is this a

394
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,800
tour and just correct collecting records

395
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:39,050
and if there is a need to do an

396
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,580
investigation we can take a look back in

397
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,220
the near history and see what actually

398
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:46,790
has happened in Arbit you know to this

399
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:48,470
day after four or five years I just

400
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,360
don't have an answer to this one very

401
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:53,300
simple very fundamental question and

402
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,169
we'll talk about that in detail a little

403
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,530
bit later

404
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:59,600
keep in mind DLP is designed to find

405
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:02,510
your most sensitive information that

406
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,600
most likely you have a DLP program

407
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:08,720
you must protect Andersen rules laws and

408
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,980
regulations that includes access to the

409
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,620
DLP environment in and of itself

410
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:19,850
DLP remember I'm of the firm belief that

411
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:22,760
it is a business tool that IT and/or IT

412
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:24,949
security might run we need to go through

413
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,929
and bring the business in early bring

414
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,610
them in often so that they can go

415
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:31,760
through and they can make informed

416
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:35,299
decisions on what they want to do it's

417
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,370
no secret goes I work with my team's out

418
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:40,190
of impact and amia

419
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:43,580
and I'll tell you the Europeans have a

420
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:47,650
very progressive view on personal

421
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:51,710
privacy and that has caused a lot of

422
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:53,900
interesting opportunities to go through

423
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:57,740
individual address some very challenging

424
00:18:53,900 --> 00:19:01,160
issues to get approval from certain

425
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,110
European boards so keep in mind knowing

426
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,700
your risk appetites are grave the

427
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:08,389
business in so that they can help guide

428
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:10,940
you through this who by the way who

429
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:13,790
responds to the ELCA incident and what

430
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,309
is your internal SLA those are very

431
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:18,260
important questions that as an IT

432
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:20,120
security practitioner it's my

433
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,669
responsibility to ask that to management

434
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:27,668
its management's responsibility to

435
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:31,400
articulate that so the impetus behind

436
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:33,890
this talk was really to give you kind of

437
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,020
my experience for years boiled down so

438
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,580
you can see where I have failed so you

439
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,668
can so that you don't have to run into

440
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,980
those traps one of the greatest clubs

441
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:45,110
that I had in this DLP project was we

442
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,960
were back in our infancy just getting

443
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:50,659
ready to roll out to the Americas

444
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,510
organizations and at this time I am

445
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:55,760
about 10 12 members of IT security for

446
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:59,120
myself and the other analysts on the

447
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,879
project two senior IT security that had

448
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,820
the DLP client installed and one day as

449
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,520
did some TV actors and I made a mistake

450
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:11,540
in one of my data classifications I made

451
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:14,780
the mistake of going through and leading

452
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:17,029
off one right parenthesis that was it

453
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,980
that's all I did

454
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:20,840
and because I did that I caused the

455
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,240
memory overload that slowly but surely

456
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,779
took every one of our computers and

457
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,340
turned them into a potato

458
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:36,529
we still call that the great potato in

459
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:38,658
effect of a 2017 so obviously that

460
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:40,730
wasn't good so I had to go up to senior

461
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:43,850
manager and say here is exactly why I

462
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,679
took all of your systems down yes it was

463
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,668
just us but here's how we're going to go

464
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,889
through and prevent this in the future

465
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:50,840
so we came up with something very simple

466
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:52,459
I looked at what are we already doing as

467
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,850
a business today well for software

468
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,799
update we have a test a pilot and a

469
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:01,009
production instead of groups so I

470
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:03,259
created that for the Americas but that

471
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:05,330
had interesting consequences because now

472
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:07,999
every classification I have to have a

473
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:11,769
test pilot and I have to have a

474
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:14,720
production instance every class or every

475
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:17,749
individual regular expression text

476
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,269
dictionary I had to have three different

477
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:22,909
revisions of that and that's why I call

478
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:24,529
fragmentation of your DLP policy the

479
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:26,840
number of environments that you have to

480
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:28,460
support directly will dictate how you

481
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,980
have to support your environment the

482
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,470
complexities that are brought in with

483
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,230
each one of those and so one of the

484
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,450
challenges is to find a balance between

485
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:41,899
what you need to meet your

486
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,629
organization's testing standard and what

487
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:46,639
you as an IT security organization as an

488
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:49,519
IT organization can go through and can

489
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:52,219
support so that's a huge challenge now

490
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:55,610
in general I know you are allowed to do

491
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,379
whatever we wanted to test our pilot at

492
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:01,610
the time you were dealing with a total

493
00:21:57,379 --> 00:22:05,059
user population of about 8,000 and about

494
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:07,309
200 total and our pilot was about 200

495
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:09,289
that were strategically picked between

496
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:11,749
our individual organizations in all

497
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:13,700
areas of the business so that we could

498
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:16,249
try to find something out so general

499
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,440
roy's we build and test me on free rein

500
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:20,179
we use change control to push out the

501
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,519
pilot and then they have another tank

502
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:24,470
control to push out to productive pretty

503
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:25,820
simple pretty standard but you're going

504
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,420
to have to figure out what your own

505
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:32,919
strategy is going to be with

506
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:34,690
that so at one point I was under huge

507
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,670
pressure and I really didn't understand

508
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,040
her this pressure was because of me I'm

509
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:43,030
a technologist I'm not people person and

510
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:45,040
I knew that we were not getting we

511
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:48,450
didn't have the policy in a state where

512
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:53,860
we needed the average person was created

513
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:55,510
100 DLP events a day eight to five and

514
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,580
management was coming at me

515
00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:00,820
mica you need to go we need to show

516
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:02,290
progress to the board and I was kind of

517
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,120
caught off guard I hadn't done my

518
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:06,670
homework so the only thing I could say

519
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,830
on that call was guys we're not ready

520
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,870
you need to spend more time to me the

521
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:15,850
average person is creating about a

522
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:18,879
hundred incidents a day and so I asked

523
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,620
management can you give me 24 hours to

524
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,670
go through it to try to think of a

525
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,760
solution I don't even know what the

526
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:28,500
solution was I needed to quantify it to

527
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:31,300
them and so I had an outrageous idea I

528
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,940
needed to find a metric that mattered to

529
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:37,149
management so I had already gone through

530
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,590
and I had been working thousands and

531
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:41,680
thousands of incidents throughout the

532
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:43,659
tuning process and so I knew that to

533
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,270
fully evaluate at the lp internet and be

534
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,280
able to trace it back to the source

535
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:53,590
recent the exact reason why it needed

536
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:56,170
our bike fires and make a ignore to our

537
00:23:53,590 --> 00:24:00,340
escalate decision was about five minutes

538
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:02,350
so I just did simple math I went through

539
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,000
estimating that five minutes a day with

540
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:08,639
the average person creating 100

541
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:12,010
incidents a day that we'd only need 4225

542
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,790
dlp analysts back to cover our 8:00 to

543
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,830
5:00

544
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:18,090
DLP incident sites not coming after

545
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:20,409
hours that's not counting weekends and

546
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:24,129
there's a mic that's not good what do

547
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:27,940
you recommend more time to me and so

548
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:29,650
when it comes to tuning going through

549
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,450
and doing your first round of tuning

550
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,820
getting the first 80% that's pretty easy

551
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,950
the next round is a little bit harder

552
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,439
and the next in each subsequent round is

553
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,680
going to be even harder than that as a

554
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,740
rule of thumb

555
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,020
your default rules are going to stink

556
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,690
I've got a friend British very smart guy

557
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:50,090
him and I are great friends at work and

558
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:52,430
if it was my attention to assign to the

559
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,260
DLP project in cakes I'd work to go

560
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:58,370
through and suffer some outrageous act

561
00:24:54,260 --> 00:25:02,480
of fortune and one day I'm going through

562
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:05,030
my incidents and I've seen wait a minute

563
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,610
Bruce has an intimate here it's an email

564
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,790
and it's a HIPAA violation well number

565
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:12,860
one I know Bruce is a very

566
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:14,360
security-conscious individual and so I

567
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,120
started digging into it wanting to

568
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,520
understand why was this classified as a

569
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,709
hit love it and so as I was going

570
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,110
through and digging in it said something

571
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,660
to the effect of hey honey talking to

572
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:28,159
his girlfriend now fiance I don't feel

573
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,910
like cooking tonight what do you want

574
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,950
from Boston Market then below that by

575
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:36,200
the way here's the best way to go

576
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:40,700
through it to apply saddle soap and it

577
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,850
was an Amazon link and I started that

578
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,310
doesn't sound like it but role to need

579
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,030
so I started to dig in and as I was

580
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,310
digging in

581
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,680
I was looking at how we defined HIPAA

582
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:55,040
rules and I'll show some of you this or

583
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:57,590
this and just a little bit and what I

584
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,320
came up with one of the dictionaries we

585
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:03,320
had was exceedingly poor our medical

586
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,169
term what soap and then we are looking

587
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,230
for either a common last name us last

588
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:11,320
names which Eric's was in or a telephone

589
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:14,180
number or a zip code

590
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,710
Daesan any email what's the chance that

591
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,420
you're going to have one of those three

592
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:21,650
if not all three of those in that email

593
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:24,860
it's gonna be pretty high it's gonna be

594
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:26,980
80 maybe but yeah it's really common to

595
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,330
go through and have one of those three

596
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:32,240
plus some medical terms of what did I do

597
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,159
to tune it I said this default

598
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,350
dictionary it's horrible and I just

599
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:40,250
dropped it just because of how weak it

600
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:42,949
was secondly we need to learn to love

601
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:47,510
regular expressions so my good friend

602
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:50,720
met she went through and has a 2017 talk

603
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:53,370
from Der Beek on regex 101 it's a stable

604
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,110
talk it's 30 minutes but if you're not

605
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,030
with regular expressions or want to

606
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,699
brush up anytime somebody comes on to my

607
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:04,610
DLP team I don't care who they are they

608
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:07,500
watch that video period and then guys

609
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:10,379
it's not the undesirable results zone

610
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,180
but I really care about what really

611
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,240
scares me about DLP is introducing false

612
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:18,150
negatives dop amazed that should have

613
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,790
triggered an alert but because we over

614
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,700
tuned they did it so every time I'm

615
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:26,580
making a tuning knob the decision I ask

616
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,650
myself how likely is this that it could

617
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:31,020
be used or abused to create false

618
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:34,050
negatives so that's what really keeps me

619
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:36,929
up at night in fact anyone on my team

620
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:38,159
it's tired of me saying this there are

621
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:40,830
no false positives

622
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:44,130
there's only poorly written rules and

623
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:46,590
what I mean by that is I've looked at a

624
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:49,230
lot of DLP incidents and for the most

625
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:51,000
part we have gotten really good at

626
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:54,179
writing these computer systems to

627
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,610
execute basic logical comparisons and

628
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:58,350
gotten really good at it so when we're

629
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,909
constantly going through and saying

630
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,719
something suppose negative one will be

631
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,820
saving about our tool

632
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,650
oh it's getting this rush it's wasting

633
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:10,649
our time it's putting our tool down

634
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:12,960
instead what I went through and what I

635
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:16,460
started to do ms I started to go through

636
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:22,490
and measure incidents on validity and

637
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:25,950
accuracy accuracy is does the actual

638
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:28,559
detection make mathematical sense so

639
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,910
stripping out human emotion just looking

640
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,160
at here's what the classification is

641
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:34,800
looking for here's the data input do I

642
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:38,340
agree with the computer yes or no that's

643
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:41,790
accuracy validity is doesn't go through

644
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,350
and catch what we're intending so if I'm

645
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,050
doing through and I'm looking for a US

646
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:48,959
driver's license and I get a users log

647
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:52,590
on my e that might be hiding accurate

648
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,840
but it's low validity right so once I

649
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:58,649
started going through and socializing

650
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:01,260
our team time especially the technical

651
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:03,270
team our analysts on this philosophy it

652
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,830
almost put our mindset more

653
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,330
how can we improve the to how can you

654
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,580
improve our algorithms how can we

655
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,710
improve our data classification and that

656
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:14,070
was a huge win and building trust in the

657
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:17,550
system to me so let's take a little bit

658
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:20,730
and talk about the architecture so

659
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:22,830
traditional DLP classifications that are

660
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,990
built upon regular expressions texts

661
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:28,439
dictionaries and other types of boolean

662
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,970
logic this can be problematic so the

663
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,480
United States of America is currently

664
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:35,340
couple lives of 50 different states each

665
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,740
state has the legal authority to declare

666
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:40,260
driver's license every which way they

667
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,560
wish and I'll show you this in just a

668
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:45,810
moment likewise many of our favorite

669
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:48,179
social media sites the ins of links the

670
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:51,480
book of faces they go through and embed

671
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,190
in their URL a 15 16 digit character

672
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,230
numeric character what does that look

673
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:57,120
like to a computer it looks like a

674
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:59,490
credit card right I've even gone through

675
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:05,189
in front of some of them to check and

676
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:06,900
they pass obviously we have to do better

677
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:08,760
when you're building your data

678
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:12,170
classifications always follow the

679
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:15,840
primary rule improv comedy and yes and

680
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:16,680
stainless I tripped over that we'll talk

681
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,899
about that in a minute

682
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,340
proximity rules are your friend per

683
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,130
you're looking for condition a in

684
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:26,790
condition B within so many characters of

685
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:29,970
yours of each other are a huge lid so

686
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:32,010
guys right here is a sample of and it's

687
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:34,470
a little bit old but this is how we

688
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:35,970
documented our Dion pupils and we

689
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,770
continued to this day

690
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,900
so I'm going to walk you through this a

691
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:43,680
little bit so the first part is the

692
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:46,290
actual classification now within our DLP

693
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,260
environment a classification can have

694
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:50,700
many different classification criteria

695
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,010
but the hit is always on the

696
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,140
classification the first thing I want to

697
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:58,260
point out is to help our analysts I

698
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:01,200
always begin with a shortcut so CL t v--

699
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:05,129
11 d e f so that stands for client

700
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,770
version 11 default so just by looking at

701
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:10,380
the start of any customizable config my

702
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:13,320
analyst my engineers know exactly where

703
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,690
that piece belongs in our environment

704
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,340
that's a huge win for documentation if

705
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,430
something

706
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:23,300
that I am so glad that we keyed on to

707
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:26,030
earlier the second Pro it's basically

708
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:29,540
just a quick description of what it's

709
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:31,820
trying to do so one classification and

710
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:34,220
have many classification criteria and

711
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:37,370
they a match on any classification

712
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:40,730
criteria will result on a hint on that

713
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:43,899
classification level the third column is

714
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:46,190
what type of rule is it is it a

715
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,840
proximity rule meaning it's looking for

716
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:50,270
conditioning condition people within so

717
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,870
many spaces isn't just an advanced

718
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:55,340
patter by itself is it just a dictionary

719
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,500
so we're just kind of giving a little

720
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:59,959
bit of definition on what it's look or

721
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,390
what what type of Woollett is at a high

722
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:07,220
level and then the rightmost that's

723
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:09,860
actually the rule itself so the words in

724
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:11,450
blue are the actual configuration items

725
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,010
that we're looking for so on the top one

726
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:17,020
there we're looking for a credit card

727
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:19,490
number so we have a bunch of pre-built

728
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,500
regular expression dictionaries patterns

729
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:23,360
that we're looking for plus we're

730
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,790
looking for a dictionary and by the way

731
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,100
when I'm building dictionaries if there

732
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:29,570
are text dictionary I append that text

733
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,780
to the end if there are regular

734
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,790
expressions I append expr once again

735
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,770
that's just a labeling him to help my

736
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:38,149
analyst know and my engineers know

737
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:41,090
exactly what we're looking for and

738
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:43,130
they're filed within 90 characters of

739
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:46,100
each other and at least one point in

740
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:48,740
time so just by going through and having

741
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:51,649
this this is a living breathing document

742
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,690
and I can use to my auditors internal

743
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:56,480
external like you actually take to the

744
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,900
business and say this is how the up key

745
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,310
works

746
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,620
it helps me because when I'm

747
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:03,020
troubleshooting deal key I'll pull it up

748
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:05,570
and I'll take a and I'll filter just on

749
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:08,389
the classification I'm hitting and I'll

750
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,790
use this documentation okay why in the

751
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,770
world that I go through and did I have a

752
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,899
hit on that because at the end of the

753
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:20,270
day I never understand which of these

754
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:23,480
three PCI classification criterias I hit

755
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:25,340
to curve that classification so this is

756
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,800
very critical for troubleshooting as

757
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,689
well as just good hygiene so this is

758
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,669
something that I highly recommend

759
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,680
that we go through and to do with our

760
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:35,660
environment so guys right here's our

761
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:40,640
driver's license everything on the left

762
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:42,710
here is how we define and then when we

763
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,480
started to look into it we saw that we

764
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,340
are getting unintentional collisions

765
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,050
everything from our change tickets to

766
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:52,030
our incident tickets to our problem

767
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:54,110
tickets our user IDs our contractor IDs

768
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:57,680
something that supports year year year

769
00:33:54,110 --> 00:34:00,760
year month month day day ordained a

770
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:04,970
month month year year year year

771
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:10,030
notations would be hit on as an actual

772
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:12,110
driver's license that's problematic so

773
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:17,200
this is where it might have screwed up

774
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:19,070
again my first attempt was we created a

775
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:21,199
classification called driver's license

776
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,210
that was just looking for that regular

777
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,759
expression dictionary that I just showed

778
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,130
you and then I created a NOC driver's

779
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,950
license and that's looking for that same

780
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:34,280
technician air plus text that indicate

781
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:37,009
that probably matched was not a driver's

782
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:40,610
license so this was things like tele or

783
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:42,800
mobile or meeting code within so many

784
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,900
characters and guys this would have

785
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,429
worked right if all I cared about my

786
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:50,210
further license I'm an insurance

787
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:52,820
organization I care about HIPAA GLB PCI

788
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,580
on top of just the US driver's license

789
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,900
so when I go through and it being

790
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,880
created easily

791
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:01,700
I was actually excluded ain't in the

792
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,480
habit 80 NOC driver's license and that

793
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:07,580
was a huge window for false negatives to

794
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,970
be accrued on my own party so what did I

795
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,069
do

796
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:13,879
I followed the primary role of improv

797
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:18,230
comedy I edited how he defined driver's

798
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:21,080
license by adding a yes and so what we

799
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,730
did was we implemented this simple hat

800
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,380
here some drivers license we're still

801
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:26,900
looking for the same regular expression

802
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:30,140
match plus a text dictionary that

803
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,240
indicate a positive correlation to a

804
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:36,290
driver's license so that was words like

805
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:39,589
driver or license or vehicle or a lysine

806
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:41,420
number oh I see column R then just

807
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,620
something that indicate that we had a

808
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,140
truth

809
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:48,440
taxi and that took our drivers license

810
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:50,540
from our worst classification to one of

811
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:55,820
our tightest best performing overnight

812
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:59,060
and that was a huge win so I often joke

813
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:02,450
about weaponizing our users when it

814
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:05,390
comes to being classification and all

815
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:07,460
that it's true it's more about inviting

816
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:10,460
them to be proper data stewards and this

817
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:12,500
is where our meta tagging of deal or

818
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,540
documents with the LP meta tags is an

819
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,400
absolutely huge win within our

820
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,529
organization we have a data

821
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,410
classification code that we go through

822
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:25,610
and that we actually enforce we're using

823
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:28,490
a very popular software to go through in

824
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:30,860
to allow our users when they save a

825
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:33,890
document it doesn't already have a meta

826
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:37,250
tag data defined in it it'll get a

827
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:39,440
little pop up hello we act company care

828
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:41,690
very much about the sensitivity and the

829
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,840
protection of our data please help us

830
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:48,460
pasa Phi your data and then if the user

831
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:53,270
is prompted like anyone public a to

832
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:55,460
private a3 sensitive and if these are

833
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:57,140
hovers over then a little pop-up will go

834
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,730
through and come up and they'll say hey

835
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,710
this is what it means to be a public

836
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:04,070
document but means be a private document

837
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:05,510
and it's great because now we're going

838
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,430
through our inviting our users to come

839
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:09,440
in we're getting them on reminder that

840
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:12,169
we do care about the security of our

841
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,570
data every time they stayed at Don Smith

842
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:16,580
know what's great about this is not only

843
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:19,210
by classifying your data with meta tags

844
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:23,120
since that's in the header of a document

845
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:27,610
you know in between LP you're also

846
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:31,130
enriching the rest of your tool set so

847
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:32,300
you'll find that many other common tools

848
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:34,250
that you already have in your

849
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,990
environment can go through and can read

850
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:38,600
those headers and can go through and

851
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:42,379
have increased functionality based on

852
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:43,940
them and that's an actual huge way since

853
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,960
we went through and rolled out this data

854
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,840
classification

855
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,910
meta tag I've actually had an increase

856
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,160
of times where the business has

857
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:55,830
proactively come to me and said hey we

858
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,899
are wanting to do X can you help us just

859
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:59,460
a way to do it better and I really do

860
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,440
think it's because we've started to go

861
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,050
through and to include them in making

862
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,440
more decisions about the sensitivity of

863
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:09,000
our data and I think that is a huge win

864
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:12,390
so what we're going to talk about next

865
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,490
is actually like strategy in building a

866
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:17,129
DLP policy anyone familiar with the book

867
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:21,720
do the first floor good after that gets

868
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:23,760
a little bit weird that being said we've

869
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,029
been hired by Paul Atreides to go

870
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:31,530
through and to build a DLP policy for

871
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:33,570
his galactic or Federation so as you can

872
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:36,000
see we are going to be on the planet

873
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:38,670
Arrakis and we are friends with a couple

874
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,800
planets and we're enemies with others so

875
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:44,240
the first part about building a good

876
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,460
deal p policy is knowing the players

877
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:50,819
next we make a map of how the space I

878
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:52,920
mean data must flow so here we can go

879
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,080
through and we can clearly see that we

880
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,330
are going to be erectus here and we are

881
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:00,000
friends with chapter house and friends

882
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:05,220
with Caledon but we are enemies with DV

883
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:08,040
Prime and quorum so we simply create a

884
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:10,529
data flow map pretty simple right I

885
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,400
found that oftentimes at pictures a

886
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:14,010
thousand words

887
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,070
the next thing that we do is we create

888
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:18,870
our data classifications so anyone is

889
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:21,240
going to be public you can be shared

890
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:23,730
free enough to read with anyone think

891
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,799
about a weather forecast in to is

892
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:29,340
proprietary to be used for me by the

893
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,860
Arrakis government or our allies a three

894
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:34,080
is diplomatic so this is something that

895
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:37,200
it's for you to be shared but we have we

896
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,299
must maintain the integrity of that

897
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,149
communication you must digitally sign it

898
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:44,160
for example a four is internal

899
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:47,070
it cannot be transmitted outside of the

900
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:50,520
Arrakis government in 85 is top-secret

901
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:52,980
and has to be limited to just senior

902
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:55,370
members of the Arrakis government so now

903
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:59,610
we have our data classification policy

904
00:39:55,370 --> 00:40:02,460
next thing we overlay what's allowed on

905
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:04,710
our data flow map this is a great way

906
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:08,130
that when you talk to your business you

907
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,680
can go through and you can quantify with

908
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,589
them

909
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,808
what our intent when we build out this

910
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:17,078
policy and they can say yes or they can

911
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:18,970
say no the next thing is to go through

912
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:22,000
into building out in whatever

913
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:25,118
documentation you choose this is the

914
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,539
format that works best for me and I had

915
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:31,569
to do this per tool per classification

916
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:34,480
but just through all our various DLP

917
00:40:31,569 --> 00:40:38,558
what we're going to go through and do

918
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,869
with each classification so once again

919
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:44,200
this worked for me you might prefer a

920
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:46,510
different level of actual documentation

921
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,520
but this is something that I can give to

922
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,920
my auditors this is something that I can

923
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,990
use to go through and to implement which

924
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,369
is absolutely huge I'm a big fan of

925
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:59,529
being open and transparent with everyone

926
00:40:56,369 --> 00:41:03,250
so now the fun part how to detect but

927
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:06,700
and bypass any DLP solution so guys

928
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:08,740
let's put on our black hats once you get

929
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:13,839
a shell on a remote system put some of

930
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:15,808
the persons that you look look at you

931
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:19,029
might want to know what my money knows

932
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:22,029
you might want to know where am I so you

933
00:41:19,029 --> 00:41:24,819
might look at your IP config another

934
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:28,059
common technique is what ActiveX

935
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:29,799
controls are on this system so you can

936
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:33,160
take a look at the writing processes

937
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:35,950
very common right all of these DLP

938
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,509
products if they are running on that

939
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:42,520
system they're going to show up when you

940
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:44,859
run those processes so it's just a fact

941
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,900
of life we have to assume a malicious

942
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:49,058
adversary it's going to be able to tell

943
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:52,059
if one of our clients systems are

944
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:54,940
running the DLP now I would assert that

945
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:57,700
a sufficiently advanced adversary should

946
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:00,789
at all times be running trust no one

947
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:04,149
encryption anytime they are acting in

948
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:06,059
the network that is not their own that

949
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:12,789
probably even within their own network

950
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:16,420
but without the help of a device to go

951
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:18,849
through and to break encryption pretty

952
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:20,900
much all DLP is going to fall flat

953
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:24,950
so as long

954
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:28,730
as a malicious adversary can encrypt or

955
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:31,850
even obfuscate the data it's trivial for

956
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:34,490
them to transform even by adding dashes

957
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:36,710
between say a social security or a

958
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:40,370
credit card something that little of

959
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:45,860
transformation is enough to break most

960
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:48,170
all current DLP products likewise the

961
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:52,010
repository scanners they are very

962
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:53,900
susceptible to the actual introduction

963
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:57,790
of any type of cryptography or data

964
00:42:53,900 --> 00:43:00,500
obfuscation now some people might assert

965
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:02,210
great where we'll just go through a

966
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,740
little MTM ourselves we'll break the

967
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:07,100
encryption ourselves but that's also

968
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:10,209
very risky so first off if you are

969
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:14,000
working within certain environments

970
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:17,620
globally you may or may not have the

971
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,630
right to go through into MTM to break

972
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:23,960
encryption on certain protected on

973
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:26,870
traffic such as web traffic it's just a

974
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,370
fact and you'll have to bring in your

975
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:31,549
legal team to see if this is something

976
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:34,819
that you can't do however I have had a

977
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:36,770
friend that has gone through and they

978
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,900
chose to empty them themselves so that

979
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:41,270
they could go through an inspector web

980
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:44,270
track and that's great from a policy

981
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:48,950
enforcement level the challenge came is

982
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:53,630
that they got hit by a very nasty bug

983
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:55,430
because within there the mechanism in

984
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:57,530
which they were emptying themselves

985
00:43:55,430 --> 00:44:01,270
there's a Mis configuration that

986
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:04,340
resulted in the cryptographic standards

987
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:09,170
exiting that locks out to the Internet

988
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:10,820
being a lower value than what would have

989
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:12,110
been if they were not going to go

990
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,630
through an EM team their selves so

991
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:16,190
there's a high cost if you do choose to

992
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,590
break cryptography and we need to make

993
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:20,420
sure that we do it respectfully and in

994
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:23,950
accordance with best practice so that we

995
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:27,230
don't accidentally decrease our security

996
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:30,520
and finally keep in mind

997
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:34,040
DLP incidents they can provide us as

998
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,520
offensive people with a whole lot of

999
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,369
their

1000
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,410
interesting information and I know I'm

1001
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:43,960
wrecking a little bit early I want to

1002
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:43,960
thank you for your time in any questions

1003
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,970
thank you

1004
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:58,979
