1
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,660
okay I think I'm miked up now double

2
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,339
bite good morning everybody

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,529
welcome I'm thrilled to be here this

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,180
morning talk about one of my favorite

5
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:28,910
topics in the world which is mobile

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,320
security now go ahead and get it on the

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:42,830
screen for you so you can actually see

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:43,850
it as well tonight excellent so I'm

9
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,180
going to talk to you a little bit about

10
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:49,970
mobile security this morning

11
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:54,710
and Mobile is kind of a unique area

12
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:57,110
right now in security about 2014-2015 we

13
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,580
noticed that something was happening in

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,979
the mobile space we weren't really sure

15
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,680
what was going on how serious things

16
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:05,929
were what we're at what things were

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,540
actually occurring in that space and we

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,399
kind of fast forward now to 2019 and

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,320
take a look at where we are in this

20
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:14,509
space I'm going to walk through what

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,158
some of these attacks look like with

22
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:19,009
some of the tools that the attackers are

23
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,009
using how serious are these things and

24
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:24,070
then of course what can you do about it

25
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:26,390
so let's define this space a little bit

26
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,538
talking about things that are beyond the

27
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,310
perimeter so as mentioned earlier

28
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:35,270
checkpoint made its name on the firewall

29
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:37,070
space so we did such a good job securing

30
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,630
that actual perimeter that the attackers

31
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,038
have decided to go somewhere else

32
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,140
all right so everybody's got a

33
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:44,179
next-generation firewall everybody's

34
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,999
kind of got the IPS box checks they have

35
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:50,840
a sandbox what we don't have is

36
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:54,229
something protecting these devices right

37
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:57,590
so iPads and your mobile devices my

38
00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:00,109
office consists of this alright so a

39
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,359
pair of air pods and my phone are the

40
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:04,399
two primary things that I use on a daily

41
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:07,609
basis to conduct all of the activities

42
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,149
that I do so I get to have a really fun

43
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:09,769
job

44
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:11,810
fly around the world and talk about

45
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:15,170
mobile security meet with customers and

46
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,120
partners and discuss what's going on in

47
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,290
this space and there's really two things

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,920
that I require

49
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,590
when I get anywhere I need power so I

50
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,750
will plug into just about anything and I

51
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,790
also need Internet to do my job without

52
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,159
that these two things are a hundred

53
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,200
percent useless now I used to be a

54
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,090
little bit of anomaly there was only a

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,369
segment of folks that were really kind

56
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,079
of doing a lot of traveling now we have

57
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,819
these things called teleworkers now

58
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:42,530
we're encouraged to work from home in

59
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:45,339
some cases depending upon your job

60
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,629
function and this is causing a

61
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,329
significant security issue in today's

62
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:53,780
landscape and the reason is that there's

63
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:56,900
not a lot of thought placed into how do

64
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,000
I enable a remote worker right so

65
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,150
normally that meant you had a VPN on

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,980
your laptop and that was it right you

67
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,269
had a VPN back to corporate you now be

68
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,810
act behind the perimeter

69
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:10,879
life is good things are easy well then

70
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,609
we had a bunch of folks that demand that

71
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,959
they absolutely have to have email to do

72
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:19,159
their job on their phones and at first

73
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,920
organizations were like no we can't do

74
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:24,290
that we put up a lot of restrictions we

75
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,790
don't want you to have email eventually

76
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,040
they relented right as these things

77
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,870
called iPhones came out here we go

78
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,910
everybody has now got email on their

79
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,549
device in some way shape or form some

80
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,590
type of access and unfortunately we got

81
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:39,260
there organically right there wasn't a

82
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,940
policy that sat down and said okay what

83
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,530
how do we actually secure the email

84
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,150
that's on this device what emails would

85
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,819
they be receiving what can they actually

86
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,889
do with these things so the policy has

87
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:52,458
lagged significantly behind in the

88
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:58,280
mobile space it's also significantly

89
00:03:52,459 --> 00:04:00,079
easier to attack these devices why most

90
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,629
people have absolutely nothing on their

91
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,790
devices today right so raise your hand

92
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:07,010
if you think you have any security on

93
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:10,790
your mobile device today let's just get

94
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:12,530
a quick view I can count less than ten

95
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,048
in this room maybe a little bit more if

96
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,478
I can't see everybody so think about the

97
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:19,159
population this room and think about how

98
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:20,478
many devices you probably have the

99
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:23,270
average by the way is one and a half

100
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,340
devices per person meaning most folks

101
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,729
are either carrying two phones or a

102
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,568
phone in an iPad so now we have an

103
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:32,490
additional attack surface that's

104
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:35,009
out there in the form of these devices

105
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,379
and lots of times people say I don't

106
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:40,439
really do anything that important on my

107
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:42,659
phone so who really cares well I'm here

108
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,449
to inform you that it's not about who

109
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:47,159
cares it's because they can't write so

110
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:49,860
the old Sir Edmund Hillary why did you

111
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:53,159
climb Mount Everest because it was there

112
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,919
right there's technologic curiosity of

113
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:57,839
what can people do and they have found

114
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,948
that this is a very rich environment for

115
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,719
many things we're going to talk about

116
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:04,050
what are some of the things that these

117
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:06,839
people are actually after so obviously

118
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,419
most of us have corporate email or

119
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,339
organizational email and what I also

120
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:14,818
have one here lots of personal

121
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:17,279
information so unlike your work laptop

122
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,830
this is a pretty rich environment to get

123
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,569
information about you this is a great

124
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,979
way to case somebody and understand

125
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:25,800
what's going on in their lives

126
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:29,610
what applications they use think about

127
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,899
online banking etc we also have kind of

128
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,589
an attitude when we're out of the office

129
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:36,479
I'm just going to get my job done right

130
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:39,119
I'm not necessarily worried about is

131
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,240
that USB that I plugged my phone into at

132
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:44,789
night at the Marriott secure or not all

133
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,860
I care about is I'm getting power right

134
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:49,050
it must be charged for my next day of

135
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,819
work or I will be unproductive so I'm

136
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,709
not thinking about security when I'm

137
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:54,240
plugging into something I'm certainly

138
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:56,969
not thinking about security when I log

139
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,669
into the Marriott network Shirley

140
00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:02,039
Marriott secures this should not be an

141
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:05,159
issue I come to an event like this I

142
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,808
plug into whatever I can get to so I'll

143
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:08,579
faster internet service and make sure

144
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:11,430
that I have power so I'm a lot more

145
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:13,499
carefree in terms of what I do and the

146
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,509
attackers are really focused in on the

147
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:17,069
fact that you're careless outside of the

148
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,639
office kind of all that security

149
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:22,860
training we've been taught look at the

150
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:25,079
URL bar and the Safari browser look at

151
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,399
where the email came from those habits

152
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,439
kind of start to go out the window when

153
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,089
we get to the mobile world because we're

154
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:31,319
moving quickly we're doing these things

155
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,059
in an uber we're doing them in an

156
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,649
airport we're doing about our kids

157
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,909
soccer game you're doing and when you

158
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:38,819
wake up in the morning without your

159
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:41,269
coffee oops what did I click on what am

160
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,269
i doing

161
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,980
so how do these devices actually get

162
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,930
infected a lot of folks want to know how

163
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:52,160
easy it is what are some of the things

164
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,720
that people use to do this so let's take

165
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,420
a look at how devices actually get

166
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,070
infected so there's really three

167
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,560
categories we break it down into number

168
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,630
one would be malicious applications so

169
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,300
yes there are malicious applications on

170
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,850
the Google Play Store in the Apple App

171
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,400
Store unfortunately if you google it you

172
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:13,070
will quickly see how many applications

173
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,049
are removed per year from these stores

174
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,360
that made it through whatever security

175
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,980
checks they have in place in the case of

176
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,740
Google it's actually an automated system

177
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,900
called the bouncer in the case of Apple

178
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,240
they personally review everything that

179
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,219
goes into the App Store unfortunately

180
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,480
this is numbers into the thousands in

181
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,030
the Google Play Store it's actually a

182
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,810
lifetime into the millions of

183
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,429
applications that have been removed from

184
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,830
the store so you can't just assume

185
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,020
anything that's on the actual Google

186
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,240
Play or App Store is actually a good

187
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,700
application and in the case of Android

188
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,080
we'll talk about an example later where

189
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,969
you actually download a good known good

190
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,630
application and it turns into a bad one

191
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:52,010
when you get it on to your device

192
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,630
networks I mentioned I'll connect to

193
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,090
just about anything it's the same

194
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,980
behavior that most people have it's not

195
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,380
uncommon to go to a conference and just

196
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,890
see which Wi-Fi access point is open and

197
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:06,469
you connect to it how do you know if

198
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,849
that's a malicious network or not if you

199
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,710
don't have anything on your device to

200
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:13,130
tell you that it's malicious you have no

201
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,960
idea and then lastly something that we

202
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,670
all kind of have taken for granted for

203
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,159
quite some time especially in the iOS

204
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:22,280
world is that our devices were actually

205
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,910
secure meaning the actual OS meaning

206
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,229
actual Android or actual iOS itself

207
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:29,600
unfortunately this has come to the

208
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,800
forefront in the last year right so the

209
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,150
for those that are familiar with Google

210
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,650
project 0 they actually announced 6

211
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,990
vulnerabilities in iOS where you can

212
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,449
actually have your phone on that

213
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:45,020
nightstand in my hotel and it would be

214
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,820
attacked without me doing anything and

215
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,350
by the way it wouldn't show up and say

216
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
that I was attacked unless I had

217
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,950
something on the device to tell me that

218
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,000
it was attacked so a completely silent

219
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,129
attack taking advantage

220
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,529
of flaws in the actual operating system

221
00:08:56,129 --> 00:09:00,660
so we unfortunately can't count on Apple

222
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:03,019
and Google at least at this point to

223
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,790
provide us a secure platform to do so

224
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:08,750
this is witnessed by Apple actually at

225
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,750
their Worldwide Developers Conference

226
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:14,949
you

227
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:27,380
announcing a bug bounty program so now a

228
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,300
iOS bug or exploit is now a million

229
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,950
dollars right so this is a complete

230
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,199
admission by Apple they need some more

231
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,120
help by the way these aren't malicious

232
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,790
things this is the natural part of IT

233
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,810
this is the natural part of security so

234
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,640
we shouldn't look at these things

235
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,680
negative we should just have an

236
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,649
understanding of what is going on and

237
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,329
what you can do about it so let's take a

238
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:50,450
look it's what some of these tools look

239
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:52,189
like that the attackers actually use so

240
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,250
Google of course is always our friend

241
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,380
and we google what are the top hacking

242
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,410
apps for Android this is the first

243
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,529
result as of last time I googled it this

244
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:06,469
is the top 40 applications to hack your

245
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:09,709
Android device these are all freely

246
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,450
downloadable open source material that

247
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,160
allows you to do all kinds of

248
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,500
interesting things to devices you also

249
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,110
know if you read through the text that

250
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,209
this is not routing the device so

251
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,760
routing is actually taking over the

252
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:24,800
entire device basically at ring zero for

253
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,750
those geeks in the audience this is

254
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,520
things that you can do without actually

255
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,260
routing the device so this is actually

256
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,560
very interesting and something that's

257
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,779
freely available with a quick google we

258
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,680
also have cables that have entered the

259
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:41,000
market place so this is an OMG cable for

260
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,260
those in the back you can see it on the

261
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,750
screen here and see what the interface

262
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,300
looks like there's a gentleman that has

263
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:51,579
come up with a very clever way of hiding

264
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,870
a Wi-Fi transmitter in this cable so

265
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:57,890
let's say you go to Starbucks and you

266
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:59,770
lost your power cable and you walk over

267
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:03,620
to the table and it's your lucky day

268
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:06,020
somebody left a power cable for you how

269
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,430
nice of them well what they don't know

270
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,740
is potentially somebody's sitting there

271
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,109
with that interface ready to upload a

272
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,740
payload to their device right so very

273
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,279
very clever

274
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:18,740
very simple very real life I myself have

275
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:24,189
found many a cable and charger in my

276
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:27,110
travels now this is a pretty busy slide

277
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:30,260
but what it is is it's an interface to

278
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:32,390
something we call a pineapple device the

279
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,170
pineapple device looks like this this

280
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,730
little guy

281
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,620
I can pass

282
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,829
or somebody can come up to me afterwards

283
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,449
you simply plug this into your laptop

284
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:42,859
while you're sitting at Starbucks or Tim

285
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:46,880
Hortons or wherever you are in the world

286
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:49,480
and I can spin up my own SSID my own

287
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,220
Wi-Fi network my own access point and

288
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,500
simply usually I'll just name it is

289
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,990
close to the existing access point as I

290
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,820
can and see who will actually jump on it

291
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,100
right so sometimes in conferences we

292
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,510
play tricks and pop these up and then we

293
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,820
put your name on the screen your lucky

294
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:07,519
day I'm not doing that today but you

295
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,959
always will see in the room somewhere

296
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,750
around the third of the room usually

297
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,790
plugs into this device now you can see

298
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,910
it I have a menu of items of things that

299
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:19,459
I can do here from this device it's

300
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,779
pathetically easy I'm a sales guy and I

301
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:25,729
actually understand how to use this

302
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:28,189
thing this costs $100 right so very very

303
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,660
easy very very simple our Incident

304
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,300
Response Team a checkpoint actually

305
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,149
estimates that hackers doing this type

306
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,339
of quote-unquote low-level activity can

307
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:40,100
make somewhere between 75 and 100 grand

308
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,990
a year so think about the fact that you

309
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,630
have to do absolutely nothing but go to

310
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,899
a public place and spin up an access

311
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:50,209
point and you're in business

312
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:52,790
very very simple very easy this isn't

313
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:57,500
high tech right this is very simple very

314
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:59,510
easy to do so let's talk about somebody

315
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,730
it's a little bit more sophisticated so

316
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,730
on the screen there you see a trunk of a

317
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,970
car and this is actually a rental car

318
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:10,639
and was rented by four GRU Russian

319
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:15,019
agents and they got caught in The Hague

320
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,870
outside of opcw's OPCW is basically a

321
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:20,089
regulatory body to not allow chemical

322
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,920
weapons to proliferate and if you look

323
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:23,990
back in your history books in last year

324
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,779
or two chemical weapons were a pretty

325
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,490
big issue in Syria Russians were

326
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:30,290
interested of what was going on at this

327
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,000
organization so they parked this rental

328
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:34,339
car where their agents outside of that

329
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,930
building and they proceeded to use their

330
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:38,300
tools so one of them is a more

331
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:41,329
sophisticated Wi-Fi antenna or pineapple

332
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,769
and one of them is actually for cellular

333
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:45,500
calls so that's called a sting ray

334
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:48,079
device or an IMSI device they're about

335
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,790
the size of a small suitcase it cost

336
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,160
about 15

337
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,920
hundred bucks and that allows me to set

338
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,719
up my own cell tower in this room which

339
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,729
is highly illegal by the way but I can

340
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,260
set up a cell tower my room and I can

341
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,390
have your phone because it's already

342
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,910
pre-programmed to go to the strongest

343
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:06,730
signal come to my tower instead of the

344
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,500
tower outside this allows me to read

345
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,110
your text messages listen to your phone

346
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,850
calls look at your call logs on and on

347
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,760
and on write complete and full

348
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,950
understanding of what's going on so you

349
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,660
can see these are not sophisticated

350
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:24,610
operations the technology is available

351
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:26,620
and it's very easy to do so let's take a

352
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,450
look at some of the common attack

353
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,940
surfaces and what those vectors look

354
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:33,250
like across there so it's a fairly busy

355
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,710
slide but hang with me what I'm

356
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,420
illustrating here is simply that the

357
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,040
same problem you have on your laptop

358
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,140
computers the same problem you have as

359
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,760
you're on your phone is the same problem

360
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,710
you have with these ubiquitous cloud

361
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,250
applications right so everybody's using

362
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:51,670
SAS these days o 365 being the biggest a

363
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,710
Gmail box Dropbox Salesforce all other

364
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,870
very good examples of these they all

365
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,790
have the same attack vectors all right

366
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,370
so you can still be a tag via phishing

367
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,530
via email

368
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,820
connecting to malicious networks so

369
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,410
everybody's got something on their

370
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,850
endpoint but they don't have something

371
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,640
on their mobile devices and the attack

372
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,610
surfaces are the same now what are they

373
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:15,220
really after they're really looking for

374
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:17,890
account takeovers right so somewhere

375
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,980
between 70 and 80 percent of all cyber

376
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,260
attacks are based on an account takeover

377
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,000
so how do they get that actual account

378
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,670
how do they get that information becomes

379
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,800
the key question they're looking for

380
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,569
accounts one of the ways they can do

381
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,170
that is obviously with your mobile

382
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:39,070
devices so what's at stake when they

383
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:41,560
actually do attack your device right so

384
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,810
number one and number one and number one

385
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,270
based on our research right now is

386
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,339
credentials so everybody in this room

387
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,829
knows that credential reuse is a big

388
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:54,340
problem that simply means that your

389
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:56,470
corporate or organizational ad happens

390
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,350
to also be the same as say a Facebook

391
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,180
account or a bank account we all know

392
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,610
who we are nobody in this room is the

393
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,040
security

394
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,570
would have duplicate passwords and

395
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,000
credentials for sure but we all know

396
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,950
somebody outside of this room that uses

397
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,230
the same username and password for every

398
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,089
site that they go to if it happens to

399
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,490
match something at your corporation or

400
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:18,410
organization that's a really big problem

401
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,450
because as soon as I steal your banking

402
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,910
password I now have your ad password

403
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:27,769
o365 and I can do all kinds of fun

404
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:29,510
things with that email obviously a huge

405
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:30,829
vector who wouldn't like to be able to

406
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,319
read somebody else's email this is

407
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:36,050
extremely valuable when you're actually

408
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,850
casing an organization knowing and

409
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,829
understanding the cadence who approves

410
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,930
what right being able to read through

411
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:43,849
email chains of important people provide

412
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,920
you a tremendous amount of email and I

413
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,600
think there's many corporate executives

414
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,880
have learned to stop writing things down

415
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,560
because otherwise guess what it's a

416
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,339
discovery and it's in the court system

417
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:58,550
pretty quickly and then lastly is more

418
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:00,649
of a little bit of James Bond but almost

419
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,449
all of the malware that we examine and

420
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:03,890
take a look at in the mobile world are

421
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,900
taking advantage of things like the

422
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,480
camera taking advantage of things like

423
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,329
the GPS so imagine if I knew where you

424
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,370
were at every second because of the

425
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,889
device in your pocket that's a pretty

426
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:17,270
powerful thing I'll be honest you don't

427
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,179
see it as much in the corporate world

428
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:22,970
although in specific targeted attacks

429
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:24,709
you do see executives that are targeted

430
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,089
with this specifically if they're going

431
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:30,309
to countries that are maybe not as

432
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:32,720
friendly to the United States as others

433
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:34,220
so let's take a look at one of these

434
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,750
attacks actually looks like so we're

435
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,440
gonna kind of walk through one number

436
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:41,840
one James walks in to say Starbucks

437
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,400
I've connect to a malicious Network I

438
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,918
thought it was a Starbucks Network it

439
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,870
looked exactly like the Starbucks site

440
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,270
when I signed in by the way I can clone

441
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,520
it in 13 seconds to have an exact

442
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:55,220
replica of the Starbucks site just my

443
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,620
own URL that I just created as an

444
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,380
attacker and what I'm going to simply do

445
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:03,580
is I'm going to trick them to download

446
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:06,860
the Starbucks app so I put out a little

447
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,990
cardboard with a QR code or I take a QR

448
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:12,050
sticker and put it on there so that you

449
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:13,940
can get your Starbucks stars or Chipotle

450
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,040
rewards or whatever insert your favorite

451
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,280
food

452
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,960
I trick them to downloading the app now

453
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,668
I have the ability to do a

454
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,370
man-in-the-middle attack so they're

455
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:27,400
logging into a legitimate office 365

456
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,770
site they put in their credentials on

457
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,929
the left hand side is the command and

458
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:36,040
control of the attacker you see quickly

459
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:38,799
I grab their credentials pretty simple

460
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,659
pretty easy you also know at the top and

461
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,150
green there's many other things that I

462
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,950
can do with this right so just because

463
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,390
I'm only stealing credentials here does

464
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,850
not mean I couldn't have done other

465
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,669
things associated with this so now I

466
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,209
have their credentials and what am I

467
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:55,270
going to do

468
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,820
I'm gonna do an account takeover and by

469
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,470
the way I have automated software that

470
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,809
will allow me to do credential stuffing

471
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,600
on all of the sass known-good SAS

472
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,580
applications that are out there so I'm

473
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,250
going to try your credentials hundreds

474
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:11,428
or thousands of times and every site I

475
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,870
can think of to see if I can get ahead

476
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:15,400
again outside of this room there are

477
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,439
many people that use the same username

478
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,080
and password so now I have access to

479
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,570
your corporate enterprise Dropbox to

480
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,159
your box to Salesforce think about the

481
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,809
damage that can be done very quickly by

482
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,990
just having those credentials and doing

483
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:30,210
it in an automated fashion let's take a

484
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,250
look at another attack

485
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,799
so most attacks today are actually

486
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,020
starting still with phishing so

487
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,910
somewhere between 80 and 90% depending

488
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,889
upon whose statistics you believe or use

489
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,270
they're starting with phishing attacks

490
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,640
phishing attacks are simple they're

491
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:48,190
either through email or they're through

492
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,320
messaging today what does everybody be

493
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,000
their messaging on generally your mobile

494
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,070
device alright so we're going to take a

495
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,890
look at an email attack here we're gonna

496
00:19:54,070 --> 00:20:00,220
send a phishing the email out again I'm

497
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:03,309
going to grab the normal a 365 phishing

498
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,559
America's password reset email and I'm

499
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:09,970
going to go ahead and craft it to send

500
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:12,280
it the link to grab their credentials so

501
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:15,580
looks like a normal email you click here

502
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:18,490
put your password in you'll notice

503
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,860
obviously it in red that that is not the

504
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,419
office 365 login site I just created

505
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,840
that site moments ago the average

506
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:29,080
phishing URL is only around for about a

507
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,830
minute right so in the old days we

508
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,870
to stop things with reputation and black

509
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,340
holes and IP addresses and all those

510
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:38,169
kind of fun things that stuff's all out

511
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,419
the window now right it's ineffective

512
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,370
because it actually won't eat this one

513
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,170
exists after I steal somebody spirituals

514
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:48,340
I'll actually pull it down therefore I

515
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:51,300
have no reputation so I put the

516
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:54,159
credentials in now I grab the account

517
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,720
what do I do I do a little

518
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,450
reconnaissance because I'm reading every

519
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,980
email that's coming in and I'm gonna go

520
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:04,810
ahead and send an email out to the CFO

521
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:07,480
and say hey send me some money now many

522
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,919
people think oh well we would catch it

523
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,450
you know it's probably gonna be a big

524
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,270
enough amount we would catch it in our

525
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:15,250
purchasing process whatever everybody

526
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,810
has limits to what they're able to

527
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,870
authorize whether or not be able to

528
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:21,429
authorize so many of these attacks could

529
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,989
be for as little as three thousand

530
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,880
dollars that are below somebody's

531
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,250
authorization limit in fact evident

532
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,520
example of a medical device company in

533
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:34,650
Virginia where 13 assistants were hit

534
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:38,050
for $5,000 each for Amazon gift cards so

535
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:40,120
quick account takeover figured out who

536
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:42,879
all the assistants were and said hey we

537
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,379
want to reward Johnny for good deed give

538
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,910
him a couple thousand dollars or a

539
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,220
thousand dollars or five hundred dollars

540
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,830
you know different denominations and

541
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,020
gift cards so the attacker walked away

542
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,389
with some good math and some good money

543
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:58,270
well below the radar this isn't stopping

544
00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:00,220
any organization does the FBI or police

545
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,770
care sure they care if they don't have

546
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,870
time to work on something like this so

547
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:08,470
you're completely unprotected if you

548
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:10,449
don't have something in place so

549
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,910
obviously game over right and these

550
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,290
attacks are on and on and on the only

551
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,310
ones that make the headlines are the

552
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,530
ones that have the big dollars

553
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,270
associated with it but remember if I'm

554
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,270
sitting in my basement or sitting at my

555
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:24,750
local Starbucks how you make 5 or 10

556
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,860
grand a day that's a pretty good living

557
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,390
so that's the answer to why are they

558
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,370
going to attack you because they can

559
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,660
they can make a living off of doing this

560
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,340
they don't care if you're the most

561
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,990
important person or at least important

562
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,449
person if they can utilize your

563
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:40,800
information to get to somebody else or

564
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,800
your organization they will

565
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,199
so a lot of spaghetti on the screen I

566
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,120
only walk through a few different

567
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,340
scenarios of how this can actually occur

568
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,469
from a practical standpoint but the

569
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,299
answer is there are literally hundreds

570
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,970
of different ways and combinations that

571
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:58,850
can be done to attack you in this space

572
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,889
again why are they attacking there you

573
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:04,549
don't have any security on your device

574
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:06,379
you're an easy target so let's take a

575
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:10,690
breakdown of what the threat landscape

576
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:14,539
looks like so you'll see that global

577
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:15,649
about 30% of the attacks are mobile all

578
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:17,299
right so here talk about one third of

579
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:19,969
the market that's essentially being a

580
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:22,429
Nord right now we take a look at the

581
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,860
Americas it's a little bit more I mean a

582
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:26,779
pack a little less but you notice it's

583
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,189
very consistent the problem here that's

584
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:29,990
here is the same in the rest of the

585
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,509
world so we have a tendency sometimes

586
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:35,059
the United States to think oh we're

587
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:36,559
pretty good we're pretty safe well the

588
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:38,119
statistics don't actually bear that out

589
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,100
in fact actually we're little worse

590
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:44,840
we're actually one of the biggest

591
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,740
countries that does the attacking so

592
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,779
it's a little bit of a break down

593
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,519
between what is actual mobile malware

594
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:52,159
how bad is it what do these things

595
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,539
actually look like so you'll see the

596
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,179
biggest piece of the pie is something

597
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:58,789
called ruff adware okay and ruff adware

598
00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:01,129
is simply the hijacking of an ad network

599
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:03,769
so for those of us that play candy crush

600
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:05,748
or words with friends you have all those

601
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:08,840
ads that kind of pop up at the bottom

602
00:24:05,749 --> 00:24:13,460
the attackers just simply take over that

603
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:15,320
mechanism and display their ads so all

604
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,940
of the money anytime anybody would click

605
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,799
on that would now go to the attacker in

606
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,570
fact the attackers and ruff ad networks

607
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,940
typically will put in something that's

608
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,730
called a clicker which will continually

609
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,950
in the background click on that ad you

610
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:31,070
have no idea it's occurring they're

611
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,389
generating revenue now is this the worst

612
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,529
thing in the world that's out there is

613
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:34,719
it the scariest thing in the world

614
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:37,220
absolutely not

615
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,749
but do you really feel comfortable

616
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:43,129
generating money for an attacker where's

617
00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:44,570
that money going what else are they

618
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:46,428
going to do if they have the capability

619
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,200
of taking over an ad network on your

620
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:50,149
device what else can they do the answer

621
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,289
is they can do a whole bunch but right

622
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:52,610
now they don't need to because you're

623
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,890
not even stopping them from doing this

624
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:57,199
so they're making money by hardly

625
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,950
lifting a finger there's other things

626
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,990
out here

627
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:04,370
generic malware is just simply a

628
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:07,280
standard malware no no outstanding

629
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:10,959
feature to it and you move down to em

630
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:14,710
rat that's a mobile remote access tool

631
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,540
droppers that's the ability to leave

632
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:18,200
malware on your device at any time right

633
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,260
so there

634
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,270
seeding if you will devices for those

635
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,520
that are familiar with botnets we're

636
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:27,860
familiar with the dropper concept and

637
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,629
you also you see banker in phishing apps

638
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,120
and you also see a little sliver there

639
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,130
for ransomware this is probably the next

640
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,659
big vector that's out there imagine if

641
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,250
you're able to lock out you know 12

642
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:41,120
billion people from their cellphones how

643
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:42,920
much they'll pay to get to them so let's

644
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,379
take a look at what some of this malware

645
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,660
looks like we'll break it down this is

646
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,890
one called Agent Smith I think probably

647
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,200
everybody this room is familiar with

648
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,090
Agent Smith from the matrix

649
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,400
he had the incredible ability to

650
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:58,820
continue to multiply so in this

651
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:03,230
particular case infected over 25 million

652
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:05,689
devices 2.8 billion infections of this

653
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,010
so traces of this were found in

654
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,490
different places this is an Android

655
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:12,230
attack it was very simple you would

656
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,180
trick somebody to download a malicious

657
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:16,120
application right so call it something

658
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,130
fun something funny video of the day

659
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,419
application they download that I think

660
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,100
that's unique about this is it would

661
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,530
actually move laterally on your phone

662
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,570
and start to look at all the apps you

663
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:28,879
had on your phone and then it would

664
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:32,210
download a malicious version of that app

665
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,880
and delete the genome good app so you

666
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:37,760
thought you had good apps on your device

667
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,550
but Agent Smith actually converted those

668
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,680
good apps to Bad apps and then they were

669
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:47,600
able to do in this case Ralph's ad

670
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:49,910
networks so we'll talk a little bit

671
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,490
about Anubis banker so obviously they're

672
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:55,640
always after dollars a banker is simply

673
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:58,730
a malware that is targeting bank

674
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,110
applications so in this case the nubes

675
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:03,650
is one that's been around since about

676
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:05,810
2014 2015 it's actually morphed several

677
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,830
times for those in the banking world you

678
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:10,549
may remember something called Zeus

679
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:13,620
was probably the most famous banking

680
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:16,049
credential stealer on the PC and Mac and

681
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,149
in this case they were able to actually

682
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:20,760
take into account something called

683
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:22,469
Android layers so Android layers is a

684
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,169
native functionality and Android which

685
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,779
allows you to paint over what's on your

686
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:30,120
screen so what they do is I actually

687
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:32,399
paint over the actual credential login

688
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,500
to your bank and you log in to your

689
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,408
credentials and generally what happens

690
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,850
is your credentials disappear I think

691
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:41,100
every one of us has experience hey I

692
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,500
just put my username and password in and

693
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,059
it didn't take well if you are not in

694
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,370
the Android device that could be

695
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:51,779
assigned to you that you were just

696
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:53,399
attacked because they allow that screen

697
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:55,919
to grab the credentials and they move on

698
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:57,418
to the next what's scary about this has

699
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,710
become a family and you see at the

700
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:01,350
bottom there they've actually just now

701
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,549
added a ransomware module as well so not

702
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,110
only are they going to steal your

703
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:07,940
banking information they're also going

704
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:10,289
to encrypt your phone with Anubis crip

705
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,539
cryptocurrency so obviously with the

706
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:14,940
spike in cryptocurrency maybe it spike

707
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:16,799
again in cryptocurrency who knows became

708
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:20,070
very popular to have applications to

709
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,980
manage your wallet this particular guy

710
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:25,139
actually stole the credentials this was

711
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,059
not the attack that was used most

712
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:28,769
recently but there was something like

713
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:30,029
this that the gentleman actually lost

714
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:32,789
twenty four million dollars in

715
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:37,169
cryptocurrency rather than attack just

716
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:38,879
as this now let's move into the James

717
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:41,309
Bond worlds this is where the real

718
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,039
excitement is from a mobile security

719
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:46,559
standpoint and the capabilities so

720
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:49,230
you've probably read some articles where

721
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,700
if you land in certain cities in China

722
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,380
they'll actually ask you to download an

723
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,149
application

724
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:57,120
essentially it's spyware and they track

725
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:58,889
your communication in your location they

726
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,510
also have things such as watering hole

727
00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:02,399
attacks where they try to redirect you

728
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:05,179
to a particular site and attack your

729
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:07,739
phone and this is becoming a pretty

730
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:09,870
hot-button topic for most of the world

731
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,820
from a human rights standpoint there are

732
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,500
many many many countries that are now

733
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,689
monitoring their citizens via mobile

734
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,520
devices when I walk through a few of

735
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:21,149
those examples so one of the most

736
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,600
well-known is a gentleman the UAE was

737
00:29:21,149 --> 00:29:24,389
very

738
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,030
spoken against this government and they

739
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:29,370
actually sent him this text message here

740
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,049
for him to click on it if he were to

741
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,178
click on that he would be infected by

742
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:35,280
something called Pegasus Pegasus is one

743
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,960
of the many names for this everybody

744
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,850
every research company has to have their

745
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,820
own name so it becomes who's the most

746
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:43,020
popular who gets it out first market and

747
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,629
what this would do would actually take

748
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:48,690
advantage of 3 iOS boner abilities so on

749
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:50,880
your Apple device one click and now I

750
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:53,280
completely own the phone so now I have

751
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,159
this gentleman's text messages call logs

752
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:59,090
web browsing history all of his email

753
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,919
what he's doing 24 hours a day

754
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,120
unfortunately this led to the gentleman

755
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,210
actually being jailed he certainly

756
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,590
currently still in jail as a result of

757
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:10,860
his government's monitoring of his

758
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:15,178
devices this has become extremely common

759
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:17,219
practice so how common practice so

760
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:18,960
Citizen Watch is a humans rights group

761
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,400
that kind of started to track this

762
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,140
information in fact the gentleman that

763
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,870
would receive that link actually sent

764
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,220
this information to citizen watch and

765
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,260
what you're seeing on the screen here is

766
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,900
where they've actually detected Pegasus

767
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:33,510
and portions of Pegasus and you'll see

768
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,250
the good old USA is listed there as well

769
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,450
you also see that the Middle Eastern

770
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,880
countries are very fond of this

771
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,370
technology now to break it down a little

772
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,190
bit further they believe that there's

773
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:46,739
over 36 likely operators of Pegasus

774
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:48,539
so Pegasus was developed depending upon

775
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,460
who you talk to by somebody called the

776
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:53,429
NSO group the NSO group is actually

777
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:56,549
based in Israel and they sell this

778
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:58,409
technology to foreign governments right

779
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:59,610
in there on 60 minutes and Google them

780
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:01,770
you can find all kinds of information

781
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,689
about the NSO group it is perfectly

782
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,120
legal it may not be moral but that's

783
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,860
another discussion for another day and

784
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:11,489
what they do is they're now tracking

785
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:16,949
citizens or important people across the

786
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:18,570
world so this is happening Pegasus is

787
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,150
completely undetectable unless you have

788
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,649
something on your device so if you are a

789
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,780
person of interest you should be

790
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,940
concerned about Pegasus in fact I think

791
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:29,129
most people know who L chop-o is the

792
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,820
most famous Mexican drug cartel leader

793
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:35,050
this is how they actually got El Chapo

794
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:37,280
this is what got Jeff Bezos

795
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:39,590
Jamal khashoggi The Washington Post

796
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,530
reporter that was dismembered in a Saudi

797
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:47,240
embassy so these are very serious

798
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:49,220
consequences to mobile security now

799
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,760
recently there is an update to the

800
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:55,940
Pegasus attacks I mentioned the Google

801
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,100
project zero team so this was sending a

802
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,020
call from whatsapp to your device you

803
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,850
didn't have to answer it or even see it

804
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,650
and it would on your device it took

805
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:06,050
advantage of that iOS hole that I spoke

806
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:08,300
about earlier so what I want you to

807
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:10,970
understand is that this is evolving and

808
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:14,090
it's evolving very quickly and as a

809
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:17,060
result of the NSA tools breach its

810
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:21,800
accelerated its accelerated so folks

811
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:24,139
that have next to no dollars now have a

812
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,850
very low barrier entry to do these types

813
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,370
of things and if you have a lot of

814
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:30,949
dollars you can do things like the NSO

815
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:32,689
group and Pegasus right so it does it's

816
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,670
not a very big leap to see that

817
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:37,430
eventually this technology will be in

818
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:38,720
almost everybody's hands so this is why

819
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:42,740
you need to be vigilant with your

820
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,870
devices so what we know is traditional

821
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,490
protections are not sufficient right so

822
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,870
your standard antivirus if you were to

823
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,440
load that onto your phone or a version

824
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:52,699
thereof is only gonna catch about half

825
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,040
so you're missing half of the attack

826
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,930
surface that's out there we have these

827
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,090
things called polymorphic attacks which

828
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:01,400
are simply just context-aware attacks it

829
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,020
knows what it's attacking so let's say

830
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,690
it's going into a sandbox or an

831
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:07,760
application sandbox it knows it's in

832
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,500
that sandbox so therefore it won't do

833
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,230
something it might decide to detonate in

834
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,060
ten minutes versus a four minutes it may

835
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,560
just decide it one needs to change into

836
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,389
a different file format that that

837
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,030
particular vendor sandbox does not

838
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:22,250
recognize so polymorphic attacks are

839
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:24,320
something that's on the rise and you'll

840
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:27,380
also see obviously campaign based

841
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,360
attacks so many folks will say well I

842
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,830
really need to worry about this portion

843
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,459
of my security or that portion of my

844
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,260
security

845
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,180
well the attackers have recognized that

846
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,740
and automated that they may start with a

847
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,420
mobile device and move to your network

848
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,190
they may start with your network and go

849
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,470
to a mobile device so they put

850
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:45,860
particular campaigns together with these

851
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:47,240
elements that will push you in the wrong

852
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,770
direction and something that you need to

853
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,440
pay attention to you can

854
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:54,500
and security only pay attention to this

855
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,240
right you have to understand the

856
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,540
complete threat landscape and how do you

857
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,760
reduce your overall attack surface so we

858
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,680
talks specifically about phishing

859
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,110
attacks whaling attacks are just simply

860
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:09,050
a bigger target right so small fish big

861
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:12,949
whale these are extremely extremely

862
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:14,450
prevalent in the mobile world so let's

863
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:16,250
talk about what we can do about it right

864
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:17,750
so we're going to talk in the generic I

865
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,649
do work for checkpoint software but

866
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,510
we're not going to talk about my

867
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:22,159
solutions we're just going to talk about

868
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:24,380
some of the building blocks that are out

869
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,780
there so one of the first on the scene

870
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,390
was mobile device management I would say

871
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,399
99% of the people that bought it bought

872
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:34,129
it to actually just wipe devices if you

873
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:36,049
lost it how multiple device management

874
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:38,149
is actually much more powerful does many

875
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:40,250
more things but it actually takes

876
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:43,130
political will for you to exert that on

877
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:47,210
your end-users so as companies went from

878
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:51,140
corporate owned devices to BYOD or will

879
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:53,570
be an alcohol cope this didn't work

880
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:56,629
right because people weren't willing to

881
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:58,300
put your software on my phone let's face

882
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:00,500
it we call it my phone whether at the

883
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,040
corporation issues it or I bought it

884
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,290
myself

885
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,320
it's my phone so you're gonna tell me

886
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:08,570
what to do with my device so for

887
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,280
corporate owned I would say absolutely

888
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,710
you should have mobile device management

889
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,050
you have the right to control what

890
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:17,450
happens on that device if you own it if

891
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:19,640
not you may want to look at something

892
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:21,830
like a secure container the secure

893
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,170
container is not a complete solution but

894
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,910
it is offered by most mobile device

895
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,550
management companies which will allow

896
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,950
you to separate personal and work right

897
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:33,380
so provides a secure container for all

898
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:36,680
of your work documents all of your email

899
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:39,770
your calendar contacts etc again this

900
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,839
isn't a complete approach because if I

901
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,970
own the device meaning if I jailbreak or

902
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,440
root the device I can actually get into

903
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,660
the secure container it's actually

904
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,110
trivial for all vendors to walk through

905
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:53,660
again a quick google will prove me right

906
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:56,150
so what else do you need you need some

907
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,440
security telemetry to work with the

908
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,480
containers and the mobile device

909
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,370
management need something on the device

910
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,850
saying this isn't a good security state

911
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:04,670
or

912
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:06,589
security state right utilizing multiple

913
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:08,390
engines to understand what's occurring

914
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:10,610
on the device how it's occurring say

915
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:12,170
it's interacting with the network you're

916
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:14,090
connecting to and ensuring that that's a

917
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,890
proper network looking at the

918
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,600
applications on your device making sure

919
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,640
that they're there proper applications

920
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,020
associated with it making sure you're at

921
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,720
the appropriate patch level for your

922
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:25,370
phone right iOS users do a pretty good

923
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,500
job of updating they turn on the auto

924
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:29,930
updates and the Android world it's not

925
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,090
that they don't want to do it most of

926
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:34,399
them do want to do it but in a lot of

927
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:36,560
cases the carriers have to have the

928
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,990
actual upgrade available for their

929
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,850
actual end-users to do it so if they're

930
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:43,040
stuck at a particular version with known

931
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:44,839
vulnerabilities that's a big problem

932
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,520
right so you need to try to understand

933
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,170
that and you need to have something that

934
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,759
will actually mitigate that so for those

935
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,440
that were in the network security world

936
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,970
for a long time it's kind of what you

937
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,680
would call virtual patching right so

938
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,879
what you would do with your IPS you

939
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,399
didn't want to make that Microsoft

940
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,350
update but at least you turn on the IPS

941
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,020
to block that particular vulnerability

942
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:04,670
that was coming through so let's talk

943
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,230
about how to actually implement again I

944
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,490
apologize very busy slide but I

945
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,980
understand all this content will be

946
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:12,080
available to you what we're looking at

947
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,430
is how to actually roll out mobile

948
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,870
threat detection and this is from

949
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:17,299
Gartner they actually published their

950
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:20,180
latest report on mobile threat detection

951
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,500
yesterday this is directly from that and

952
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,540
basically you have four different ways

953
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,070
to put things out there from a mobile

954
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,950
security standpoint one is to integrate

955
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:30,470
with a uem right so for those aren't

956
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:33,859
familiar with the term unified endpoint

957
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:35,600
management this gives you the ability to

958
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,830
interact with mobile threat detection so

959
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,380
maybe if your mobile threat detection

960
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:40,970
says the device is compromised

961
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,740
maybe you shut down access to a

962
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:44,359
particular application on the network or

963
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,470
maybe you shut down email so for

964
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,780
instance if my device becomes

965
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:50,209
compromised I no longer have access to

966
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:53,570
my secure container right so giving

967
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:55,430
myself some risk mitigation you also of

968
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:58,880
course could roll out just mobile threat

969
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:00,950
detection without a uem so for cope in

970
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,500
BYOD environments this is a popular

971
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:05,299
choice we also have something we haven't

972
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,390
talked about but you have the ability to

973
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:10,010
actually bake in this technology via SDK

974
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:11,779
to the applications that are developed

975
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:13,880
so let's just say for instance your

976
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,920
Wells Fargo Bank and you want to make

977
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,690
sure that when that

978
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,240
application is interacting back with a

979
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:21,280
bank that it's in a secure state would

980
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,200
you like a jailbroken or rooted device

981
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,740
to interact with your corporate servers

982
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,808
I think the answer is probably no you

983
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:32,049
might put something up that says call

984
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:34,240
customer service or maybe you can't use

985
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:36,720
it today so you can actually bake the

986
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,569
security into the application itself

987
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:43,180
and lastly proxy based so this is the

988
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:45,460
old VPN this has really kind of become
