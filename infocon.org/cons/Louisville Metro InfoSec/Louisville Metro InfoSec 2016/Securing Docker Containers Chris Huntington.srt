1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,940
thank you everybody

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,740
literally destroy years will be able to
hear yes I spent 10 years in a metal

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,109
band with my foot on a nap so final hear
you in the back just Chuck something at

4
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:32,910
me please no samsung ye will talk about
will talk about container fires here but

5
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,218
we don't overlook one of those going on
but if you guys it's a small group and I

6
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,219
you guys want to keep it interactive if
you have a question

7
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,129
speak up throw something at any rate
plan whatever it is i'll stop we will

8
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,500
talk through whatever whatever it is you
want but an intro on this one is this is

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,600
a doctor security talk now I've heard
several people in here actually do dr.

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,549
containers for living room grimaces that
price of that so is that a that breeze

11
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,180
hands i'm going to get to work with dr.
day today there's one

12
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,369
alright so this is not going to be a
real technical deep-dive the actual

13
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,570
doctor auditing or anything like that
there's much better people when tools

14
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,679
out there what we're going to talk about
is a security program that I don't for

15
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,990
customer that wanted to talk about
hardware grab the controls around dr.

16
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,030
how do i integrate my security team with
the dev ops team is trying to move

17
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,829
faster and that's trying to be gradual
my security guys can put up barricades

18
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,839
right so what we did is we kind of don't
into dr. side whether or not we're ready

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,479
for dr. and then wrap the program around
that dr. security presence so that we

20
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,509
had a good way of building out from
there

21
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:57,210
um so from that perspective who am i
right guy up you're talking my name's

22
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,149
Chris huntington on the chief
information security officer for a

23
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,690
company called exigent important talking
I did technology

24
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:11,230
enthusiasm for universal 2004 work swing
in really really old firewalls and doing

25
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,060
work for the state of Illinois and a few
other places up in the Chicago area then

26
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,310
move down this list and a few years ago
i'm very certification one of those

27
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:27,220
matter nobody really cares about sure
but you know just recently census which

28
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,440
means I now absolutely no nothing and
starter so happy my twitter post you'll

29
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,210
find mostly about cigars but that's a
that's going to be in a nutshell on a

30
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,830
built-in exigent for just over a year
now doing a lot of security consulting

31
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:47,800
and building a few programs too early to
deal with fishing to deal with some rice

32
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,230
and retention and log management so what
is dr. that's what we're really here to

33
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,399
talk about right

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,050
this is my favorite infographic ever and
I calling demographic supposed to mean

35
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,850
it's actually think it is this is the
shipping shipping shipping ships right

36
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:11,200
but and when you when you talk about dr.
right all year but I wish it right and

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,488
what do you ship it right well your
shipping containers right and what your

38
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:21,730
shipping in those containers is a
rebuilt environment right that has your

39
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,369
application in a in a portable container
right we used to talk about $TIME p.m.

40
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,020
and that we would deploy newbie energy
trying to deploy a new iteration right

41
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:38,590
but are slow p.m. too cumbersome the end
required hardening the engines require a

42
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,430
lot of different processes and a lot of
different things to move that between

43
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,660
environments right dr. illuminates a lot
of those things because it doesn't have

44
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,820
an operating system does but it's shared
operating system it doesn't have a lot

45
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,489
of the lobby encumbrances of a of a
traditional vm or traditional server

46
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:58,420
environment

47
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,730
okay so I got a little slide out here i
will read the quote out cable people put

48
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,780
a quarter in the word and then just
stand here read it on but really it's

49
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,340
it's a flexibility cool right and it's
built for scalability

50
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,540
right and portability scale Melanie
above the ends because you can actually

51
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,970
move not containers across multiple
physical host pretty cool not something

52
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,680
you can do really easily with a vm
architecture it allows for are very good

53
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,130
communication and collaboration among
the top schemes

54
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:37,219
alright so what we do is opposed to the
shipping code right building code every

55
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,740
time uShip doing you environment but we
usually build a container in-depth right

56
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,150
we install our prereqs in the container
that we have and we take that container

57
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,880
dev QA reduction in that container
persist throughout the entire lifespan

58
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,880
of that iteration of the software so is
opposed to having to build packages were

59
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,390
building containers right where we're
spending less time following code

60
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:08,780
spending less time provisioning beyond
spending less time hardening the end and

61
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,770
we know what's out there every time the
shipping container that makes sense

62
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,240
right

63
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,740
why don't you faster be good all right
thing about disability is that is very

64
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,450
very very fast

65
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:29,300
that's why dev ops teams but it right
but because of that you can actually get

66
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,870
into one where you move a little too
fast and that's one of the things we

67
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,750
talked about in our our readiness
discussion is that you have to be ready

68
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:45,440
to move this fast right you don't go
from from running a writing a running

69
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,360
race against four-year-old to spring in
the Olympics right and if you're if

70
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,860
you're used to traditional software
deployment schedules doctors gonna throw

71
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,380
retching a complete right Morgan
shipping more shipping more often and

72
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,380
you're gonna have a lot more contention
for resources and you ever had before

73
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,030
okay that's one of the things you have
to understand is that because of that

74
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,119
speed had posted some inherent
difficulties if you don't communicate

75
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,979
well you don't work any rate processes
uh it was released in March 2013 so it's

76
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:25,070
a three-and-a-half years old not really
well baked in technology but it

77
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:30,860
actually works really really well
because simple right so far 2013 it's

78
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,980
got all the blue chips and sponsors of
it

79
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,850
redhat IDM cisco google everybody's
pitching in on the doctor sided is

80
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:46,100
gaining a lot of football or soccer time
users there's a lot of things going on

81
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,710
the dock community already that you know
usually takes a decade you get feeling

82
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,719
this has been really quickly adopted
because it is piggybacking on the comet

83
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,720
the tail of the comet which is DevOps
right

84
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,790
the current goal and they keep pushing
towards this and I still don't see how

85
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,710
it's going to work is to be operating
system independent right so right now

86
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:16,070
doctor is a linux platform right i can
run it on any linux server it's built

87
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,420
into the Cardinal running anywhere I
want anyone in server in my container

88
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,420
for linux server let's start without a
problem right

89
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,140
they want to move that to the windows
side and when I understand units PSD

90
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,700
side as well which would be pretty
interesting maybe really had a cool to

91
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,610
be able to ship between different
environments and different different

92
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,220
skill sets and migrate without having it
a lot of vendor lock-in which we really

93
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,570
have again i'm not sure how we're gonna
make it happen but they said you can do

94
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:53,719
it so that is the current push it also
call opinion features in the past past

95
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,390
six to eight months and it really helped
with securities days doctor isn't though

96
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,099
a virtualization technology a lot of
people won't fit in with the vmware

97
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,770
hyper-v with citrus one anybody actually
a nap

98
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:15,289
thank you it's not that right and you
can't think of it that way if you start

99
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,710
thinking about is virtualization
technology will start applying the

100
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,390
principles of virtualization to it and
it works completely differently right

101
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,680
there are some similarities lady
provision provision resources you

102
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:35,060
provision ram cpu provision X similarly
if you think about it is we have

103
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,270
anything about it as something that's
going to be

104
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,740
all time it's not bad at all these
containers are going to be created and

105
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,330
destroyed faster than we've ever created
straight games crashing we can create

106
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:52,450
and destroy vs right um it's not going
to be inherently secure they didn't look

107
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,280
at the colonel and say oh this is really
secure rights bill fragility and

108
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,180
sometimes the jelly and security don't
necessarily go together very well I'm

109
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,150
sure you wanna head's not right

110
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:10,360
we are the Department of know or invest
with the Department of yes but right and

111
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,530
DevOps has gotten the point where
they're saying well you said no so I did

112
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,030
it this way

113
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:21,220
alright so doctor is not it's built for
that is your knees built that's be and

114
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,540
it's not made inherently to be secure
and we're making strides over the past

115
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:31,120
few said past few months 11 not 10
release and stuff like that it's also

116
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,500
not a virtual sandbox but it does behave
similarly similarly to what it does use

117
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,050
the sheriff's pact right so there is a
way to break out of that container and

118
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:48,729
move from move laterally or container to
contain right it's not because we have

119
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:55,810
ensured platform it isn't as sandboxed
as avi would be right it doesn't have a

120
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,469
lot of the functionality that we look
for like switches we have some of the

121
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,120
functionality but we don't have a really
in-depth switch type technology or some

122
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,660
of the other things that we can use the
segment am very effective

123
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,189
ok and it's not can see it for
application hosting and I got that in

124
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:19,510
there because i really love the work and
see in 41 and because it its I hear a

125
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,040
lot of dead ops team saying well we're
just going to stop and look at how it

126
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,579
works

127
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:31,030
hello but everyones using it are why
well because every using it fast that's

128
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,390
what with all heart slowly roll

129
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,290
what are we actually doing this ok
that's what we're going to get a little

130
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,939
bit further down the line

131
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,860
how does it work I'm for a long time

132
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:51,080
osc systemd which everybody loves here
soon as a system DIC a lot of and liver

133
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:57,080
were originally the way that dr.
interacting with linux kernel right and

134
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:03,020
now live containing library ship with i
think one . 08 i remember right and that

135
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,140
integrated a lot more with the
virtualization functionalities that are

136
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,850
built in like the KTM part of the curve
right so now we have direct access to a

137
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,510
lot of the virtualization features there
that we didn't have access to before we

138
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,410
had to work around it that would contain
your library uses a lot of the kvm

139
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:23,089
functionality built into the webex
Colonel i use things like namespaces at

140
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:29,330
our secrets all the good stuff that we
really want to get to in the colonel to

141
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,770
share with back container it now access
is through container we do still use

142
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:40,640
some of her in some system knee in that
respect but is much much less than we

143
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,050
were using it up unit you're right
three-year-old technology so this is

144
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,729
moving real fast and it's sometimes
difficult to realize has new iterations

145
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:56,060
come out one . 10 came out with username
spaces right and username spaces was a

146
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,760
monumental shift for the doctor
community and I say about happy people

147
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:09,110
ready for going after god I but about
half the people were great for it and

148
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,020
they are monitoring software and
everything else went to school with

149
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:18,770
preserving look at all these new users
right so keeping up with what's actually

150
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,829
being released before you apply the
patches is another thing we want to

151
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,900
understand but dr. changes every single
liberation is still very very very new

152
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:32,540
so something understand like i said
earlier container can span multiple

153
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,459
physical host so if you've got a bunch
of boxes that you need in production and

154
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,170
you want to have specific resources for
specific processes and container and

155
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:48,920
span multiple hosts container you can
decide resource limits to avoid one of

156
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:56,420
your containers tossing rescue contains
right it does have unique tcp/ip stack

157
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:02,719
perfect and each one has its own tcp/ip
stack that's built-in ready to go and

158
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,220
he's your own IP addressing everything
else you don't have to rely on virtual

159
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:13,339
interfaces the same way we do the
process ID is obviously that was part of

160
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,980
the namespaces feature right

161
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:22,070
unfortunately for a long time the user
name spaces wasn't available so the

162
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,600
doctor a root user and the doctor
container and if you're on one of your

163
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:34,339
earlier a user root user in the
container is a user of hopes right that

164
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:39,139
was a well when I saw that the first
time right when we did this study get it

165
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:43,100
before using this basis without but that
came out februari and kind of change the

166
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,570
game already in that respect

167
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,709
namespaces gives us that isolation as
well so we use namespaces to decide with

168
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:53,660
resources right which process there that
have an age basic appended to the

169
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,310
beginning right can be assigned specific
about resources so you can get very very

170
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,660
granular as well which is something i
can't really do giving up and get more

171
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,750
granulated anybody questions before
going forward

172
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:14,000
oh ok I again each of the applications
running a container network stack for

173
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,930
separate containers only contain
container contains the freeware that

174
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:26,839
dependencies for that application right
so one application requires openssl

175
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:33,260
right god forbid we have openssl in
there again one container requires out

176
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,760
that goes in the applicator right and it
ships from bases stolen base install

177
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,769
with that configure and attached to that
contain it

178
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:47,300
it's really critical um it creates great
at the beginning of the development

179
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:54,889
process so one of the things we'll see
is that in . when you create a container

180
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:58,519
what's really cool is that you can
download containers kinda like it's

181
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,649
almost like get up for containers right
there's a container adopted

182
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:08,119
oh thank you dr. up and you grab
anything from there

183
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:13,430
don't want that it's already 97 the way
to where you needed to be right we're

184
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,769
talking about those a little bit more
because there are some pretty shocking

185
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:21,589
numbers around the doctor help but that
continues to build beginning shipped

186
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:25,970
through the process check that each each
one of the stops on the way and then

187
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:31,220
that container persists all the way into
production until the end of your cycle

188
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,970
usually years if you're agile usually in
your sprint right so you're shooting a

189
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,379
new container the end of each each
development cycle repellent spray right

190
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:46,819
um Security benefits obviously and
current level controls your advice and

191
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:52,819
spaces are great you have a smaller
footprint per container right so now i

192
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:56,899
don't have this big sprawling machines
that I have to match all the time right

193
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:02,509
match base machine on a regular basis
not match the dependencies need to the

194
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:07,339
containers but I don't have you know 450
windows machine but i need to patch or

195
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:11,179
450 dr. machine around start linux
machines and I have to catch on a

196
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,600
regular basis and actually produces a
lot of the patching that we actually

197
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,309
have to do which is really cool

198
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:23,179
um and then the control groups allocate
the resources relatively well right to

199
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:29,240
prevent one container from eating up
being all resources on that the base the

200
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,399
host server she's really really helpful
that's not against your name basis so

201
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,949
that's a good those are good security
benefits and i love not having to

202
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:41,179
capture all the time patching is
probably more thing in the world

203
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:47,029
sitting there waiting then it doesn't
work I gotta fix something that I said

204
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:49,339
their way again still doesn't work right

205
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:52,699
this reduces the amount of catching I
have to do but it doesn't reduce the

206
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:58,758
number of vulnerabilities and run across
so i'm using namespace again was

207
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:05,240
released one . 10 ok i was an
experimental version of 19 which only

208
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,410
ship on the network platform right and
you throw

209
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:14,960
everything pushes a lot of fun figure
out of 110 went into general release in

210
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,870
mapson root within the container into an
armed with outside the container which

211
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:26,209
helps us a lot of privilege escalation
lot of movement all the things that we

212
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:30,440
really freaked out about we're hosting
web application right so many pops by

213
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,210
server my container what can they do
before this they got ahold of a process

214
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,490
management process of the host because
it's reprocess on the most anything else

215
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:46,310
that's out there and God knows y'all a
lot of times end up having the same same

216
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,899
user across multiple posts we got a lot
of our potential right so let's be very

217
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,150
very secure

218
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,110
we had a meeting a big issue with that
this is itself a lot of those problems

219
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:02,360
right we start gradually issues because
I mean they can just fish will be an

220
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,360
administrator saying free coffee or free
spicy food but this helps a lot

221
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:13,430
again these groups inside the container
is no longer route outside the container

222
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:23,360
right but but as I saw this upgraded one
. n drop I didn't see a lot of people

223
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,969
start to implement this with separate
passwords or separate group users right

224
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,560
so now all of a sudden

225
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:36,980
yeah it's it's not the process is the
same but only crap passwords the same if

226
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:42,860
i get that off to the races right so you
can actually no manager shows a little

227
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,879
bit more effectively

228
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,990
it's a nightmare to keep all the
passwords that working people but you

229
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,990
can do it and you can help with
privilege escalation that respect at

230
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:58,160
this point my security conserves right
we're going to talk about these little

231
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,020
more depth to share common architecture
really wasn't designed security in mind

232
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:10,700
usernames basis of maybe a big change on
the dr. Damon does one is root right so

233
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,590
it is eight is a predictable attack
surface right a lot of demons run

234
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,520
through but this one is another one that
people realize you're running doctor is

235
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,389
it's an attack surface that they can
look at

236
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:30,658
uh it is also free 1919 girlier it was
relatively juvenile to escape the

237
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:34,679
sandbox right it's a little bit more
difficult now but again in complete

238
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,719
integration has caused seeing some
issues around complete integration and

239
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:45,659
people being able to grab passwords that
config files right and that's just bad

240
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:50,070
security but again we're not were
automatically standing we're not looking

241
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:57,149
for a password and these need these
fibers are very often something you want

242
00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:02,399
to look at what dr. though um this is
the big one for me and this is the one

243
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:07,978
that kinda was a deal breaker for us
last year and this is a little bit old

244
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:12,209
numbers i think back februari thirty
percent of containers with dr. home

245
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:17,339
contains serious which is medium or high
priority security vulnerabilities right

246
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:22,499
so unless we got our hands around
scanning all of our containers as they

247
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:28,469
go before they go to production we have
we have seen significant risk of having

248
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:34,320
a incident based around somebody just
grabbing a container of the hub we're

249
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,519
building out that right somebody builds
on that container that they just grabbed

250
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,379
from the hub and then tries to ship it
to prod and we we grabbing a few days

251
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:44,369
home

252
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:49,168
what is that right that's going to be a
significant amount of rework ok so how

253
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:53,039
do we deal with that that was one of the
things that how many people here at tsa

254
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,749
PreCheck country rechecked people are
you only work on the town

255
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,099
oh this is this isn't uh-huh

256
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:06,359
we try to build a similar PreCheck
program where the security team is no

257
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,049
longer sitting back scanning was
actually on the network being correct

258
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:13,589
their say alright I'm gonna grab tank
containers today and i'm going to run

259
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:17,279
I'm gonna run s against I'm gonna check
and then i'm going to tell the

260
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:24,539
developers . Ops guys alright he these
containers are good for you run for this

261
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:25,750
one time

262
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:32,080
right because you know what we look at
the actual vulnerabilities that's really

263
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,230
hard to see in this one I'm look the all
the images in the container hub or 962

264
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,700
the ones with high priority
vulnerabilities 36-percent have high

265
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,380
priority vulnerabilities right so that's
why i remember right going back to the

266
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,060
cdss 7 or higher which is the ones that
make us popular a little bit right

267
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:59,379
like who look what I found the ones that
were triggered the latest or tag the

268
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,450
latest which was 73

269
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,400
twenty-three percent of those contain
high priority vulnerabilities

270
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,200
it's a big number right that's a really
big number but these things are getting

271
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,640
shipped on a regular basis with
companies that have wrapped around what

272
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:23,500
this actually means when I saw these
numbers i saw that right and actually

273
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,360
funny enough about 3% of that ship is
actually got fired so

274
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,500
oh that was that was definitely what
what i was looking at i solve those

275
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,480
numbers were like holy how would we do
with this right as a visa so for this

276
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,310
customer right

277
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:42,610
how are you wrapping my head around the
fact that their dads want to do this

278
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:48,939
fast right but i'm going to start
getting container ship in the QA we

279
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,520
start standing him and we have to reject
it

280
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,680
the entire container ship factor right
not just coat the entire containing how

281
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,250
I'm going to deal with that I'm going to
stop that being a work stoppage how am I

282
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:09,280
going to stop at for being a rework but
ok so we look became to the fundamental

283
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,420
difference

284
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,200
ok fundamental differences security is
the checkpoint right we've always

285
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,290
operated any checkpoint you shall not
pass right and DevOps can see that are

286
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,610
moving at warp drive

287
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:26,649
alright that's what that actually says
could make it any bigger else kinda took

288
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,160
up the whole screen but tops are running
warcraft they want to ship coach Chip

289
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,880
code code they want to get their stuff
down and get it out right

290
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,540
and they're they're saying what you gave
me your loss top 10 to deal with and I

291
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:42,220
want i'm going to deal with those arms
your coat and hat and all the rest right

292
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,130
well how do we add security to a process
and bill sent make sure everybody here

293
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:52,750
has seen talking sometime or seen on
youtube for those different places that

294
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,940
Adrian some website talk about here in
meeting for developers right how do we

295
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,010
help them become more secure right and
they love training and beer expensive

296
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,330
beer and spicy food

297
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,230
the things that I remember from this
talk primarily subpoena lot of spicy

298
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:14,530
food and talk about security alright but
how do we work around their process how

299
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:20,379
do we work with DevOps set it against
DevOps it's not this constant value for

300
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,210
all right it's not us versus them

301
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,380
it's all of us together everybody's on
the security team and everybody is on

302
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:31,690
the dev team training organisation so
how do we do that right so i built out

303
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:37,540
this for Phase approach to dealing with
so many wanting to move into the docker

304
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,080
bro I guess right

305
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:47,889
the first was discovered second was
analyzed the third was deployed and the

306
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:51,190
work was audit regularly and what I've
actually changed because of some new

307
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:56,980
tools is it is now audit continuously
write these things have come out over

308
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:02,020
the past few months past year like this
law which is a doctor focused

309
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:08,290
vulnerability management platform and
it's fantastic it's really really great

310
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:13,000
and it's changed the game because the
way the containers are brought up and in

311
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,290
taking down it's almost impossible for
your traditional non-integrated

312
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,490
vulnerability scanner to keep pace with
this kind of movement right it's so much

313
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,750
configurations so much different
different looks that we have to give

314
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,950
things that is almost impossible to keep
up with it especially were not using

315
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,950
share passwords and share credentials
and we're doing authenticated scans

316
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,270
right that's the thing that we really
need something that's integrated that .

317
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,960
so that's one of the things we have to
look at how how well does our security

318
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,850
team communicate with the other tool

319
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,659
that's part of the discoverer face right
so we're going to decide whether or not

320
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,640
we're ready for dr. hey and your dad
about that processes have to be very

321
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:58,810
mature right and we got you know as a
system and somebody who's very process

322
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:04,629
driven and I like to see procedures
followed exactly predictable predictable

323
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,310
happens every time

324
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,649
everybody knows what to do and they're
singing from the same sheet of music

325
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,700
right

326
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,140
that doesn't sound like your dev team
you need you need to get on the same

327
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,230
page before you're ready to start
creating destroyed containers with this

328
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,190
kind of pace

329
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:23,560
you have to have very very robust
fallback options right because again

330
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,090
you're moving real fast

331
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:30,100
mistakes are going to be made ok to
develop those processes to roll back in

332
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,020
the case something goes goes wrong and
we need to we need to come back to

333
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,310
previous iteration right really easy
with snapshots from the elves and stuff

334
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:43,960
like that would work would have been
more contentious when you are starting

335
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,760
to destroy containers your shipping was
in place so make sure you got good

336
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,840
processes wrapped around that and decide
how you're going to do that in reverse

337
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,740
it right so you don't have extended
periods of time you're not reversing of

338
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,930
the clock right um and then tested
containers to verify that they're

339
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:06,070
actually going to work without
privileges right you can avoid using

340
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:11,860
group processes to a certain about
that's a really good thing reduce the

341
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:16,090
amount of places that your financial
live and it's going to help you be more

342
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:21,669
successful this is a little bit less
little bit less important now but still

343
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:27,370
very I mean just good security practice
then look at our your app's rating right

344
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:33,100
so are your shit defined processes right
that's one thing that we have to

345
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,750
completely change how we think about
shipping code we're not pushing out and

346
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:43,300
installing installer package or pushing
out a bill or Reilly every time we're

347
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,669
moving way faster than that so we need
to make sure that everybody is if you

348
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:53,470
have processes in place right now every
well reverse everybody understands what

349
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,500
they are and everybody

350
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,880
just follow you gotta look at an
organizational type mentality on this is

351
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,550
we're no longer just making sure that we
have security and technical control

352
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:09,770
device we need to be organizationally
mature right and organizationally mature

353
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:13,790
means that are the artists ready because
we built them the right way

354
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,230
the other thing is relics I've seen this
played a lot of people right they

355
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:23,000
program with libraries right and forget
that they're using that old library

356
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,910
internet coconut there's been an image
going around the guy

357
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,910
hey this looks like really old old I
wonder fighting and then it

358
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:34,640
hands up as a stack of wood and hands up
and there's an entire ferris wheel on

359
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,420
top of this pile of wood right and
that's exactly what i've seen a few

360
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,530
times and had been a big pickup with
these doctors limitations if somebody

361
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:46,430
doesn't realize there's still using a
library and they don't build it into the

362
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:51,560
new container and hits you and nothing
works right so make sure that you

363
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,919
eliminate all those relatives or know
what they are know what's in your code

364
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,130
when you're actually referencing to make
sure that you got everything of work

365
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,440
right cool

366
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,510
everybody good on the discovery phase no
no questions

367
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:11,390
alright next one is analyzed right and
then let's see what is going to reside

368
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:17,150
in these instances ok what I got that's
right i got that processes that are

369
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:20,270
already got good organizational
structure

370
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:24,470
I've got three policies what do I
actually want to move in a doctor at

371
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,040
this point right there are certain
things that you don't want to move the

372
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,200
doctor right database experiences not a
great idea for a performance standpoint

373
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:40,520
how secure are my jails their place to
allow people to securely compute in my

374
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,840
application right

375
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,720
will any of the direct access methods
and actually a couple times work

376
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,850
yeah all right i got this one customer
that uses ssh to get it up big mouth

377
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:56,300
files because they just can't be
bothered to put a CSP and web app right

378
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,220
they just SH over and I

379
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,419
ftp and dump the CSV and then run a
batch command right you're doing that

380
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:08,760
again you're you're having direct access
into a shared infrastructure that's

381
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:15,240
probably not the best idea that i can
take that one back and forth and I all

382
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,299
of the end up on both sides of the
quoting on different days and different

383
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:21,870
out different scenarios but
realistically this is one of the things

384
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:25,949
that we set forward to set and quiet or
anybody outside this organization has

385
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:30,059
ssh access or anybody outside of my
inner security operations ssh access

386
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:37,710
we're not going to allow doctors because
there's too many watches right uh you

387
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:42,929
know the last part is this is where we
get into that audit containers right and

388
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:48,270
this is that we check standard that that
we built in was willing existing audit

389
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,950
container satisfy requirements

390
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:56,490
ok so the security team likes to sit
back and firefight that's what we're

391
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,700
good at what I've done over a decade
right out

392
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,429
we fire fight we sit back and find your
abilities we help fix so we set

393
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:10,020
standards we do that so right but a lot
of times we don't have time to be

394
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,010
proactive

395
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:15,990
it's because we're spending so much time
fighting right what we can do with this

396
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,880
scenario is now I've got this new
technology that's coming out the people

397
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,620
are able to grab containers from the hub
and they're able to work and really

398
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:34,229
really efficient means ok so how do I
handle handle security guy okay in the

399
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:40,080
answer that we came up with was alright
we're going to start rolling out doctor

400
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,090
in three months

401
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:46,678
let's just use an imaginary three months
and i'm going to have one of my

402
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:53,070
engineers on the security side spin up
that environment download containers

403
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:59,340
recheck and set an expiration date on
that breach app right all right i hope i

404
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,149
can live with the vulnerabilities that
are available every containers got some

405
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:07,580
vulnerabilities right everything your ID
say has some vulnerabilities

406
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,510
whether we know about what I'm going to
all these containers and i'm gonna

407
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:17,570
recheck for certain amount of time and
i'm also going to cap index everything

408
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:20,929
is in that container that I pulled out
from the hub right so that I've got a

409
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:28,040
database of everything so if i have a
new vulnerability is out for openssh I

410
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,060
know exactly which containers i proved
that have a presentation that i can say

411
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,250
now we need you back patch

412
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,880
ok so I'm going to index 1 i'm going to
check on grace you're serious

413
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,830
vulnerabilities either going to clear
i'm going to detain them right so what

414
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,320
we're doing is building this
collaborative environment where I'm

415
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:51,350
saying hey that guy I don't you need
this container submit the security team

416
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,790
I've got a list of container ideas that
I've already pre-qualified for us to be

417
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:59,540
able to use and if yours doesn't fit
into that that group that I've already

418
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,480
qualified i'm gonna go ahead and check
it for you then you're going to be

419
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,090
allowed to ship this at will

420
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:12,379
until this date so I want to be for
sprints in order to get through you're

421
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,430
going to get more spread so if you're on
six weeks prints that several months

422
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,480
right

423
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,470
you're going to have this cycle to use
this container and i will come back to

424
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,550
you unless I discovered something
serious i'm going to know what my my

425
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,090
exposure is so finding to put in
compensating controls I can do it ahead

426
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,780
of time for that certain amount of time
and then you're going to be a lot of the

427
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,129
work at will

428
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:40,670
right now i'm going to integrate in
technology can actually also stands

429
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:45,410
those to make sure that the code that's
coming in or new prerequisites that

430
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:49,520
we're installing into the containers are
actually also vulnerable but this is a

431
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,270
way for us

432
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:55,490
Sarah this guy is good to go you have
for this a lot of time you really don't

433
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,830
even have to check with me before you
build on this but it will hear our

434
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,000
little bit our radar before get shipped
prop is obviously you know what's in

435
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,540
production and he know what's in QA to
circle set

436
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,320
I'm I never know what's in the
development environment for the most

437
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,780
part they're just a lot less a lot of
times but

438
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,890
this is a way for us to interact with
those guys are very proactive let so

439
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:23,790
they're not sitting there waiting for
security to go ahead right there

440
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:28,259
they're shipping in this speed doctor
and we're sitting back say alright let's

441
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,950
check another five of these that just
came out right you saw those hundred

442
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:35,399
thousand containers in the doctor how
there's probably more than that now that

443
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,720
those numbers are a little bit old but
you know we audit hundred and fifty of

444
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,529
them are probably going to satisfy 99%
of the requirements that are going to

445
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:49,050
come across for a doctor implementation
right and you're sticking to the newest

446
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,580
available and free checking those you're
gonna get much more number under under a

447
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:59,069
hundred and fifty last I checked last
night it was 148 something like that

448
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:05,880
right so having your dad's understand i
can check this database of audit

449
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,430
containers right

450
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:12,750
however you want to categorize them and
then move my speed without having to

451
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,280
deal with the security guys

452
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,720
SI look at that right that's going to be
a really great thing for them to be able

453
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,250
to do what they want to do moving their
speed and allow us to focus on the

454
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,930
things that really devote so much of our
building management and the compensating

455
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:34,230
for me to put in place that you like to
say we like this design set of standards

456
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:40,170
and the standards that we get out there
find acceptable containers from the

457
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,470
marketplace and I said marketplace there
because i think they changed the whole

458
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,169
name right I'll be doing this could be
wrong

459
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:51,990
something like that it's the doctor up
defined standard LS pills for the hosts

460
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:57,660
p.m. right fine what those look like
because great the containers are good

461
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,740
but the hosts be at third I'm sorry
about the house being the host servers

462
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:06,569
still need to be patched right we still
need to keep those update you still need

463
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,800
to define our standards and make that
predictable across all the platforms so

464
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,460
when I build the new red box for you
know start I know what it's going to

465
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,280
look like as i'm shipping through these

466
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,060
different iterations from these
different cycles in the code if we can

467
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:24,380
keep those as consistent as possible
across we're going to get less less

468
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:29,930
issues especially with i I've actually
seen that that environment 110 trying to

469
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:34,430
shift to a 109 environment and hey look
namespaces that your user name spaces

470
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,390
are available

471
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,420
well the prop engineers had upgraded yet

472
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,920
well we need to make sure that as we're
standardizing on one side we're

473
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,130
standardizing across the board and
making things available as we go forward

474
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:56,240
I like to define the versions of
dependencies that i'm ok with right this

475
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,770
is what I put openssl there because i
was patching openssl for 48 hours

476
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:05,990
straight 1-2 off scars from that work
but i like to define the versions that I

477
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:12,439
comfortable with so if they use a
container that isn't audited for that is

478
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,290
audit but they need another they need
another library added in they know what

479
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:21,470
versions they can go ahead and install
us there were hard-working forward that

480
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:26,240
are going to work with our apps and be
with security and our requirements that

481
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,430
makes sense right

482
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:34,549
um then I like to say alright i like to
audit with best practice analysis my

483
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,670
clients recently or minus the
circumstances

484
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:44,030
Michael Boland that produces it from
sissified great when it's heartening to

485
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:48,530
lidocaine aware of it when I was a baby
environment really helps with hardly a

486
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,990
lot of the host be everything's really
helpful

487
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:54,049
there is a container plugin for that as
well

488
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:58,880
ok so we can audit the containers but
this is again hardening is a

489
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,200
vulnerability manager

490
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,779
alright so what I look at the right i
look at my traditional vulnerability

491
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,910
management pot for that's really
difficult to get set up initially he

492
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:14,750
spent a lot of time to find what's right
what's not right setting standards

493
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:20,180
setting bass lines and stuff like that
and then we go to environmental groups

494
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,190
is fast and that we can't keep up
anymore

495
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:28,460
right i like to use this slide for that
all right I'm gonna be scanner right but

496
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,120
I'm missing it almost everything you
look at the chalks really not helping

497
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,630
much

498
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,830
right because it's missing a core
functionality with the automated scanner

499
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:42,200
is supposed to do is go to look they
will scan the network right and look for

500
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:47,779
new instances of those new things like
that but the amount of logs the amount

501
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,930
of data that comes into an automated
scanning tool when you're creating a

502
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:55,220
container every two weeks is really
really difficult to keep up with

503
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:59,570
ok so we want to do something that
integrates with dr. and integrates with

504
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:04,370
our life cycle so that as I build a
container I'm managing that container

505
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:08,509
from the security side with them upside
right there's great tools for managing

506
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:12,830
them off are great tools for managing
security and docker which twist lock is

507
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:17,390
still probably my favorite just from an
integration standpoint and speed of

508
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:22,009
installation standpoint it's fantastic
but you don't end up with the

509
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:27,140
misconfigurations hiding good where you
got this automated scanner this is how I

510
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:32,779
always done it right this is what I use
is what all the guys are trained . but

511
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,630
it doesn't work because of the speed
that we're moving at now

512
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,050
alright just really like that picture
because it made me laugh

513
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:45,710
having a beer . or three years on what
we want to look at continuous controls

514
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:51,200
are instances right in my continuous I
mean we need to look for best practices

515
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,109
before the ship to prod we need to do
regular pen test to make sure that we

516
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:02,810
have the jails in place that we said
work-wise what's right is more important

517
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:08,480
to do action and us because of the speed
that we are moving right we are now

518
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:15,110
living in speed of DevOps and that speed
means that 10 tests are going to find

519
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,470
those containers and accidentally were
destroyed because I wasn't sure my

520
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:22,370
rollback plan was to leave this
container place for a couple weeks while

521
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:25,160
I make sure that everything was good
right

522
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,370
well that containers now they're not
even tell you how many people had that

523
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,540
happen at $TIME p.m. before

524
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,910
oh that's all on

525
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:35,950
yeah I found those and wasn't amused
because i looked and they had a dick .

526
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:42,038
mine runs over that come from Tom had
just happened a couple weeks ago um you

527
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:46,180
can implement adorability scattered
light neces really helpful to scan those

528
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,730
again I look for something that's a
little bit more integrated as i was

529
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:58,930
doing this we were building a program
around esas and then then twist lock him

530
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:03,819
out it was like wow I can have those two
processes and ingredient right so we

531
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:07,450
work we're doing a manual process to
bring it bring these online bring them

532
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:11,980
offline and online and offline this lot
of work for guidance managing that

533
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:17,410
message implementation right ton of work
management credentials to manage yeah he

534
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,879
dresses up you're looking at managed to
the different vulnerabilities of you

535
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,839
might see in a different one in tune and
development stuff and that's something

536
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,799
came out the made it a lot easier right
so you can implement vulnerability

537
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:30,609
scanner

538
00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:36,098
um I also like to say and this is just a
this is something that I wanted to get

539
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:42,970
in place but SCA right let's look at the
coat see if the code is actually doing

540
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:47,558
what we wanted to do static code
analysis looking at a loss popped i'm

541
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:51,220
looking at the things that we would
expect out an application from a

542
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,598
security perspective we now have time
budget to do because you're stunning

543
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,789
West i'm auditing be out catching p.m.
and dealing with three you know dealing

544
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:04,779
with every vulnerability coaching when
they provision new vm and patches

545
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:09,069
different muscle right we're spending
less time doing that now so we've got

546
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:12,038
more time to do things like static code
analysis focused on the privilege

547
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:16,329
escalation focus on the lateral movement
side of things so that you can say all

548
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:21,670
right I know about 110 I don't get user
name spaces but hey look at photos

549
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:29,260
password and config file that was
available in my in my my own web server

550
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,299
right we found those before

551
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:36,190
happens all the time and this is what we
we try to look for because now we can

552
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:41,359
still break that that sandbox a little
bit more easily we could be four

553
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,869
um tools i got like Swiss locking your
ability scanning our run defense they

554
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:52,430
help with clients and they actually help
manage access control to your doctor

555
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,450
passports

556
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:57,859
it's really cool and alliances the
hardening and best practices analysis

557
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:04,519
that that is a really great tool for
your face builds your your host bands

558
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:09,890
and honestly any linux boxes that you
got out there running like this and

559
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:13,940
understand your risk measure your wrist
against best practices always a good

560
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,940
idea so it's something that I really
like to mention all the time

561
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:21,470
I'm visa that some of the articles i
mentioned if you guys want those i will

562
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:27,288
post this somewhere and get it out later
come out at some point over the next

563
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:31,519
couple days i am actually going to be
doing this entire talking to the side

564
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:36,288
very open article so if you guys are not
Siberry this will all be in cyber reopen

565
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:42,230
by the end of next week not slide with
