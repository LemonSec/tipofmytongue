1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
expert everyone say that the computer
forensic investigators probably like 10

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,809
years just about in federal court state
courts few times in the postwar that

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,809
sucks you in here purchases difficult

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,359
alright so can you do me a favor keep
not BS meter so people when asked where

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,630
he was head case studies and I watch
them sometimes i'm sitting there

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,609
thinking I don't know that's about
cracked it so if you sit on your

7
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,660
business me root of all everybody knows
him everyone will crack

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,559
who here has leveraged different
forensics solves problem not be enough

9
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,959
it's a response just like civil
litigations you hope so if you're

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,110
looking for a digital frames class it's
going to make your eyes bleed this is

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,289
not it this is not going to help you
pass the certification exam i'm just

12
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,920
going to give the basics of digital
forensics but I used to give those types

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,850
types of talks and what people they look
to your stories how did your language is

14
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,870
what problems did you solve and so will
go through the basics but then i'm going

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,260
to show you where each one of these are
case studies that out some of them are

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,099
old enough for 45 years old but the same
things happen it's just different people

17
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,539
when i'm too lazy to continue to redact
information such as you send stuff to

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,250
talk about digital forensics basics

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,979
we'll talk about how it works you know
what we're looking to accomplish how we

20
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,060
do things and they will talk about these
decks and you'll ask yourself never

21
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,720
stops

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,770
seriously they really did that and then
there's gonna be some pro tips when the

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,100
proteins are don't do stupid things on
computers because we'll figure it out

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,470
what we would what we do seems very
complex and very difficult and there is

25
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,640
a level of complexity

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,630
it's not as hard as well make it out to
be it's not like you see on CSI you know

27
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,460
text within our hard working well in
rooms and we're just not nearly as

28
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,658
attractive is no speak so it's real
difference what you sit there and this

29
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,909
is gonna be boring to me you're sorry

30
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,159
nice to meet you see peace alright so
some digital forensics basis a little so

31
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,680
I do a lot of things in response i do a
lot of civil litigation we work a lot of

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,759
cases trade secret that is what I do a
lot of i do some hot sex course i'm from

33
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,710
Knoxville Tennessee can't tell

34
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,329
and so we don't do Tennessee's no
problem or step so it's real house takes

35
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,840
divorce or just a little bit expensive
item also child custody

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,599
there's a lot of money involved and i
have a couple of those cases it will go

37
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,040
through we don't do i do a water tray to
do a lot of spoliation of evidence do a

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,660
lot of concealing other people doing and
many times are actually . as neutral

39
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,140
there's not a lot of forensics people in
knoxville tennessee and so I work

40
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,890
sometimes the court will appoint as a
neutral to work for Botox and that's

41
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,399
kind of hard so just of digital
forensics basics people think for

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,360
instance is just recovering deleted
information it's not there's so much

43
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,230
more to it

44
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,379
I don't know that I've ever had one case
The Smoking Gun is something that

45
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,599
someone deleted its activities

46
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,018
it's what they're doing is what they're
trying to cover up yeah sometimes the

47
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,849
content and information is important but
also time instant responses when i get

48
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,530
the value of information we do keyword
search is born but it's extremely

49
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,310
valuable when you're looking at an
operating system but by default Windows

50
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,879
7 is about 800,000 bottles when your
time to find what you're looking for

51
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,470
digital communications i just call this
email but i have a twenty-two-year-old

52
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,920
they have no idea what email this so now
it's just digital communications

53
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,600
Internet activities we spend a lot of
time analyzing internet and i'm going to

54
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,440
go through more of these in debt
pictures and movies

55
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,769
yeah pictures we do a lot of moment of
US currency so sometimes i just have to

56
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,250
have the phone back like this because of
the pictures that have been on pump five

57
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,459
activities will talk about the
importance of time learning activities

58
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,319
external use storage usage metadata and
accept data most people know this now

59
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,888
but some people still don't know when it
comes to accept data application

60
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:44,819
execution histories and anti forensics
is my favorite i love it with someone's

61
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,470
trying to hide something stuff we
analyze you know there's nothing or

62
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,780
Sarah here computer servers memory for
instance i'm going to do a lot more that

63
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,620
even in civil litigation so we do a lot
of different response mobile devices

64
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,849
truth is I probably analyzed more mobile
devices now than i do computers and

65
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:06,388
that's a completely i had some slides
about mobile but my tops only 15 minutes

66
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:10,680
and not 60 so i cut those output mobiles
are completely different animal

67
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,459
it's different tools at the different
methodology cloud storage not

68
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,329
necessarily the stores with the
interaction with the storage removable

69
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,380
media is huge and trying to do with that
we doing with gps devices and I don't

70
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,159
have a case study on GPS here but we
actually worked the case in which a

71
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:31,229
tractor-trailer with the wrong way down
a one-way street hit someone killed him

72
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,159
well his testimony was that he did not
go down that way or there was some type

73
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:39,300
of confusion as to what happened and the
defense actually i recently had a GPS

74
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,250
device and have wings and every few
seconds it shows and we showed that he

75
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,000
did exactly what the police report set
so that if your defense attorney locking

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,219
but we kept him from litigating
something for a long time that he was

77
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:55,440
gonna lose watches the pics i've not
analyzed and watch it but I saw a case

78
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,880
fits in which you have people that are
drawing whether it's disability or

79
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,260
something else everyone's where fits now
so you're John disability because you

80
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,900
can't walk more than a hundred feet but
you were gonna fit

81
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,650
let me get my hands on that fit into the
pit so the fit a lon

82
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,380
you're not supposed to be able to do
certain things but you know you're doing

83
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,849
your 10,000 steps a day

84
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:18,300
something's kind of struck what stranger
I don't work that well but I've seen

85
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,729
that so as an expert witness this is as
basic as digital forensics gets I have

86
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:28,530
to explain things to judges juries and
determine any attorneys judges are good

87
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,570
so attorneys are extremely smart until
it comes to technology they struggle

88
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,750
with that so i have to come up with
analogies to teach them things and so my

89
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,490
goal is it my twelve-year-old she's
pretty smart girls mother if not we're

90
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,639
open understand what I'm talking about
that a judge or jury or the attorneys

91
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,889
with so this is the analogy that I use

92
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,719
so if you remember to show how old are
longtime going when I went to lover i

93
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:56,490
want to book i went to the card catalog
system to the decimal system i pulled

94
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,789
the card there . to the book on the
shelf

95
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:04,620
that's how computers work it's that
simple so when you delete a bottle so

96
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,639
for what it's worth we pretty much just
intention that happy they need to name

97
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,200
it something they made it delete the way
the way the week works is the same thing

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,599
that if someone were to take that car
and related they're still reference to

99
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:21,779
it here in the book is still on the
shelves until someone puts a book in its

100
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:22,830
place

101
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,830
that's how file systems work so sticking
with thank you sir

102
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,870
sticking with Microsoft's file system
HDFS it has the master file table

103
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,050
it has an entry invest file table that
points to the physical sector that the

104
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,220
word document exists off so when you hit
the delete button all you're doing is

105
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,390
removing that injury so 44 . time is
still gonna be in the mft table until

106
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,110
another file over rocks and it's still
going to be able to hard drive that's

107
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,460
all the leaky ducts because we're too
lazy to wait for 20 it out so that's how

108
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,830
we recover deleted information keyword
search anytime anything at any point

109
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:02,320
stop and ask me a question for football
necessary keyword search it is boring

110
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,099
but you know people start documents in
places other than my dog there's

111
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,610
temporary office there's downloads
there's a lot of other places and when

112
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,720
you need to calm down

113
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,530
Amelia documents to find things of
interest keyword searching works

114
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,640
I'm so it's extremely valuable but it's
morning so lots of times we're doing

115
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,729
discovery and forensics of the kids the
attorney says we want to know what they

116
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,290
were doing and also we want all
documents that have these terms so we

117
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,370
run the keywords weekend excellent we
use access data safety k which is used

118
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,740
ET search which has access to it as much
better than any place up so we didn't

119
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,330
exit very flexible so we can do all
these things and or not the thing with

120
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,500
an index that's kind of frustrating is
there certain always characters like a

121
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,900
heightened or a period or a dash it does
not index those google so when I need to

122
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,560
search for an IP address that becomes a
pain because it's not going to have that

123
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,330
dog index that's right to do something
for a proximity search so i can do one

124
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,890
on to within one word of 168 and i'm
going to get that out there except

125
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:09,430
summit I want plum within Bob words of
payer that's the proximity you can do

126
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,920
stemming and fuzzy and incentive we
don't do any criminal investigations

127
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,030
sometimes were hired as an ex is a it's
open expert for the defense we don't do

128
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,500
tell photography but we trying to work
with a capital and they have word lists

129
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,820
that for every case the issue we have
trade secret theft so what sometimes

130
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,230
they know what they're looking for

131
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,870
not the sexiest thing in forensics but
it's still important to help you get

132
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:37,390
down to what you're looking for so
communications conventional email really

133
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:37,960
doesn't

134
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,040
so we're looking at outlook we're
looking at PS days within LSTs that's

135
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,179
getting a lot more difficult

136
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:47,800
the people of them too LOL 365 so now
you just have an OSD so we're still

137
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,290
looking into eventually males webmail
used to be extremely fruitful for us

138
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,339
gmail hotmail email all those were
awesome because it would catch the

139
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:02,050
entire webpage on the device so we know
there's a case study later when i was

140
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,310
able to recover recover hundreds of
young male from the device because it's

141
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:11,199
catched since they look to the JSON
language very little is left on the drop

142
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,010
and it's frustrating i can see to and
from the date i give you time analysis

143
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,480
and see maybe they access the file to
upload it but not nearly as much as what

144
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,529
we used to get and it's extremely
frustrated we do look at attachments

145
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:28,060
people still use their business email
accounts to attach contact list and

146
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,750
sensitive files and send it to the gmail
i don't know i don't want to do it

147
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,870
doesn't bother me because it makes me
successful but they still do it

148
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,800
social networking communication facebook
messages this is huge for us especially

149
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,329
when we are working the divorce case
when you're using facebook Messenger

150
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,510
it's catching all that to the drop these
little snippets so we have scripts that

151
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,380
will pick all that up in a spreadsheet
put in college or and what I pissed in

152
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,240
10

153
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,930
we'll talk text messaging a little bit
later when it comes to mobile devices no

154
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,469
actually will talk about now so mobile
devices there are very few things are

155
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,470
actually a text message so that was
enough

156
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:08,050
so when it's blue that's not a text
message that's awful that's obvious when

157
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,680
it's green

158
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,250
that's a text mrs. Finch what's act if
it's all of these other third-party

159
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,760
those are not text messages and what
throws attorney's office there are well

160
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,709
we'll just call Kari get those Texas

161
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:20,680
well first off the carrier doesn't have
the pair of the Texas they have the

162
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,189
metadata and they only have the metadata
for real text messages so I had to

163
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,520
explain to them that that's not going to
answer your question because text

164
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,400
messages are really there's not a lot of
text messaging left internet history so

165
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,089
internet histories tell a story it's
phenomenal haven't submitted a history

166
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:40,420
test or just if you look at some with
google queries and if you're interested

167
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,890
in seeing this you can actually I want
them because I don't have time &

168
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,870
freelance but I'm use google when you're
logged in it keeps all of your search

169
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,140
queries it keeps every video you're
watching keeps everything that you're

170
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,990
doing while you're logged into google
and you can actually go looking

171
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,810
search histories and you can see your
search histories and when you go back

172
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,819
through that I do that from time to time
you like

173
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,459
yeah i forgot about that you know if
there's a health problem if there's

174
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:07,180
something I'm worried about there's
something bad i plan on doing I'm like

175
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,540
if you remember what was the young girl
that was killed

176
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:17,290
listen Casey Anthony that is a great
case as to how you have to be very

177
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,120
careful but that whole case hands on
those on those searches or whatever that

178
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,980
was the forensic platform didn't read it
properly but that's the only evidence

179
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,950
they had was that search query for
whatever that whatever the poison was so

180
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,220
don't get your search histories if you
don't turn it off

181
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,089
we recover deleted internet history and
it's not it's trivial to do that with

182
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:43,300
the right software we don't do about
hand we have software that doesn't we

183
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,540
don't care what browser you use so we've
seen where something for you use

184
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,990
Internet Explorer to do their normal
stuff and then they'll switch over the

185
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,899
firefox to do different stuff and they
make their bodies covered with they're

186
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:57,250
gonna start thinking well you know i'm
just using her next let's hope we don't

187
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:57,970
care

188
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,060
forensic software reviews we choose
every browser even see monkeys on that

189
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,439
list because the attackers use that for
some reason so we don't care what

190
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,810
browser you're using we're going to get
back first case to facebook check so

191
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:16,479
that's not going to us there was a
suspected affair doing this for 10 years

192
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,720
yes sir I was just as is the history
still there when you use the firebox

193
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:30,730
it's not kidding don't use it that much
and probably a private browsing time if

194
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,529
not all of its going to be there

195
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:36,790
please look like shards of glass you can
pick up some other but you're not going

196
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,449
to get all of it but if it's in the
index file so in every browser does it

197
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,510
differently keeping me when you delete
your internet history

198
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,709
it doesn't even zero out that file it
just kind of deleted it starts a new you

199
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:52,420
can get that but when you're in browsing
mode it's unlikely we're gonna get all

200
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,000
but we see that you went into private
browsing mode which to me would raise

201
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,329
suspicion so when I see that
automatically on your timeline second

202
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,640
are what are they doing it why so there
are legitimate reasons I guess go to

203
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,259
private browsing moment when I

204
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:12,220
that I think something malicious may be
about to have a question

205
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:18,459
so there are suspected fair Deucalion
sorry prospect call me said I think my

206
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:22,179
wife is having an affair with someone
from high school on facebook magnetic

207
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:26,889
head up on facebook again if you've
heard this one before so he said I want

208
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,999
to take a look at so for some reason he
tells her i'm sending this off to a

209
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:33,759
computer forensics company and they're
going to take a look at what you think

210
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:40,359
she did she goes right clears the chat
history i also have some proof that she

211
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:44,259
cleared the chat history from facebook
not from the cash on the drive then she

212
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:48,369
deleted her and histories I didn't care
i was still able to get back to Leni to

213
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,609
chat messages and it was exactly what he
thought that was just that one person

214
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:55,689
and we were able to get all the internet
history back to so it really doesn't

215
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:59,799
matter if you delete the internet
histories and browsing mode hurts

216
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:03,608
we'll talk about anti forensics efforts
which is like a bull in a china shop to

217
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,910
me is worse we'll talk about that with
you there are ways to get around it most

218
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,809
of the time we're gonna cover or have a
reason to suspect something's going on

219
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:16,868
this is one of the most simple cases
I've ever work and the Attorney steel

220
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:21,220
tells this story every time she has an
opportunity so we were brought in for a

221
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:26,079
workplace injury there was a father a
medical facility and so the claim was a

222
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,799
diminished quality of life the claim was
that she was having uncontrollable

223
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:34,480
seizures which is a diminished quality
of life um somehow we were able to

224
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,389
normally have to create a very good case
to be able to someone's personal

225
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:41,379
computer somehow internal was able to
get it and I analyzed so I went through

226
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:45,039
and looking at everything and sometimes
it's the simple stuff I spent days on

227
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,869
this case trying to find something on
the internet research she would research

228
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:54,639
symptoms of her condition overall
doctors now pointing up in time I've got

229
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,689
a headache i'm pretty sure I'm gonna die
according to energy she would do that

230
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,329
but working closely with the attorney
its timing

231
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,659
she only did it about three or four
times and I asked about the state she

232
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:09,100
said I don't know why those are days
before hearings she would research the

233
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,679
symptoms right before the hearings and
that she would demonstrate those

234
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:17,019
symptoms during the hearings so that was
used then she started looking at workers

235
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,200
compensation calculate

236
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,800
yeah if you're following for workers
comp you're gonna be looking at that

237
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,479
this one thankyou researches what
computer forensics box let me tell you

238
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,930
what about little time that you start
for that there was one time that they

239
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,989
actually starts for my day's been good
friends explained by myself and just

240
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,640
kind of freaky because building
forensics like all the goods so we have

241
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,240
that was pretty good and then I started
looking at when are slowly lifted the

242
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,500
pictures flip through the pictures and
she went on vacation a few times her you

243
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,130
can pull it together for the same i get
your family school vacation you're gonna

244
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:49,730
go

245
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,140
she was also going to the owners of our
game anyone been in stadium not so we

246
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,199
can hold a hundred two thousand people
and it's straight up and down

247
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,600
I won't even drink beer at the tailgate
before the game because I'm afraid I

248
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,380
can't get up the steps it is that state
the order tomorrow get those 20 or

249
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,880
30,000 people there so it's hard to get
up-and-down think she's on the field

250
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,260
alright then finally I run across a
couple that my attorney to finally sink

251
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,260
your teeth into this is her

252
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,990
that's our time so if you're a good
defensive start a 60-second real quick

253
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,970
captain needa fitness there was a bear

254
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,800
we had to jump you the other kid jumped
and we're going after their snakes you

255
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,150
may be able to get mom maybe the judge
the jury on tonight or I will let that

256
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,750
slide

257
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:38,300
good luck with this that's her jumping
off the bridge and I know that bridge

258
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,140
that during this time of year is about
20 feet from the water we want this case

259
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,010
it didn't take some awesome CS hasta I
just had to look at the pictures because

260
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,270
people don't realize iphone users you
plug your computer when you plug your

261
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,150
phone into maybe do an update or
something or sick of a playlist if you

262
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,150
don't do that we hear it creates a
backup of your phone to your computer

263
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,079
that's where stuff like this comes from
people don't realize that it's there we

264
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,050
want to guess I'll activity shoes so I
wasn't one top somewhere they were

265
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:11,659
talking about mac addresses Mac without
access and change i will take a step

266
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:17,750
from ntfs has come back be so there's
modified access change and for board is

267
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,280
extremely important because there's two
types of metadata there's filesystem

268
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,379
metadata and dinners application day

269
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,090
my assistant today is when files copy to
that device application metadata says

270
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,350
when that document was created more so
you can have a document for the modified

271
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:38,179
date that's before the creation things
because of that is hard to explain but

272
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,450
that's the board date when was the
document for work not when it was great

273
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:47,120
so we know what documents are created
modified access deleted Conda it's very

274
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,280
difficult to know exactly what if I was
too weak

275
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,149
we know that it's deleted and we know
what it was last access you can behind

276
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,000
and sales to leave it at that time but
I'm very conservative because I've been

277
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,840
kicked in the teeth

278
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,040
lots of counsel the same here's a good
one we know what documents are open when

279
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,820
you double click an icon to open a
document it creates them to call a link

280
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,850
file in that link file even without the
document itself

281
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,959
I know when you open that document the
first time I know the last time I love

282
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,690
the size of the document and I don't
want that document is located

283
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:20,300
specifically network share USB Drive
that can be huge for instance if someone

284
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,669
turns in their resignation on sep tember
not concept / 20th in September 19 I see

285
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:30,080
the development customer list of xls
from a USB drop we need to go to figure

286
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,060
out with a USB drivers so we know where
that's coming from external mas usage

287
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:40,879
again none of this is most of its not to
most people but every time you plug into

288
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,090
USB demas we know every USB storage we
know mobile phones we know anything you

289
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:52,189
plug into that USB port tattoos that
system with a lot of different artifacts

290
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:58,340
it logs registries we know the first we
always even XP we know the first and

291
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,649
last comment about was you and that can
be key is I sho sho Pistons sometimes I

292
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,500
know each time starting with windows
seven started putting things in the vid

293
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,040
walk every time in juice that's big
because now I know first time every time

294
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,330
and last time and sometimes I know how
all you can see when it's plugged it in

295
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,730
and you can see when they upload and
that's you can be

296
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,320
he also model and serial number is huge
when you're looking for advice

297
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:27,889
here's an example that oh ok studio so
it was a discovery very politically

298
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,760
charged discovery matter in which the
reference this case with four times

299
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,160
because

300
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,310
still screwed up everything you could
have done losing the case was thrown out

301
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,669
because i'm going to do i'm actually
it's settled reviews about to be thrown

302
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,570
up ask for a bunch of documents with
specific file names from the computers

303
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,810
and all your video we need this
discovery and then we're also going to

304
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:51,389
look and see if you didn't yank so you
can see we know the internet we know the

305
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,140
product we know the serial number we
know the driver was associated with it

306
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,430
we know the first time we know the last
time we know be installed a that's a lot

307
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,180
of pretty valuable information when
you're piecing together tama the leg

308
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,600
files that was referencing you have told
you about this is that same cruiser

309
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,060
drive everything is redacted here was a
filing with keywords and he was supposed

310
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,210
to provide during discover if you've
ever been in litigation you don't move

311
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,140
up with the discovery process because
that's everything is based off if you

312
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,520
want with the discovery process
sanctions or the case thrown up all

313
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,510
these file names were specific to what
he was supposed to produce so we knew

314
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,490
that he has a USB drive and I know the
exact USB drop that has these files on

315
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,490
that he didn't produce that was huge in
our favor

316
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,419
so let's talk about intellectual
property theft there's a fine line

317
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,720
between intellectual property and trade
secret but this one was intellectual

318
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,450
property little background so medical
device manufacturer create a device that

319
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,350
not a lot of people to larger company in
the same sector trying to buy them about

320
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:57,929
three times and each time they tell them
so they hired hit their lead engineer

321
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:03,690
that designed the product for passing on
your products so the lead engineer lift

322
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,870
went to work for the parent to talk
about and that helps

323
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,409
they're like we're missing some emails
from his email box of manufacturer we

324
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,310
need to get these back and related to
get my output mattress

325
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,450
yes but your league engineer went to
work for the competition is trying to

326
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,030
buy you three times and you're just
worried about simulated diamond

327
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,149
yep can I take a look around some other
stuff you just don't spend too much

328
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:30,270
money each other every time 1222 he
resigned from the government 12-2 not a

329
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:33,960
big deal but what I'm looking for is a
change in behavior whether you realize

330
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,700
it or not everyday you do the same
things on your computer when i'm alive

331
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,140
i'm investigating a person you set that
baseline they're doing the same things

332
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,090
when they start doing this

333
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:48,740
the things you start to get on that 22
before is target company can come work

334
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,360
for another big deal let me know I kind
of know pet 12-team he copied the

335
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,260
projects folder from the network share
to the desktop folder of his laptop I

336
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,950
know it's confusing

337
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,390
laptop desktop / I'll be the project
folder there not a big deal huge deal

338
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:08,149
he had 35 to people because he said we
will never make copies of our DWG sounds

339
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:13,220
no seller no solidworks files are too
everybody a copy because if there's a

340
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,659
copy one of the drop

341
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:18,140
they sent the wrong side to a
manufacturing retirement costing tens of

342
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,490
thousands of dollars

343
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:23,419
he just had to change the behavior he
copied their every one of those designs

344
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:27,080
to his laptop when he told everyone else
not to do that and to never remember

345
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,360
from the puncture see copy down you can
see there's eggs from the desktop you

346
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,590
can see the date then copied it and i'll
explain the headaches you're just a

347
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:44,600
minute 1222 it 110v power is the laptop
on he's an engineer we all work late

348
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:49,189
he had this laptop three years nothing
never been powered down past 930 change

349
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:53,600
your behavior as the device powered on
it found a new USB device it never

350
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,500
simple

351
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,610
so you can see here first i'm connected
december $MONTH twenty-second 611 so

352
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:05,750
this is UTC offset five hours for non
upset non-members thought of hours you

353
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,760
got one way I know vendor product and I
don't see remember when you think about

354
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,840
to happen here

355
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,549
how was it up and then he moved the
project's poser over to the USB drive

356
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:20,480
and i know we moved it because three
times when you turn the laptop off of

357
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,730
two or three that's 50 minutes when you
move a file or a group of files first

358
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,659
you have to copy it and then you deleted
that's what the red X mates so we were

359
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:34,370
able to recover all of those files we
got ripped a black hardware three times

360
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:40,039
50 minutes to move it and emulated still
took us four years to win this case

361
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:50,560
application executions so we know the
first execution date and time of every

362
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,350
application we know the last as we know
the last execution date time we don't

363
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,459
know you know first time last time we
don't have many times we can't see

364
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,840
everything in between

365
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,820
we don't have many many times we know
the user to execute the application so

366
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,030
windows has something called prefix and
when it tries to do from a binary

367
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:15,010
perspective is to be more efficient and
loads a piece of in a PDF PDF file and

368
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,400
it keeps the last hundred twenty-eight
so I know the last hundred twenty

369
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,420
programs and then I can recover deleted
PDF files and rolled off and see more

370
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,600
that's where the entire system that
every two years about that which is the

371
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,929
registry file for user also has
something called user system that has

372
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,170
the same things so we know what
applications where and lots of time

373
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,820
today that can be huge community is so
let's start with what would be

374
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:42,520
considered an easy trade secret theft so
this was a high very helicopter about

375
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,110
Pilar organization in which one of their
lead people are one of their best people

376
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:57,159
resign domain school on a six so they
contact me contact me immediately so

377
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,760
we're really worried because we know he
wants to set up a competing business we

378
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:06,550
need to know what's going off looking to
do queries how do i think another email

379
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:11,800
account to gmail and other user here is
that other people don't use on that sees

380
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,460
what he's trying to do you can
synchronize outlook with gmail so right

381
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,890
here already know he's gonna find a way
to get this data

382
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,850
he's probably got I just need to figure
it out i find the copy sensitive

383
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:26,679
information to a USB Drive show that was
dropbox was installed on march third of

384
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,450
$MONTH 2011 and then uninstalled may six
right before you resign so ask my condom

385
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:36,250
like what's the significance of marks
third and she said oh I remember that's

386
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,310
the day that he got into an argument
with the partners as the direction of

387
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:43,690
the offer so soon as that are happening
here we have a plan to install dropbox

388
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:49,390
yesterday you can see here they removed
it and this is a big deal for you it's

389
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,590
called it the government stuff

390
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:57,439
the application execution as i said i
know we know if executed self i see on

391
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,789
the day i'm a lab at one-thirty know 12
13 p.m. he executed and remove so he

392
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:11,179
went into the Avenue control panel and
remove drugs China the tracks then on

393
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:16,820
makeshift which was the day before first
time connected then installed a kingston

394
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,678
datatraveler serial number first time
that device has never been used

395
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,610
you can see what's about to happen here
he went into a so if your BR person what

396
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,219
has the most valuable information out of
the CRM or out

397
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:34,279
so what most people don't realize he
went into outlook and explore today when

398
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:39,140
you do that it creates this map file on
the local Drive of what you're doing so

399
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,610
csb of an angular which is the address
book and calendar in the email which is

400
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,979
the email so I know this is happening

401
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:51,140
how can i top this USB Drive i know we
just plugged in this map file has the

402
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:56,450
path the name and what was exported so
you know the timeline you can see plug

403
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,860
in the USB drop explore every bit of
this stuff so through this we were able

404
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,350
to get his home computer stuff

405
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:07,639
oh so we did the analysis of the whole
machine that argument was really easy

406
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,779
with the court record look we got this
this and this gives the stuff what you

407
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:15,950
did when he installed dropbox he started
moving over the business secret stuff

408
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,720
it's dropbox sync it up you went home
install dropbox and it's down to some

409
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,909
computer for you . the next day after
makes when he went home he had a

410
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:29,570
different USB Drive helping all that
stuff out the dropbox folder under the

411
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:36,049
USB drive and then the dropbox from home
with you and we obviously want this case

412
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:41,840
metadata so metadata is just information
about information that can be extremely

413
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,709
valuable in the right context so for
instance we don't want to file this is

414
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:51,140
mainly office . adobe not so much we
know when the file was created access we

415
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,580
can see the summers we can see the past
10 offers of a document sometimes we can

416
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:00,168
see the track changes on that's way back
to work those three but sometimes we can

417
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:01,750
see what those changes were because

418
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,200
let's scrub the document prior history
reading histories we don't wanna

419
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,920
documents been print so even now I can
tell you the last time of documents been

420
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,960
printed because it's tagged email his
email headers spreadsheets you know

421
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,050
what's awesome about spreadsheets is
that if you just print a spreadsheet you

422
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,500
don't see the orders and all that we've
had cases in which the formula was the

423
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,180
problem not the results office documents
pictures you know this is a surprise

424
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,990
anything but pictures have you have
location services turned on your phone

425
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:33,670
and take a picture it has a lot of stuff
can remain model resolution you know

426
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,020
what we do it also has at altitude
$OPERAND longitude latitude where you

427
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,440
were standing when you took the picture
so this can be real and in cases like

428
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,160
divorce cases when someone's not
supposed to be a certain place we made

429
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,520
on the stance that no I've never been
there and then we have a picture of this

430
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,690
is worried because this phone and also
we don't know we don't just get Tracy

431
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,960
but when someone's looking for a runaway
if you can get them to take a picture so

432
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,650
i will send it to you sometimes you can
get this but it's kind of scary that

433
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,820
there's that much info

434
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,790
one thing to keep in mind when you
upload your pictures to social media

435
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,350
they scrub this because they realize the
implications of that

436
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:14,139
here's a case that you just call me
today this was last year i think so

437
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,130
story there was a teacher and opiates
which will create spaces like the secret

438
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,610
city that's where we enrich uranium is
like blowing stuff up so he was a

439
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,639
teacher there allegedly had write up
some type of school credit card number

440
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,460
defendant day three carries away of shut
up shut up to the head and incentives a

441
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,880
suicide with family was pretty well off
and I just would not let it die

442
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,950
nope they would let it rest they want to
prove that they really need help in this

443
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:39,760
case of you

444
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,170
so think there was a document that the
model and state law enforcement that was

445
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,890
named to love of my life and it was
actually it's supposed to be you know

446
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,730
the litter which he was claiming is
going to suicide note

447
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:56,410
so this was a knoxville news suicide no
family house computer created the

448
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:01,360
afternoon before his death . . this
document was created was about four

449
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,510
times after . according to the
statements from the hottest hairstyles

450
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,500
for my memo

451
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,220
according to them including the parents
email to local media didn't include the

452
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,220
actual author of the document not need
to talk

453
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,780
remember also stated the nodes and four
times after happened . so i was very

454
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,070
conservative this this is simple right
click properties they put this thing to

455
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:25,379
rest you can see the document was
created on july 24th called the love of

456
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,010
my life

457
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:31,260
here's the kicker any document on $MONTH
twenty-fourth could have been renamed to

458
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:35,158
that that won't change the modified date
of the document to change the following

459
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,179
and I can see there was modified on
Tuesday April twenty-eighth the 2,000

460
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,600
2015 4 days before the document was
given to me for analysis

461
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,080
the other thing is i was on the phone
with her and she said yeah there's been

462
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,689
a couple of times when i close the
document and asked me if i wanted to

463
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,510
save it so i did didn't mess anything up
too much

464
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,690
why are you saying this right when you
look at a document yet so she knew this

465
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,500
was coming

466
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,559
I don't think she did anything wrong she
just wanted the case to go away

467
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,090
last time five answers every sound on so
you know it's a matter so if it all

468
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,689
sound over his account of course it's
going to be create their revision number

469
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:10,950
so we can be remitted more violence four
times revision 1 is the original four

470
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,900
times since that so kind of Atlanta it's
simple stuff like this that when you see

471
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,679
a doctor has been modified horsemen
given to be used

472
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,730
alright I've got to set the states for
this one of the smallest piece of

473
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:28,140
evidence this is that one case i was
referring to what happened here was

474
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:36,780
there was a large company that was being
sued by a small really small competitor

475
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:40,649
and what's called a ketone because the
government was up involved if citizen

476
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:44,130
can bring suit against a private party
on behalf of the government and they

477
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:47,909
give me whatever the findings are
whatever resolutions thank you part of

478
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:54,000
that so this dude had a small company
that competed with this huge company he

479
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,510
finds a key top suit because they were
doing reps supposed to work things out

480
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:02,640
with the government is it takes a lot of
money to pop suit the assumption is he's

481
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,690
being funded by someone else that also
has vested interest in that company

482
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,059
loses this awesome

483
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:12,510
this guy has a lot so we're all thinking
he's involved we haven't been able to

484
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:17,520
type to it so we got the computers
desktop laptop keyword searching 5,000

485
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,639
docks and

486
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:24,160
the first dog that the document that the
Attorney looked at she called me and she

487
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,250
said I've never done this before but
this seems strange to me

488
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,560
what is it so she just looked at the
properties during any discovery which

489
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:37,060
platform you can you see that you have
to do this but the title of the document

490
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,929
was a court filing that he had filed
against them six weeks before

491
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:48,310
alright the author of the document was
the gather we were suspected it was his

492
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:53,620
wife so he used his wife's computer to
create a document to file against this

493
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:58,000
company gave it to him so that time into
the whole thing it didn't solve the case

494
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,290
but it was kinda suspicious because they
can't even depositions and testimonies

495
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:06,460
no no he has nothing to do with this and
does you know how that happened

496
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:12,610
so this just more accepted this is my
favorite place that's my drama you know

497
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:18,159
the accepted you just click on a link
and it will take you know this demo will

498
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,970
show you an exact locations to wear with
anything while we're going to tell you

499
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,570
before you left

500
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:32,020
you've got a little time to figure out
where I live and opportunistic separates

501
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:38,530
I so I love this this is any effort to
consider destroy evidence

502
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,370
the overwhelming majority of the time it
looks like a role in a china shop

503
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:48,219
because you're going to see zero net
files you're going to see applications

504
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:52,630
if executed with names like ccleaner so
they're special program ccleaner on the

505
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,580
unit is if you run ccleaner get if you
run ccleaner and every artifact and i'm

506
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,179
really looking for linked files jump
lists which is a new top of the pile

507
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:07,420
internet history is temporary files it's
all gone i cannot get it back but Mr

508
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,880
Le's get is another one

509
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:16,270
Blake claim and so the truth is the only
way you really get rid of a file truly

510
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:20,020
get rid of it is when you run these
applications it over rocks those sectors

511
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,580
of the disc with zeros and ones and you
don't get it back after that butt-ugly

512
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,389
the show mr. robot shows how to get
through

513
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:33,389
yes mr. robot is very talented the NSA
is also very talented i know i'm talking

514
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:37,619
about slamming it with a hammer and then
burning it is

515
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:41,849
yeah but see when the course requested
that it's really hard to get around it

516
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:46,649
so that's yes you will not get it back
when that happens you know if you can

517
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:49,259
take it shooting it's fun you know
there's a lot of fun ways to get rid of

518
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,760
our crowd loves but you have to reduce
something to the course you need to

519
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,500
produce something that's not in pieces
hurt system utilities actually cause a

520
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,819
lot of problems defrag is my nemesis
because you have all these deleted files

521
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:06,808
over here daddy Frank's job is to
reorganize the files on the disk it's

522
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:12,809
going to overwrite those files that i
want this cleanup obviously you know so

523
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:17,010
I bring this up because same difference
a couple times when we have helped rob

524
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:22,440
the preservation letters to the opposing
side so this was stated specifically and

525
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,529
it is further ordered the entry of this
order

526
00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:30,539
yeah do will not engage in any activity
that could potentially damage data

527
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:32,430
stored on the computer hard drive

528
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:36,058
this would include installing programs
that limit or replicate data normal

529
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:40,710
captured during internet activity and
programs that alter or living on

530
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:44,789
allocate space black space or the
windows registry file or running

531
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:49,440
utilities against the harddrive such as
reformatting or defrag anyone want to

532
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,970
guess what he did

533
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:55,529
soon after receiving use this as I mean
us what he was going to do

534
00:35:55,529 --> 00:36:01,829
lucky I can't make this up desktop
computer so i told you we know the

535
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:07,140
implications are executed clean manager
has the windows disk cleanup you too

536
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:14,250
he received the order i think on 9 15 or
9 15 or 9 20 that order windale meaning

537
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:20,009
it was signed in and give it to rain
clean manager 928 930 actually that's

538
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:27,059
UTC so that's like 430 afternoon the
desktop of you ready for a first-time

539
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:32,849
december $YEAR 13 last time December
25th we showed up on December 27 to pick

540
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:34,700
up the laptop and desktop

541
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,950
they're take 25th read it six times
because once gonna be good enough i need

542
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,359
to run five more towels

543
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,020
the judge love this about the way and
hey you're going on the desktop let's be

544
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,700
consistent doing on the laptop also
claimed manager this one was vista this

545
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,980
one's XP play manager is this cleanup
random 110 which is after he's been

546
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:00,530
given the order not to let the time one
comes in handy dandy runs deep red three

547
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:05,270
dollars if that wasn't enough he also
said leave the internet history him up

548
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:11,509
so he use firefox when you decided to do
was to kill the internet histories then

549
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,150
leave about two hours worth of history

550
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,599
they'll never notice that there's two
hours of history this happened five

551
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,740
hours before we showed up to pick up the
computers so he deleted the histories

552
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,720
and even try to recover because why he
tried to delete and you've got back so

553
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,720
this is slowly and evidence and it
didn't work out

554
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,869
we finally won that case this one so
everyone has that case that the proud of

555
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:41,569
that keep referring to this was the
third forensics case fireworks started

556
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:46,670
on in 2007 and they didn't finish until
2000 let you comfortable because this

557
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,930
one's good this one set precedent so
reports that President that commercial

558
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:55,759
spyler candy bar tab and simple so we
have this young attorney young

559
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,790
attractive tell me something similar
young attractive attorney Mary's

560
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:02,210
established business and this is all
public and i'll leave the link if you

561
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,960
want something entertaining the great
this is it so he owns a lumber yard

562
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:12,050
that's r2p sales two home depots and
wells he's well-established so he had an

563
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:16,640
issue with fidelity in the past has a
couple of kids and they have a habit of

564
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,069
getting into trouble so what she decided
was that we really need to monitor these

565
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:25,609
kids activities on computer because you
know kids get into a log truck there

566
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:31,490
were eight computers and his lumber yard
office they only install it onto the two

567
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:35,990
computers that he uses she also have a
prenup agreement in place that states if

568
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,270
you cheat on me I take you to the
cleaners

569
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,930
let's see where this was going

570
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:45,779
what she did with every time an email it
to him it was automatically redirected

571
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,210
to her yahoo mail account through the
spectra soft blush they relayed that

572
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:54,870
product because I was about six lawsuits
against them so you can see this is

573
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,779
going to email it was rerouted to her

574
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:02,910
you see it flashing report so this is
the actual diagram been together for

575
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:08,069
testimonials and corporate week in this
case the email will be sent to rule and

576
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:11,700
I can't disclose names because it's all
put the email will be sent the boy clone

577
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,629
before it landed on the drive and this
is what was important because the term

578
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:20,010
was contemporaneous with transmission
before it landed on the drop it

579
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:23,460
redirected it to her that made a heart
attack

580
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,210
what she would do if she would take
emails from female business associates

581
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,560
and sit back to her she would modify
them to make it look like rolling was

582
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:37,380
having an affair with them she would
copy these texts off of yahoo mail can't

583
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,430
put in a word document and did you find
to produce in discovery

584
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:46,080
that's just the beginning so that's
what's happening there is there's a link

585
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:53,700
there if you just search clumsy go Henry
I analyzed seven confuse unless his

586
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,480
computers and allowance was able to get
her computer based on some stuff I

587
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,760
recovered hundreds of yahoo emails in
full-time just what was going on every

588
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:08,190
meal yet i have a binder this stick
their work so through discrepancies and

589
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,200
emails being produced in discovery

590
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,350
here's what brought to light is a small
number offices windows for workgroups

591
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:19,020
she used that while she used that lumber
yard has her law office from time to

592
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,320
time it was a weekend in the admin
assistant when help

593
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,950
what do people do when they go to shut
their computers off that computer was

594
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,600
the print server for the company so
crystal golden box and plugs into USB

595
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,310
Drive says she's never seen USB drop
opens three documents from the USB

596
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:39,120
dropped as I could see them and print
them because monday is gonna be hearing

597
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,560
they print because the computers all
admin assistant comes in on Monday

598
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,299
morning hours of the computer is what
spits out on the print Elster emails see

599
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,420
dr. she texting the wrong way cause is
very expensive

600
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,869
you know divorce attorney before
starting college me and I have this case

601
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,219
it worked on a lot

602
00:40:56,219 --> 00:41:00,809
it gets better so she was producing
false documents and discovery and

603
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:06,029
seasoned attorney is the discovery
process is safe and testimony she stated

604
00:41:06,029 --> 00:41:07,469
so in deposition

605
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:11,999
I don't have your USB Drive I know she
plugged into a USB Drive which trickles

606
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:15,089
talking through this i was able to get
her laptop computer

607
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,348
the first thing I did was look for that
USB Drive I knew the serial number of

608
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:22,679
the model number they matched so I
notice you've been using that we've

609
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:27,089
gotten that wrong way which was my
client through this and there's even

610
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:31,319
more to them into really kept saying
bill there was an international

611
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:35,729
agreement that one file was not popular
with the courts and I don't want to

612
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:38,788
interrupt your agreement is but we've
got other stuff anymore . he said it's

613
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:43,619
important because what I sound is what
is not locals five this will never

614
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:47,699
happen is you she was using Windows
works ms works whatever whatever that

615
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:52,589
was the night that he signed the end
enough to agreement that ended up would

616
00:41:52,589 --> 00:41:57,150
have cost him a lot of money there were
two of them copy print one of them was

617
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,179
the one that he signed one of them is
the one that was filed that had another

618
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:03,539
paragraph that make her a very wealthy
woman in the temporary Prince dreams i

619
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:06,719
was able to pull both of those outfits
show they will click she had him sign it

620
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,949
and she changed the back page of filing
with the course she's still practicing

621
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:14,999
on the state of Tennessee I'm sorry she
still has her losses

622
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:20,640
I don't think she's press so it was an
awesome case instead k small if you just

623
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,069
if you just Google climb kou maybe we go
there's a lot of good stuff up for me to

624
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:30,029
based on opinion but I join everybody
left on the story you want to ask a

625
00:42:30,029 --> 00:42:38,819
question ever limit as R let it be using
linux about know what happens when your

626
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:44,880
targets are using look I don't have as
much so there's a there's a couple files

627
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,849
and the it depends on what I'm looking
for is what i'm looking for activities

628
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:53,160
commands and stuff like that there is a
hidden file in the root of each user it

629
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,459
shows all the commands the better you're
mainly looking at timeline stuff

630
00:42:56,459 --> 00:43:00,749
linux and OSX is not as fruitful from an
activity perspective you're looking at

631
00:43:00,749 --> 00:43:04,620
walks and you're looking a little bit of
activity you don't have windows

632
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,620
industry that's where i'm getting a lot
of the stuff from yeah there's not as

633
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,080
much there now minutes from when I our
side

634
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,930
yeah you know we can be pretty
successful there i don't think i've ever

635
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:18,540
encountered uses linux yes i did once it
has a real pain but i found one cast

636
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:22,890
webpages what they were looking for but
yeah it's about I don't enjoy minutes or

637
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:27,330
Mac actually I'm a Mac user and i can do
it i just know that the artifacts it's

638
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,870
not as fruitful and I'm afraid of
missing circle you're hoping that all

639
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:37,920
bad guys stick with the most haha sports
/ they're not bad guys they just did

640
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,990
that things don't we do it so if I'm
looking for photography or you know

641
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,839
things that they should be doing on the
internet I can still do the same

642
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:50,400
internet analysis i can still do keyword
searching is to town Line else's I just

643
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,060
don't have the windows registry is that
I've made and pointers and stuff like

644
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:58,200
that i have on windows it's just much
more proof your question how about

645
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,819
virtual machines if you really want to
be a bad guy getting rid of something

646
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:07,590
and to where no one's going to find it
even mr. robot have a virtual machine on

647
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:12,150
your device power of the virtual machine
do your website have a virtual machine

648
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:17,070
snap it power up the device to your bad
stuff refer to snapshot unless it's

649
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:20,550
going to records anywhere there's a
record that you reverted to snapshot but

650
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:24,510
there's not gonna be anything there many
times if you get an experience and

651
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:28,410
experience forensic analyst will
overlook you a video missed especially

652
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:32,129
if its virtual box or one of the others
it's not for you where they'll see the

653
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,750
prefix or something like what's that

654
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:37,740
just keep moving on there's only been
twice I've encountered that I've not

655
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:42,359
seen anyone do what I've just described
but on ya 3pm to be a real have a

656
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:49,530
desktop with 40 days for him and it's a
real you doing is a repurposed sir from

657
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:58,230
test like I'm sorry like a test lab yeah
well on the nineties but the tip that

658
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:02,190
question was going to be you could
create a virtual machine entirely and

659
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:06,570
never yeah but there's going to be
different with the other line OS unless

660
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,820
they're mens style esxi or something

661
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,960
it's like a windows video I'm going to
see the point or two that began to the

662
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,540
virtual thoughts even

663
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,890
vmware you're gonna have to load that
from you can't keep a ramdisk there all

664
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:23,480
the time you're going to load it from
some of this persistence with some

665
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:33,620
mystics problem is you don't have any
every time you shot that's everything

666
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:41,509
well I'm not trying to figure out how to
be your profession good Father's Day and

667
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:47,270
I'm trying to understand the limits of
what you're doing cause it's if you have

668
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:50,420
someone that knows whenever someone this
does digital forensics

669
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,380
yeah i mean even if you take that the
prefetch stuff does to me but if you

670
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:59,030
rename ccleaner dhc-2 nope ntsc unless
we're going to match up the ashes

671
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:02,330
probably not going to catch it so yeah
there's different ways you can get

672
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:06,200
around it but there's always gonna be
some slip up somewhere

673
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,550
yeah so there's less it may be something
very small but there's going to be a

674
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:15,380
slip-up somewhere because you can't be
that perfect all the time you don't pick

675
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,850
me up

676
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:24,529
all right now this was real quick
government contractors one got cfl with

677
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,890
the computer company computer company
start beating the model the kids and we

678
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:31,790
found that two days before he left he
uploaded the huge bandit and losing

679
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:35,210
because i can't see what's in the cloud
but i can see the activity in the

680
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,830
interactions with the cloud

681
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:41,360
this is a bit and i'm about to run a
tunnel site company are split is a

682
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,220
manufacturer of the device they got into
an argument one would start competing

683
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,430
company and the other ones staying and
somehow the competing companies

684
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:53,600
competing be new everything going on and
company yet and you know the president's

685
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,660
like yeah some people have bits and
pieces of this but I'm the only person

686
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:01,160
that knows everything that email note my
office so we call the full recipe is it

687
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,649
sweep the place and gossip nothing here

688
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:07,940
I don't do an awful he didn't may be
able to help you soon be off in the

689
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,940
afternoon and a couple of things but
nothing that was their assets in your

690
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:17,780
computer so this was after a sum of the
spyware and a reputation for being

691
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:22,370
upfront vs Power but what happened here
is that once i got it and started

692
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:27,350
looking i can see through user since
someone ran a tw6 so it goes

693
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:31,790
oh that's where watch it was funny about
that is on their website stated house

694
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:37,279
spyware is so still not even the NSA can
do work for me was previously mechana

695
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,330
saying I don't even need so i took a DVD
eventually friends again is converted to

696
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:46,670
a video is a must include up first thing
I did was reach out to data . when

697
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,020
watching better . com

698
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,710
so obviously didn't audit network
communications it was even HTTP not even

699
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:56,030
https something are its active it's
there

700
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:59,900
I know what's going on if I could just
add that to a person we've got something

701
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:05,390
so just using parts are core here
whatever you want to call it the top i

702
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:09,379
can see here I have the account RB I
have a computer and i have a login ID

703
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:13,220
someone have used a credit card number
to connect so I don't have something

704
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:17,089
about that time the FBI stepped in and
told I don't know what happened with it

705
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:21,170
but I had it too much and I have a good
relationship the FBI smoking fun but I

706
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:24,470
added this one on a silver platter and
this is what i call the Triple Crown

707
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:31,160
mirror so this dude internet talk about
internet insider threats this guy is

708
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,089
companies in California this guy was
fired from his company without thinking

709
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:38,990
it through and we work to help people to
have plants get rid your sowlaty person

710
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:44,240
they didn't follow any contacts what
they gave us a fire they disable his ID

711
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,569
account resetting the domain
administrator account and forgot about

712
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:53,270
stuff like 10 ppm log me in i was access
was removed on 124 two-and-a-half months

713
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:58,400
later guess it's kind of ticked at this
point someone connected into VPN went

714
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,610
straight to the main controller started
working on cracking passwords care

715
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:07,520
benefits of craft was the links 125
someone comes back into it installs b

716
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,800
and c est you because since they're
sensitive computers and CCTV systems

717
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,420
that have VNC start promoting and so
this person knew exactly where they were

718
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,680
going what they were doing

719
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,710
I'll I got fired 11pm to almost up to

720
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:26,630
so you can access it appears on the CCTV
must have more attention on

721
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,240
closed-circuit recordings like a month

722
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,939
there are six months

723
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:37,390
evenin deleted certain frames sorry
someone he or she may be started access

724
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:41,920
and bottoms like credit card and blow .
email because this person may be the

725
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,119
supervisor does the supervisors name
clearance data should be stored

726
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:50,650
clearance date anyway but he starts
accessing that bonus letters credit card

727
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:56,290
info scan documents he knows he or she
was around this stuff is it starts

728
00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:01,540
access to joining someone connected back
into the computer recover the password

729
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,920
from the previous thing was being used
we don't have subpoena power so i don't

730
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,599
know all the other piece matched up I
know to give to the BPM marks they

731
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:14,980
access used-book mail from they had a
small business server so you got

732
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:20,290
everything is on that one server you
gotta change ID everything databases

733
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:25,420
that's what is connected to you she was
connected to use webmail to access the

734
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:30,970
Attic director's email and purchasing
manager say some previous credit felt

735
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:35,109
the pale he started placing online
orders you can see the owner's through

736
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:39,279
the web cache then start searching more
credit card info so you know you can

737
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,950
distribute the load so when you do that
little even if even a flywheel search

738
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:50,020
research and windows the registry keeps
that car credit car realize the season

739
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:54,250
truck has brought idea so the operating
system is on see everything else is on

740
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:57,579
deep databases exchange that's what
problems with their attention because

741
00:50:57,579 --> 00:50:59,589
he's like I need to destroy the evidence

742
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:03,970
let our drops he wasn't responding you
can't format a drive that you're logged

743
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:07,868
into so he was able to format the drive
and the email they were able two weeks

744
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:11,650
but all these artifacts left on Sandra I
don't know whatever happens this when

745
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:16,599
they turn it over to the FBI last one
which is a good look from a global

746
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:21,040
perspective that means we can about the
hostage divorce this one with a stakes

747
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,290
so there's the suspected of better with
an executive he goes on vacation with

748
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:30,220
this payment and for some reason decided
to use the Sun ipad to continue a

749
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,959
conversation with his mistress

750
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,500
so as soon as he moved in with his
account and send her that first message

751
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:42,520
it downloaded the entire thread to that
happen to us son sees it is it small

752
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,220
alternate turn

753
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:50,220
with me because everything synced up and
so I didn't really have spent a lot of

754
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:56,069
time on this one to recover as you can
see you know it's tough you're not and
