1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,820
alright everybody thanks for coming out
to the last talk of the day sometimes

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,000
more about for the last talked and so
appreciate everybody coming or going to

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,160
talk about fantastic so red and blue
teams working together just a little bit

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,880
about myself like 71 boss penetration
tester work at the Krusty tech fancy

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,309
t-shirt i also have been with the
backtrack project since almost a one and

6
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,180
throughout the transition kali linux I
don't really work on the project too

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,329
much anymore but like that is basically
my background comes from all of that

8
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:51,629
work stations and i'm also a co-founder
about derby on security conference also

9
00:00:51,629 --> 00:01:01,530
importantly I'm not a cissp so that
others anyone can we now and by handle

10
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,080
off whether used to be great but i
changed it

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,670
d to political cell i need to be on CNN
and they wouldn't put that on there so

12
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:28,650
liberal box so anyway wanna talk about
is red team routine testing and

13
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,310
there's been a lot of officer with the
past few years about it i know that it's

14
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,070
been a hot topic and heavily talking
about sort of the difference in between

15
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,860
what some of the other people are
talking about what what I wanted to talk

16
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,350
about is that most of the stuff that
people talked about purple teams and red

17
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,970
blue teams working together was all sort
of theory you know that it would be

18
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,270
really great if we could do this and you
know everybody hold hands and sing

19
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:00,300
Kumbaya off the reality is that very few
more actually executing these types of

20
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:06,270
tests and so me and my team have
actually been executing several purple

21
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,679
team tests past two years and so when I
talk about some of the stuff that I've

22
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,140
learned from those tests and you know
some of that some of the challenges that

23
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,179
we had some of the things that work

24
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,360
so what's interesting about security
today is that basically everywhere I go

25
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,410
you know what used to be back in the
days that security companies were

26
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,609
struggling for money and it's never
nothing . easily didn't have in all this

27
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,519
kind of stuff right now it seems that we
have an influx of cash you know we've

28
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:44,430
got all these people get hacked right so
here's just a couple highlights from the

29
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,790
last year's we obviously know that this
list would go down like eight more

30
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,470
screens that we wanted to but the thing
is is that high-profile before getting

31
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,280
hacked and you know sea level people in
these organizations are actually

32
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,120
starting to get worried about it you
know they're hiring equal and throwing

33
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,030
all this money at the problem and so
that type of thing there is no longer an

34
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,100
issue right but the problem is that
we're actually still getting half right

35
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:17,010
people we got money you got stuff and so
you don't talk about why we're still

36
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:22,950
getting act so the number one thing is
this guy

37
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,970
hey buddy got this guy calling you all
the time so unfortunately and I you know

38
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,570
I'm gonna call out anybody in particular
but unfortunately there's a lot of

39
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,209
companies

40
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:40,240
still doing penetration testing sort of
gold standard whey right come in and

41
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,240
they any you know smashed up and they
and get don't add in the generator work

42
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,990
with some kind of some kind of tool or
something

43
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:54,490
Eric recommendations that you know I
have no making sense your environment

44
00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:01,570
and you don't know what to do right so i
was happy to the situation is now you

45
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,380
know that security is becoming more
popular dollars cash now what's

46
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,420
happening is the salespeople are selling
red team engaged right that's awesome

47
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,619
they do that in the military so it must
be awesome and so you have this guy

48
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,360
telling you that your red team game and
what they're saying is you need you know

49
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,790
even adversary need a targeted attack
somebody that you know to pretend like

50
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,430
they're from China or whatever the case
may be right and so you know that's what

51
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:36,790
we in turn the rent and so this is
becoming the hottest you turn you over

52
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,720
the past couple years my god I can't
even places out work that salespeople

53
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,670
have been guilty of literally calling
anything that they can already because

54
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:51,340
it sounds really sexy so that the
problem with that is that you know once

55
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,840
again all were really doing and you know
nine times out of ten is renting

56
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,280
situations is traditional World War II
independence right the terms of the

57
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,750
industry I've been misused a lot over
the last you know past couple of years a

58
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,990
lot of times you'll get you'll just get
the necessary and i'm not saying

59
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,030
intercompany a lot of companies build
their pen test all right you hire a

60
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,659
venture to do your penetration testing
they come in and they asked to be

61
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,310
whitelisted and they're running Nessus
and all these scanners on day one that's

62
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,270
not testing as far as I'm concerned
that's just you know conducting a

63
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,260
security assessment based on the results
of the skin right i'm not saying that

64
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,140
they're just getting monkeys because
they're going in there validating all of

65
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,320
those findings and they're using another
tool they're making sure it was funny

66
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,750
too

67
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,680
actually accurate but that's not
following the breadcrumbs of an actual

68
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,220
attack right so that's not going to
happen in a targeted attack

69
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,080
there's three ways generally that you're
you know company gets compromised on the

70
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,950
inside so the reason we do the internal
assessments is simulated insider right

71
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,520
so there's a couple of different ways
that can happen one of us from phishing

72
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,810
attacks so users computer gets
compromised so at that point the

73
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,140
attacker already has to set the domain
credentials and there's already a

74
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,680
specific path of stuff that they will do
with those credentials and none of them

75
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,770
involve Nessus anonymous FTP and sslv3 I
can promise you that right now right and

76
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,419
so the other things that you have is
somebody plugging the road device into

77
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,599
your network now that guy's definitely
starting from square one right he

78
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,500
doesn't happen but once again he's going
to be going after the network traffic

79
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,650
you know talk a little bit more about
some of the easy wins the second but

80
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,370
he's going to be going out for password
hashes network traffic and then the

81
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,810
third way is a disgruntled employee and
once you get that employee already has

82
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:41,630
some type of axes so the problem with
the ready to come into the organization

83
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:47,030
and think they're really also and plug
it in the network and they you know rip

84
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,929
through and get domain admin and they do
all of this really cool stuff and they

85
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:57,950
show you have screenshots and I love
each other and you know they that you

86
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,280
know everything is really great and then
they leave and then you're basically

87
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,349
stuck with you know how did they write
and so you might you might get a little

88
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,860
more you know I've seen a lot of good
reports I've seen a lot of reports in my

89
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,030
opinion if you can take every single
vulnerability in a report and recreate

90
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,520
the issue even if nobody on your team
knows anything about it you know that

91
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,950
it's not technically didn't really do
you any good

92
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,039
right did I really give your
recommendation that can help you

93
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,590
so a lot of people think that you know
penetration testing is this magical

94
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,239
black are right and a lot of the guys
that

95
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,610
in an honor red team one hand like this
it's not i was still using the same

96
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:44,910
techniques that I better use it for the
past ten years to organizations now

97
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,020
sometimes a new technology comes out and
you bypass or do something with

98
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,818
fundamental theories that were using
other still the same and so the problem

99
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:59,220
is is that obviously there's some sort
of discount right for some reason the

100
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,639
stuff that we're coming in and testing
its not getting so a couple of easy with

101
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,710
that I normally find the organization's
just going to always really wake up eat

102
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,388
you can even be brave and raise your
hand got up anyway you don't believe it

103
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:19,500
or not I don't know how many birthdays
we have to this thing that they're

104
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,919
becoming a nice you will find this every
now now we're getting better right

105
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,810
most people you know but what does take
it is 40,000 3d basically was its

106
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,370
support to get rid of it right there are
still people there's still people with

107
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:43,289
this out this is my favorite anybody run
tom cat on their network this is

108
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:48,329
basically my favorite vulnerability ever
and the reason is because i find it off

109
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:53,339
every single penny and it's never in the
production of appointments it's always

110
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:58,320
in the developer . so what happens is
the developers spin up a box and call

111
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,790
itu no I need a server you don't need to
be on the filmmaking and I needed to do

112
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,649
this and I need to install Tomcat and so
you know somebody does that for vegas

113
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:10,800
leave all the defaults for the developer
warning

114
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,689
well the developer doesn't care because
he doesn't care of his child and so he

115
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,620
started to build a platform on top of
they're all running on the default

116
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,750
talking application so for anybody that
doesn't know you know Tom hat basically

117
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,620
runs a lot

118
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:32,339
permanent job in the desert so it's
absolutely trivial compromised system it

119
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:37,020
was not a tomcat i actually found one is
all recently so I wanted to hold in

120
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:44,279
their comcast 730 another favorite that
never goes away as cold fusion love

121
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,080
coldfusion we actually not so good with
coldfusion that it has a pass the hash

122
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,600
attack where you can basically login
with your hash after you do AF after you

123
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:02,850
actually knew a anyway there's the end
of the attack that that brings up the

124
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,110
hash of of the of the admin user and
then you can login with that hash so we

125
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,390
actually created a google chrome plugin
couple friends on and yeah basically it

126
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,960
pulls the hatchet just lost you write it
and you never even seen it just happens

127
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,040
so that's pretty fantastic contribution
a lot

128
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,660
this course is my all-time favorite the
summer 2016 password i know people are

129
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,529
in the audience laughs but I've gotten
more times with this year you could ever

130
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:32,520
imagine

131
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,560
absolutely insert got it works every
time

132
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,339
with the season now we're rolling into
winter so hopefully we got some winner

133
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,980
2016 but but but you know it's almost as
easy as enumerated the user names from

134
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:54,779
application summer 2016 deployment this
configuration this is my favorite day

135
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,790
ever heard about that is spoofing pretty
popular to a corresponding that does it

136
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:06,420
so so hardly anything uses an ice right
but it's difficult to turn off and

137
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,670
actually require some effort you know
manpower go inside the environment and

138
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,689
turn it off

139
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,490
so those people don't want to do it i
made successors what's called lnr voice

140
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:23,939
which is local link multicast name
resolution and once in Windows visit

141
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:28,618
introduce that to sort of take the place
of netbios is the windows protocol so

142
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:32,879
it's absolutely fantastic what it does
basically you know you set up a rope

143
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,809
server and transfers you're dumping
hashes across the environment that's all

144
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:40,649
complicated and i'm not going to get
into and totally but it's so easy to

145
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:41,639
turn off

146
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:48,989
it's literally one gpo policy-setting
quick it's gone you know but we're not

147
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:53,639
doing that i found that on every pen
test that I've been on this year in fact

148
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,379
it's so common that just do that and
then i put it to the side and I don't

149
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:08,189
even use that environment anymore
because I almost feel like you know

150
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:12,419
patchy we're doing a lot better matching
went windows

151
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:18,269
the problem is all of our other stuff
that's not right that doesn't usually

152
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:22,139
make it into the backside and I realize
that that's not a lot of people told me

153
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,739
like when you look at like an Adobe
cycle and you want and it's like weeks

154
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:32,970
542 bugs that she you know whatever
you're like so so it's just cracking

155
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,829
software to do about it but up but what
actually is still a really big issue

156
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:42,899
another only big issue is that i don't
see a lot of organizations running their

157
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,989
own vulnerability scanners this is
getting a lot better but these things

158
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:51,629
are so cheap i mean like to nessas like
12 bucks a year something I mean like it

159
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:59,159
it's literally absurd not be running
your own vulnerabilities and so the

160
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:04,349
reason that's important is because not
attend an organization i find someone

161
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:07,679
hey you're right and I'm to the
organization and I get every one of

162
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,379
these things that we just started
talking about that

163
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:14,069
like did I even really need to be there
did you even do your due diligence for

164
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:19,409
the vulnerability scans did you even
check for you know like every scanner no

165
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:21,209
catches tomcat tomcat

166
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:28,378
coldfusion all that stuff lights up any
vulnerability scanner so where i'm going

167
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:31,649
with that is once again like I've been
saying we've been using the state

168
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:36,269
techniques you know same methods and
their user compromise remember

169
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:40,259
exploitation and finding the post
exploitation so the one thing that's

170
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,439
become the most important to me to show
customers is pivoting and most

171
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:46,889
exploitation so this is what people
really care about where you should be

172
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:50,939
caring about an organization there's
always going to be a remote code

173
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:51,599
execution

174
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,470
there's always gonna be you know
somebody that didn't set the right

175
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,089
password or something right

176
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:02,519
keeping up with that type of stuff is
impossible however if you can live it

177
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,540
the movement that somebody could do with
an organization you're doing way better

178
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,498
than most

179
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:11,999
right so so I like to tell people to
think of it you know instead of the old

180
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:15,749
school like castle wall effect . let's
build our perimeter up as high as

181
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:21,179
possible is to look at it from a
situation i'm like okay i know it's so .

182
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:25,439
this computer is going to get it just
did it because it's just it's so what

183
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:31,980
can i do to mitigate that user here you
know whatever forgetting anywhere else

184
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:42,059
my network so now i'm going to enter the
blue team so i don't really bad for the

185
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:48,689
blue team guys there's make let's give a
shout-out booties so I feel really bad

186
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:52,860
for the blue team is really the reason
is is because you know number one I get

187
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,480
to blow an organization i usually don't
have any rules I get whatever I want and

188
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,199
I just run over the place and I give
them a report on like all this stuff is

189
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,128
wrong and then I back right and so
that's how it used to be and and I

190
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:09,629
really didn't feel like always making a
difference like a lot of those times

191
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:13,199
because I don't know especially when I
come back the next year and you have the

192
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,459
same issues and I said it was critical
and I'm like you know why why did you

193
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,459
get this fixed

194
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:23,380
and so what we did you know and trust a
sec we started to look back like what

195
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,000
are responsibilities right i mean i get
easy for me to say well I gave the order

196
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,750
to fix it so it's your fault right but
it's not really the case right so a lot

197
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,400
of times we get tired to be like a you
know I got trusted advisor and a lot of

198
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,459
the companies are smaller and they don't
have big security they might not

199
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:44,590
understand what is to insert the
implications of turning on all or any of

200
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:49,330
that kind of stuff they might not know
that you know encoded powershell man

201
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,560
gets by basically you know any execution
policy or whatever some people just

202
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,579
don't know that and so not everybody can
be offensive but you know not ever going

203
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:02,050
to be offensive but there's hockey
reason why we can't work together and so

204
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:08,469
what it looks like most of the places
after i'll leave you know this guy he

205
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:13,450
said that his desk with my reward right
i do I mean like I literally have to

206
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:19,570
find one whole not always find one hole
into the organization and you know good

207
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:25,630
blue team has thousands of thousands on
thousands of holes so it's not really

208
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:31,180
fair you know unless I'm helping that
guy all right so that's wrong all we got

209
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:38,260
a pretty big disconnect right and so
what we've been doing is trying to him

210
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:46,030
to extend our assessments a little bit
more so that so that we can come in and

211
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:50,530
we can help with the blue team
activities right and so normally what

212
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:55,540
that consists of is finding out what
technologies that have in place you know

213
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:01,150
a lot of times we all like this on
anybody's products but i'm going to but

214
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,240
anyway so you know a lot of times i go
to an organization

215
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:10,599
finish the test and they're like hey you
know why didn't our you know sorry what

216
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:16,899
is our fire I catch you know and I'll be
like you guys are I'm playing up and so

217
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,459
you know what that's nothing against
fire I like technologies are fine and

218
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:24,850
definitely have a place in the process
but I know this is a lot of times

219
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:29,350
they're configured properly and my whole
company we were are you know how you got

220
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,320
a reseller and we so you know ninety
percent of our business with selling

221
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,559
product and then there was the little
consulting group that I work in and what

222
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:39,490
I noticed over the years was that was
that what would happen is you would get

223
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,300
you know like fifty thousand dollar
budget the bottom you know I firewalls

224
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,669
making this up or whatever and they
would spend 47,000 you know 47,500

225
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,690
dollars on the firewall and then they
would only have like you know two grand

226
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,790
left have some you know for a level guy
come out and configure rather than you

227
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,330
by a piece of technology that was a
little bit cheaper actually spending the

228
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,678
time to bring expert in make sure that
it can easily work with the rest of your

229
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:12,250
women that so I see that more times you
know not where so many devices in the

230
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,809
network not working together and you
know the information is somewhere that's

231
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:19,960
another good point that comes up on
these tests all of the topics that there

232
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,040
is a huge difference between what I
really like is when they come into the

233
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:30,879
room and they see mr. here and then they
all right back to their computers slunk

234
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,660
and like whatever else you know and you
know down in the bottom you know find

235
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:40,450
something novel in there like you know
how like look there's a really big

236
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,490
difference between you know Cee Cee and
you know figuring out I was thereafter

237
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:51,520
right and so you know most places have
logging in place but it's such a massive

238
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,830
operation that you're not actually seen
and liked law all the days you know

239
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,970
that's fine but you're not working on
anything else

240
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,020
don't wear no one actually were
anomalies that you're with just wasting

241
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,690
terabytes space long years so one of the
first things that we like to talk about

242
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:17,550
all these assessments is I love this
term paper but you know I used to make

243
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,840
fun of the whole lot like cell but but
it's actually actually true right so

244
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,000
basically there's definitely some things
that you can do as a routine you know

245
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,850
that don't require some super offensive
Red Team Ninja right you know scanning

246
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,270
remediation retest all that to the
vulnerabilities

247
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:42,389
it's not that hard to scan for the
vulnerabilities you know go in there by

248
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:48,210
or ties in some fashion and you know
gonna win and validate them with some

249
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,680
you know third-party to let me have to
talk to me about a funny I mean it's

250
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,120
like with pearl or some other Linux
command line tool right it's not rocket

251
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,090
scientists definitely not black magic

252
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,230
another really important thing that we
see is sanctioned vs rewards and

253
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,750
companies like a lot of people you know
don't want to work security issues

254
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,740
because they don't want all the help
desk and say you know I just click on

255
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:20,400
this link and her to be that you know
that great you know how we want to be

256
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,770
that person because they think they're
going to get in trouble but what i have

257
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:28,950
seen work is a no rewards type program
like for example every time you were out

258
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,660
we had a place I was added that just
implemented a program where every time

259
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,470
reported a suspicious email or an
attempted fishing attackers on the way

260
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,910
that everybody would get entered into
the drawing a hundred-dollar starbucks

261
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,110
card or something like that

262
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,669
whatever but the point is is that a gay
people reason to actually like report

263
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,119
stuff you know now granted of it

264
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:55,609
bunch of reporters nonsense try
starbucks card however i'd rather they

265
00:20:55,609 --> 00:21:01,188
were bored too much stuff than none at
all right so I don't know third-party

266
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:05,359
testing right i mean like third-party
testing is important and i will not play

267
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,319
that all I mean we still be doing our
due diligence with your batteries

268
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:13,249
penetration thats all that kind of stuff
but the thing is that we need to take it

269
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:16,999
a little bit farther because over
currently doing is really not working

270
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:22,669
one of the biggest questions that i ever
get on this summer I gene step is you

271
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:25,729
know how do you want with my boner
ability management program is working

272
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:30,589
right I've got so many vulnerabilities
like even keep trying but you know I

273
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:36,708
just keep getting on past you know and
one of the ways to find this out is our

274
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:38,689
way to get tested

275
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:42,829
are they finding a different way in
every single time right so the goal for

276
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:46,609
me on the inside when i'm bringing a
penetration tester I know they're going

277
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:50,899
to get in some right there's something
that they're gonna do that's gonna get

278
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:54,468
them what I don't want it to be
something different than when they were

279
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:58,759
here the last time because I fix that
the last time right and I wanted to be

280
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:03,409
something different and more importantly
what I really want is I want to be able

281
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:07,879
to see what they're doing right i want
to be able to detect their activities

282
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:13,789
one of the other main things that we
help people do on the inside is

283
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:18,979
assessing their maturity model right and
so you know day Kennedy that founder of

284
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:23,629
our company and one of the guys started
to be hung with you know he was

285
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:27,379
instrumental in writing the penetration
testing execution standard they

286
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:32,988
overheard that couple people what that
is basically is is that is a guideline

287
00:22:32,989 --> 00:22:36,499
whole lot of penetration testers got
together and we actually developed

288
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:43,519
standard that a we wanted to follow
penetration test of work early for me

289
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,719
it's for our actual clients and the
people that are buying meditation test

290
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:53,299
to go in and it will tell you whether
you got what you paid right it will tell

291
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:54,330
you what I meant

292
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:59,970
in it and you know is it is it the wall
fact and all y'all know however there's

293
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,289
over 300 security you know experts that
got in on this and got together and

294
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:05,940
decided it was a good idea

295
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,860
so if you're on the side of buying these
type of test if you're not sure you're

296
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,760
getting what you're supposed to be
getting your jump on over to the test

297
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,110
and take a look through it and see how
it goes over everything from Discovery

298
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,668
pre-engagement interactions all that
kind of stuff did that stuff happen you

299
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:30,269
know what was it just hang up on you
have gone you know because I mean all

300
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:38,039
about you but I'm not ours for that so
then you got just got his back

301
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:43,110
I got a sweet product right I'm not
picking on anybody but there are some

302
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:50,219
products that claim they can solve 99%
99% years but so this is the guy that we

303
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,820
all went around right one of the cool
things about my company is that were

304
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,120
vendor agnostic we don't sell any
products whatsoever we're not sponsor

305
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,110
buying by your thing like when you asked
me what problems are like the only

306
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,129
feedback that i have is what gave me a
really hard time on the last penetration

307
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:10,200
that's really all I'm going to do these
products i don't have a higher i am home

308
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,360
where you know anything I I all I know
is that you know last you know companies

309
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:26,490
on our last year have been admitted this
this way and you know was a real so I a

310
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,340
lot of talk about some more stuff you
know whatever hard so hard

311
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,689
purple team engagement right the main
thing that word is this also it says

312
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:39,480
this all the time the product industry
has literally set us back insecure

313
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:46,740
literally probably at least ten years
and the reason being is that we been you

314
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,730
know

315
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:53,100
it all goes back to the cash right so so
we're in security positions you know

316
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,149
giving us all people and they're giving
us all this cash we don't know what to

317
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:02,040
do and on and on this side and we have
all these product companies saying i

318
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,780
have a product that will fix your
problem and that's not to say that these

319
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:12,480
products don't work the problem is is
that i have yet to see a product that

320
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,670
does everything and I get to see a
product that even does its full job

321
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:24,120
completely without some type of smart
person behind it you know a perfect

322
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,040
example you know let's just say you know
i got like a login mechanism like slump

323
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,889
right so longest fantastic fantastic two
logs everything right but don't know if

324
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:39,300
you don't have somebody that knows how
to write a lot very well then it's

325
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:45,149
basically useless gonna do it right so
like we've been conditioned to rely on

326
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:49,170
all of these products right and they
give them names and you know i got i go

327
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,900
places all the time and they're like oh
you're gonna have a really hard time

328
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:58,410
because we got the next shit our walls
like oh ok how is that different than

329
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:01,860
your boobies firewall they can't even
tell me right they don't even know what

330
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:07,320
the differences or whatever so
unfortunately I you know we're having a

331
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:13,560
lot of product problems with product and
so that's one of the reasons why one of

332
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,340
the most important things when you do
you know I call this the deck with

333
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,030
traditional penetration test right this
is basically what i'm talking about here

334
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:27,270
is that like is that we too instead of
you know doing this copper adversary

335
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:31,650
simulation like under-the-radar like all
this house stuff like that's what I used

336
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:37,440
to think was the best use of school you
know like slipping and I United catch me

337
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,240
you know wall and all this kind of stuff

338
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,990
I used to think that was also the call
was at the end of the day like I did

339
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:51,400
feel like I hope the blue team protect
against me the next time so what works

340
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,809
better for me is to is to you know go
with more of an open process right and

341
00:26:55,809 --> 00:27:00,309
so watching people talking about this
whole thing or whatever so little

342
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:03,910
evidence no means different stuff to
different people but what it means to be

343
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:09,040
is that is that we come in together you
know I i make friends with the blue team

344
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,210
but you know what

345
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,500
come in and talk about what technologies
we have we did a really big one getting

346
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,160
this year that went really well we went
down you know it's a fortune 500 company

347
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,240
we went down and basically they got us a
whole conference room there were

348
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,580
monitors all around the opportunity when
we have you know slump guy black guy and

349
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:32,080
you know whatever other stuff to add
going on the other guy everything and

350
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,639
every individual person basically put
their product you know up on the screen

351
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,270
for their technology that they were in
charge of you put that up on the screen

352
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:44,679
and what we did is a red team was we had
come down the week before we had just

353
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:47,500
done all of the attacks and make notes
and all that kind of stuff

354
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,090
what we have done is we have constructed
use cases that would show each of the

355
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:56,860
attacks in action we do step by step
further people because the other thing

356
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,740
that the 18 people don't always
understand is if they're not working

357
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,000
with us and they you know they might
seem like a powershell something rather

358
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,340
you know in slow but if they don't
understand the process how we go through

359
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,020
the actual engagement at the things that
makes sense to us you want movement it's

360
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:18,610
ten times harder protected right we need
to be totally transparent without these

361
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:22,360
attacks for because the stuff that we're
going to penetration testers is the

362
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,330
exact same stuff that hours you and out
right you know

363
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,909
powershell mean cats like all that kind
of stuff you know even past

364
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:35,490
actually it still works best same way
that malware replicating the network so

365
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:42,750
basically here we got like my gangster
been going so basically we got you know

366
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,290
now we've got a situation where the red
and the blue team can work together and

367
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,680
it's less adversarial I don't have
anyone hears a penetration tester but

368
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,260
have you ever gone to do with
organization and sat down and like he

369
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:59,670
wants all her you know over there and
I'm gonna stay on you know you can so I

370
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,910
I never like that i always felt like
they didn't want me there you know I

371
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:08,940
mean I don't like don't be like hoping
maybe on saw whatever but what I want to

372
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,050
feel like I'm actually helping I don't
want them to not like me i want them you

373
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:18,149
don't want them to think that on there
like you know cause them pci issues or

374
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,800
anything like that because on the right
the number one thing I tell people is

375
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,409
your equations like this

376
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,220
yeah dying on the window right I can't
tell you how many times I've seen you

377
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,820
know this job but it's serious like
people have stuff like this in their

378
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:40,290
organization probability x risking know
whatever so this is obvious answer right

379
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:47,340
there is no formula protects against
attack so what kind of stuff should we

380
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:53,250
be spending our time right so this is a
russian-made figure out slot slip

381
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:58,740
through the editing process so anyway
there's a lot of stuff that can be done

382
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:06,060
your organization and it doesn't require
buying tampons you know it may work i'm

383
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,570
not going to say it doesn't require
money because the stuff requires you

384
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:14,040
know manpower hours you know maybe
bringing in experts training that kind

385
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,330
of stuff

386
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:21,559
I guarantee you that it doesn't involve
more product go hard and so I number one

387
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,029
anyone that knows me knows I'm a huge
fan of network segmentation everything

388
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:31,880
life if you have a firewall you can do
network segmentation right it's

389
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,360
literally like rules and textiles you
just have to know what you're doing

390
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,379
obviously right I love big fan of
network segmentation and i'm a big fan

391
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,880
of people getting the week purpose that
you're supposed to my favorite example

392
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,710
is the HR department right everybody's
got an HR department and so you as a

393
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:54,500
security we H on because their whole
entire job is to open up pdfs and word

394
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,730
documents all day

395
00:30:55,730 --> 00:31:01,940
that's a whole job so I want them a lot
of my fireman right there so I so

396
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,330
perfect example is if you take my
business

397
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,199
that's right go to the HR department and
you're like look what these people

398
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,700
really need access to 18 authenticate
and they probably can access to some you

399
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,169
know database thing that they were in
their HR information into on what it's

400
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:22,370
called but whatever and so you know
where they keep track of all that what

401
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:26,239
else they want access to the server
reviewing my access to members are

402
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,809
wanted access to the DMZ that's right so
you can call and there you know

403
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:37,399
lower your attack surface just find that
way so i'm going to family ever

404
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:42,379
segmentation based on business units you
know what I education and awareness

405
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:48,230
no i mean like are you ever going to fix
everybody know however you can cut the

406
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:52,100
attack surface down right so there's
nothing wrong with you and education and

407
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,889
awareness there's plenty of companies
that you don't have training on this

408
00:31:54,889 --> 00:31:58,850
kind of thing the one thing that will
recommend it especially on fishy

409
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,039
education and user awareness

410
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,429
I've seen it not be as effective when a
company comes in and puts a bunch of

411
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:08,930
like nigerian prince examples and stuff
on board or whatever like that's not

412
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:13,790
what I've seen be really effective as a
company actually doing official test and

413
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:18,320
then coming in and following it up with
a presentation and actually email that

414
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,790
everybody you know is compromised by all
the board like hey does everybody

415
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:28,520
remember this you know other people like
haha now you know but that makes it

416
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,980
actually being great in there right into
real it's no longer I 419 scammers no

417
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,210
joke or whatever like it's actually real
so that type of stuff works a lot better

418
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:46,190
up I'm gonna go on a lot about
monitoring that text in a little bit but

419
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,760
your other things secure coding
practices and security immigration

420
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,770
throughout the lifestyle project I can't
tell you how many times you know we get

421
00:32:54,770 --> 00:33:01,580
a call from somebody that says I've got
a product it's going to launch I got a

422
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:06,409
product and it's going to launch on
october 24 it's a hard day I can't

423
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:13,040
change it had to have been tested before
them right i mean like like don't you

424
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,930
think that you should schedule that book
for your art product launch date right i

425
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,230
mean like that's a perfect example of
someone not building security

426
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:25,730
immigration and lifestyle project it was
an afterthought at the end right and so

427
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,090
what if i get in there not like this is
the worst sequel injection I've ever

428
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:33,500
seen I mean your steps to start from
scratch on me story pages right i mean

429
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,130
I've never going to make a product was
not going to happen so that's why it's

430
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,850
important to building security
integration is going to cost more to

431
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,730
bring in some super smart security to
oversee the project

432
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,350
absolutely but i guarantee that it will
save you money in the long run because

433
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:55,909
you won't get hacked or morning multiple
penetration pass on product another big

434
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:03,110
problem that I see is the bridge right
so the one of the biggest issues that

435
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:06,979
Sen security department is that there
are reactive and they're not proactive

436
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,179
right basically all they're doing is
putting out fires all day long and I

437
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,118
actually blame this you know war on the
business

438
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,899
actual security department because you
know there's 90 and there's helpdesk

439
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:21,199
there's all these other common people to
put out fires right security should be

440
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,158
proactive and focusing on these issues
so what happens is we have a breach

441
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:30,889
everybody goes in a panic mode all of
the fancy policies go out the window and

442
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:34,879
everybody scrambling around trying to
figure out what we're going to do and

443
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,799
and none of this none of the security
protocols that were put in place you

444
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:45,349
know actually actually you know work and
everybody wants to blame it off an apt

445
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:51,259
or it was a you know it was in China or
whatever and you know and then what'll

446
00:34:51,259 --> 00:34:54,740
happen is you'll say give us a
sophisticated threat right and that's

447
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:58,999
what the news but you know what if
you've ever looked at anything about

448
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:03,950
where that is on some of these breaches
yes some of its like 10 lines of my mom

449
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:08,598
is attained it something like the
college or whatever I mean like say

450
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:10,549
wherever the sony breach

451
00:35:10,549 --> 00:35:13,788
I mean that colorful like it was written
in 1985

452
00:35:13,789 --> 00:35:17,900
I mean it was uncertain right i mean but
that was an apt and it was you know

453
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:25,579
North Korea or whatever you like so so
getting a ratty of getting over like a

454
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:29,660
lot of this industry terminology that's
meant to make you scared

455
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:34,038
you know like advanced persistent threat
or whatever and actually looking at like

456
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:38,269
what some of this stuff is right and so
a lot of the times if you would if you

457
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:42,649
had some insight into your network these
two lines of my home would never get by

458
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,460
you I mean like make over there we can
fix that in a few minutes right you

459
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:51,589
never get that pie but you know so the
number one thing that I try to talk to

460
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:54,700
people about is what are you trying to
protect you

461
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:01,210
you would be really surprised how many
times I go somewhere and I'm like what's

462
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:04,150
the most critical data in this
organization

463
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:09,490
what would hurt the most by actually had
you know and it unless it's a bag that

464
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:13,029
says my money a lot of people don't even
know the answer

465
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:17,680
you know I mean and sometimes I know
what's even more important is that you

466
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,279
tell me the correct thing to do because
I can come into an organization or 10

467
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,470
like I know what your goals are 100 work
they're perfect example under a little

468
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,970
gas place you went down there and we
wanted to do some goal oriented

469
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,328
pentesting that so you know they were
going to give you some flags and I said

470
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:38,320
you know what's the most critical pieces
again this organization suiting it's the

471
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,119
customer list or whatever but no they
actually had a database which contains

472
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,420
survey plans from surveyors that they
have purchase for potential new oil

473
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:54,609
sounds right so that's obviously very
important that you know whatever I would

474
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:57,400
have never done that unless somebody
actually told me I would have never

475
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,140
known that was the most critical date so
knowing what you're trying to protect is

476
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,200
probably the most important thing and
there's nothing wrong with get out the

477
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:13,118
whiteboard right you know a law like
person great done the next thing I

478
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,810
always like to talk about is you got
actually know what your adversaries all

479
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:20,710
right i got i gotta be honest with you
like China doesn't care about something

480
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:26,630
he never really done you know i like and
so so so you can buy next

481
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:31,009
get China protection or whatever
whatever they got going off but I find a

482
00:37:31,009 --> 00:37:32,240
lot of times they don't care

483
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,640
that's not to say that you don't have
adversaries and you don't have

484
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,629
competition in the business you don't
have potential in the industrial

485
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,589
espionage because thats that's real
right is happening on but it's really

486
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:47,058
really important to actually go who's
potentially attacking you and protecting

487
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:53,029
against you know a lot of other places
and i'll be like you know oh my God

488
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:57,589
we're so worried about China i'll be
like to do any business which I have to

489
00:37:57,589 --> 00:38:02,720
do any business with anybody in the
Pacific room and not really worry us

490
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,839
company and I'll be like hey let's go
over to the far wall

491
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,808
drop the whole Pacific Rim problem
solved right like some of the stuff is

492
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:15,740
really only had two funny example but
some of the stuff is super simple right

493
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:21,169
i mean like we're not doing something
really simple one of my favorite things

494
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:25,549
that can be good when he was that will
use the sea so if you were on time and

495
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:28,819
now we did you know other company we
need some external penetration test

496
00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:33,710
program and one of these things was to
cut down the noise right so a lot of

497
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,980
time logging all this stuff we got
always and always and we have no idea

498
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,740
but there's some really simple stuff you
can do you know this is back to the

499
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:47,359
bottle they went back he said look you
don't need 484 353 for dns and you know

500
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,900
like 84 some random applications or
something right he's like I don't need

501
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,349
anything else he said so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to auto show and

502
00:38:54,349 --> 00:39:00,289
everybody else for six months basically
right and so like that cut down and away

503
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:05,119
see the scale of stuff that you have to
look at after that was so small that it

504
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,940
was actually like a digestible format
get in there and actually harder to type

505
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:14,029
that was happy and so you know we did an
external penetration

506
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,819
cm7 i pulled out all the stops i was
doing and scan the way five-minute

507
00:39:19,819 --> 00:39:24,890
packets like you don't hold on yards
every invasion tiny girls you know ftp

508
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:30,049
relays and bounces and everything else
he still killed about me because he had

509
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:37,430
that small inside it was network and so
that means into up you know we talk

510
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:40,848
about three things like on our weekly
never really important right so

511
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:47,809
detection is the first one so there's no
sense do it anything else until you can

512
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:51,559
actually detect something right we're
not even talking about block or anything

513
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:54,979
that kind of stuff we're talking about
seat and that doesn't mean they get

514
00:39:54,979 --> 00:39:59,930
through your blocks great maze until you
find what i did that means did you get

515
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:05,960
mail work you get you know like a
blinking products order whatever you got

516
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,279
going on in the legends face with you
teach you get something that said oh my

517
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:15,950
god you know our Smith just trying to
log into a hundred boxes at one time

518
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:20,058
they were failed logins they were
successful because the attackers already

519
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:24,499
have our Smith's password but still
going to learn on that because i know

520
00:40:24,499 --> 00:40:28,729
there's no chance that would be logging
into a hundred simultaneous boxes

521
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:32,598
successfully and a two-minute period
right but is that something that we as

522
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:40,219
the Tigers do all the time so basically
detection is probably the most important

523
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:44,839
you can't get anywhere without detection
right and so but there's so much to

524
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:50,180
detect so what that means is they need
somebody want me to come in and say this

525
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,779
is how we attacked your organization and
are we going to get every single our

526
00:40:53,779 --> 00:40:57,410
ability next that's not the purpose of
penetration vulnerability assessment you

527
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:02,239
know we like use the scanner your wide
and far and you know depth and all that

528
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:05,989
stuff or whatever you know we validate
as much as you can give an overall

529
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:10,339
picture right that's absolutely crucial
necessary in the beginning but once you

530
00:41:10,339 --> 00:41:14,119
get past all that you're patched up
under control and you start doing some

531
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,900
real targeting goal-oriented

532
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,490
additional testing then I'm really going
to show you online for weeks why don't

533
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:25,500
we only might get one way in right but
it's going to be away from AZ the path

534
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,849
of least resistance to show you all the
ways that we made it for your network

535
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:34,289
and a lot of times if i was to rate the
vulnerabilities on their own they might

536
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:39,299
be late might not be critical where they
might be you sighs and some games but

537
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:44,430
once I changed all of those i use the
word attach a going to anyway and so

538
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:48,058
what's taking all those together or
whatever then it becomes a critical it's

539
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:53,430
great because I look for the next thing
that we're talking about is the

540
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,149
deflection right so the next thing we
want to do is just flat some of the

541
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:02,130
issues that we see so perfect example of
this is power show right i mean our

542
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:07,710
shell has now become the go-to I come to
tool for penetration testers right it's

543
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:13,109
almost every window system we can run it
memory with my house execution policies

544
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:17,339
you know we can do a lot of things and
then the really be part about it is that

545
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:21,390
you know while we can you solo are
monitoring tools you know like carbon

546
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:25,980
black can see our you know we can write
a card like rules see Power Cell

547
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:31,319
execution in the environment we can also
use PowerShell turn off carbon right

548
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:38,460
seven but it's kind of a you know a
tricky situation or ever but you know an

549
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,410
end but we will really successful with
that with carbon black actually is

550
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:46,529
carbon like was flung my environment
that we want you we were really

551
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:50,640
successful it right these rules or you
know creation of privilege to cattle

552
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,808
powershell execution that happening and
so you know something that's really

553
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:58,589
simple in your environment is that we
use pen testers always include are our

554
00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:01,500
shell commands that's how we get past
the execution models you have you ever

555
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,700
tried to run some power shown it says
you've been restricted by the you notice

556
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,649
execution policy or whatever

557
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:11,400
well when you run powershell and you
encode the coming and I anyone in memory

558
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,829
25 passes all that's fantastic and so
but what happened is you know some of

559
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:17,470
the front

560
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:21,609
website called up on that and so we use
the dashing code command so some of the

561
00:43:21,609 --> 00:43:25,990
products are whining national coat so
you know that's kind of a bummer for

562
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:30,339
like a day until we figured out that
there's actually as another shorter

563
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:34,480
version of that that is just a shitty
antsy to encode as well right but they

564
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,680
were lying on that so they were flying
on the actual encourage you know they're

565
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,879
flying off like so anyways changed all
of our tools brother coming we were all

566
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,400
set no problems and so you know it's a
constant battle to keep up with that

567
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,990
kind of stuff and you always always need
somebody offensive you know to keep up

568
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,520
with that type of stuff

569
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:59,890
the next thing we're going to talk about
is compensating controls right so people

570
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,790
laugh but you know there's all kinds of
compensating controls that can be put in

571
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:07,540
place I mean I'm you know right I'll
talk about every single one but

572
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:13,029
basically user account stuff getting
more granny or with your counsel is one

573
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:16,690
of the things that messes up all the
time and i'll actually show you the

574
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:22,810
registry settings messages all the time
I like to make fun of his term to risk

575
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:23,740
appetite

576
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,250
I remember when people start saying a
couple years ago but but but after I

577
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,000
make fun of it

578
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,150
well it's actually got a little bit of
eating to it

579
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:36,130
I'm because you know what well I was
really gonna like I don't like had this

580
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:40,000
Nirvana that you know what company fix
every problem that they were just know

581
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,140
you were not told them to or whatever
but the fact of the matter is that is

582
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,890
that it's not like I mean the primary
goal of companies that make money

583
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:52,330
security is always going to be you know
the point for us is just get this here

584
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:56,348
is close to 2nd as possible because
they're going to be more important than

585
00:44:56,349 --> 00:45:00,070
making money so at some point you have
to go over and you know what type of

586
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:04,990
stuff is acceptable words right and so
so you have to have some sort of risk

587
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:09,399
appetite right and it goes back to where
i was talking about doesn't care about

588
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,920
right so i can . you know like some
textile me actually an organization like

589
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,530
I wear something

590
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:24,390
China's trying to get you know I'd be
like you can have a little risk another

591
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,210
one of the most important things we see
any bugs like today as people

592
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:33,330
complaining like to complain complain
complain about you know how bad

593
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:38,790
something is how bad there's not very
many solutions so I like to be a

594
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:43,170
solution offer i don't like to complain
i mean some of the stuff in the industry

595
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:46,860
who were stuck with you know what I mean
like it and I'm not an entire product

596
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:51,780
means . . your products and Trust say no
in place doing the things that are

597
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,770
supposed to you

598
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:57,060
we just don't replace our products are
you know put all our eggs in one basket

599
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:03,240
so you know what I tell the boys to get
back to the basic principle choice of

600
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:09,750
the basic stuff is what messes me up
most of operations like you like iri or

601
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:16,200
like a silencer and stuff like that you
know I rarely even see you know that's

602
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,850
not saying that those tools don't give
you some . visibility but as the packers

603
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:25,440
they are really causes problems so
basically you don't know hanging through

604
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,610
that's the number one thing stuff that
motor abilities and get I should be on

605
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:35,070
you want to keep your scary to proactive
instead of reactive I talked about this

606
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:40,830
already you know that's actually like a
life skill having my morning to be

607
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:45,480
proactive instead of reactive so a lot
of securities i see you are reactive

608
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,560
they don't pick something and tell it's
broken right anything don't know that it

609
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,580
needs to be fixed that's also that's one
of the reasons that it's important for

610
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:57,960
renting vs. come in like hey you can do
this this is this

611
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,040
don't be like oh my god never thought of
that and all the flip side of the city

612
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,090
with the blue team because they're like
this is how we do this is not like you

613
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:10,500
know thinking in my head not really also
now I can work on getting around that or

614
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,660
whatever right so like it has a building
up the relationship between the red and

615
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,720
blue team and

616
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,450
making everything so password policies

617
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:27,220
this is still like a worst thing in the
world I don't understand why I'm days

618
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,759
all this technology and all these
password managers and we're still using

619
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:37,150
the default windows password policy
characters means told sir just to show

620
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:41,620
you how absurd it is it doesn't even
cost any money to fix some of these

621
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:48,460
problems right so we have a tool called
ships who knows about the local admin

622
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,270
password right pass the hash attack
we've been talking about that . 10 years

623
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:53,020
right

624
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,400
well that's still paid unfortunately i
still get pushed back for companies all

625
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,270
the time they're like hey we just use
the same one that's what our gold disk

626
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:05,650
image with pushed out to everyone and
the argument you know against removing

627
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:08,320
the account i'm going to my next
argument which is removing the

628
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,040
administrator and totally but the
argument is always will love it

629
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,750
our CEO is in China you can login to the
domain you know what he's used up almost

630
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:21,040
passion temperature whatever got to get
into this good or some other ring that

631
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,150
never happens

632
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:27,220
I mean like reimage I mean like they're
so they are things you know just example

633
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,970
there are some tools that are really
expensive like you know like i'll pick

634
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:33,640
on cyber Ark i'm probably gonna be in
trouble

635
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,990
there's later about whatever i'll take
outsider art it's a great fantastic tool

636
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:41,500
that's awesome password management does
all super cool stuff but I cost a

637
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,490
fortune

638
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:48,459
I don't buy affordable but so in order
to combat that you know Jeff Walton

639
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:53,860
overdressed exact he wrote this tool
it's actually 399 and it's called ships

640
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:57,970
and basically what it will do is it will
manage all of your local admin password

641
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:03,399
keeper several on every computer updated
for you calling three mention that part

642
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:09,820
so at this point there's not really any
steps able like I should not be using

643
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:14,380
the I should be retiring those medals
for modules but I'm not

644
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:22,300
some other easy medications that we can
do you know we talked about randomized

645
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,020
admin accounts also disabling the admin
accounts right there are several systems

646
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,830
where you can actually disable the
anyhow and also with the newer servers

647
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:33,370
you have to put in place another
administrator or you can disable

648
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:38,740
first-hand account however it's still
better to help weeks have the admin

649
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,830
account means something different like
that's not to say that i'm not going to

650
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:43,900
get it but you know it's something right

651
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:48,490
you know it's not an administrator and
then you know the use of privileged

652
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:53,589
accounts environments is totally random
right so so what I always what I always

653
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:58,270
hard on is getting really granular with
user accounts right at Tomcats what I

654
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,130
always like to pick on all the time

655
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:04,750
more times and then often we get in our
application and what was happening you

656
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,990
know the application will be running
under the domain admin process and the

657
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:11,020
reason being is that something i was
trying to get his application of the

658
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:16,180
work you know he was under a deadline to
get this thing finished and you know you

659
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:20,620
could get the application do what it was
supposed to do under a normal user

660
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:24,910
account was trying to check all this
crap in the GPL policy no it's about to

661
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:29,020
be beer o'clock and he wants to go home
so he goes you know what let's make this

662
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,120
thing don't have to call it a day

663
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,779
you know press go and goes home next
thing you know a lot take over the

664
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,250
application and i'm already right so
that's somebody that didn't take the

665
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:45,130
time to to get really granular with us
account and is easy with you know

666
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:52,150
another really easy one is you know stop
basic binary follow the powershell I

667
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:55,660
mean like everybody's got like a blocker
and stuff right

668
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:02,890
standard i mean i can sell a lot of this
right endpoint visibility this is a big

669
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:03,730
one right

670
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:07,990
probably i don't everyone throughout
percentage that might be wrong but high

671
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:10,839
percentage of attacks start on your end

672
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:14,770
try to either clicking on something and
somebody got compromised that kind of

673
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,000
think so

674
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,770
so I'm not saying that endpoint tools
are important

675
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:24,560
but because they are but it's using the
data that give you you know effectively

676
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,850
and not believing that your end .
monitoring tools going to stop the

677
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:35,240
attacks were talking a lot of attention
not function and then gpo policies one

678
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:42,589
of our favorite ppl policies is this one
my access to this computer from the

679
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:49,130
network this thing messes me up all the
time and here's the setting right

680
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:58,490
this message me up more than anything on
any interest to get this loan that more

681
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,910
I want more about this too much but this
is more on network segmentation right

682
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,879
isolate this there's no reason why I
should be able to

683
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:11,900
yes make you have a question for you

684
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:17,750
well that's where the administrator
account for the local admin account

685
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,000
sorry

686
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,670
so just to clarify we're talking about
the local administrator account so

687
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:29,840
what's that isolate right there's no
reason why this stuff should all be on

688
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:34,130
the same on the same network right i
should be able to plug into you you know

689
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:39,350
copper tree and be able to reach write
this stuff seems really elementary but

690
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:46,850
it's not you know like it's obviously
order would be doing this is another one

691
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:51,319
of my favorites i always get the budget
or even on this because you know i will

692
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:58,580
say that you know red team consultants
are in demand you know have fairly good

693
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:02,960
salaries and that type of thing a lot of
times you can make the case to hire one

694
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,980
of those people internally but i really
really really they think it's a good

695
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:07,760
idea

696
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,990
I feel like every company should have at
least one internal offensive person that

697
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:17,419
that's all that focus on is offensive
attacks right maybe that's um you know

698
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:23,090
Nirvana that I got going on or whatever
but if at all possible higher-end tester

699
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:29,060
back to that nervous you know it's super
super important to actually researcher

700
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:33,920
vendor I'm not calling anybody out
there's a lot of that ms teams out there

701
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:38,750
not bad it's just that they're you know
like what they're doing is more

702
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:44,210
vulnerabilities and holiday so knowing
the difference and ended the maturity of

703
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:48,740
your organization is is a little bit
weird that might be what you know at the

704
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:52,220
time but if you've got a group that's
coming in you know you've been doing

705
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:56,209
testing 456 years you've got fiction all
these issues you're doing your due

706
00:53:56,210 --> 00:54:00,020
diligence and they're coming into giving
your report and it's full of blue

707
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,920
lotuses stuff like it's that that's not
the case

708
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,420
promise they're just you know out of
their skill set they don't know what

709
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,440
else to do

710
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,730
and so it's time to look you know a
different organization so you can try to

711
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:19,040
this is you can try to find some new
issues and that kind of stuff once again

712
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,750
going back to the test

713
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:24,770
all i did i'll be able to go to that
penetration test execution and don't

714
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:30,650
take my word for it take 300 wonder how
many more on that security experts were

715
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:34,700
working on what a penetration tester
look like what you should get the

716
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,839
results should be i mean the end of the
day like obviously CEO of the company

717
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,260
and i'm looking at the budget and it
says a hundred thousand dollars for

718
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:46,490
security test right like I don't know
what they don't know if they said Nick

719
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:50,779
and cost a lot of money or whatever all
i know is when you hand me that four

720
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:57,170
thousand dollars board so you know I
mean like that and when i write a report

721
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:01,190
i keep that in mind right this is all
somebody's going to see this is what

722
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:05,990
paper i can articulate what i did on
this report then you know I didn't

723
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:12,379
really do my job you know standard
testing that still makes sense you know

724
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,900
I mean I'm not saying that we should do
it

725
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,380
I love goal-oriented

726
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,950
is my absolute favorite thing in the
world way to go after give don't have

727
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:24,118
been boring i like to come to an
organization and say give me 10 flags i

728
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,960
like to ask for ten times are on
technical flies and business likes you

729
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,710
tell me what's important let me see if I
can go after right that's my favorite

730
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:32,220
kind

731
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,519
I don't like it when they give you my
peace I like it when they give me

732
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:40,859
anything because I all direction
organization because that way i show you

733
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:44,819
realistically how i got for me to see
without any help whatsoever

734
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:49,799
um mergers and acquisitions you know i
always recommend a lot of testing their

735
00:55:49,799 --> 00:55:52,529
you don't want to connect something
network to take your own without at

736
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:56,910
least one that's going on have product
launches we do a lot of interesting

737
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:00,779
products you know I mean like hardware
type stuff just to make sure that

738
00:56:00,779 --> 00:56:06,119
there's no you know small town that type
of stuff on there or whatever up anyway

739
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:11,730
and so basically here's the things that
are beyond you should get out of like a

740
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:12,839
really good

741
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:17,099
purple team assessment you know as
understanding the risks and threats and

742
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:21,539
taking those back and you helped design
your networks and applications with the

743
00:56:21,539 --> 00:56:25,230
offensive part mom right i mean think
how much cooler online use an

744
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:28,589
application developer but if i was
developing an application

745
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:32,578
you know I had a Kennedy over here and i
make over here I've got my application

746
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:37,470
would be a lot better came out of the
water and it cost me more to develop it

747
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:41,640
probably but if I figured that into my
initial security budget that won't be a

748
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:46,259
big deal you know I talked about this a
lot understanding the process of attacks

749
00:56:46,259 --> 00:56:50,880
right i mean me and make just in a blue
team recently where he went out of the

750
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,869
organization and we stage a whole bunch
of attacks or whatever and make show you

751
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:55,920
some cool stuff on it

752
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,000
no I showed mixed cool stuff you didn't
know you know and we both learned from

753
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,650
that exercise and quiet really want from
that exercise this was a client that was

754
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:10,710
used to getting security assessments
from big for vendor or throw anybody

755
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:17,039
under the bus but so you know they were
ready for us in all our end

756
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,869
yeah and the thing was that yes it was a
common stock

757
00:57:22,869 --> 00:57:27,760
however what they learned was that you
know you get what you pay for like

758
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,329
sometimes you don't want to go with a
big company sometimes you want to go

759
00:57:31,329 --> 00:57:35,890
with somebody who's a little bit more of
that several of the defense and I'll be

760
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:40,180
honest with you it was a it was a lot of
painful conversations with that but at

761
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:45,848
the end of the day like I really you
like help that you know if I go into an

762
00:57:45,849 --> 00:57:50,289
organization and tests all week long and
i work with the team and say I got you

763
00:57:50,289 --> 00:57:54,069
carbon wide and long balls bounced up
and so they're learning on you know

764
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:58,180
they're tracking event codes and splunk
and then the writing caramel-like rules

765
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:02,348
you know baseball track of echoes at the
end of the day we created a rules and

766
00:58:02,349 --> 00:58:08,260
protect our shell and we created a rule
to you know to track domain account

767
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:12,369
creation you know interesting story
hours at a place one time about historic

768
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:17,109
houses place one time and they were like
we got you'll never be able to create a

769
00:58:17,109 --> 00:58:20,828
domain admin which I don't normally do
we always wrong with the service now all

770
00:58:20,829 --> 00:58:25,660
we do is when they say we're tracking
that then test right so we'll create an

771
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,368
account that's real

772
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:31,000
so I go in there I create an account you
know everything's good and I go over

773
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,170
there on like cool did you catch me let
me see your work you know they're madly

774
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:38,770
looking for their spunky or whatever and
they're like no it's not there will

775
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:42,788
turns out that they were learning on the
particular that code for the creation of

776
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:48,339
a domain admin account however there's
actually four different event codes

777
00:58:48,339 --> 00:58:51,430
based on the different kinds of creation
of

778
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:55,419
right if you create one from the gloomy
and gives you want to bed come if you

779
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:59,470
use the veto do that's different
backgrounds and you do it next use

780
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:03,609
coming and can potentially be a
different event right so so so just out

781
00:59:03,609 --> 00:59:08,078
of that they wrote three four bodies
from rules you know and end of the day

782
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,440
they're like we are these work well in
this other situation with carbon block

783
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:17,230
do they buy if I hope you write three
rules like I feel like I really help

784
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:22,960
organizations at the end of one we test
we can detect encoded powershell usage

785
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,160
on your network white that's a good week
right that's a lot better than getting

786
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,990
up you know long list of remediation
that you know you don't shave virgin air

787
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:36,970
will make sense or you know whatever
Party organizations all calls will

788
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:40,899
figure out what i'm talking about when
you just gonna have us in there with the

789
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,900
blue team totally transparent step step

790
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:49,900
so what are the other things that you
know we always like to do a show to

791
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:53,200
motivate the time to do with these
weaknesses right we like to give you

792
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,339
know a lot of times when everybody sit
in the same working together there's a

793
00:59:57,339 --> 01:00:03,308
lot more shock value and executing
agency and all right so thanks everybody

794
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:07,180
for coming out to run over the time or
whatever i will take questions of

795
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,440
anybody actually questions
