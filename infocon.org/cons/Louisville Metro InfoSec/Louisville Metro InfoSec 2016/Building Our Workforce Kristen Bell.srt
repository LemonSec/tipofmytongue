1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,469
I'm really being here i have to discuss
wall time and really happy returns

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,940
speaker this conference is very dear to
my heart because when i started

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:22,050
applications during this first securing
conference I attended so that was here's

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,970
the speaker before Who am I

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,470
kristen bell I've been an application
security over 11 years currently

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,469
managing consultant and the talking did
a couple years ago sort of all this

7
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:36,270
after I'm not done

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,600
that's turned into a walk and I kept
adding content to the blog post i

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,809
started the conversation was getting
more generic it was more about mentoring

10
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,899
the original was the one cause Botox is
the same and that is that we have a

11
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,800
shortage of people to fill all the junk
demand jobs that we have and it's the

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,250
same problem that we've been suffering
for a number of years and it seems like

13
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,340
we're all kind of competing for the same
talent so what a lot of organizations to

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,530
sort of come down to use a grassroots
movement growing their own course and

15
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,530
that like man I was doing these blogs
and writing about mentoring and doing a

16
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,570
lot of mentoring myself sort of came up
with some ideas and some trying true

17
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,539
things that works so that's what this is
about and we're going to talk first

18
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,240
about what we're looking for in terms of
candidate and then I go to kind of steps

19
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,539
to how to get them from an entry level 2
and active productive member of your

20
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,899
team so personal who I'm looking for

21
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,790
there's obviously a small sector of
individuals who are in a different

22
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,369
career paths and wanna you know I
hobbyist there are people who got up on

23
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,560
the monitor yes

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,119
and they're very interested in changing
our career half and however they make

25
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,919
great candidates and I've seen great
success that I know very well an

26
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,660
individual who spent years insurance but
he loves security did a lot of it on the

27
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,930
side and he's now a really great IT
security professional Benassi that much

28
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:30,239
one really interesting cool that people
is military veterans and service we read

29
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,950
articles all the time about them having
a hard time finding good solid work may

30
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,350
come out of service and yet many of them
have cyber security experience it's not

31
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,519
necessarily this skill set that we're
looking for but at this point when these

32
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,810
candidates what we're looking for
attitude we don't really care that their

33
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,090
skills that spot on the other more
obvious cool peoples of course college

34
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,310
and university graduates and bring that
up only to say that the worst thing a

35
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:05,880
lot more resumes which will have
specialization degrees 90 security the

36
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,640
college curriculum systems have a white
honda and just one throwing out there

37
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,679
that don't overlook a really good
candidate comes out of generic computer

38
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,569
science degree program i think those
myths starting to hold computer science

39
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:25,560
degrees have generic computer science
degree because we were in school that's

40
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,730
all that was offered so like I said just
throwing that out there because again

41
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,470
we're looking for attitude and folks
more trying to be very very different

42
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,139
than real-world experience in our
business

43
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:42,870
so what I was looking for candidates we
obviously need self stars we are very

44
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,280
very busy we are overworked because you
don't have the workforce that we need to

45
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,989
do all the work that needs to get done
so we need people and then of course I

46
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,100
tell people when i get

47
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,390
stranger's email me all the time on
linkedin how you had to security and

48
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,390
what do i need to learn and I was done
this isn't just a job

49
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,120
this is a lifestyle you enter into this
line of work and you are going to be

50
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,220
learning the rest of your career it's
not a static thing there are things at

51
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,810
technologies that I'm assessing today
that literally did not exist when I

52
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,200
entered into this workforce so that's
very very important

53
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,480
we also are looking for people with
passion course and an interesting what

54
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:32,170
we do and then claim facing and I've
gone through to repress presentation of

55
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:39,190
us facing may not be quite the term but
strong communication skills and there's

56
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,450
a couple of different reasons

57
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:45,729
well I tell your story several years ago
I had to go on-site to applying step

58
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:51,430
piece of software this stuff was their
product and one of their products in

59
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,560
their new line and they have really
state had press releases that this is

60
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,830
not a rollout and I was there to assess
the products particularly i found some

61
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:08,289
greaser stuff and of course made it no
and the next thing I know I'm being

62
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,840
shown into the season to explain it to
him in a way that he could take that

63
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,849
information and and then translate that
information to other c-level executives

64
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,510
because you understood that if it
couldn't get it fixed by the real estate

65
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,849
it may have to delay the release after
that of course we are working against

66
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,510
the clock and I have to go talk to the
development group and i had to get them

67
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,950
for mediation techniques resources the
exact location of where these are

68
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:41,830
building existed and then after that the
business owners wanted to understand

69
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,830
what the consequences were to their
business reputation

70
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,200
following that after the desk soros
settled it was a very wrong day

71
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,469
what I'm talking to my security contact
on-site it was more than generous he

72
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,460
needed to know how to make sure that
this these things were fixed once i was

73
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,560
on my plane home and he was there to
make sure that the remediation was

74
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,630
properly put in place so i have to have
a lot of different conversations with a

75
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,490
lot of different groups of people and I
have to give them a thing kind of

76
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,800
information but in ways that they cared
about it and you know derby car starting

77
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,780
up and I love dirty porn a couple years
ago there was like a recurring theme

78
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,280
couple two or three of the speakers that
I saw it all talked about the horrific

79
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,650
reports that their steam coming out of
high security and it wasn't the reports

80
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,539
were technically bad it was that they
were just bragging hack that look at how

81
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:45,250
great a hacker I am totally not
consumable other people and the audience

82
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,710
that needed to read and understand the
information so i was actually really

83
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:56,650
happy to hear that went back to my first
team meeting after that dirty on and i

84
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,330
was asked to give up what did you learn
what did you what talks that you see and

85
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,800
I said guys were doing something really
really well we're writing great reports

86
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,130
of hair care business or not there's a
reason that our commercial tools have

87
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:17,050
canned reports with executive summaries
you know our services are expensive and

88
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,520
the ROI not very tangible people want to
read and understand who are the

89
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,530
decision-makers and dollars members of
weather getting back what we're finding

90
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,559
web hosting and how are adding value

91
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,720
so what is a communication skills are
really really important and especially

92
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,730
for someone like me who majority of my
clients i will never meet face-to-face

93
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,550
the only impression that they get from
me is the email or written communication

94
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:52,660
or hall and then I reported the end of
the day undeliverable so you know it's

95
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,250
just like I say if you have somebody
that's kind of introverted just make

96
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,830
sure that our mental enough to think
that that's really really important

97
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:08,830
okay so now we've kind of talked about
who are looking for that makes good good

98
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,750
solid candidates

99
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:16,330
how do we get them for entry-level to
being productive independent worker I'm

100
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,219
going through this from an application
security perspective because that's my

101
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:27,460
baby but some of these concepts are or
mentors in general across the board and

102
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,098
some of them I've been thinking very
translatable to whatever you are trying

103
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:41,169
to train and whatever type of course
you're trying to build so the anime ah

104
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:47,110
we again we're so busy we can spoon feet
so it's very very important that we

105
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,960
enable and that's going to be a
reoccurring thing throughout the rest of

106
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:58,660
the top and I'm on different techniques
and ways that we can enable people self

107
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,339
education is the first step

108
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:06,010
obviously I very important and I'm Brad
on our industry because there's so much

109
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,569
information out there you anything you
want water that it's pretty much out

110
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:16,000
there free to get but for new people
coming into our industry this community

111
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,430
extraordinarily overwhelming so i always
suggest kind of giving a broad spectrum

112
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,579
of all the different things from soup to
nuts

113
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,470
somebody needs to be able to become
successful in their career field

114
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,570
deliverables

115
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,070
everybody has like an artist on our team
who writes the most beautiful reports

116
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:42,130
those four examples that that example of
solid work should be put in front of

117
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,120
people

118
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,530
the great learning tool starts keep
patterns things that we typically see in

119
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:54,220
every assessment had a low-hanging fruit
and then a the other things checklist

120
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,630
methodology don't just get on like
vulnerabilities how to find them what

121
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,840
their definitions are there's a whole
lot more than they need to learn to

122
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,510
become successful so some education is
very very important and in this first

123
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,110
step

124
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:13,090
starting right there one of the most
important thing about vent or people

125
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,240
successfully is being available

126
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,260
the last thing you want to do is easy
might be is difficult money in the

127
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,780
corner with books videos and things like
that going to stagnate him they're going

128
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,959
to feel like if they want to ask you
something or take a moment of your time

129
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:36,670
that there are you the most importantly
it's for you as a mentor have that it's

130
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,439
so important to become available because
you're building a relationship with

131
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,850
these people

132
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,850
you have to understand their strengths

133
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:52,210
however were casting our knowledge may
reside and then you start realizing what

134
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:57,340
their interests are so application
security isn't just like one thing their

135
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,450
specialization in it and as you build
these relationships you start seeing

136
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,320
what really sports somebody's interest
you'll start realizing what their

137
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:12,430
specialization might be so again very
important this will keep coming up but

138
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:19,510
be available i will tell you at one
point not very long ago I was on a

139
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,830
leadership team i had five people on my
team i have three people I was mentoring

140
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:31,210
at average utilization rate of 98 that
these people didn't eat my day and I it

141
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,260
means it recently

142
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,460
at this point in the South education
process you're talking about giving

143
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,690
people five to ten minutes a day and it
might just be a conversation

144
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,890
hey what are you reading you have any
questions are you introduce you find

145
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,380
something interesting and they just want
to talk

146
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,930
so they're important after your kind of
having intelligent conversations with

147
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,760
them and you feel like they're kind of
beginning to get it then it's time to

148
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,530
set them up with your toolbox and my
gift I don't mean I know some of you are

149
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:08,810
thinking about our organization we have
fruit toolset that we must use but let's

150
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:14,150
face it and our world whether it's our
commercial tools or small scripts we

151
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:21,410
have either tools that are filled with
many tools tools that we find to work

152
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:26,120
with other little things that we use to
help us complete our jobs and then help

153
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,790
us do our work screen share with them
show them some of these things do Daisy

154
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,089
changes together why what scenarios

155
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,650
how do you do it this is kind of what i
say the rubber meets the road and this

156
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:45,500
is where it doesn't matter if your
mentor ease and across the table or 500

157
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,000
miles away you start hearing the spark
my interest because they've been reading

158
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,200
about all these cool things are going to
get to do and louder seeing it for

159
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:00,110
staying in real life so next step after
you kind of feel like they're getting

160
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:05,000
constable let them shadow you and what
does this look like

161
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,440
well it doesn't look like an
international retail corporation of

162
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,090
something goes down across the client
millions of dollars in their day and a

163
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:19,460
half step for what we're looking for is
a smaller less complex application

164
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:25,340
that's a tester QA environment with data
that's not production data it might be

165
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,170
testing it might be a small snippet
depression there or data that's been

166
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,329
backed up and will be restored the
completion of tests

167
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:39,269
and what you do with that is your screen
share make sure that they kind of got

168
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:45,600
everything working and then you say look
I want you to go out and find whatever

169
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,499
you can find and every couple of days
throughout the engagement i'm going to

170
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:54,660
check on you and we're going to top and
then at the end of the engagement after

171
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,969
doing that every couple of days

172
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:03,119
share your test melts let them see what
you found that make a habit and then

173
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:08,279
more importantly let them see the whole
process on how projects but if you have

174
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,569
client calls that you have kickoff
meetings whatever they might be having

175
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:18,059
within and then see what project looks
like right and then share with them the

176
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:23,670
deliverable of the end of the day they
know kind of how all that stuff all

177
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,920
those findings and all those notes end
up in the final report and at the same

178
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,709
time when you're doing this if you have
ports solid evidence you should be able

179
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:38,910
to give them free testing and validation
work whatever you call it when somebody

180
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,649
says something you see the true face
whatever that process is what's really

181
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,540
good about this now you start in our
arrival person they're actually being

182
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:54,389
able to do real work and they're going
to be able to deliver some small-scale

183
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:59,160
deliverable typically these kinds of
engagement you're not writing a whole

184
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:05,040
deliverable from scratch and dent into a
report it might be a negative report and

185
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,709
in this process or top about peer review
but i'll come back to that after the

186
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,339
next

187
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:17,309
so just keep it in the back your head so
these two processes have been shadowing

188
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:22,499
you and then maybe getting some of this
retest validation work you can do

189
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:26,730
several iterations you'll start to see
kind of where their strengths are what

190
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,130
they're not

191
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:35,240
once you feel like they've gotten to a
point where they're ready for that next

192
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,360
step then you want to find something
where you can shadow them and why are

193
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,860
you shouting again you're building a
relationship you're working with them

194
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,890
you're figuring out how they are all
those things but all of this building

195
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,150
the work force

196
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:57,439
regardless of whether your clients are
internal or external this should be a

197
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,590
total you transparent process your claim
should never be burdened by the fact

198
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:09,260
that you're building your team and
growing workforce so in this grade

199
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:14,720
this is between where this person goes
and they initiate a project entirely on

200
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,740
their own but you're in the background
shadowing them as if they're not doing

201
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:26,210
the work so that if you do miss anything
then at the end you can come back to

202
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,340
them and their findings to bears and
then the really cool part about this is

203
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:36,590
for the very first time they're going to
build up a full-fledged deliver all the

204
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:42,020
most important part of these two things
whether the validation recording or a

205
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,970
full-fledged deliverable is peer review
i don't care if you have a formal

206
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,850
process if you have no process at all

207
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:56,480
build-in step into your mentoring you
must be the person who does appear of

208
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,340
you you must be everything that they
turn out before the client does whether

209
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:07,670
we draw our internal and this is your
time to see their writing skills to see

210
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:12,079
what kind of evidence that they're
coming up with is it solid doing an

211
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,209
extra screenshot here and there are the
screenshots readable it's very very

212
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:22,160
important and again you need to know if
this peer review goes to somebody else

213
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,020
on the team and its own that you'll
never really know you won't see it you

214
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,070
have a mentor have to have your eyes on
this part of the project

215
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,760
it's very very important so like that

216
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,390
even if you have no care of you at all
just make sure that you're seeing all

217
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:44,570
this against your claim transparency as
well so how's your putting of going

218
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,790
through and doing all of these exercises
especially when you're talking about

219
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:56,240
people who this may be their very first
professional job there is it an

220
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,670
opportunity to talk about personal
brands personal brand is kind of buzz

221
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:06,260
term that that's been flying hammer
industry the last couple of years but

222
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,310
it's very very important and especially
for those of us who don't come

223
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:14,899
face-to-face with most of our clients
personal brand is basically how people

224
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:21,110
perceive us and there's a lot of
opportunity to do coaching as our

225
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:26,719
mentoring and to talk to people we get
into a lot of sticky situations i tell

226
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,860
people when people ask what I do for a
living I tell them this thing and it

227
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,439
sounds like a joke but it's really funny
and that is our prerogative is to go out

228
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,200
no matter what you doin I'm t security
tell somebody their babies gurgling in a

229
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,860
way that they don't just say thank you
because they come back and do more work

230
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,729
for us

231
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,620
that's kind of a hard thing to do and we
have to foster something as personal

232
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,120
brand talk to them about some of the
scenarios that you come up against that

233
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,719
you've seen or heard about tell them
stories and coach them

234
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,520
ok this is a good way to handle this
particular situation not guarantee if

235
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,290
you do this long enough you'll come up
against a very very important kind of

236
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:15,889
conversation to have and I think that's
part of the mentoring do all of these

237
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,440
things with positive guidance

238
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:25,790
it's so important and always remember
that one . you are that person and they

239
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,530
look at up as seasoned professionals
like you're some kind of rock star

240
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,700
just make yourself human to them if
they're struggling with something it's

241
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,570
something that you struggled with tell
them that

242
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:43,389
the positive guidance is is important
from a lot of different categories for

243
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:49,210
their again to enable them we're trying
to make them give them the tools that

244
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:54,040
they need to become successful and
there's a whole lot of things you know

245
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,490
there's a whole lot of ways to go about
that you know we don't want to be the

246
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:03,220
taskmaster and don't want to like get
the red pen out constantly the top to

247
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,280
them and understand that you were there
too right

248
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:13,300
so the other thing if you don't do a
whole lot of mentoring you might this

249
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,940
might not be obvious but it's really
important and part of you enabling them

250
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,920
and building this relationship and
knowing kind of where they're at is when

251
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:30,670
our next and when they're ready for
those next steps is communicating if you

252
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:35,830
are the mentor first of all I have had
people who have mentored that thought

253
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,189
they're ready for the next step when
they absolutely work but they have great

254
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,880
confidence and I was good and I have
people that were just didn't have that

255
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,020
confidence and we're so ready for the
next step and yet probably never would

256
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,980
have taken a voluntary and I guess what
I'm trying to say is the people that you

257
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,530
mentor probably really don't have a clue

258
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:57,850
this is kind of up to you to know and
that's part of why you're building that

259
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,080
relationship

260
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,850
the other problem is whether you're on
the leadership team or your recording to

261
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:08,590
the leadership teen they have no idea
when this person is ready for the next

262
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:16,419
step and part of your job as a mentor
and as the name or is to make it 5-4

263
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,740
them the height this person is really
ready to do a shadow we need to find

264
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,100
that we need to look for this type of
engagement we get this kind of project

265
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,189
from the one let's get them involved

266
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:33,820
the other thing along with this type of
communication when we have people mentor

267
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,060
obviously we want to get some return on
investment

268
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,620
obviously we're very busy so we tend to
give these people sideline projects

269
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,219
things that they can handle we don't
have time for and they help the team

270
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:53,230
that's all good except when these
projects become up 40 alo week projects

271
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,640
and they're eating up this person's
whole day the persons not getting to the

272
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,440
next level and you are not growing your
workforce and it's up to you as the

273
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,169
mentor to go to leadership or no matter
and say hey it's great that we have this

274
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:12,429
person they're active productive member
of the team that they're doing these

275
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:16,360
things that we don't have time for but
it's taking so much of your time but

276
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:22,120
it's hurting us we need to schedule a
solid time within their schedule within

277
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,250
their calendar for them to devote
totally to mentor and then or we need to

278
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,919
figure out how to free them and the
reason that you're kind of doing these

279
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:40,750
things is where do you want to see your
team and a year two years five years the

280
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:47,200
way you mentor people and is how great
your team will in the future so very

281
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,909
very important

282
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,299
I'm privileged to Cooper's industry

283
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:59,679
I have had the privilege of having plans
that fall within to be a half the

284
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,179
fortune top 20

285
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:05,289
I've seen vulnerabilities that I like
that I remediated and I know that

286
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:11,770
they've had tremendous impact on a lot
of people and there's nothing better you

287
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,179
know it's kind of fun to sit back and
realize that the other thing in my

288
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:21,549
career that I've found that is really
really rewarding beyond belief is to

289
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:27,760
watch someone come into their first job
out of college and end up being a

290
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,580
successful IT security professional
there's nothing better than that i know

291
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,379
that some of us happen known information
orders in our life

292
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,850
they're missing the boat this is one of
the best and most positive experiences

293
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:48,129
and with that i'm going to leave you all
with a one of my favorite quotes

294
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,400
it's hard trying to live it's how i try
to management how I try to mentor and

295
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,190
I hope that I've also provided you with
some new ideas on going back and

296
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:04,800
building your own work forces and that
thank you so much for having me and I

297
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,570
talked really fast they go through that
true especially mad so any questions

298
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,000
then may I have an idea

299
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,220
