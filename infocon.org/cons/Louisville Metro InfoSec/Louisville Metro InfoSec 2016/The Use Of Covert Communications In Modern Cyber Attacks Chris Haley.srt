1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,730
and we going excellent so good afternoon
I am Christian network from sign

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,070
Cleveland Ohio and we're going to talk
today about the use of covert

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:21,180
communications in modern cyberattacks so
because first and foremost we're going

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,820
to talk about just is the fundamental k
communications that exist within the

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,289
full constructive attack and in both
i'll touch on a few different points

6
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,149
around command control and exploration
but really did a couple tenants I guess

7
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,590
before we get into that we remind
ourselves is when you look at these

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,530
types of tau communications the
operative is much like the Beastie Boy

9
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,449
slow and low and it's going to be don't
get caught right so there's going to be

10
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:58,349
automatic control in communications that
exists within you know different

11
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,090
elements of the attack they have to be
spaced out over several thousand seconds

12
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,560
potentially i mentioned before that
these types of channels are used for

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,119
command control and also exploration of
the cycling of get out of the

14
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,530
environment

15
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,220
the other thing we have to acknowledge
two is that when we look at the hackers

16
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,170
we look at some of these nation state
entities they're not wants they're

17
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,659
actually pretty smart people and they're
gonna do their best to conceal their

18
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,430
identity and hide in the rocket pop so
that's really a few tenants we're going

19
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,729
to talk about relative to his
communications so we look at the faces

20
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,189
of a cyberattack many of you heard of
early spread out studied in detail

21
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,619
around kill chain theory some of the
models that exist you know probably most

22
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,530
common is the Lockheed approach and
really there's there's a few elements

23
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,110
when you're looking at behavior and
that's what does that's a kind of you

24
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,570
know the approach that we take with
cybersecurity is around behavior that

25
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:10,810
network and we look at the life cycle of
an attack so when you look at just one

26
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,709
of the elements right there's a there's
a few phases one is around kind of this

27
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:20,530
opportunistic type of thread it now
think of rattling courthouse and you

28
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,380
know top 30 things you didn't know about
Donald Trump you go to one of those

29
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,400
click eight sites and it's just a
pockmarked and littered with different

30
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,100
you know click fraud add objects within
the site you may get infected with some

31
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,989
kind of Bitcoin mining or paper install
type of the you know you know piece of

32
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:41,380
code but the ones that are most
concerning is around he's targeted

33
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,799
threats and the types of threats that
usually resulting in a couple things one

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,280
of it

35
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,110
identifying propala organization so I
had the desire to break into your

36
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,959
company or your organization and really
the goal is to establish that position

37
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,269
on the inside network now i can take
advantage of Nancy and accounting center

38
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:08,920
a spear phishing email and know that
with a high degree probability should be

39
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,540
open it up

40
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,260
I'm a throw to the old tried-and-true
method of Thrones and USB keys in the

41
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,220
parking lot C with pickup rate is but
nonetheless we know that there's going

42
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,390
to be a position established on the
inside and then ultimately once i have

43
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,820
that position we're going to follow this
pace of events typically including over

44
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,350
Constance type of pattern on the inside
the network find out where the

45
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:38,890
high-value data Liz how to get to that
data is really privileged to the system

46
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,279
that does have access to it or
credentials that have access to it and

47
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,840
then ultimately how I get it acquired
and incited out-of-network so that's

48
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,140
really approached in my company takes in
terms of evaluating the faces of attack

49
00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:00,279
especially when you're on the inside
network so just fill this out but really

50
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,560
the purpose of this conversation this
talk is around hitting communications so

51
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,790
when we look at command-and-control
customers

52
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:14,269
and control you know rats for example
where some of the techniques that modern

53
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:21,739
cyberattacks so let's talk a little bit
about CNC servers to begin with the one

54
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:26,120
thing we can be sure of is that the the
smart guys the smartest hackers out

55
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,039
there that are going to recycle and
reuse the same identities behind command

56
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,509
control structure what they'll do is
they'll rotate domains very frequent

57
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,770
basis so you'll have if you do who is on
one of their domain you'll see that it

58
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,960
was registered eight hours ago which is
a little bit sketchy you'll see that it

59
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,680
has no alphanumeric sequence within the
actual domain name that can be

60
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,759
pronouncing the language in the world
right so those are a few judges obvious

61
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,860
indicators that it's a little bit dicey
so we will see your domain generation

62
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,560
algorithms will also see the use of
tunnels right so protocols like dns that

63
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,110
they have some tumbling elements within
a also to the legitimate use of you know

64
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:19,190
what I guess a corporate environment
might consider is acceptable use gmail

65
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:25,130
example Google Drive Dropbox and then
ultimately to when we look at these

66
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:32,719
artifacts right in the reuse of just
domains and in IT spaces and other

67
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,740
elements of identity that increases the
chances of getting caught these boats

68
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:43,159
are going to do that but what we like to
do a vector as we evaluate our behavior

69
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:47,900
we don't get signatures we don't look at
and accept things at face value

70
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,020
ok you know it is what it is

71
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,729
no it's around behavior and when you
look at some of the artifacts and in and

72
00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:02,150
contents within a behavioral sequence we
look at things that can change says such

73
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,870
as IP address such as URL protocol and
so forth

74
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,759
fundamentally the underlying behavior is
not especially when we're looking at you

75
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,760
know things like mad control it

76
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,500
things like exfiltration so you can you
can disguise something a hundred

77
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,060
different ways but on the wire is going
to be very truthful and we're going to

78
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:28,180
see that behavior the other thing too
that we also do with my company is that

79
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,130
our source of truth are network-based
packets we're not looking at system logs

80
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,969
are not looking at Flo's we're actually
evaluating the whole construct of the

81
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,590
packet and there's a lot of useful
material within the packet itself not

82
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:47,229
just the payload and in terms of files
could be leaving the environment but

83
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:52,210
also to around Cade's what is my what is
the how rigid is my communication

84
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:59,560
pattern in channel is it very 86,400
seconds on the . for example one you

85
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,890
know once every 24 hours words there is
a tier VIII somewhat of a client-server

86
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,110
relationship and then also too much
popular station and disguising oneself

87
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,330
hiding within protocols tamil within a
total type of thing so these are some of

88
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:22,570
the you know if you look at detecting
some beasts covert communications again

89
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:28,030
it's around looking at behavior so
really there's a few approaches that we

90
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:34,030
take the vector side is our product is
built around supervised learning and

91
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,080
unsupervised learning based algorithms
i'll give you an example of supervised

92
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,719
learning it's really a concept around
analysis of prior samples of malware

93
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,780
prior samples of data to build and
construct a model right so if you one of

94
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,729
the examples one of the algorithms you
use around corals so if we saw your

95
00:07:54,730 --> 00:08:01,360
browser at university of louisville vs
want to jpmorgan chase they're pretty

96
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,010
much gonna be the exact same right so
that that would be an example of what we

97
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,659
would consider supervised learning it's
basically what we call local or global

98
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:16,240
learning meaning that we don't need any
local context or awareness of elements

99
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,889
to unique to your organization

100
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,719
on the other hand on supervises more
open with all local learning and

101
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:28,069
thinking about like authentication
patterns anybody work at a hospital or

102
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:32,510
working in healthcare system in this
room now

103
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,679
okay well so a large hospital they're
going to run three shifts right so

104
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,120
they're going to have you know employees
on staff and in authenticating

105
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,620
throughout the day and so when you see
three ships of authentication compared

106
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,579
to let's say a bank where take five that
profile is going to look a little bit

107
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:55,250
different so from learning in a
behavioral element the unsupervised is

108
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:01,699
going to be more globally significant as
we define these outlets so let's talk

109
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:06,979
about hiding within encryption right and
you know what will get up into a little

110
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:13,519
bit more about encryption and how and
how because this is kind of problem

111
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,730
space today in terms of visibility so
there's a there's a study out there from

112
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,980
sampai that suggest anybody read the
sorry well these familiar with it is

113
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,720
basically suggesting that this year 2016
was going to be seventy percent of

114
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,839
internet traffic is going to be
encrypted so that's not only going to

115
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,070
include you know the facebook traffic of
the world and they recently made that

116
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:43,670
change but also I malicious traffic is
going to be encrypted and that kind of

117
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,920
gives the attacker a little bit of an
edge in terms of you know concealing

118
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,760
what exactly they're doing with that
payload the good news is there's still

119
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,620
some evidence within the packet headers
that give us an indication of malicious

120
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:04,790
behavior is any up and then also to just
the whole concept around description SL

121
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:10,310
offload and when you look around as i
talked to my customers that's one of

122
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:16,399
these top of mine projects and ideas I
have so much encrypted traffic i don't

123
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,540
have any visibility now I need to start
thinking about something

124
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:26,839
project in that space and then also to
when you're looking at you know just

125
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,160
encryption and a hiding place for
attackers there's a few elements around

126
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,740
just the the actual session itself if
you think about a normal client-server

127
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,910
session usually the commands originated
from the client side they're the ones

128
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:45,770
commanding the server the server is
responding to commands and you can see

129
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:53,510
directionality as a relates to that
session with in SL session that still is

130
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,819
is is very true so you can you can see
directionality even in spite of

131
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:07,490
Christian so just a couple questions
guys are guys analysis up so number one

132
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,230
you guys just do you decrypt network
traffic or security inspection today

133
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,060
show hands

134
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:22,910
yes all traffic is a decrypted one some
traffic is selectively decrypted by

135
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:30,230
policy no traffic is decrypt I'm not
today but i'm planning the future

136
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:36,740
ok so that kind of gives us an idea that
you know one individual of about thirty

137
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,120
years actually

138
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:45,620
decrypting traffic sir if you don't mind
what I what industry are you in banking

139
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,420
okay that makes sense and is that
something that you are doing proactive

140
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,050
leaders at baseball policy is policy

141
00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:01,729
ok catch up so . haga song when you look
at also to at the individual session or

142
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:07,940
individual love you know component light
this quote is from sherlock holmes with

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,590
it while the individual man is insoluble
puzzle in the aggregate becomes a

144
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,460
mathematical certainty and so when you
look at the math and statistics around

145
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:23,570
behavior you can put together patterns
even within you know encryption so if

146
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:28,190
you take a day of science-based approach
some of the models reveal some very

147
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,690
predictable things such as kids you know
is that is decadence and commute

148
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,760
education pattern between a
client-server very rigid predictable so

149
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,319
that's one element

150
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,710
the second thing is around the
rationality and losing control session

151
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:48,170
if it appears to be remotely controlled
from the outside coming in that's

152
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:53,719
another very good indication that
there's suspect later the third around

153
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:02,600
automation vs human-driven types of
sessions automation is very consider- or

154
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:10,310
if it's a very rigid set of instructions
coming back and forth exact same white

155
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:16,189
sequences is prevalent on the wire and
the experience itself that becomes a

156
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:23,240
very you know predictable indication of
you know the title you know encrypted

157
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,900
malicious behavior so those are the
types of things that we would look at

158
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,500
within these patterns right command
control instructions

159
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,570
what am I am remotely controlling
offending remember i'm an offending

160
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:41,180
party rolling controlling a machine that
i have a position on i have encrypted

161
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,709
tunnel in between that so I'm firing
down instructions on what I want this

162
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:51,380
individual next remote access for
example and then also to maybe it's a

163
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:57,260
dropper that's encrypted and firing down
our updates so that's really one element

164
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,400
around encryption the next thing is
around getting Thomas right so we look

165
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:08,000
at our friend for norton he discovers it
and you framed his way out of shape for

166
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,430
all intensive purposes it was a hidden
tunnel so what are hidden tunnels right

167
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:19,880
when we look at techniques you fight
attackers it's basically an embedded

168
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:25,460
tunnel within a accepted protocol you
know what are the common ones use DNS

169
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:36,380
right HTTP ssl so when you look at what
are the types of things that folks would

170
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,460
use within a hidden tunnel again it goes
in command control the instructions

171
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,600
right so I want

172
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,100
make sure that traffic is allowed out
from the perimeter firewall so therefore

173
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,750
i'm going to use a protocol that
everybody allows out dns and I'm gonna

174
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:56,240
bury my control instructions within the
actual name of the dns text field for

175
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,209
example the other thing that it's used
for is a exfiltration so if i wanted to

176
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:06,410
just piecemeal data out of the
environment that would be another use

177
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:14,689
case behind and title so i just touched
on this a little bit hit messages data

178
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:20,509
embedded within the dns text field at
this point I'm within the are RFC think

179
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:27,709
it's what 255 characters is allowed in
the text field you know it were just a

180
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:32,630
line allowing dns out then you know is
there a signature that can really

181
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:39,170
identify those patterns right it's going
to be you know kind of moving target and

182
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:45,560
then also to require some intelligence
around pattern so we just a little demo

183
00:15:45,560 --> 00:16:05,630
here we show and be open water sure go
ahead and start so just as an experience

184
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:20,149
is you see that should enable

185
00:16:33,990 --> 00:17:34,980
I just stupid ass look up will say
Google like how well try to use policy

186
00:17:34,980 --> 00:18:05,910
outlining me give you an example of this
so if i do a standard look up on let's

187
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:12,900
just say Ohio . god I can see 72 bytes
in the request and i can see 88 response

188
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:21,630
if i do a gig on the same domain name
will see this quality record come back

189
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:27,210
as well as the MX record in the normal a
record right so I look at these are the

190
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,470
typical behavior that we would see in
dns queries for example is going to

191
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,630
follow very rigid pattern now I see a
dns all might look something like this

192
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,879
go ahead and find a hidden tunnel he get

193
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:51,640
this is this is a little unusual

194
00:18:52,180 --> 00:19:06,070
so I see a query this actual domain name
go to the bottom I can see that the

195
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,710
length is to infinity two characters
which is very short of Max going to the

196
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,770
RFC and I can see this just sequence of
garbage right so what I see here is the

197
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:22,990
query going from the actual client who's
saying it off to the command control we

198
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:29,200
can infer that there is a program that
can be pretty or use this type of

199
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,510
information in return

200
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:38,560
CC is the response to my query now is
also 312 bites it's not normal like a

201
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:45,520
you know a 10 character or fewer type of
domain it's a much larger than my

202
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:54,370
response i can see here's my queries
response 328 bites so that the behavior

203
00:19:54,370 --> 00:20:00,040
looks a lot different and you can
converge is based off of the tax people

204
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:09,550
then the dns query that its command
control or external type of behavior

205
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:33,120
so the other you know so HTTP is also
another example where we see this type

206
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:40,770
of behavior we see it in optional fields
within HTTP headers the river for

207
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:47,040
example that where there's not a mandate
to actually use any of those headers but

208
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,889
malicious behavior they do stop commands
into those headers for purposes of

209
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:59,190
control Rexville types of patterns
difficult to detect if you're using just

210
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:08,040
rudimentary security methods we also
have a we publish a report every six

211
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:14,580
months and it's basically a survey our
existing customers we allow our

212
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,020
customers to opt in and basically share
metadata actions that are hurting their

213
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,360
networks and really this is what we've
seen relative to hidden Thomas right so

214
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,040
we saw approximately fifty percent you
know command control and exploration

215
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:38,100
within SLA HTTP or HTTPS all mostly
exfiltration we saw some command control

216
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,240
and then with dns we saw all command
control so this is kind of an

217
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,480
interesting I guess sample set

218
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,520
I'm interested to see how that shakes
out you know the year-end and see how

219
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,260
are these lands but ultimately these are
types of tunnels that we do detect on

220
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:01,680
you think it's hiding within around
hiding within allowed applications

221
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,680
because any Walking Dead fans in the
room

222
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:11,730
yeah so we all know how the
you-know-what this model looks like

223
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,030
right you cover yourself with zombie
guts and you can kind of obvious

224
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:21,330
navigate amongst you know the allow dead
numbers so what's the use cases around

225
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:27,960
this is things like one Drive Dropbox
gmail what appear to be legitimate

226
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,100
applications that are permitted

227
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,959
I and organizational security policy
anybody hear about this one here we're

228
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:42,400
out this attacking this there's a piece
of command control malware that lived

229
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,150
inside of Google drafts folder i'm not
talking about that general that was

230
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:50,410
having an affair with some high profile
ladies need to exchange messages in

231
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:57,640
their graph older but basically what
this look like was there was a command

232
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,169
control session that was running within
the drafts folder of gmail and

233
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:07,570
effectively is this piece of malware
running on machine allow Congress

234
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:16,840
invisible internet explorer instance to
run within the machine itself and it was

235
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,760
sitting height on commands to pull down
you know what those next sequences are

236
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,169
so think about this right as you're
looking at a security approachin and we

237
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:31,240
have what filtering tools out there we
have you know email stand and everything

238
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:39,549
else attackers are using known good you
know types of applications out there to

239
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:46,720
effectively established rccnz habits
right in this is kind of aids that the

240
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,120
whitelist blacklist theory gmail is kind
of known good and now we get out of this

241
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:58,149
threat intelligence concept that you
know if I'm hiding within own good and

242
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:02,679
that kind of eradicate that will model
away at least it disproves that this is

243
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:09,280
bullet i know same thing there's others
instances where dropboxes uses going as

244
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,060
command control or some event with

245
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:19,290
the singapore that use dropbox so it's
again it's around identifying the

246
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:25,020
behavior not necessarily the name
species so there's a study out there i

247
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,700
think one of the statistics are that you
know somewhere between 15 to 18 thousand

248
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:35,130
new species or december every year on
the planet so that's roughly 40 to 50 a

249
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:40,710
day there's some studies out there
suggesting that there's almost a million

250
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,540
variants of malware malicious code that
comes out every day I didn't personally

251
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:50,760
can't qualify for qualified happen we
know it's somewhere between hundreds of

252
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,500
thousands upwards of $MONEY million if
we took that approach right so everybody

253
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,690
learned about you know can fill came
over great so we try to organize all the

254
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:05,820
days of classes of species on the planet
would be very difficult to do from

255
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,710
Albert perspective special that we were
taking the approach that we had a name

256
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:16,920
them all and then create a signature for
all of that so my database of you know

257
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,900
signatures grew exponentially by a
million per day that's something that I

258
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:29,490
can't scale so a better approach is
looking at the behavior now if I'm an

259
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:35,160
attacker or one of these guys and only
software factories up in Ukraine for

260
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:42,390
example my job is to write code and you
know rehashes to you know basically have

261
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:48,180
a threat intelligence speeds and I sell
that other people the behavior is going

262
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,900
to look the same but even though the
hash is different so that's really do

263
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:57,690
approach that we take and again we're
looking at what's actually happening go

264
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,250
to take into account this is gmail
command-and-control drafts folder type

265
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:07,110
of the situation there's some very
useful things that we can see the

266
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,080
Haverly rather than just trust it

267
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,580
okay i have infected eye holes that's
going to gmail therefore it must be the

268
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,580
gym so as a matter of

269
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:26,210
you know looking beyond the actual names
an ounce of the activity and looking at

270
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,409
the burbs

271
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:34,789
so in you know you have a footnote here
is it really matter if a scan originated

272
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:39,169
from a laptop tonight we don't
necessarily carry and . care about what

273
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:42,169
we saw

274
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,980
so again we saw and then just kind of
capitalize on this what we saw is this

275
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,850
type of pulling instructions and this is
an actual algorithm and detection of you

276
00:26:52,850 --> 00:27:02,719
fire it's based on you know command
sending down commands and then the

277
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,860
offender the infected holes facing say
what's happening actually very

278
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,860
sequential rigid set of instructions

279
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:35,390
I'm sorry for getting up with seek it's
good to remove the slide together all

280
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:40,280
ask the question anyway I guess any
thoughts or comments around what do you

281
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,840
think poses the greatest risk would you
say consumer based applications out the

282
00:27:44,840 --> 00:28:02,418
dropboxes the gmails and so forth about
cloud 80 us on ground about tools kind

283
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:05,780
of mixed bag

284
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:12,168
nonetheless though we know that average
degree continue ball and figure out the

285
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:17,360
next you know way to get going to use
techniques that eventually it's washed

286
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:29,389
out remote access Game of Thrones fans
anybody so you know so grand is the kid

287
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,269
is being

288
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:35,489
lifted up by this guy named hold or if
you've never seen the show and he's got

289
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:41,219
these really cool capabilities one of
which is what they call a war in the

290
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:46,440
show and that allows you to see things
through the eyes of an animal he also

291
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,909
has the ability to you know how to
shape-shift and you know actually jump

292
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:57,869
into other living creatures and noodles
and the prequel power to happen

293
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:03,509
effectively its remote control remote
access is able to remotely control

294
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:10,109
another living entity and so when you
look at remote access right you think

295
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:16,079
about rats do you think about tools like
VNC you think about tools like you know

296
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:21,450
just even using in and take advantage of
some of these administrative tools out

297
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:27,629
there is anybody secure their uh their
Island boards or even just their

298
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:32,579
management coordinator service server
guys in the room anybody worried about

299
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:37,979
just I love a security or even those up
management words mean you know again

300
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:42,509
these are all there's plenty of tools
out there to gain access to other

301
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:47,820
systems so when you're up the there's
good things to think about when you're

302
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,928
looking for remote access now we showed
you the kind of constructive an attack

303
00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:56,999
by and large a lot of the elements are
fully automated so automatic controls

304
00:29:56,999 --> 00:30:02,849
automated program three machine gets
infected he executes the payload and

305
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:09,119
then there's a an automated control at
some point though once I've applied you

306
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,779
know maybe some recon drive done a
number of different things on the inside

307
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:21,299
I found a vm that's in the lab it's a
patched and that's my my is inside

308
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:25,349
source that I'm gonna continue to go out
there and control control excuse me

309
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:30,149
eventually there's going to be a shift
wrong automation human hands on the

310
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:36,689
keyboard where the actual precision of
happening in acquiring data chips from

311
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,160
that automation to that

312
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:45,690
so it's you against this is concept
around you know hidden communication

313
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,690
what we see

314
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:55,350
so there's this last rat attack of this
class rat program that have a few years

315
00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:00,090
ago was discovered by RSA and
effectively it was it was discovered in

316
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:07,260
China and he evaded AV tools invaded a
number of different techniques that all

317
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:12,420
the makings and characteristics of a rat
but using traditional security methods

318
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:18,990
it was largely undiscovered four . three
years you know so there's a nice little

319
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:26,160
ride of its uh you know probably a
20-page document that is on the RSA

320
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,770
website but effectively what they did is
they stole assert that was used by

321
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:37,860
legitimate you know entity a valid
certificate and then disposed of it once

322
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:45,600
they establish their you know the actual
drop around that . and it went largely

323
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,850
intact so again it's one of those things
that you have to look at what types of

324
00:31:50,850 --> 00:32:05,399
technologies of eight signatures and can
still execute their purpose i'll say

325
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:18,570
that one more time business or bank
transactions and you know this allow

326
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:26,220
state you usually have that everything
while there

327
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:34,350
yeah good question are you guys heard
that it's kind of hard question but I

328
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:38,010
repeat the question was that you really
have to

329
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:45,060
was it one more time your previous labs
valid tiny offer happening

330
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:58,590
yes should you look at your service in
the star to the party

331
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:05,399
yeah I think that's a fair statement in
this case that happened within China so

332
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,520
she was trying on China crime which is
but yeah I would agree with that

333
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,300
statement

334
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:19,590
ok so i think we're near the end we're
going to talk a little bit on an

335
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:24,179
organization that if you notice that
shows on here that I like breaking bad

336
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,890
fans anywhere okay so we know that
Heisenberg remained fairly anonymous

337
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:35,760
even in the presence of is a
brother-in-law was DEA agent who knew

338
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,350
Heisenberg was he was related to
walterwhite and yet you know he was

339
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:49,110
still able to remain anonymous up until
the end of season 6 and all right there

340
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:55,500
again we know this is a technique that
we see relative to attack the behavior

341
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:03,090
so the common techniques is the use of
Torah here and that's really to disguise

342
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:11,489
your resource and disguise you know in
office gate where you originate problems

343
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:19,799
you may use this type of channel to you
know conceal your identity and something

344
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,380
that there's encryption involved there's
a there's customization ball by the

345
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,440
attacking entities and it's really not

346
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,140
you know it's it's an evolving and
ever-changing type of network so hard to

347
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:38,379
get Rob now there are things that you
can see and readily

348
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:44,920
identify the matter of perspective so
you know tor browser is very easy to

349
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:50,710
identify you don't want to fall a lot of
them use 9001 right so it's one of those

350
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:58,270
things that you can see this behavior
this type of channel occurring as it

351
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:07,870
relates to you know optimization so
worth the other thing too is uh when you

352
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:12,970
look at traffic bouncing around on the
inside so we have a detection called

353
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,709
stage transfer hot one and two and
that's basically you know concealing

354
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:23,710
where traffic is originating hurries is
bouncing through and basically what

355
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,060
we're looking for is a way out so you've
seen his type of pattern inside

356
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:33,970
I've captured and acquired high-value
data and my goal is to get outside of

357
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:37,720
the network you may see some of this
staging some of this transfer between

358
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:45,790
holes in order to explore tree design
data so last but not least i really

359
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:51,940
wanted to touch on the other pieces to
when there's a focus on identification

360
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,560
and in different patterns right it's
worth mentioning to that there's a lot

361
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:02,650
of non-human driven devices that reside
within a given Network anybody in

362
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:07,810
manufacturing and industrial environment
within the room so there's a study

363
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:13,900
within the plant floor that there's a 10
to 1 ratio of non-human devices such as

364
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:20,050
a you know plc or some type of you know
control that has an IP address is

365
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:26,050
attached to the network versus the
laptops of the human that the these

366
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:32,080
types of devices so it's worth noting
that when we look at behavior we should

367
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:37,840
just look exclusively at laptops or it
is exclusively at devices that were

368
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,530
familiar with there's a whole bunch of
weird stuff out there is getting an IP

369
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:46,810
address we did a little experiment
doctor throughout threat labs you can

370
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:51,670
locate about read up on this case study
but it's basically the ability to

371
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:58,240
deploy functioning backdoor the ability
to leverage things like infusion pumps

372
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,629
or other non-traditional devices as a
way on

373
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,740
so when you look at the hospital right
there's there's a couple interesting

374
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:10,000
things even like a university you can
freely walk in and out

375
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,690
nobody's going to really check to see
who you are gonna be a guest you can

376
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:19,690
just go start rolling through the the
hospital and there's really no controls

377
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,670
as to what you can and can't do

378
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:26,290
I mean now if you wanted to have social
engineer by yourself code even better

379
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:33,250
but for the most part you can walk in
and find a network jack within the

380
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:40,030
hospital you can find a device that has
the ability to solve back door on it

381
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:45,730
same thing with in you know university
is you just pose as a student or faculty

382
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,990
member

383
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:51,160
so the point being is that
non-traditional devices that have in the

384
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,990
way these things go right you think
about if I'm a hard-working hospital my

385
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:01,180
hire a company to roll out you know
10,000 fusion palms they're going to put

386
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:05,919
the same password on every single level
they're not authenticated the ad is

387
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,030
going to be default and we're going to
be very little controls their job is to

388
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:14,290
get the installation done as quickly as
possible now to secure the environment

389
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:18,520
so this is kind of the new set of
threats were looking at in terms of

390
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:26,170
command control in terms of back doors
and so forth and that sort of thing so

391
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:31,390
that's I up against it right now I think
we have a few more minutes but again

392
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:35,500
really what I wanted to touch on is just
a high-level summary of some of the in

393
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,730
command control types of sessions that
we can see in modern cyberattacks

394
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:45,160
hitting exfiltration where some of the
techniques that are used again a couple

395
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,170
things to look at behavior is very
relevant posts signature look at the

396
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:54,309
pattern and look at the case look at
where the session originates from

397
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:55,960
where's the control live

398
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:02,560
and also two packets or source of truth
right so short a very few

399
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,160
man-in-the-middle or package
installation techniques there is a lot

400
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,230
of integrity in terms of what those with
that source will yield terms of

401
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:19,210
forensics questions comments thoughts so
i'll be eight minutes back it really

402
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,950
appreciate you guys taking session
