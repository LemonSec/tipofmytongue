1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,130
and maybe using the most but we're going
existing out

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:52,379
yeah it's off closer you are to see
everyone to allow all right good morning

3
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:58,829
my name is matt bianco on the senior
systems engineers and let's go and going

4
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,879
to talk about addressing your cloud
security risks just some things that

5
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,729
need to be aware of you know as you're
going down the road of thinking about

6
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,560
cloud and what that means your
organization is going to be things in

7
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,700
here that that may seem familiar but
there's certain things in here that you

8
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,720
probably never thought so just a quick
poll here how many people have actually

9
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,869
started down the path of cloud security

10
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:32,369
oh cool all right so is that question a
year-and-a-half ago there was no hands

11
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:38,400
right so we're definitely making
progress in them up now one thing I'll

12
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,740
tell you if you can ask a question asked
questions make this interactive happy to

13
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,570
do that like it that way

14
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,369
one question I will not answer is
anything about architecture because

15
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,430
that'll it's a texas-sized rat hole and

16
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,800
we will get derailed for 15 minutes on
that ok but i do is slide at the end if

17
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,960
we have time if not can come and talk to
me and I don't can get from cadres clock

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:13,959
is going to cover architecture himself
so as I mentioned come and talk to me

19
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,260
after I want to know more about how do
you implement this how does it fit the

20
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:31,120
environment etc and I ok when we talk
about five security but what's

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,060
interesting is as you may think
immediately

22
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,720
well that means that you wanna you just
want to block things that you want to

23
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,109
stop it from happening right and that's
not the case at all

24
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,940
cloud security is their cloud is a good
fit right

25
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,260
I use cloud everyday I doesn't use cloud
in here if anybody raise their hands

26
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:57,790
right but we all use it even cherry
grocery list with my life on an iCloud

27
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:03,310
you know that's that's cloud gmail
dropbox I mean the things that we do you

28
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,690
know a personal level that's all

29
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,880
lots of clouds fantastic and there's a
lot of business needs for cloud if you

30
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,750
think about it right i mean we can spit
up an appt we don't have to pull in

31
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,239
servers we don't have to pay for power
quick to marketing is all kinds of

32
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,700
reasons why cloud is where is white
larger organizations are adopting clap

33
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,350
it makes perfect sense but we do
obviously have to wrap some security

34
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,730
around it in order for it to me you know
where we wanted to be like our internal

35
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:41,260
networks like it tackles so if we talk
about the way things used to be this is

36
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:47,048
very basics like that there's a purpose
to this right we had our point to it you

37
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:52,060
know our our internal network here right
with our servers and everything used to

38
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,120
be consolidated in one place it seems
easy

39
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,519
obviously those things were still
getting packed all the time right

40
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,880
because users are obvious ability

41
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,680
and if we wanted to our in our day was
all internal he wanted to connect to

42
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,400
that data we just connected because we
already on the network

43
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,980
we are outside the network it was very
simple right we had back in and and all

44
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,200
those good old days

45
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,440
however if you look at what's in here

46
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,560
Gateway's firewalls IPS . that sort of
thing all the tools that were using

47
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,460
today were built for that scenario right
now what we're trying to do is take

48
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:40,450
those tools somehow extends out into the
lab and that doesn't work as they

49
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:46,390
weren't built for that what they were
built for is this right so we we just

50
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,020
can't use those tools to that extent
what we see some tools out there that

51
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,820
are trying to adapt proxies and things
that are trying to mold on it has be

52
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,409
offerings to what they already have it
is the architectures are all wrong

53
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:08,770
let me push you are so the problem with
the problem with cloud is also the

54
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:14,650
solution or the solution is the problem
either way there's . 2000 identified

55
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,510
cloud so first thing we need to do is
again five legs clout and that is not a

56
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:26,260
URL based website that you just go to
consume you know like cnn.com or

57
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,390
espn.com those aren't typically security
risk other than maybe drive back malware

58
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,520
you know I'm not worried about people
getting into ESPN are accomplished with

59
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:43,060
my fantasy team which is over to by the
way so you don't want to see that but

60
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,540
that's that's also the solution right
there's all these great apps out there

61
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,830
twenty-two thousand plus of them that
are available for every line of business

62
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:57,940
you think about it finance HR everything
that we can figure even coating happens

63
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,560
in the flour in fact I've been in a
couple startups now let's go is my third

64
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,270
one and every company that's coming out
of California that is a startup

65
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,930
doesn't ever by a single server so there
is no servers in our company whatsoever

66
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:20,710
not even one because everything that we
do is involved from our mail for our

67
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,299
development right everything because we
can collaborate on a very easily and

68
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,710
hopefully we're in a good position
because we offer cloud security so we

69
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,390
are right but that is a staggering
number we'll talk a little bit more

70
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:41,289
about why that matters now we have this
this evenin this hybrid approach but

71
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,220
definitely everything they are dated
that once wasn't in the cloud or

72
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,540
on-premise is not moving to the cloud
and end to something said I could make

73
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,880
the argument we wanted there is there's
probably a significant security controls

74
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,200
around some of the absent that are out
there you're not Microsoft is one of

75
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,900
them a lot of work there's carriers
sounds like it's not true but it

76
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:10,539
actually is it is Microsoft right so
when people want to access data now

77
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,950
we're accessing it from every we can get
to it from no matter where we are but

78
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:21,010
that introduces additional problems into
this because now if you look where our

79
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,620
perimeter was our perimeter is the
end-user right so you have to think in

80
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,360
terms of cloud security is your
perimeter is end-user it is not in the

81
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,620
four walls it's not your data center
anymore even if you haven't adopted a

82
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,090
cloud that it's still the end user
because they still have the ability to

83
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:47,739
take data and move it to your own
personal versions of things so this is

84
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,710
based on our own data points and this is
absolutely true in fact the numbers

85
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:59,200
below are a little bit generous i'll
talk about that when we do risk

86
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,450
assessment is very easy thing to do you
can grab proxy watchin and firewall logs

87
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:11,860
things and and and tell people at a
glance what the overall issues are what

88
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,000
we find on averages there's a thousand
asses numbers actually changed a little

89
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,490
bit

90
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,169
there's a thousand apps that are being
used in every organization and that I've

91
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:26,000
never seen the number below 700 and I
see that number between five and six

92
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,710
thousand or larger organizations so
imagine that five thousand applications

93
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:38,059
that are being utilized the question
becomes how many of those are section by

94
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:42,140
the company so quick definition of
sanction vs suns unsanctioned pretty

95
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,540
civilization is means it's been an IT
vetted they have some administrative

96
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,459
control over the application right
control users that get into now remember

97
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:57,770
at no time did they control the app they
can't go and say hey microsoft for

98
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,480
onedrive use different Christian they
can't do that right or add this feature

99
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,580
they can ask but you know that that
doesn't necessarily happen so that means

100
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:13,459
that invite way that ten percent for
section applications is very generous as

101
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:17,660
if the number is a thousand that means a
hundred absolutely essential variety i

102
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,939
haven't come across a single company yet
400 applications were actually section

103
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,880
when people think about this they're
thinking in terms of 3x five apps right

104
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,310
that means that number is probably
closer to one percent meeting once below

105
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,899
is everything that's on station and
that's somewhere between nineteen ninety

106
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:45,740
nine percent so when you're talking
about security strategy it has to

107
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:51,170
encompass this entire thing it can't be
that top line and we'll talk about

108
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:57,709
generation one Cassidy's vs generation
to cassidys and what differences are one

109
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:02,599
of them is that top line that was
generation one cast which is let's just

110
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,060
control the same connects right but as
you can see if the majority of the app

111
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,239
usage and the majority of the data
that's going out is going into

112
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,050
unsanctioned apps then we control thing

113
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,410
the other part of this is is a cell
inspection right

114
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,600
Cassie should be doing SSO inspection
automatically because a hundred percent

115
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,790
of the traffic that is going to these
cloud houses is SSL or TLS encryption so

116
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,390
without it you don't have any visibility
you're basically back to the days of a

117
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,390
proxy which is locker allow strength

118
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:44,250
alright so quick poll here how how much
data or business David you think exist

119
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,400
in the cloud today

120
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,140
anybody have an answer that's actually
write less than you realize

121
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,510
because we're really in the footnotes is
a percentage and we have presented to

122
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:06,990
throw so when yeah yeah it's thirty
percent right now so close and rapidly

123
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:12,300
growing because what I see even over the
last year is very large organizations

124
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,339
that are really starting to adopt that's
large organizations tail a lot of data

125
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:23,490
right small organizations have adopted
for for a few years because it's easy

126
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,930
for them to implement but now we're
seeing the adoption of these large

127
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,130
organizations because they don't want to
pay a center-right my servers anymore

128
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:37,200
fact microsoft doesn't want to sell you
server licenses anymore

129
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,260
safeway trying to do that recently tried
by server 2012 and microsoft says they

130
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,370
wanted to use office 365 they don't want
to sell it to you because they want

131
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,700
everybody moving into that platform
there's a lot of good reasons for that

132
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:57,360
so if we have thirty percent right that
means this ever-increasing amount of

133
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,130
data that's going to cloud but we're
still susceptible to the same things

134
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:08,280
that we always have it we still have to
worry about data breaches now go back to

135
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,030
that other statement where you don't
control the application so the best that

136
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,650
you can do in this scenario is to make
sure you have a resource where you can

137
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:22,500
set out applications for you ever use
find out which applications are actually

138
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,730
being used and made sure that the one
that you choose or the handle that you

139
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,570
choose fall in line with your appliance
so when you get into

140
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,490
audience you're not failing those
because you can't make them change the

141
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:39,950
appt right you want to fail those a
panel the rest of this i'm going to talk

142
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:45,560
about because you guys are all else here
this is why we're here because the last

143
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,199
two points right . getting out and
really i'm at the crux of this that is

144
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:58,250
the point we don't control the app right
what we do control the data so obviously

145
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,930
in any cloud security strategy data has
to be the most important thing and

146
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:08,209
that's where our location how do we
protect the data from the user to

147
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:13,700
wherever its go and that's what we're
going to be going to discuss any

148
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,320
questions thus far

149
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,290
awesome-o income before

150
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,350
alright here we go this was talking
about division fail bought into the

151
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:33,470
residence is so the question becomes how
are you dressing and risk today and I

152
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,970
can answer that question i talked to a
lot of companies right I get pretty good

153
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:43,460
picture of their infrastructure and
going back to that second slide that I

154
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,410
showed their addressing it the same way
they address the internal needs and

155
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:55,579
that's it right which is we have proxies
have firewalls we have a deal that sort

156
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:03,110
of thing again none of that extends to
the cloud easily and it certainly

157
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,970
doesn't see the cloud in the way that
the cloud needs to be seen or audit in

158
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:13,340
and take action up so when you go down
this path you should be asking you that

159
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:19,760
question how do our current controls
work for Cloud usage and the short

160
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,500
answer again is it does so you need a
new strategy for that and that's where

161
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:32,600
Cassidy's came into existence now if we
go back to that original picture

162
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,870
this was the strategy back in $MONTH
2005 which was able to walk right these

163
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:53,670
are proxies you just block everything so
yeah so that's not really sustainable

164
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:59,910
right and in any kind of cloud strategy
because we want the club to be used so

165
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:06,300
have been blocking via strategy you know
it just doesn't work and it's never

166
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,030
going to work because that's not the
world that anymore

167
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:16,199
it worked in 2005 because we didn't have
mobile app usage that we have now I mean

168
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,200
everybody's connected to your browsers
and they weren't a lot of times back

169
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,560
then by the way so that wasn't that hard
so you're just doing your else filter

170
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,510
2005 was easy for a few years ago
first-generation Cassidy's came out and

171
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,740
said all right here's your strategy
let's section one app and then we'll

172
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:38,340
lock everything else so similar strategy
but now you have one half that you're

173
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,380
allowed to use again it's not blocking
is never going to be a sustainable

174
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:49,320
strategy so if you come to be after this
and say hey Matt tell me how I can block

175
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:56,460
better i'm not going to answer that
because that's not a strategy right so

176
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:03,210
anyway and one of the reasons why that
is not a strategy is because we what we

177
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:08,220
find is that they end up opening up and
punching holes through those to begin

178
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,910
with

179
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,750
alright so they try to block everything
and then HR passes we don't need all

180
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,290
these apps and then finance houses i
need all these apps right now also you

181
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,030
have what we call exceptions for all
happening and what we actually found is

182
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:25,709
that ninety percent of the cloud app
usage is actually from blocked apps

183
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,420
because they've opened them up and those
are based on all the assessments that

184
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:36,060
that so right there is one reason why
blocking doesn't work the other reason

185
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:41,160
is blocking is a non-friend typically
solution so as soon as you leave or you

186
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,160
pick up your mobile phone and go on the
LTE network

187
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,670
you can go wherever you want right a lot
of holes in blocking strategies that

188
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,530
doesn't save you from anything

189
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:58,040
so the question becomes what we do and
we have by the way you know you can just

190
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,620
find another half is probably far less
secure to use and is not in your proxy

191
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,400
category list and just use that that's
what people do eventually if you're

192
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,870
blocking dropbox and places where they
want data to your just gonna find it

193
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:17,000
happen you're not blocking and that's
typically the security on those is his

194
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,010
terror but you don't go to their website
the one that I picked out all the time

195
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,030
zippyshare right we see that be used in
places and you're not going to go to

196
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,450
zippyshare on their website and they're
gonna tell you ate by the way this

197
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,970
happens the job right

198
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,820
nobody says that they're going to say
hey you get one get $MONEY free stories

199
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,320
how great is that

200
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,200
but when if you have the ability of that
out that app it has no security only

201
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,480
piece of security that it adds is SL
which is easy to do is you just buy a

202
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,150
couple certificates right but there's no
encryption at rest their clients . and

203
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:58,040
this is a place that people are
potentially data without that SL

204
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:08,000
inspection or candidate is right that so
the way you should think about cloud

205
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,950
security is it being enable technology
not a disabled technology right again

206
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,430
blocking doesn't work so you have to
enable what people are going to use

207
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:25,460
anyway you're going to figure it out
just let him use it but let them use it

208
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,690
safely and that should really be how
you're approaching cloud security

209
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:35,450
security we're trying too hard wired a
little bit to figure out ways to stop

210
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,650
people from doing things or stop people
from getting infected things or you know

211
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,010
it's all about stopping so when we talk
about security

212
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,520
it's a little weird to talk about
enabling but you'll find that this

213
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:53,000
strategy yields much more security than
you're blocking strategy because this

214
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,220
strategy will allow users to do they do

215
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,630
and you can protect them wherever they
are doesn't matter if they're not grab

216
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:09,330
off grab manage devices on manage device
we can protect and so the other part of

217
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:17,309
this got the six steps yet but it will
be up to 30 minutes talking the other

218
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:21,120
part that I find it's a little bit
difficult is since this is kind of a

219
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,668
newer space where as i mentioned before
really have the foothills of this

220
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:31,919
exploding right as people adopt more and
more the security becomes more and more

221
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,780
important

222
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,250
it's still a little difficult to talk to
leadership about about this whole

223
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:47,429
process and why it's important so we
actually need to provide them something

224
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:54,270
that they can reference that shows them
what the issue is and any Casby

225
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:59,010
typically there's a few that don't but
most of them did will come in the grab

226
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:04,590
some oxy logs from your firewall and
said they will do some magic on the back

227
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,010
and force those laws and they'll tell
you what the problem is they basically

228
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:12,210
create a story for you and you can take
that story and you can add it to your

229
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,020
leadership and say you know it by the
way I wonder where this but we're using

230
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:22,470
1500 apps you thought it was 20 and we
don't have any way of knowing what kind

231
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,850
of data that is going through your visit
vast majority of companies are doing SL

232
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,639
inspection right this is definitely
something I know I is a very very small

233
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,260
percentage of companies are doing SL
inspection on traffic and even when they

234
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:44,400
are they're not seeing in the context of
cloud because cloud speaks API right so

235
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,090
that's his cell inspection is great if
you're just looking at all the data if

236
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,959
you don't understand the context of
where users trying to do you're missing

237
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,809
the boat a lot of the most companies are
doing a solid session so now they're I

238
00:20:57,809 --> 00:20:59,610
talk to a customer

239
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,899
not too long ago we were sitting across
the table and leave it out there trying

240
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,700
to convince their leadership will allow
them to SL suspect that track

241
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:13,460
and she said today statistically we are
blind to forty percent of our traffic

242
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,630
going through

243
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:19,159
yeah we can see the headers right we can
see where it's going but that's it

244
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:23,600
it doesn't tell us what the payload is
we can't inspect the document we don't

245
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,840
know that sensitive data going out to
the valley we have no way of knowing

246
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,129
we're flying to forty percent of that
next year is going to be sixty percent

247
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:38,450
few years or not to be eighty percent
because slz so in any strategy the

248
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,970
question you need to ask is how r us
self-respecting my traffic and in today

249
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,350
Cassidy's will have to have to do that
automatically so if you have an ssl

250
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,850
project that's been sitting on the shelf
waiting for you to figure out how that's

251
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,320
gonna hit performance

252
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,460
what kind of appliances you're going to
divide and all of that stuff which is a

253
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:05,450
huge cost look at this to replace that
project because it has to be done anyway

254
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,029
and by the way the Estall inspection is
happening in the cloud it's not

255
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:11,899
happening at your premises no
performance it right cloud much more

256
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:16,580
robust so that's something to think
about when you're approaching this is

257
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:24,559
this will take two projects that you
really have a solid eight so this is

258
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,470
something i just threw it I thought was
pretty interesting

259
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,210
it's going talking to leadership about
it this is the National Association of

260
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,779
corporate directors it's just a website
that is dedicated to you know leadership

261
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:41,510
and collaboration season and there's
some questions out here and i love this

262
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:49,158
it says questions directors and asked to
assess the board side literacy so i

263
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,779
would love to get this question your
back and you see exactly what back for

264
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:57,289
their but you know basically the
question that they're talking about is

265
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:02,629
how do we know that our ground rules are
protected our intellectual property you

266
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:08,570
know we work for car manufacturers are
drawings of our future cars or concept

267
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:13,279
cars and how to make sure that stuff is
is protected if we're blinded forty

268
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,360
percent of our traffic today i will be
sure that hasn't gotten out right right

269
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,350
and got into something

270
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:25,668
so this strategy with what I just talked
about right that that risk assessment

271
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:28,820
that you can get down by anybody and to
some extent you can probably do it

272
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,889
yourself if you you know what your real
because what we'll what a cloud security

273
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:39,770
broker will do is look at those 20,000
app specifically because those apps are

274
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,940
places where you can put data corporate
dated and that includes things like

275
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,900
Facebook where you can post you know
credit card numbers you can close that

276
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,620
twitter post on facebook so you have to
look at all of those places where data

277
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:57,770
click potentially go right so ask them
this question popped down every

278
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,280
successful in front of them and you know
I was like to say once you see it you

279
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,080
can't unsee it can bury your head back
in san diego didn't see that you know

280
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,939
there's 1500 apps or more that are being
used we have no visibility into the data

281
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,710
so we have no idea what our exposure
really is the only way that we're going

282
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:21,830
to know that is to get a cast be get in
line with that traffic fully SL

283
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:27,379
inspected automatically and then look at
it from a policy that's the only way

284
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,409
that we're going to know that are
sensitive data is getting out of this

285
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:36,980
organization or that somebody is going
home putting something on dropbox going

286
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,710
home working on it the whole day just
shared it out

287
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:45,110
unintentionally publicly to the world
what stops that have not none of the

288
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,330
total size of blue balls and other tools
that yes go to their friends house each

289
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,668
downloaded document editing back

290
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:57,169
yeah all of that those scenarios have to
be protected right so you can start

291
00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:01,520
seeing where those tools that you have
internally start falling all right and

292
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,980
you need to be able to protect that
exact sorry

293
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,990
and the only way to do it is is with the
next generation of fans

294
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:16,480
ok so one of the

295
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,880
exactly to talk about them which is very
important is all the ways people can

296
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,650
access products so if I ask you today
and said hey what you know how do you

297
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:32,980
access cloud I know you're going to say
well no problem and comparatively the

298
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,059
browser is actually the easiest thing to
control these browsers we can redirect

299
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:43,960
right we can get in front of browsers
browsers are always easy but it's easier

300
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,130
than the other ways but that only
accounts believe in a 50-percent of the

301
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:53,559
the access to products so the other one
is six clients and and find ways my

302
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:57,940
laptop's morning's presentation it's
syncing files the box behind the seeds

303
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:03,070
that is not going to go through a
reverse proxy and that's what a lot of

304
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:10,990
casual cell is a syncline is hard code
hard-coded you go directly to the

305
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:15,280
application so you can't get it to
redirect anywhere

306
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,710
the only way to solve that use cases to
get in front of it forward proxy and

307
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:26,380
intercept the track because it's going
can't redirect it anywhere so mobile

308
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,559
apps right how many people in here pick
up their phone and say you know what I'm

309
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:35,620
going to go to office 365 and i'm just
going to use the browser you should want

310
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:41,889
nobody does that right i mean you
download the app you download if you're

311
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,980
going to box you download box app if you

312
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,880
salesforce you download the Salesforce
and moving to use the browser accepted

313
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,980
to quick google search everything else
we downloaded apple and so these are the

314
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:59,350
same as implies you cannot redirect an
appt only way to get to do this in front

315
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:04,719
of the app in a foreign proxy mode so
you can intercept the traffic rather

316
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,970
than try to steer itself and then
something people don't think about a lot

317
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:17,200
are in the app ecosystem so if i have
sales force is probably a hundred 100

318
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,980
apps that connect into Salesforce and
can manipulate data all day about how

319
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:29,260
you protect that so these when you think
about your policy security strategy it's

320
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,230
all of these things

321
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:34,790
you can't just protect the browser and
say you know we're good because that

322
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:39,620
gives you a fraction of the issue
coverage you have to cover all of these

323
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:47,780
everyone to get 360-degree coverage for
your letters and if we if we do that

324
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,610
right and we get in line with that
traffic can see it as hell inspecting it

325
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:57,020
allows us to ask some questions and if
you ask them today in our risky

326
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:02,299
activities taking place is sensitive
data the answers to that is you probably

327
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:03,950
have no idea

328
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:09,200
unfortunately but that's the truth
that's the world live but you can and

329
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,080
how about you know it's coming from a
managed or unmanaged device is

330
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,240
supporting a case that you talk about is
it on the network is it off the network

331
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:23,780
is it is managed to get the same access
the unmanaged devices that all we can do

332
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:29,030
that with that on our internal networks
right but we can't do it in the clouds I

333
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,678
mean you can if you're growing up so
that has the ability to see all of that

334
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:40,640
stuff and then adjust how what how and
what you can access based on that fact

335
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,590
and then threat protection will talk
about about that but you know it all

336
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:52,610
falls into the same so all right one
thing I'll fill this out one thing I

337
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,990
want to cover here is gonna be able to
see the date of the right way to so if

338
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:01,070
you look at proxy long and firewall logs
you're going to see HTTP transactions

339
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:07,070
back and forth like crazy and then
report on and say you know what somebody

340
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,490
went to Google Drive that's a hundred
sessions

341
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:16,850
HTTP raw sessions report if you go to
box being out is 24 the same activity

342
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:21,918
which was user logs in browsers an empty
folder upload file chairs pop there's a

343
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,740
hundred activity report right so Roxie
Hart they don't session eyes the data so

344
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,059
it looks very messy and it's very
inaccurate it may mislead us into

345
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:36,350
thinking that there's more google drive
usage there is Box because we're just

346
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:41,809
looking at session right so one thing
you can do is specialized that they you

347
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:42,310
can see

348
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:47,290
it's one session out of all of that that
user went in the uploaded file file

349
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,510
server that's one second

350
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:54,280
same thing with box right so now the
data actually starts making a lot more

351
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,840
sense then when you're just looking at
proxy to try to make decisions on

352
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:06,790
another view of that is if you just you
an empty folder will drive it's still a

353
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:13,960
hundred session you know is that's how
Google works that seven box

354
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,710
neither one are right it is how they
reported and how many transactions it

355
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:23,950
taste you know actually the things so
that doesn't really do us any good so

356
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,910
here's one of the things i want you to
walk away with to this is critical when

357
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,780
you're talking about your class
securities traded in order to do this

358
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:35,950
correctly in order to be an enablement
technology yet more secure

359
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,030
you have to see the activities that
happen inside of every app not just your

360
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:45,070
section F every single app need to be
able to see what is that user Ewing

361
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:52,419
inside of zippyshare right because if
you see that call that API inspection

362
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:57,790
because that's how we talked to collapse
so being able to see those API calls and

363
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:02,860
exactly what they're doing normalize
those we can see what upload is share

364
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,510
and edit opposed to create and then when
you go to your policy engine you can say

365
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,400
you know what these apps

366
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,930
I'm not going to upload to especially
not a perfect data so now we haven't

367
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:18,850
blocked the app but we now protected
user from doing something stupid moving

368
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:23,080
our data doesn't belong right and now
we're out of that blocking script now

369
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,810
we're just blocking risky behavior
rather than try to block the apps will

370
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:33,070
talk about something that kind of
couples with that those are critical to

371
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:37,179
your clouds here strategy so when you're
getting this out when you're talking to

372
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,990
companies actually asking this question
how people you see the activities inside

373
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:47,830
the app because that couples with GOP
with policy and you can create policy

374
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,960
around that which has nothing to do
again with blocking that

375
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,169
I finally got it

376
00:31:54,890 --> 00:32:01,760
so six steps some of these recovered
before right step one is to discover the

377
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,270
problem and this is remember talking to
your leadership

378
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:09,110
this is the part where you're going to
present them with you know a story which

379
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:14,149
is just a report that says this is how
many actually using and you know this is

380
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:18,678
how much data is going back and forth
those apps these are all the risk X so

381
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:23,840
therefore these are our risk users so
it's very straightforward put it in the

382
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,149
context of cloud uses this is derived
from proxy logs which you know is that

383
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:34,100
what I've already talked about that is
very high-level 30,000 foot view of the

384
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,520
problem because they don't have the baby
I inspection they're not going to see

385
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:43,370
the activities in the apps but it's a
great starting place to tell the problem

386
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:47,658
that if you already know the problem any
as i mentioned before can make all the

387
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:53,000
canopy's pretty much offer offer this
for free just call up and say how to do

388
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,760
this week if your problem you can skip
over this part is more of a commodity

389
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:14,320
right this is this is not a strategy
that's not a

390
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,580
it's not a strategy so your strategies
and block let me tell me the problem

391
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:23,529
i'll just use that information of all
talk about that so you need that

392
00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:30,639
information potential to move to stage
two which is the holy grail in my

393
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:36,370
opinion of what it can be doing and that
is remaining exfiltration data that's

394
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:40,209
really the heart of what this stuff is
right we are providing the data from

395
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,639
getting where it doesn't belong

396
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:46,809
that's what it has we should be doing
now there's a lot of ways we can do this

397
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:51,610
we talk about it says in here sanction
to unsanctioned now so you know what

398
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,240
prevents your user you know you have a
sanctioned out let's say that you're

399
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:01,360
saving office 365 sharepoint your users
pull the file on there that says you

400
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,029
don't want to work on this all 10
personal locks or personal line drive

401
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:12,040
you know what stops them from doing that
so yeah we can control data at rest

402
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,310
inside of the sanction app that's
important

403
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:19,629
create files in there we can for
Mallory's want to do all of those things

404
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:24,639
but unless you're taking care of the
data in motion you you're missing

405
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,550
ninety-five percent of it was so that's
dangerous

406
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:39,159
alright so we talked about this pretty
much length you know it should be an

407
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,240
enabling technology and i'll be asked to
use there's no getting away from it

408
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,379
anymore

409
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:50,199
we have downloaded customer he said I
just need you guys because I can't

410
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:53,290
listen to my entire department you're
driving me crazy

411
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,910
great they all they do is complain
because I'm for blocking us i just need

412
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:04,089
to enable it and insecurity again that
that has to be your strategy coupled

413
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:09,520
with you know that SL inspection that I
inspection all of those things are what

414
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,730
you don't have today the most part right
that this is going to give you and is

415
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:20,410
rapidly evolving itouch

416
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:28,690
this to this which is allow being able
to detect managers and manage devices so

417
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:34,119
we we do that internal and if i plug my
laptop one of your networks I better not

418
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:41,260
be able to get up I have a whole
instances some networks but actually so

419
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,859
you want to make sure that the same
applies to the cloud there has to be

420
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:49,538
some audit on the end whether that's a
certificate check or you gonna be you

421
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:54,280
know ops wat audience on the employees
to ca are you running this kind of

422
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,780
encryption attached to this domain are
you running these processes you have

423
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:03,490
these files installed as you do your
manage device right and if you're manage

424
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:08,500
device and you get all the access that
you should get to your class especially

425
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,690
sanction was but if you're not a managed
device then you should be extremely

426
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:18,609
limited so if I go home and try to go
into our corporate box of help and I get

427
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:23,950
my wife's computer it should know that
that is not my corporate device living

428
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:30,368
in your viewing only or maybe nothing
right so that's a very important piece

429
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:33,520
of the world because get users of you

430
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,869
perimeter need to know a little bit
about that user before they get to our

431
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:44,319
idea and their device so we cannot talk
about different ways that you can do

432
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:46,569
that but it certainly built it

433
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:55,900
hi Step five is is all about threat
detection so this is also been rapidly

434
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,460
evolving probably the last six months
i'd say $MONEY in cash and that is the

435
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:07,240
ability to obviously detect malware in
sanctioned apps which is it as data at

436
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:12,189
rest so be able to scan any file has
been dropped in the same chap but also

437
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:18,099
emotion so David going to any cloud and
and the goal here is to stop the cloud

438
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:24,339
propagation of matter because if i put a
smaller oven in our corporate box

439
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:28,808
account or onedrive and then I'm sharing
it with a bunch of people well they just

440
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:32,290
got more fun syncing files now I just

441
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:38,200
pull the file down automatically to my
to my end right so it has to be robust

442
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,750
and it can't just be okay by the way we
only am you know one of the beginning of

443
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,500
ours

444
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:51,280
I mean it has to be that it has to be
dynamic sandboxing same stuff you're

445
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,260
doing internally has to be done for word
cloud data and then used for on top of

446
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:03,220
that anomaly detection so who's bulk
uploading downloading files are logging

447
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:07,120
in from two different locations and
given period of time writing sharing

448
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,250
credentials into an avid user behavior
analytics is a big term in the industry

449
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:17,200
right now is built into cloud usage I'm
pretty predictable so I wake up in the

450
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,109
morning go to the same things i usually
go to Nobu similar files so it's pretty

451
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:28,390
steady but it'd be very easy Asian my
behavior if i log in from China at three

452
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:33,879
in the morning and go to have something
on an extreme example but that's the

453
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,070
kind of stuff that needs to be looked at

454
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,910
right again extending this stuff that
we're doing internally this work very

455
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:45,490
well now into cloud because you don't
protect ya protected

456
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:51,729
oh and there's one other thing with
ransom layer so what one of the new

457
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:58,570
things that's coming out is I don't know
this is you need to cloud but being able

458
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:04,690
to detect how files are being encrypted
and I don't have all the expert details

459
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:10,510
on this yet but when something somebody
gets it as trying to create data in your

460
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:15,370
station application and impossibly
that's not using your pc encrypted or

461
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:20,200
some other checks is doing its gonna be
able to stop it right now the files it

462
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,250
doesn't create the first couple will
obviously be restored from previous

463
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:29,170
versions so that's all in the works of
take care of ransomware lot of people

464
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:31,240
stuff

465
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:41,049
and then the last one is coaching user
training in this probably at first

466
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,740
glance doesn't seem like it's an
important part but this is actually one

467
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:50,770
of my favorites if we're behind a proxy
and we go to a website that we're not

468
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:57,820
allowed to go to what happened he throws
us a big abrasive alert that says you

469
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:05,110
you're not doing it right and that's
that's not how casually this so Casspi

470
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:11,110
is going to you're going to try to move
sensitive data to a place you should be

471
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:16,869
PT idea eh I mean whatever compliance
you have a little bored when you do that

472
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:20,920
it's going to pop up something up and
say you know this is this is not the

473
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,450
place you should be putting this data so
we're not allowed to do it and by the

474
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:30,430
way here is the place where you shoot in
our section application or internally or

475
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,279
network this doesn't go outside the
airport

476
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,430
you know so you do that enough times the
users will learn you know and they're

477
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:44,109
automatically going to go to the desired
if you send out an email saying hey by

478
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,630
the way to prefer everybody put
everything in box please

479
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:53,800
and here's the link was going to
remember that he's gonna care you know

480
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,750
nobody's going to care about that so
your real-time educate users to what you

481
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:03,700
want them to do real-time pop that up
and you can brand in any way you want

482
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:10,600
and you have to say you have a redirect
automatically to the desire baby that's

483
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,310
an important piece of Apple process and
in order to do that obviously we can go

484
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:20,650
back and look at the API inspection all
of those activities a policy on to stop

485
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:28,750
that message up all stuff that we were
talking so I think this is probably the

486
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:34,030
last slide and his talks about you know
the first generation cavs vs second i

487
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:37,390
think it's important to differentiate
between the two one week and his first

488
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,400
came out two years ago

489
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,370
their goal was to tell you the problem

490
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:47,319
right i think there's a commercial after
a series commercial get companies

491
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:53,410
termite potter paint and he's taking a
termite all over the place and they say

492
00:41:53,410 --> 00:42:00,850
we can do body as well I'm just honored
i don't do anything about it right and

493
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:08,020
that's kind of what Casby was in LA came
out tell me the problem just blocking

494
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,910
strategy which of course we know it
doesn't sustain or it doesn't do you

495
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:18,370
know it doesn't look at any activity
it's not doing us or is doing basic do

496
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,540
so

497
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,650
regex and keyword matches things and it
basically wasn't doing any threat

498
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:28,990
detection so very very basic then we're
going to you know now the second

499
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:33,040
generation of Cassidy's that is that
hundred percent coverage for all the

500
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:41,259
apps you know blocking those activities
not the app itself and then true

501
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,530
enterprise-class deal and that's
important right that's probably one of

502
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,920
the things when you're going down this
path you want to ask about how

503
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,450
enterprise classes you deal is really at
the end of the day we're seeing

504
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:58,960
activities but your ability to attack
that comes from your heel and policy so

505
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,890
that is one of the most important pieces
of any one of these products is how

506
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:10,089
enterprises do proximity analysis and or
logic fingerprinting exact match all of

507
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:15,340
the stuff that you know that we need
internally at me for the possible so you

508
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,430
want to ask that question you really
want to test out those deal edges

509
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:23,080
because if you can't if you can see it
but not enforce it can't see it

510
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:29,379
obviously it's so good it's what you're
only as good as your policy behind and

511
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,680
then obviously all the threat
intelligence that I talked about all of

512
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,509
that now is built into these products
you can see these very robust is a long

513
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:44,680
wait very short time so there's a lot to
look at those are the things that you

514
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,339
want to focus on when you go through

515
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:52,170
this process all the stuff i talk about
those activities right those are

516
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:56,460
important video engine that should be
your strategy going forward because you

517
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,720
want a future prove yourself whatever
you end up with a lot of these out there

518
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,240
they're not future they'll cover you for
out for six months right and then a year

519
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,709
from now you'll be like well I really
want to stop this from going into

520
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:14,460
unsanctioned that hard we can't do that
right now you're getting another project

521
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:32,970
so this is a summary i'm not going to go
through and questions questions

522
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,100
awesome well thank you for your time
