1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,890
alright it's a really good turnout
compared to last year was here for this

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,920
conference last year getting better

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,570
cool alright well we're going to talk
about healthcare emerging frameworks for

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,720
a start I want to tell you guys how I
got into how I got into the healthcare

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,689
side of the business i'll tell you a
little bit about myself for this but

6
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,239
this is really interesting because the
very first time was just a boring

7
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:34,290
assignment

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,399
somebody got grease and they're like
okay and security professionals second

9
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,800
assignment was really awesome i can name
the hospital

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,449
it's a pretty small Hospital it's an
itch to provide plastic surgery and all

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,280
kinds of stuff but they work with
superstars so things like hilton

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:01,500
Kardashians and those kinds of folks
right so somebody from the internal

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:09,119
department has sold off records to
outside in order to make some money so

14
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,619
that's kind of how I got in

15
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,680
there's all sorts of photos at lives at
risk of being leaked or you know some of

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,900
the stars that you see in Hollywood and
I'm like man you know going i was a

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,400
prior to trial

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,540
given my background but I'm like
hospitals are kind of hard on you never

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,490
know what you come across right so
that's kind of my internet to how i got

20
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,009
into healthcare security wasn't even
about ph i wasn't even about risk it was

21
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,479
all about

22
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,320
we don't want naked pictures out there
somebody so my god

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,529
well that's the people that need to go
into right but up you know once i got

24
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:59,549
into it right you know my background has
been in quite a bit in in defense i have

25
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:00,870
a prior

26
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:06,750
you know I moved here from India for
about 13 years ago and that's 12 US

27
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,820
military and I started to learn
everything I could about security join

28
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,160
us security specialist jobs

29
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,170
hey I'm gonna go to learn everything
that I can deploy quite a bit got all

30
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:26,010
kinds of certifications and and what not
to get into this and what I'm really

31
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,609
into is taking complex organizations and
making them simple and GRC is one of

32
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,460
those fields so i really love passionate
about what I do I love reading

33
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,470
regulations boring stop and autonomy I
so when I kind of got into the

34
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,440
healthcare I thought okay how does this
you know healthcare be coming from

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,030
that's background now I'm going to
healthcare and I got standard operating

36
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,510
procedures a very good rhythm to stuff

37
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,930
how does that compare to you know where
I'm going and you know what I noticed is

38
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,440
that healthcare is actually the most
sensitive of all of the different

39
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,300
agencies work with the exception of
Defense certain weapons platforms

40
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,510
because we have the most data right and
it's unrecoverable he won't give up my

41
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:25,260
fingerprint I can't change it right so
and and the other thing is in defense

42
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,350
and finance we see the the impact right
away i lose money

43
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,339
I see you're right way but in in
healthcare it's a long-term

44
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,550
implementation of that data loss

45
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,840
you really won't know the impact maybe
10 years from now you'll realize okay

46
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,100
somebody knows that I got HIV and I
can't get married right something like

47
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,210
that right it's a long-term implications

48
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:58,340
when we come to the infancy our maturity
of entire healthcare it's it's immature

49
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:05,210
because you have a very unique
environment right you might have

50
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,980
skata equipment trip from other vendors
like course you gotta pee

51
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,239
there's a lot of other machines like
cash machines the FDA supposed to have

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,329
horse oversight of those machines and
they're kind of late to the game in

53
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:24,020
terms of regulating and increasing the
level of security right so so generally

54
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:30,109
gets the more you know when we compared
to finance or or defenses it's immature

55
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:36,320
what we're seeing out there is more of a
you know there's only harsh scrutiny in

56
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,030
this area in the next 2-3 years i think
the healthcare will totally transform

57
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:48,770
and it's going to be a chance for CIS
too shy or a few hospitals we've seen

58
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,270
them replaced like my very first
assignment help these the aisles

59
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,890
completely replace the cyber security
guy or when somebody with a strong

60
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:03,409
security background right so that's kind
of what it is it's a long with

61
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,840
introduction to who i am what i do i
love what i do what you can expect from

62
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,469
me on this presentation is GRC is a big
buzzword so you can expect very clear on

63
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:21,440
a video presentation you can ask me
questions if you have any like next up

64
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,440
heard this before but you know it
doesn't make sense

65
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,160
we'll talk about the presentation is in
a format of how you actually start but

66
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,250
at the same time what are some of the
things that are happening right now some

67
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:42,920
of the emerging right so you know it in
my experience healthcare is is really

68
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,940
tough

69
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,310
how many work at hospitals right now
probably work with like as a business

70
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,940
associate somebody doing business with
the hospital

71
00:05:51,940 --> 00:06:01,270
alright almost almost everybody so the
main thing is it in hospitals it's you

72
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:06,400
know it's it's really about determining
how to take the best approach because

73
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,799
it's really hard compared to any other
industry in my opinion how are you going

74
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,510
to secure an x-ray machine

75
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,880
I mean you gotta work with vendors and
they might say well we're amateur we

76
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,380
don't have fun day

77
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,600
where's the guidelines right there's no
authoritative sources and healthcare

78
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,610
woman compared to other industries now I
don't got hit by legislation will talk

79
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:36,460
about that when we compared to defense
or finance it doesn't have teeth

80
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:42,280
comparatively right that makes it really
challenging to make a business case to

81
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,510
your senior you chip will come over you
know how to be

82
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,500
how do you do that and and but for
removal or why is it up

83
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:58,060
why is it difficult when we compared to
other industries there's obvious reasons

84
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:04,660
might LOL management hair or
patient-centric and the data doesn't

85
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,120
really like value compared to patient
safety right so the management makes

86
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:17,650
decisions based on other factors right
so what we found is that the maid root

87
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,789
cause

88
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:26,440
really because security generally
approach it from an upside-down are

89
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,500
really passionate about what I do I like
to do software engineering i like to do

90
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,470
frameworks and i'm a guy like we three
levels below cio right so we take a

91
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:43,720
bottom-up approach and that's you know
that's fine because we're happy vibe you

92
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,360
know love what we do but the reality is
today business environments all

93
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,940
businesses are driven from the owners of
directors

94
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:58,670
down to the words right and generally
security is down here so we gotta

95
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:04,550
understand is all authority whether
security business related or legal comes

96
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:11,450
from a higher source right so you have
to figure out you know what is that our

97
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:16,640
source is this my board of directors is
this my managers right and gentlemen we

98
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,530
try to treat for at the border right so
that's kinda where some of these

99
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:31,489
frameworks are being presented to sew
sew in contacts of security we've seen

100
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:37,669
these guessing of that alien show and
they're talking about we found parents

101
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:43,789
all the world to see that right yeah so
you know insecurity in almost every

102
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:49,220
single field a lot of legislators
lawyers right these there's always some

103
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:56,030
pyramid right saying okay very top you
got some sort of strategy got something

104
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:00,770
in the mind of the executive that after
that it gets decomposed down to either

105
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:07,280
business processes risk management that
I gets down to the Royal right so the

106
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,910
reason why you want to start your GRC or
any kind of emerging brain / is because

107
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,260
you'll get funding for right and the
basic definition that we use for

108
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:24,140
governess is give me give me money given
control with authority right so there's

109
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:31,670
all sorts of other definitions out their
processes procedures and frameworks none

110
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:37,219
of those things are possible unless you
have control and resources so that's

111
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,170
kind of what we try to illustrate that
every single framework has that we are

112
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:50,390
lacking that Intel so kind of where to
start your journey and again this is

113
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,810
more of where you know how do you start
the journey but how do you leverage

114
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,209
merging frameworks into that

115
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:05,399
so imagine this continued on one side
you have completely secured mark call

116
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,819
this whatever you want it's not
healthcare is just let's just say some

117
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:13,920
he's a laptop a piece of data sending
anybody can come pick it up right on the

118
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,559
other side completely secure is really
hard to make that environment completely

119
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:25,949
secure it's nearly impossible goal when
a management tasks like they just want

120
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:28,979
to be way over here for like well here's
the money

121
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,939
just get me to secure its a possibility
that's what they want

122
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:40,439
yes that's right the way we explain most
of these things to to healthcare

123
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:47,040
executive is that you know me living in
India it's pretty lawless they have all

124
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,529
don't enforce them but in America you
have lost for everything

125
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:58,350
osha hip-hop 44 out right that's the
first little commentary that's where

126
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:04,350
most people kind of start for us might
the security right but where

127
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:10,170
organizations in the United States walk
to be they kind of want to be you know

128
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,209
what they call it ahead of her but you
don't want to go so far ahead that were

129
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:19,018
costing ourselves a lot of money but we
just want to be better than the law so

130
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:24,809
we don't get lot usually what's
happening in the cyber security is that

131
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:30,389
there's an external force and that force
can be defined by breach lawsuits

132
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:37,769
hackers nation-states right so we laid
out of this crafting ok the external

133
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:41,309
forces you know they're not using
they're not hiring us to be hundred

134
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,769
percent care is out there right

135
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,910
it's is were actually i have the
compliance curve but we're really behind

136
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:55,649
when it comes to an external force
managed to breach and whatnot so usually

137
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,370
what we try to do is move the
organization

138
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:04,010
ahead of that we don't say hey we want
to take your program and make it secure

139
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:08,720
and whatnot and we kind of describe that
the healthcare cap that's the widest gap

140
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,620
in our industry 444 healthcare it's a
pretty wide gap their data set from

141
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:25,460
other industries we also call this wed
wine in harris my for that term is ok

142
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,170
because you're a mouse

143
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,279
what kind of movies do you have you're
going to be you know you're going to be

144
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,770
hard but my cat or something right so we
also call those kinds of things in

145
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:42,170
harris profile and that's a financial
industry they use that term but it under

146
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:51,380
a framework called fic right so so once
we kind of have this narrative described

147
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:58,490
to our management on where they are in
terms of following the law kind of the

148
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,140
first step of maturity is just following
the law right

149
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,689
usually i know i understand that most
people say well security doesn't equate

150
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,050
to compliance and I completely agree
with that

151
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,979
however in order for you to get to that
side of the house

152
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,200
you've gotta start here that's just a
level of maturity that's a lot of people

153
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:29,510
are not understanding is that we use
laws we use standards pushed . if you do

154
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,830
it the other way around

155
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,990
you'll end up with a completely immature
and Mark meeting will spend money every

156
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:42,350
time there's a breach you look at trends
only new firewall or you know we access

157
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,120
control we need all other things right
and then the hackers will work around it

158
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,040
and the main finding has been is that
we're not really using brain works

159
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:58,069
properly we're not establishing 40 from
the get-go which is from top-down right

160
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:02,779
so kind of love when I talk to a lot of
people

161
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,110
this didn't help some people don't even
know what law is right so i didn't know

162
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,080
that either so hip up

163
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,720
it's a long the first one how many of
your bird hack is that a long day

164
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,710
yesterday

165
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:28,430
that's a long guess that's a lot alright
pci pci is a non voluntary or

166
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:35,780
involuntary role is so sometimes % like
a pci type framework percentage of the

167
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:40,610
executives like as if they have to do
they really don't and that's kind of

168
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:45,350
what we lose them because your legal
compliance officer whoever made that the

169
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,180
Federal Register he or she may say well
I don't really see this in here write a

170
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,040
list of you but the message will not get
transferred up to the top executives

171
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,930
will be like well it's not a lot we have
to do right I don't have to do that

172
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,430
we'll also talk about interpretation of
law when you were actually like okay

173
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:09,319
well it was this that means we have to
do it well how you actually closed at

174
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,320
work now how do you actually said
alright

175
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,370
this means i have to change this
computer side right how do you kind of

176
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:24,290
drill now all the way how many of your
part of my trust you guys and I trust no

177
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,510
I hate it too

178
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:32,090
I like it from the security
practitioners standpoint as a consultant

179
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:40,340
I mean but reality is it's not a law and
and it's overly burden sometimes right

180
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:48,950
it's got about 300 requirements or
something that 500 requirements come on

181
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,410
that's just ridiculous right

182
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:57,560
so again you pass this to the management
first he'll say yes because usually the

183
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,510
business cases established our vendor or
somebody who were trying to do

184
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:07,310
this way they said you hi trust so if we
do I trust we're going to get a lot of

185
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:15,949
business was that you get a fancy seal
right but they don't know the cost of

186
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,990
that fancy right when they decompose all
those 500 requirements tournament to

187
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,820
pass and put ours next to them it's like
a two-hundred-thousand-dollar exercise

188
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:31,280
and you might be trying to go over
50,000 customers so a lot of times

189
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:37,430
people communicate that all about this
risk management framework you guys you

190
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,959
guys seen it right guys heard of it

191
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:45,140
ok alright that's not a lawyer and then
now the Privacy Act of 1974 that's a

192
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,770
long arm and then glba guys ever dealt
with that

193
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:55,310
ok so the shortcut wait for me to
immediately don't I see a bunch of

194
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:02,239
articles it has a at the end of an act
it's most likely login good way to take

195
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,569
a gas attack doesn't but you know don't
don't just trust I trust don't just

196
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:13,639
trust b/ci you know those are those are
voluntary obligations and your board

197
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,760
wants to know they won't want to know
what is actually voluntary what is not

198
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:27,619
want to know that in a very clear
communicated matter so after we can

199
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:31,909
establish that eventually you'll get to
the point where you will have a nice

200
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:38,210
spreadsheet with the matrix with all of
your CFR's and then you'll figure out on

201
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:44,330
univ bc right and you'll get to the
point where a compliance officer will be

202
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,980
satisfied their security practitioners
like and that's just paperwork exercise

203
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,620
we really ain't doing security right so
what you're going to have to do is

204
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,159
instead of leveraging the framework at
that time you gotta turn that

205
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,460
conversation got a transition

206
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,500
to risk that's what it comes down to
next right first one you met the law

207
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:17,740
the next thing is the risk right hip is
quite hold up service right so it's

208
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,350
really nothing new Under the Sun as far
as la goes got attacked kinda gave us

209
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:28,330
more teeth but the reality is it's kind
of been their legislative framework has

210
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:33,580
been there so it's not be six when you
go to your compliance manager compliance

211
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,510
officer they already know these things
they've been doing them a certain way

212
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:42,820
right so is that leveraging the
framework at that time turn the

213
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,590
conversation into a risk right because
now that you've met in your world you've

214
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,730
met your bare minimum recommended
actions

215
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:58,030
what's the rest will do anything beyond
that right so information security when

216
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,920
it comes to risk management

217
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,680
he's a whole new language we've seen
hundreds of different that is this risk

218
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,530
management framework fair uptake right
these are good to learn when you go to

219
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:15,040
your management they don't really know
their kind of used to light hitting

220
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,590
patients right there used to hearing
like safety your patience patience

221
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:25,209
outcome and those kind of things and
somehow we have to get creative but not

222
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:33,220
really crazy on how to communicate those
crazy hasn't can't have you know a

223
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,540
fairytale

224
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:43,030
ok so you know give an example somebody
broke into the wireless network to

225
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,300
inject more one medicine

226
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,600
then you know that require something
like that those kinds of things really

227
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,949
happen we've seen Jax at that pawn in
other places where people are

228
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,760
demonstrated when you're actually
presenting back to management it kind of

229
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,830
sounds like fairy tales it kind of
sounds like well yeah that's nice but

230
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:12,480
come on you know what does not change
right so when we turn the conversation

231
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,830
with the risk try two lovers the turtle
language that they're already using

232
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:23,340
rather than giving them new set rather
than teaching that things like fair or

233
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,350
I'll take those are all good things i
love those things but I know that it's a

234
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:34,500
communication problem right so that's
kind of how we transition to dial in

235
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,940
order something

236
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:43,830
sure so I like to use this chart when I
first moved to United States one of the

237
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:51,990
biggest problems i had was language so
English is my third language so I'm like

238
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,400
all the couple from india so all of
those languages are all that's high

239
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,040
english is somewhere over here right so
so one of the biggest confused because

240
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:07,740
whenever somebody will say do you see
what I mean I didn't know is there an

241
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:15,510
audio water division i literally had no
idea i had a lot of embarrassing moments

242
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:22,980
too i asked my teacher I was having an
affair right and and what I was trying

243
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,550
to see this

244
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,210
how's your business going you know
things like that right there's these are

245
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,450
small things that order

246
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:34,490
no idea right side made all kinds of
weird comment from your kid in school I

247
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,159
think we're going to college because I
just didn't understand right

248
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:43,519
so I see information security a lot like
that I we have a lot of language that we

249
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:49,010
use to kind of eating the same thing but
we don't we don't have a good handle on

250
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:54,590
that right so so put all the languages
of the world and they're all kind of

251
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,820
related you know historically so I
typically they say there used to be one

252
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:06,110
language in the world that's that chart
shows right done by some scientists but

253
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:11,059
wouldn't it be nice if we did have a
single language in cybersecurity right

254
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:14,510
everybody when I said vulnerability
everybody understood what that actually

255
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:19,610
meant right that's like an unreasonable
goal that ain't going to happen we kind

256
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:25,459
of tried that a couple of frameworks the
government's tried that come over the

257
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,130
single language industries tried that
and it doesn't work so if you are using

258
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:36,500
a framework to describe breach of
contract but your legal officer is using

259
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,960
the terminology of business associate
when you get for what's going to rule

260
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:49,340
out whatever's in that already right so
there's a lot of issues with GRC as a

261
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,360
whole

262
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,639
alright so before you turn the
conversation from compliance and then

263
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:59,539
going into risk for you go to just be
aware of this

264
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:07,760
these are the things that some of the US
government policymakers are pressing so

265
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,429
eventually you want to transition into
frameworks if you have is if you like

266
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:15,470
alright started my party

267
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,900
I understand that he has to be clear

268
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,640
use language that everybody understands
all right might be up for a hospital or

269
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,430
retail my pc on whatever is right

270
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:31,410
huh you eventually say okay we want to
become mature organization how do I

271
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:39,060
transition to the frame right and what
is it right is generally you can look at

272
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:45,600
it as you know document that bunch of
smart people come up with and they

273
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,689
believe these are the best practices
these are guidelines

274
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,730
that's a general framework boils down to
you can they take things out you can put

275
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,530
things back in right it's different than
a legislative framework legislative

276
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,070
framework you may not be able to take
things out if you do it requires a

277
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:08,280
strong justification right if you say
that this is an addressable control he

278
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,870
requires a really strong justification
of why compared to I so you don't really

279
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:18,899
have to have it just I honest CSF
cybersecurity framework you don't have

280
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,820
to have just so there's a difference
between a legislative framework and

281
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:30,840
industry . so when you do this it will
increase the level of confusion

282
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,929
drastically because that's what you'll
get into a lot of conversations about

283
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:42,990
mappings and ok so we're using this
framework and we got a pci environment

284
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:47,580
got hit by environment and there's the
organization and they have all these

285
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,409
business units underneath them

286
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:55,050
how do we translate all that language in
how we can coordinate that right so you

287
00:24:55,050 --> 00:25:01,590
be aware of that so you know before that
and having clear understanding of the

288
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,889
line

289
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,450
that is really important and the
Franklin is just the beginning

290
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:12,090
it just tells you what to do sometimes
it tells you how to do it

291
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,300
there's really not a lot of friends
that's how to do something to tell you

292
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:24,930
what to do so so I was contemplating a
question actually put this up

293
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:31,980
don't offend anybody but to be honest I
think frameworks cause a lot of problem

294
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,320
there eight if done incorrectly there's
a lot of money being wasted

295
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:43,470
I come into organizations i can put a
strategy and we get lost inside Frank

296
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,830
works all the time because it's
rehashing the same data over and over

297
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:52,260
like an auditor comes in he does a pc is
given your policies in a different order

298
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,419
he wants to do it by he wants a
different set of policies ice water

299
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,400
comes in he wants a different set of
policies right and you know if we could

300
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,950
figure out how to address this issue we
could reuse those funding that type of

301
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,690
funding to actually buy cyber security
issue we can rededicate those resources

302
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:17,610
to firewalls locked a correspondent
covering all those things that was

303
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,909
supposed to be doing so one of my
biggest complaints in industries that

304
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:26,490
were we seem to be recreated this
product you know in my opinion it's just

305
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:31,770
my opinion on the company's opinion the
certification is nice but it doesn't

306
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:37,560
really achieve security we learned that
for pci right on target happened pc ugly

307
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:42,090
horse thing that's a pci Council of
course once a week told you it doesn't

308
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:46,530
achieve security right we were kind of
making that same mistake in healthcare

309
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:52,830
right so that's why it's one of the
worst offenders to me like if i pay you

310
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:58,590
100,000 dollars the budget executive
asses how are you moving the needle and

311
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:04,709
its really not are so why a hundred
thousand dollars right that's that's

312
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,200
that's what you're exactly it looks like
last

313
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,149
why not this money i'm really not going
to get anything can i use what's

314
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:17,939
whatever is 3 out there there's playing
free content i'll show you the other

315
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:27,870
thing is the ucf 5-4 at work it was
really good i really liked it because

316
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:33,989
security wasn't busy in terms of people
talking about it we only had a handful

317
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:40,769
frameworks so today there's a bunch of
them one for each industry so whatever

318
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:46,169
there's a framework created a consortium
is gathered and then they put together

319
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:50,130
the best guidelines that they said
that's a program that takes hot takes

320
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,870
like a year right

321
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,678
we're already behind the curve because
attacks are happening why it's happening

322
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:02,039
right now what this does is this
combines all those that chart that I

323
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:07,260
showed you a couple back its attempt to
combine all the scary languages come up

324
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,580
with one language so when you say
security and ice and protection we have

325
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,559
a new work that we agree on call

326
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:19,769
that's right that's all harmonization of
lines we take to party source languages

327
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:24,360
printing target language we've got too
many sources right now we've got way too

328
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,469
many sources to kind of keep up to
update that language right that's

329
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:34,950
problematic from your legal side they're
not you know that every time you read a

330
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,549
contract they redefine those terms all
time

331
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:45,629
hey so so that's kind of you know the
state of the frameworks will get to how

332
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,240
do you actually you'll get past this

333
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:57,750
leveraging going / went on human health
services website and you know for you

334
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:03,960
guys who are doing hi trust kind of look
at i was about to do a high trust

335
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,789
certification and I got pushed back like
you know I trust ready yes you could say

336
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,559
until I got pushed back

337
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,379
exactly

338
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:16,330
he said alright what is the
certification got get me and I tonight

339
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:21,220
normal reputation cultures where he's
going to be nice and tight and you're

340
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,240
not gonna get an actor you will catch it
and all these things that we normally

341
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,270
try to use to sell the business right

342
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:34,659
oh and then he said okay I get certified
and i'm going to lure does human health

343
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,170
services even recognize your
certification or anybody else's

344
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:44,440
certification that's kind of where you
got right and again I'm being very clear

345
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:50,710
and honest with you guys right and
they're legal counsel 70 this and of

346
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,280
course how to get the business but it
made me realize internally what's

347
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,240
happening

348
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:04,120
we're selling something that may not
deliver value so this tells you the

349
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,139
human health services basically says is
it require and then and then the

350
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:13,330
answer's no right so it's not required
when you actually get to port it doesn't

351
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:17,530
really might add to the evidence but
they're still going to look at better

352
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:25,990
pressure and you know way assess you
against that rather than some some you

353
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:37,090
know certification so it's all these
issues kind of get to where we start my

354
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:44,379
mind is that the business the oldest out
of all of the rules in the business

355
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,650
alright is the CIA oh right order to CEO
that's the old this kind of you know

356
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:57,490
position right and then the next came
the financial guy died have money then

357
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:03,460
make me money and legal right to start
with the Federal Register structure your

358
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,750
conversation around the business and how
you make how to use the federal register

359
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:12,730
to make the case if you dig through it
hard enough if you email me and I can

360
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,920
send you the stuff but it refers to this

361
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:22,070
it tells you the following right so if
you get in Port bachelder to look at and

362
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:26,540
then usually food mapping there's a lot
of mappings out there from smart people

363
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,110
have done myself as a whatever
intellectual exercise

364
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,570
there's a ton of three mappings out
there that are available 24 start with

365
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,649
him up it directly maps to NIST
cybersecurity framework that was

366
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,520
released

367
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:46,700
sometimes this year right and then let's
hear a little bit more mature use the

368
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:52,610
hip opportunity missed our map the start
of that will actually give you down to

369
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:57,290
technical details right so that's the
second level of maturity and then

370
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:02,210
eventually you can use this to map to
computer sexy little the government has

371
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:10,580
provided you how to map to a net mcafee
environment that's a welcome and then

372
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,899
kind of the software to automate your
processes don't rely on software to say

373
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,460
alright give me a GRCC to only don't
like that right how to go through this

374
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,130
exercise your pocket

375
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:27,680
we have five minutes here are the links
presentation will be available somewhere

376
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:33,200
passion of my email address but come
talk to me i'll send you all the battle

377
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,300
registers is right there

378
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,290
the latest 2016 mappings are available
from the US

379
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,860
well and then of course the privacy
overlaid with really really

380
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,810
comprehensive about to learn page
document that's available as well right

381
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:53,780
that's going to probably kind of get
over the whole problem so you know start

382
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,790
the conversation with compliance
transition into risk and then something

383
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:07,070
approved for your frameworks and then go
over to something so that's kind of the

384
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:12,679
presentation and this is just a nice
little you know current state of affairs

385
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,960
are normally people are are doing things
they start in SL she

386
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,929
then they over to the voluntary not
voluntary requirements and then you know

387
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:26,029
into spreadsheets and emails

388
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:30,529
once you have this for your organization
that's when you can start looking at

389
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:34,820
automation of your system before that
you're gonna buy something you'll be way

390
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:41,899
too mature to understand it implemented
correctly its value so that's it

391
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:45,979
questions comments alright thank you
very much
