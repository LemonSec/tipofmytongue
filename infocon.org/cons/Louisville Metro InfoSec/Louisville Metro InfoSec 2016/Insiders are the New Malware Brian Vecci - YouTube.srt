1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,179
and then go to make our hearts and we're
going to move him in unfortunately he

2
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:18,270
moves much partner have concentrated you
want me to get mostly because the

3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,840
audience mostly just and understood

4
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:42,050
wanna come wait a couple minutes we
decided to randomly grabbing it up to

5
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:54,260
you what you want anything but you're
gonna miss you if you want to hear first

6
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:08,780
chair over there you wanna just as part
of the journey my report usually stop

7
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,560
you're one of these programs

8
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,320
don't

9
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,350
alright I guess remember Julian from the
close the door

10
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:42,020
that guy's practically everything hit me
something your face is how many of you

11
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:48,170
guys are familiar with a pretty good
impression of us for those of you that

12
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,600
don't I hope this is useful for you

13
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,520
my name is Brion I'm here from our
corporate office in New York City my job

14
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,850
is to travel around because our
customers for your product management

15
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,830
engineers and talk about what we do a
Technical Evangelist which is maybe one

16
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,310
of the sillies files might even like it
but let's be going to do whatever I want

17
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,300
when it comes to talking to investors
this kind of thing right here meeting

18
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,709
our customers potential customers not
you guys but we do want to do it is

19
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:20,600
probably my favorite part of my job so i
asked you guys who is familiar with

20
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,350
brought us a few hands went up didn't
actually know how the company came about

21
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,620
in her two-story I don't see a lot of
people not that's good

22
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,690
our founders actually came from a
company called nap so I hope all of you

23
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,840
most of you are familiar with that big
storage company they were they working

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,440
professional services for that they're
working with a french oil company that

25
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,970
was drilling off the coast of Angola in
Africa this company has been and it's

26
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,500
like 35 45 million dollars hiring divers
and deep-sea submersible to go

27
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,340
photograph and take videos and images of
the ocean floor they were looking for

28
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,030
places to drill for oil so this is a
really expensive endeavor and they were

29
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,390
storing all of that data on their naps
because that's what was that after

30
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,850
designed to do one day I woke up and all
of the data may be gathering the last

31
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,340
weeks and months was gone

32
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,480
flipping on 40 million dollars with
images so they call the two smartest

33
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,910
guys i can think of that they brought
him and said we've got some questions

34
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,109
about this

35
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,060
what happened was this in action was
this an insider that's taking all this

36
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,900
data to competitive was this some sort
of technical failure who could have had

37
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,769
access to all this data and actually
what didn't happen and so they spent

38
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:33,019
weeks writing scripts and powershell
scripts digging into the data they could

39
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:34,830
find and they

40
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,890
they started to answer some questions
about who could have access to the data

41
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,040
the they couldn't really answer
questions about what actually did happen

42
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,950
to it and a light bulb went on their
head and said you know what this is this

43
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:49,320
is important data is not necessarily an
IT sa data is not like discs and servers

44
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,160
and networks and all the other
technology data is a business asset and

45
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,480
we really need technology to help manage
and protect and monitor those business

46
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,380
assets so they went they found a company
to start doing that company was running

47
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,820
fast forward to today and I don't need
to go through probably any of the names

48
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,480
on this list

49
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,170
you guys are cyber security forum like
this you know these names you know that

50
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,920
when do you go to target sonia and the
People vs data breaches are becoming

51
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,779
more common and they're getting bigger
and they're becoming more costly not

52
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,029
just from a dollars and cents
perspective but they're coming becoming

53
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,419
more costly to us as an organization
preventing these kind of reaches

54
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,510
probably add near the top of all of your
priority list

55
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,150
that's what you want to learn about
that's why you're here that's why you're

56
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,510
investing in technology that's why
you're learning about everything from

57
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,180
all these great vendors outside
including garage you want to figure out

58
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,300
how to better protect your data and make
sure that your organization isn't one of

59
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,460
these bubbles right a lot of these
breaches have a few really key things in

60
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,090
common

61
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:51,780
first one in that threat to the data
threat was already inside now some of

62
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,299
these like Snowden and some of the other
one involved in insider that actually is

63
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,020
part of the organization had legitimate
access to data and semi all tell me all

64
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,990
that takes on the other hand a lot of
these threats insider threats but an

65
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,330
outsider has stolen and taking those
legitimate credentials to use for their

66
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,940
own nefarious means Saudis a good
example right

67
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,169
Sony's an example of attackers coming in
from the outside but the threat to the

68
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:23,070
data was already there is able to
propose they weren't doing monitoring

69
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,729
the potential sitting on open file
servers that the threat to their data

70
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:30,630
was inside second is unstructured data
that's getting stolen right nobody's

71
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,169
breaking into a bank to steal pens
people are trying to get inside your

72
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:37,169
network or your insiders that you're
worried about inside the network already

73
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,870
they're not taking writer logs they're
not taking out

74
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,890
asian logs there is some cases are
trying to take databases but it's the

75
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,610
unstructured data that's how your
information that's how your your assets

76
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,200
become portable they end up in filing of
the spreadsheets and presentations or

77
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,979
documents

78
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,850
yes you're going to have patient records
or transactional records that existing

79
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,840
databases that you absolutely want to
protect need to protect the data that

80
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,049
you have the most of that you probably
know the least about is unstructured

81
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:11,220
right and finally traditional approaches
haven't worked i think the horizon has

82
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,090
insisted that eighty-seven percent of
security spent 13 years has been at the

83
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,270
printer you guys probably you're
spending lots of time and money and

84
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,510
energy securing the perimeter of your
network right

85
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,409
mercy is that a lot of organizations
have security model that kind of candy

86
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,070
bar

87
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:31,530
the perimeter is very hard and solid but
the inside once somebody's inside or if

88
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,179
they're inside are already there

89
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,220
the security on the data are the assets
selves relatively soft so hard outer

90
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,280
shell nice soft interior talent electric
fence eighty-seven percent of spending

91
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,559
has been on the perimeter and notice
security controls haven't worked when it

92
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,580
comes to being the region's the impact
of these reaches is significant is

93
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,950
growing most organizations see on
average about one attack right and even

94
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:05,039
if they get reached its 270 some odd
days where they realize that it actually

95
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,780
happened that summarizes as well almost
half of us don't even know if we sum if

96
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,760
we suffered some sort of inside of reach

97
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,969
this is everything from people extra
training data to a ransomware attack

98
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,660
right and more than a third of us
estimate these costs are more than

99
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,480
$MONEY million-dollars it's not just the
recovery house it's not just the

100
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,950
technology costs it's the reputational
damage and these kind of issues tend to

101
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:30,570
have sea level or board-level visibility
right now these aren't just IT issues

102
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,390
this is your help desk sitting around
trying to figure out how to stop it

103
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,200
reaches this goes right you're bored
right are the last thing i want to talk

104
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,700
about before I start telling you how our
approach to solving this problem is that

105
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,560
the specific problems were talking about
again

106
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,200
r19 problems they're really CEO Robert
knowing when Bob have access to a 40

107
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,120
left the easy access anything that he
should have

108
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,979
do I have sensitive information like pii
in widely accessible folders do I have

109
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:00,250
sensitive data that's open to lots and
lots of people and even if I did you

110
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,900
have any way to fix that

111
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,719
why do we keep getting this ransomware
I'm not gonna ask you to raise your

112
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,270
hands because I've been asking that
question for about 12 months now and

113
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,940
everybody kind thoughts of heads but
nobody wants to raise the answer they

114
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,360
got hit by ransomware you guys may be
experiencing that i'm not going to get

115
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,139
any assumptions

116
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:17,320
what did we get rid of you have huge my
today how many of you have more day of

117
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,919
this year they had last year every hand
let me go you think about it you're

118
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,580
going to have more next 22 didn't get
rid of if we have a retention or

119
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,810
disposition policy

120
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,590
how do we apply it especially with some
structured data and then did everything

121
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,760
go

122
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,539
who had access what do they do with you
can't manage what you don't monitor not

123
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,020
monitoring structured data is really
really difficult to answer all of these

124
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,978
questions and I bet this is a workshop
we could go around you guys start a tad

125
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,910
brainstorming some other questions about
your data that is probably important

126
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:52,120
that you might not be able to answer so
from a an attack perspective it's really

127
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,040
easy to get inside the network right
employees make the state of things they

128
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,270
should they access data should probably
have access to native too much to do and

129
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,569
accented that they don't need anymore
because you're on a project for the role

130
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,320
changed would have employees make the
state's this comes from verizon as well

131
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,770
twenty-three percent of phishing email
get open and more than one in 10 of

132
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,459
those open you must get clicked on
that's a terrifying statistic from a

133
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:19,239
security perspective right and i'm sure
i think there are other organizations

134
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,760
out there that will help you then user
training you need to make sure that

135
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,779
you're using understand security and you
have defense-in-depth that and they

136
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:30,459
understand what it takes to properly
protect organizational data but it

137
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:34,569
almost doesn't matter it's very easy to
get inside network if you have a

138
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,959
determined that we also have to worry
about rogue employees people that are

139
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:41,589
already inside the network admins using
their credentials to poke around maybe

140
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:45,010
not maliciously just to see what they
can see right service accounts that

141
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,750
might stop eating like service counts

142
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,040
users may get malware or hide to have a
potential hijacked you know people make

143
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,459
mistakes or just described employees
it's happened and almost every

144
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:56,219
organization somebody decides to go to
bed

145
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,340
there grabs everything I've ever worked
on for they walk out the door right

146
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,760
these are the kinds of factors that you
need to worry about from a security

147
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,020
perspective and think about it if you
were hit with any any any one of these

148
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,880
kinds of attacks today on your
instructor many of the customers that we

149
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,439
talked to where the organization we
talked to the answer there's no so i

150
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,950
hope you all agree that there's right
here right but how do we stop people

151
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,090
that are inside or determine attackers
from the outside leveraging inside

152
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,640
potentials that's what I want to talk
about today I'm not going to get into

153
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,090
the weeds in technology or features and
functionality and certainly can if you

154
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,240
want to raise your hand and ask the
questions but what I really want to talk

155
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,220
about is a high-level approach that
focuses seen work for are thousands of

156
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,460
customers and thousands of other
organizations this is how we think about

157
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,720
unstructured data protection and a
methodology for kind of protecting your

158
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,880
data not just now but over time the
first thing a thing that's most heat

159
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,840
that's most important is you need to
understand your data you need to have

160
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,100
information about your day we call that
medical data about data specifically

161
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,030
when it comes to your files to the stuff
that's on this device is sharepoint

162
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:09,180
exchange and even all the ccr5 when it
comes to your file data here are the

163
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,229
kinds of metadata that you actually need
first user group information you have an

164
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,830
identity store both in Active Directory
maybe other directory services like hell

165
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,270
. for using them but then also local
accountable file servers and sharepoint

166
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,900
and exchange closer identities you've
got user objects you've got service

167
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,949
account objects you've got group objects
and all there's all of the relationships

168
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,670
between we go out gathering that
identity or second other permissions

169
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,229
information if you've ever looked in the
windows faster or big man's device you

170
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,820
know you're talking about hundreds of
thousands maybe millions of folders and

171
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,230
millions upon millions of files you need
to understand the potential access to

172
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,040
all that data and access control list is
usually just a list of groups that have

173
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,520
access but if you go out to your
identity store and map all that and then

174
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,270
go out to your permissions and that all
that you understand potential access you

175
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,400
understand how people are getting access
not all files are created equal

176
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,290
they're down on the bottom right you
need to understand interrogate the con

177
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:09,279
ten of your data right what represents
more risk to your organization a payroll

178
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,759
file on a SharePoint site that's open to
everybody or someone's itunes library

179
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:16,720
that's another person answers probably
the former but you're never going to

180
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,500
know that you understand access and
understand the content and then i set up

181
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,079
once they're probably gonna say a
half-dozen times throughout the course

182
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:26,620
of this presentation so please bear with
me but you can't manage what you don't

183
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,279
monitor and we're talking about attacks
especially insider attacks you can't

184
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:33,790
catch you can't see so if you're not
monitoring how people behave and you're

185
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,500
not modern looking at actual access to
that data actual file level activity

186
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,029
very difficult to catch these even if
you're very determined to do it so the

187
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:46,420
metadata that you generally you were
actually able to go out and gather this

188
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,930
metadata on a regular basis on a
continuous basis and do it without

189
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,349
impacting your environment now we start
to see some of the ways that protect

190
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,579
data and keep detected over time the
methodology that I'm gonna take you

191
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:01,810
through today is what we consider
operational plan but it's really a data

192
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:07,268
protection methodologies got three easy
faces Beltran first you got to detect

193
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:11,949
you got to turn the lens one of the
reasons you guys and watch and almost

194
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:15,430
every other organization after that as
data which pretty much everybody can't

195
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,849
and reason that people can't protect
this data is that you haven't turned on

196
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,260
the lights imagine trying to clean up
your garage in duck that's often what

197
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,600
we're doing when it comes to
unstructured data you don't have any

198
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,209
metadata first thing you need to do is
map your environment turn off my folks i

199
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:36,790
get so I but we had a very small glitch
and audio should resume in a few seconds

200
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,969
and changes if I got lots of information
especially information that sensitive

201
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,380
that's open to lots and lots of people
that's probably the first change that I

202
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,790
want to make IT risk is a function
really two factors its value of an asset

203
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,189
multiplied by the probability was lost

204
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,100
we're talking about on structured data
we're talking about the sensitivity of

205
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,060
the files and the number of people who
have access to remember that example

206
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,739
about the payroll violence yet one side
risk is what how sensitive is something

207
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,550
and how many people have access to so
you want to find out we've got really

208
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,180
valuable assets and start reducing the
number of people who have access right

209
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,420
we want to lock that data down right
away we also want to get rid of global

210
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:40,130
access in general and I could probably
come up with a couple of scenarios where

211
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,320
it makes sense but in general you don't
want data open to everybody especially

212
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,089
not open

213
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:50,870
you've got all the windows file servers
you've got this lovely logic helping

214
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,200
everyone group somebody plugs into your
network they don't have to dedicate

215
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,880
their plug into the network they can
access that big right even if they are

216
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,300
technically now that can access all the
day that's open to domain users and

217
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,620
authenticated you need to eliminate
global access but why have you done it

218
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,520
before now

219
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,939
well first of all you probably don't
know all the data it's over

220
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,420
second of all and maybe most importantly
not a good way

221
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:20,180
facing right what happens when you
remove that global access all the people

222
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,209
that are using that group to access data
all of the service accounts and

223
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:27,650
applications all departmental users all
of your business users suddenly can't

224
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:32,150
access the asset so if you're going to
do this and i highly recommend you do it

225
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:38,600
in a way that minimizes risk that helps
you make change without disrupting right

226
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,520
so you should be able to understand who
actually is accessing data should have

227
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,300
access to this data so that when you
remove the little access group you do so

228
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,990
safely and the people who continue to
meet access including service accounts

229
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:56,420
maintained that access you don't break
anyway that's a moss who gave me advice

230
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,229
when I was not helped us give another
great piece of ice and like to tell when

231
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,940
I talk about limiting global access
except Brian you're smart guy but be

232
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,830
really careful when you try to get
something right

233
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,540
fastest way to fire 19 to try to make
something just absolutely no idea what

234
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,160
you're important this is a great example
of that unless you know you have a

235
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,630
mechanism in place understand the impact
of making this kind of change very

236
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,260
difficult to do which is why if you if
you guys aren't those customers and you

237
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,170
haven't gone through this kind of plan
you may still have a lot of data open

238
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,430
but you tell you there are ways to do
this safely so we want to lock down

239
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,910
access we want to eliminate our lockdown
sensitive data unlimited mobile access

240
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,270
get rid of lighting crew and then we
want to simplify our permission

241
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,689
structure this is about putting a
sustainable model for preventive

242
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:47,130
controls in place which is a really
convoluted way of saying you want to

243
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,189
make sure that the right people have
access to the right data right but you

244
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,250
also want to make sure that you're
managing access and permissions

245
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,540
appropriate if you think about the
windows file system treat the right way

246
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,920
to manage access is to manage near the
top of the tree right you want either

247
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,639
the very top or make it the most wanted
two levels down those are your

248
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,880
departmental shares your team shares
your personal drives but have you and

249
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,600
that's where you control access the
problem is when you don't do that if you

250
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,020
let access controls be broken all the
way down to treat it becomes impossible

251
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,180
to identify where they are and to really
make changes if you start if you start

252
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,300
changing preventive controls and
changing access reducing access to the

253
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,419
top of the tree if there are broken
inheritance really far down you actually

254
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,540
not making any changes that you want to
make sure that your permissions are

255
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,200
simplified and managed as high as
possible and when I say managing

256
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,770
permissions the idea should be that you
have a single-purpose group if i put

257
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,460
someone in tonight in an ad group to
give them access to this data that's all

258
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,700
it should do it should give them access
to the other data sets of two other

259
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,820
applications you want to make sure
you're using single purpose groups

260
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,350
ideally a regroup and modified room and
towards the top of the tree now this

261
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,490
isn't something generally you can push
the button to do this is something that

262
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,530
you're going to want to sit down and
think about what do our permission

263
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,310
structures look like now what do we want
them to have you know what do we want to

264
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,129
look like in the future and how do we
get them they're being able to simulate

265
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,820
access control changes monitoring how
data is being used getting rid of all

266
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,200
the stale data tends to reduce the
amount of time and effort it tastes to

267
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,419
simplify your permission

268
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:17,480
this is generally the model you're going
to want to get too if you want to get to

269
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,970
sustainable model weird is monitored
properly control you also want to

270
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,940
eliminate excessive access here's what i
mean by this

271
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,549
pick a user any user in your head
ideally not an admin user but pick any

272
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:35,480
business users an organization do you
know every single age group with her

273
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,169
heart

274
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:40,460
probably you probably figured that do
you know all of the data that they have

275
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,989
access

276
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:45,470
probably not that's a really difficult
question answer can you be an

277
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:50,509
archaeology project now the follow-up to
that is does that person is here she

278
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:54,649
have access to date it that he or she
doesn't need to have access to any more

279
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:56,869
the answer i will bet money

280
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:01,100
the answer is yes again our roles change
their own projects people's access get

281
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,570
close right there's all sorts of ways
that we get access to data and that

282
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,509
first job i'm gonna go back to my sister
again work to help desk people call it

283
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:12,919
all the time I need access to this share
i need access to this folder on this

284
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,340
project need access to this my boss
doesn't need access to my job

285
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,059
people scream and yell until they get
the access that they need to do their

286
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,259
jobs

287
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:25,639
what the hell just five years not once
did anybody ever call me up screaming

288
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:29,508
saying right i have access to much data
i mean too many groups and if you don't

289
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:33,710
remove me from them i'm going to have
your head above water never happen but

290
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,169
you need to figure out where people have
access to stuff that they don't need

291
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:39,679
right we talk about the right people
having access to the right data part of

292
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,700
that is making sure that your insiders
are actually users don't have access to

293
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,669
a whole bunch of data and a whole bunch
of systems that they don't need access

294
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:47,119
to

295
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,080
well if we're looking at how people
behave if we're looking at the actual

296
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,730
day that they access we should be able
to figure out the data that they don't

297
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,509
need access to if I'm in a group and
that group gives me access to a bunch of

298
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:04,639
data and i'm not using anything that
group gives me access to and in fact

299
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:08,629
i'll be like all the other peers of that
group we should go to highlight that we

300
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:11,809
should be able to understand where
people have access to data that they do

301
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:16,428
the only way to do that is to understand
all potential access and tomorrow

302
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:17,509
actually

303
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:22,550
so turn the lights and now we've
actually started to make changes to our

304
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,129
environment maybe we're making changes
from a security perspective without

305
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:29,150
disrupting right we want to lock down
the most sensitive to get rid of global

306
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:33,890
access simplify permissions right we
want to prune unnecessary access that

307
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,680
people are groups that they don't need
they should be pulled out

308
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,320
we should get rid of all the lorry
improvement active directory and file

309
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,129
system and we want to start by the way
identifying data owners that's going to

310
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:48,020
come and apply it to the final stage
here estate turn on the lights didn't

311
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,540
take a lot of work might take some
technology and tooling but it didn't

312
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,960
take a lot of work we have to take the
controls putting preventive controls in

313
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,890
place that takes a little work it takes
a little engagement your business that

314
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,280
started that means you're starting to
make changes to access control you want

315
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,580
to do that safely but that's not
something general you push a button do

316
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,879
there's generally a project involved
that finally you want to sustain this

317
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,940
over time you want to make sure that
your people your process in your

318
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,170
technology all work together to make
sure the data security that it's

319
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,290
monitored that people have access to
what they're supposed to and that means

320
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,629
that it's not just a one-time project

321
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,390
you also want to make sure that you have
the right processes in place to keep

322
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:27,980
this going over time so the first thing
that we want to do is identify our date

323
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:33,950
on the people who should be making
decisions about access about who should

324
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,400
have access to this financial records
and who should have access to these HR

325
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,150
files and should have access to this
department chair and who shouldn't have

326
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,860
access to MIT

327
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,459
those aren't necessarily the guys going
to help us like me my old job

328
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:52,370
it's not even the person who manages
who's ever making the request right it's

329
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,790
a data you need people outside of mighty
outside of security have the right

330
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,389
context can actually make these
decisions understand the data understand

331
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,170
the business understanding should have
access if you ever try to identify a

332
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,010
donor

333
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:09,140
it's a nightmare right on average and
this is I've seen this garden says IDC

334
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:14,030
says this on average take six to eight
hours to identify de honor for a single

335
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,660
hole because you're looking at filename
to look at your permissions but

336
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,450
permissions there's five rooms that have
access to this folder it's open to

337
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,320
everybody who do i go do and then once
you get the content and you figure out

338
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,500
what department-issue taking that
department they tell you I don't like

339
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,240
this I don't have anything good

340
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,290
alright never had anybody I know what
happened to me before but once you start

341
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,389
monitoring how people behave

342
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,380
it's amazing how easy it is to find your
data would you can go to somebody and

343
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,680
say yeah I know you don't want to be the
data on here you may not over this is

344
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,520
but every single person that touching
this file works for you so you're the

345
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,629
owner we're gonna start figuring out the
right security place once you monitor

346
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,020
how people behave very straightforward
to figure out the native lawsuits not

347
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,610
your most active user 99 times out of a
hundred that user's manual don't know

348
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,389
your one phone call away once you
identify your honors though you need to

349
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,850
start if needed the ability to make
decisions

350
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,490
the first thing that you want to do is
make sure that when somebody needs

351
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,480
access to something it's Daytona not to
help desk that person's boss that

352
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,130
actually makes the decision yes or no
should Brian have access to this and

353
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:20,570
ideally you want to automate that I need
access to something I go to a mechanism

354
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:25,700
of my page or portal or something i say
i want access to this data that request

355
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,570
gets right data owner or multiple data
owners maybe you have an authorization

356
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,000
workflow data owner says yes or no

357
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,450
they say yes I get the access if they
say yes but only for a certain period of

358
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,980
time that you automatically taken away
think about process that you just not

359
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,310
put in place not only to the right
people have access to the data but the

360
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,490
date owners make a decision about who
should and shouldn't have access and

361
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,960
when you got monitoring place think
about the automaker you have now you

362
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,150
know that brian asked for access on this
day

363
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,110
here's why he did it here's what it said
you needed before here's who approved it

364
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,990
why they approved it when they approved
it because you've got a monitoring

365
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,920
control place

366
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,090
here's everything that the bride like
that access imagine how much more

367
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,540
security from an accountability
perspective just having that audit

368
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:14,720
record you picked up a cold last trip
apologize it's not just the

369
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,420
authorization workflow that you want
others involved in all right you want

370
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,570
them reviewing access on a regular basis

371
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:24,350
let's go back to our friend Elon Musk
niggas who has access to data but

372
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,379
probably doesn't need it

373
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,680
based on his behavior right we can
automatically identify that maybe all

374
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,840
the map but imagine a better scenario

375
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,459
once we've identified our owners once a
quarter one year once every six months

376
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,040
whatever whatever it is you're basing
your policy

377
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,240
typically we see one Supporter the owner
goes and reviews who has access to their

378
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,160
data now we have actionable that
information is about this guy who isn't

379
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,060
behaving like he's in your group anymore
it's not something an IT security this

380
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,629
ravine that access I'm a date on i'm
looking at the people have access to my

381
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:59,490
data and this guy's flag is visible look
like you belong in my room anymore based

382
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,600
on behavior that's among the most
actionable things you can do a donor but

383
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,649
you get that far

384
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,350
you need to simplify your permissions
identify your owners and then put a

385
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,939
mechanism place for this to happen

386
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,840
this tends not to happen overnight but
then as a data under your review access

387
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,139
you pull that person out and now you're
inherently more secure be something with

388
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,740
the right context somebody who
understands data understands their team

389
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,580
understands their business hopefully
your business i should say is making a

390
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,090
decision about who should and shouldn't
have access and you're giving that

391
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:32,850
person information about behavior about
all of the detection tools that you have

392
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:37,679
in place that make their job make that
review job easy once you have metadata

393
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,100
in place you're constantly gathering all
this information is also much that you

394
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,750
can automate right all of you actually
have to say if i had to guess probably

395
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:50,190
two-thirds of the people in this room
work for an organization that has a

396
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,390
retention and disposition policy for
data i also have a guest of those two

397
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,840
thirds and actually have a policy to
find that it's less much everyone's

398
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,409
customer and it's less than a quarter
that are actually applying your

399
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,670
retention policies to unstructured data
it is notoriously difficult to do we

400
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:09,150
tend not to delete anything to keep her
forever just in case because you'd

401
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,230
rather not delete something that needed
online and delete something illegal

402
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,980
substances hey what happened that data
so we have retention policies but once

403
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,220
we actually understand behavior and we
understand content and we understand

404
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,550
permissions and ownership we can
actually click our retention policies in

405
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,530
place and autonomy

406
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:30,629
deletion archiving disposal updated we
can automate quarantine if i save a

407
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,330
spreadsheet that's got a bunch of
patient records in my personal Drive

408
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,240
that's the wrong place for that data
doesn't mean i'm doing something

409
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,560
delicious right but that's probably the
wrong place my dad probably breaks the

410
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,639
policies that you guys working so hard
to put vicks when I save it if I

411
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,570
monitoring behavior and processing
system should automatically identify

412
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,129
something sensitive when my place
leaving behind it says hey this is the

413
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,070
one place that was booming business
reason that's the kind of maybe

414
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:00,240
automating of quarantine automating the
retention automating disposition

415
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,870
automated migration and consolidations
once you have metadata and you've got

416
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,520
the system that can actually analyze it

417
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,040
these are the kinds of things actually
automate and that's how you're going to

418
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,000
stay in overtime right you're not going
to go through and cleanup project every

419
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,800
other year is a healthier now and I've
been part of the cleanup projects before

420
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,760
especially before the advent of this
kind of metadata and monitoring but once

421
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,150
you have all this meditative think of
all the things automate think how much

422
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,350
easier your life we think how much more
secure you'll be the policies you have

423
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,340
in place to protect data actually get
enacted on the day that they were

424
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,780
designed to protect so we've turned the
lights we put good preventive controls

425
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,350
in place we've gotten rid of the really
bad for that controls the global access

426
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:44,250
the orange qualitative data and now once
we identify her owners and get them

427
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,930
involved and once we put automation
place we can sustain this overtime so

428
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:52,350
think about the model that you've got
your actually monitoring and you're

429
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,300
protecting your data from the inside out

430
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,290
this is the opposite of that candy bar
fast i'm not saying by the way get rid

431
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:01,440
of your firewall i'm not saying get rid
of your perimeter i'm not saying get rid

432
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,620
of your end . monitoring i'm not saying
get rid of identity management data loss

433
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,879
prevention or any of the other controls
the technology that place what i am

434
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,260
saying is that if you decide that
protecting unstructured data you decide

435
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,500
to protect your data important and we're
here

436
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,450
more and more that it is becoming a
critical critical to data security to

437
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,690
protect unstructured data you need to
protect it from the inside out so let's

438
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:28,320
think about where we are we turn the
lights we've detected we put detective

439
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,560
controls in place we understand
potential access we understand about

440
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,580
access to what we understand that puts

441
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,490
this group here's what's gonna grant
them access to the interview know where

442
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,520
users are you know our service accounts
are you know our admin accounts are and

443
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,389
where baselining all Behavior now we put
preventive controls place we've gotten

444
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,710
rid of global access we've gotten rid of
overexposed sensitive data or we just

445
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:52,390
put a good you know a good tight control
we continue behavior model and we will

446
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:56,380
remove all the dangerous artifacts all
of it all of the low-hanging fruit from

447
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,160
active directory and the file systems
and finally we have identified honors

448
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,610
and automated week and we have owners
involved the authorization workflow

449
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,540
owners involve the entire review process
and we've got good accountability

450
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,960
controls not just for today is being
used but how people are getting access

451
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,590
to that data is improving and when they
produce and all of the other water

452
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:18,939
records that one if you're going to make
sure that your assets properly secure i

453
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,320
guarantee you by the way if you pick
another business critical asset like for

454
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,560
instance the cash accounts that your
finance finance department manages

455
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,220
they've got all of these controls in
place they know exactly who's got access

456
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,600
to that account they know exactly how
it's being used by who and got budget

457
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,110
owners that reviewing access on a
regular basis if you want to treat your

458
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:43,030
data like an organizational asset like a
business asset and not like a server for

459
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,850
peace of network equipment for the
workstation or anything else you want to

460
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,040
do business asset

461
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,740
these are the kinds of controls that we
need to have a place because if you

462
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,770
don't have had over the chaotic
environment and this is one of you guys

463
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,889
you guys are all super smart but we had
over the environments were active

464
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,030
directory complete mess

465
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,820
we don't know how many users how many
groups we have don't know where they

466
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,810
grant access we don't know what date is
out there or how it's being used even

467
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,919
know in some cases how much data we have
all these are issues that we hear a lot

468
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,520
of organizations that have a lot of
unstructured data but once we help them

469
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,730
walk through this methodology take it to
a state thing sustained over time and

470
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,170
they could start focusing out fix I'm
completely blown away every time I get

471
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,410
to the slide but as it turns out
everything I've talked about is

472
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,100
something everyone can actually do again
complete coincidence wish you'd like to

473
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,850
learn more about what this would look
like in your environment if you like a

474
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,449
risk assessment and actually turn on the
lights in your environment on one server

475
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,830
on one platform even in your entire
environment we do

476
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,580
risk assessment and you really walk
through that whole detective days

477
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,269
whatever day you want to look at your
map all the sensitive data will add to

478
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:49,019
active directory wonderful Matt back to
the file systems themselves will show

479
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:52,649
you all the potential access and will
create a big report that says you know

480
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:55,469
what youre so many folders you have that
sensitive data here's how many of those

481
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:00,059
that are open globally here's how many
you know threats that were detected

482
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,769
loudly monitoring data

483
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:04,890
here's how the scale data we found
everything that I talked about in the

484
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,309
tech space we can show you over the
course of this risk assessment and then

485
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:12,059
we can walk through if you would take to
put preventive controls in place here's

486
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:15,450
what it would take to sustain this over
time even if you do that a subset of

487
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,960
data this by the way is your charge this
is something that you'd like to see

488
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:25,529
please come talk to us yet working on my
network for permissions I need to be

489
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:27,480
able to have that going to check
everything

490
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,889
it's a great country and don't smile
using ad network that's a really great

491
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:36,059
question for those who get in here the
questions on this assessment of your

492
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:36,899
network

493
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:40,649
what kind of credentials which could
anybody so the answer is no anybody

494
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:44,549
could not do this is a hundred percent
process you need to install us would we

495
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:48,450
help you get up you give us a window its
software basically the windows and

496
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,720
sequel server we split up and then as
far as credentials

497
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,720
we need to domain user to bind to
whatever domains are going to walk we

498
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,769
need to use it's got backup operator our
users filesystems analogous permissions

499
00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:02,220
for sharepoint exchanged right so it's
going to depend on what platforms you

500
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,730
want to look at and when you actually
want to monitor but we you got this down

501
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:10,740
to a science thousand times no nobody
randomly can decide on your risk

502
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,940
assessment built environment just to see
what i can find that very question

503
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:22,110
yeah question any of the day you're
Annalise ready to leave

504
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:27,870
I it absolutely not so the question is
does any day this threat assessment ever

505
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:28,860
leave the building

506
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,918
the answer is all the data produced
during the threat assessment belongs to

507
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:32,909
you

508
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,510
this is a hundred percent on-premise
solution so none of the day that the

509
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:40,050
metadata analysis or any data at all
ever

510
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:44,460
ends up in any hands or any systems that
are controlled by you and what we doing

511
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,600
that I mean we will help you prepare
this this this document this artifact we

512
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,899
give it to you and we don't use it
anywhere else but another word you're

513
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,790
not using databases out there somewhere
help you do this

514
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:01,800
absolutely not everything all the
analysis everything that we do is in

515
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:13,379
your environment and systems that you
spent yeah so the question is everything

516
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,060
a nap or virtual appliance or what have
you

517
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,840
so it runs on a application server
cluster that runs on windows and sequel

518
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,250
gentleman is also not generally we
always have a distributed RT

519
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:29,100
recollection network so for instance in
a very simple installation we even have

520
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,699
an application server 17 sequel we also
have a collective services physically

521
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,180
close to the file server but have you
eat one of those collectors by the way

522
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,450
can support 5200 file servers so it's
not like you to set up one for every

523
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:43,530
every box generally during this risk
assessment agree you give us one or two

524
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:47,280
VMS and we spend everything out to start
running it as far as a production

525
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,550
deployment and back customers at
hundreds of thousands of users and

526
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,750
petabytes of data

527
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,570
certainly you're talking about a bigger
distributing collections framework but

528
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,960
still it's all controlled by them
because everything's windows people it

529
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,540
takes us the company lion takes 90
minutes been up in general to take 2-3

530
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,500
hours to get it up and running in a day
to see all of the texts controls

531
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,340
internal monitoring map the environment
scan for sensitive data and then we

532
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:15,090
start preparing this report flower
baselining I user activity by the way a

533
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:18,810
lot of the more advanced threat models
as we call of the admins not behaving

534
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,799
like admins some of the really advanced
grants for detection service account

535
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,970
monitoring abnormal access to steal
sensitive data that typically takes 3-4

536
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:32,040
weeks of behavior before those threat
models stop throwing false-positive you

537
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,279
need to see activity so let me know
what's normal

538
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,490
so we alert you when something's
abnormal it actually isn't some of the

539
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:41,489
threat models by the way are really
valid right from day one

540
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:45,299
some of the more rudimentary or
threshold-based grants were detection

541
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,060
cooking lots of files and started

542
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:52,549
data exfiltration on stale or sensitive
data those will light up and start

543
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,430
working as they're supposed to ride away
some of the more advanced ones take a

544
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:59,270
few weeks of user activity bacon time
you're not doing anything by the way

545
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:04,250
sometimes I said make in time or
analytic . people who maybe have done a

546
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,740
behavioral ethics project in the past
you start saying well now i'm going to

547
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,580
be up all night tuning rules everything
is always learning analysis we do is

548
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,870
only understood everything just a box
just light up the the alert threat

549
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:18,890
models and you and all those are
available as part of success

550
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:25,129
yeah yeah yeahs number of different
locations and how's that is that where

551
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:32,630
you have to that you know her eat or
entertaining you know go ahead and great

552
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,020
alligator is a great question for those
who can actually hear what if I got

553
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,250
multiple locations

554
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:42,320
the answer is you'll have it still have
that single application server or

555
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,860
cluster it's a really big environment
and then you have those collectors visit

556
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:51,110
close to those each of those locations
because those collectors are gathering

557
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:55,190
but potentially huge amount of
information from the big nap or the

558
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:00,710
Isilon file servers sharepoint we've got
one of our biggest customers has net

559
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:05,150
naps in 12 different data centers in
each netapp has a 50 million pile events

560
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,720
a day so we have a collector close to
each one of those naps they do all the

561
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,200
processing them and send it back to the
application server which were all the

562
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,879
analysis some of the alerting and all
the reporting everything else is great

563
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,320
question though as you can imagine a lot
of questions the smart ground you guys

564
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,470
are realizing this is a huge amount of
metadata this isn't something that I'm

565
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,109
gonna drop my iphone your network at
something you don't know everything you

566
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:30,380
need to have some sort of infrastructure
to gather it but the ability to gather

567
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,370
process analyzing the percent all of
this metadata in ways that are really

568
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:38,600
useful and actionable is literally what
promises designs reason I tell that this

569
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,839
origin story the beginning is taking an
idea that our founders first of all

570
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,530
their engineers and technologists they
lived these problems before and

571
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:49,010
everything that I've shown you these
former owners perspective we built

572
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,079
ourselves we developed all of our
technology

573
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:55,759
because we realize the tools in place
the tools that existed and even some of

574
00:36:55,759 --> 00:36:58,640
the repurposing of other tools that you
might use to attack this problem in

575
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,598
various ways simply one sufficient
because of the huge amount of medication

576
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,049
that you do it together but we do this
without impacting your environment all

577
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:09,109
like to prove it to you and that's part
of what the risk assessment does it will

578
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:12,680
show you how we collect everything how
this analysis works and it will also

579
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,788
prove to you hopefully it doesn't impact
your environment we've got about 5,000

580
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:20,299
customers only now we've got a 12 month
from last year's we're having success

581
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:24,440
but you know what i want to impress upon
analysis if you think this might be

582
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,190
valuable

583
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:30,319
I encourage you to risk assessment only
because you get a complete you know a

584
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:34,430
full license of all of our software you
get our help setting up and using it and

585
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:38,930
you produce risk assessment for you for
free this this doesn't require any

586
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:42,440
licensing or services time to seeing a
lot of value

587
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:51,920
yeah metrics wall scroll also second
question you have there any limitations

588
00:37:51,920 --> 00:38:02,180
type of server hardware or yes with your
questions any metrics about the impact

589
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,169
of the environment

590
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:08,239
I'll start with that one so generally on
file so for windows sharepoint unix

591
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:13,039
exchange we have agents that sit on the
file server together the activities

592
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,809
specifically we never write to disk on
any platform on any sort of monitor and

593
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:19,789
that's true across any platform

594
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:25,309
there's never an aisle for the agents
it's about six to 10 megs of ram 01 cpu

595
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:29,359
and again we never write this so it's
very low weight since the kernel level

596
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,619
of windows and there isn't it sitting in
an analogous place on sharepoint unix

597
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:40,400
expect as far as the second question
actually this is the second half to the

598
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,640
first part of your question on in our
database

599
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,308
it takes about half of Game four
thousand users per month to gather that

600
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:51,019
information so it's really really small
from a data storage perspective most of

601
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:55,488
our customers will keep six to 12 months
of hot activity data another 2-3 years

602
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:58,849
of rolled up statistics everything else
is automatically archived off our hands

603
00:38:58,849 --> 00:38:59,660
off but it's very

604
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,200
easy to suck that back in for running a
report having some sort of forensic

605
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,368
analysis so generally doesn't break the
bank at all at the data center or on the

606
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:10,730
net and our politics was the windows
file

607
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:15,200
yeah yeah this is the best way to do
this is take a look at our install

608
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,180
requirements document we go back to
basically windows 2008 we can we have

609
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,598
some older servers that monitor
sharepoint it goes back all the way

610
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,849
exchange and goes back two thousand
seven and then as devices are going to

611
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:34,039
depend on the specific format specific
on tap version for solaris can capture

612
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:38,599
card version and ice along similar
concept it really depends on the

613
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:43,940
specific platform that's that has been
around since 2005 doesn't five started

614
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,619
16 and we generally have supported
everything that was common to that

615
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:53,780
generally when we start monitoring
platform its seemingly rare for us to

616
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:58,160
drop support from honoring that platform
just ate it just tends to live there

617
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,950
makes sense to monitor is that is your
vegetable any other questions

618
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,829
look at that you guys are going to get
three whole minutes back in the day i

619
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:14,779
hope you appreciate what I've done I
thank you all so much as this video

620
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:15,230
something that
