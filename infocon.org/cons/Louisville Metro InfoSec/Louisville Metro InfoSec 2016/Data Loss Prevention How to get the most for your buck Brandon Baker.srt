1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,109
welcome everyone and you come in and
listening to be on this topic I think

2
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:14,969
it's pretty important topic plan access
hearing broker or as a gardener calls it

3
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:22,109
a child to access broker word access i
think is a misnomer because it's not

4
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:30,660
about identity and access management is
it is the control you put in your

5
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:40,500
network to extend those controls out to
saps my name is Nikki I'm not a BP at

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:48,120
capturing information security based out
of Cincinnati local people here and I do

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,989
these presentations at local life
chapters throughout like I'm a big

8
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,419
believer in supporting the community

9
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:06,540
thank you grab so has became about their
program 2012 first speech you started

10
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,700
showing up on the market and you know as
we'll see here we're gonna we're going

11
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:19,770
to talk about the evolution has as it
came up 32 years so you know we're all

12
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,360
familiar with the traditional security
model that we've all been to our careers

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,210
implementing and maintaining we have our
data center regional offices and

14
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,699
security stack that consists of many
controls that we implemented through our

15
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,680
network to make sure we know what's
going on and can control bad things and

16
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,680
stop delicious behaviors and activities
from happening all the way from next-gen

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:55,950
firewalls IDs IPS systems secure my big
waves or proxies still very important

18
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,189
email gateway its members and boxes

19
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:07,910
of course that dlp solution so the
standard traditional security model has

20
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:16,490
has exploded in the edge of your network
is just no longer exists so the next

21
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,440
thing to come up was basically
infrastructure-as-a-service where you

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:34,250
are applications and other back-office
functions are being run in an

23
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:40,100
infrastructure-as-a-service like there
was a slow ramp-up too trusting these

24
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:46,190
organizations basically running you step
on somebody else's computer but you were

25
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:52,250
able to implement the same types of
controls you had and the traditional

26
00:02:52,250 --> 00:03:00,260
model in the infrastructure as a service
providers and virtual versions of

27
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:07,760
firewalls IDs its's all of the controls
you have corporate you can now extend to

28
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,579
an infrastructure as a service provider
and Trust started coming up for these

29
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:23,239
solutions through various regulatory
bodies who take a deep look at how these

30
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,920
organizations are running their business
to give you a level of assurance that

31
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:35,809
the security controls that you would
expect be run in these infrastructure as

32
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:44,420
a service providers were being inherited
so it is very very important that these

33
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:50,119
governing bodies actually survive these
infrastructure service they really

34
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:57,380
didn't have much to do it has so the
need for cats became about as SAS

35
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:03,530
application software service because
here you are you no longer running these

36
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,890
applications in an infrastructure that
you control whether local one gram or

37
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,739
and

38
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,300
infrastructure as a service provider
these are applications that somebody

39
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:21,180
else's maintain their in charge of
version control or in charge of all the

40
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,390
things you're traditionally in charge of
taking care of and you know this number

41
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:33,870
keeps growing even even from the first
time I presented it was 15,000 and the

42
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,450
latest cloud report came out from Mexico
who partnered with and we're up to

43
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:47,670
20,000 you know I know I took a look at
just a brief link to an article about

44
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:56,100
the number of marketing startups that
are just funded in Israel alone there's

45
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,520
a hundred twenty different marketing
startups that are coming out of Israel

46
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,340
doesn't count let's go out here so so
what's up with these apps on most of

47
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,099
them are put together very quickly using
agile development practices and they are

48
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:19,080
brought to market as quickly as possible
so that those organizations can monetize

49
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:26,250
their investments and so one thing it
can be provider does for you is they

50
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:35,610
actually look at how ready that
organization is too how's your day you

51
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,070
and when you look at the various
line-of-business applications you can

52
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:48,090
see that with very very few exceptions
until you get to the storage area they

53
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:55,409
really haven't caught up to modern-day
enterprise-ready applications so you

54
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:02,340
know that that that really does pose
arrest because while your organization

55
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:09,270
may section select few SAS applications
for users to use you're all familiar

56
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,370
with microsoft strong learning tappings
right now to get you to use this season

57
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,140
five

58
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,330
you know those moves those calculated
moves are only a small percentage

59
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:27,489
the applications that are actually used
within the organization and so most

60
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:33,969
Cosby vendors will providing free
discovery service help sell their

61
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:38,079
product of course but during that
discovery service they're averaging

62
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:44,289
close to a thousand applications that
are discovered within our innovation and

63
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:50,110
in order early adopters of Casby has
been highly regulated organizations

64
00:06:50,110 --> 00:07:01,329
large financial institutions insurers
medical device providers the RSA

65
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:07,479
conference this year is a rock the
casbah ball session and you know the for

66
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:14,769
CIOs that were on the panel talk
specifically about discovering the

67
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:19,929
business side apps that they didn't know
about importantly the the unsanctioned

68
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:21,909
user lat

69
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:28,419
it's very important so to understand
exactly what's going on your network and

70
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:36,849
it extends beyond what you are your
firewall laws hockey lost telling so

71
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:40,779
that sort of leads into the risk you
know what's the risk of allowing all

72
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:46,479
these unsanctioned apps to run within
organizations and the answer is very

73
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:53,409
risky so the latest cloud report i came
up with a few minutes

74
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:59,079
pardon the pun here include a little bit
of it so on average there's 26 pieces of

75
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:04,929
cloud map malware in the enterprise and
we had these numbers come from real

76
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:12,578
discovery processes real discovery
cycles within organizations who have

77
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:20,679
signed up and 55.9 percent of malware
infected files are actually shared with

78
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:26,888
others either within the organization or
publicly external uses both of which are

79
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:27,569
bats

80
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:36,690
a huge amount of us there and you know
they look at the probability of data

81
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,639
breach when you introduce that's
applications and it's they came up with

82
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:47,730
the number of its three times more
likely to have a data breach and lasts

83
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,190
about a little bit of fun here is that
62.3 percent of cloud apps that don't

84
00:08:53,190 --> 00:09:02,069
have terms and conditions that do not
specify that the customer data most of

85
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:11,099
these flowers consider the data you put
in their application to be there and you

86
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,720
know you're fine as long as you're
paying service and subscription and but

87
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:24,630
what happens when you terminate services
of that manufacture so you know we

88
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,589
really want to get through these five
slides you know it's tough to

89
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:34,649
encapsulate the thoughts behind the five
steps to five strategies and you should

90
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:42,000
adopt in order to ring saps under
control and one is you have to have

91
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,370
credibility with your peers you have to
have a discovery process that allows you

92
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:53,939
to on exactly what is happening within
your organization not only with users

93
00:09:53,939 --> 00:10:00,839
within the confines of the perimeter but
you are remote workforce you have to be

94
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:08,759
able to articulate the challenges and
and gain by in by having the knowledge

95
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:15,089
up front that these things are happening
right now they pose a huge risk to the

96
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:23,670
organization and it'll actually give you
some credibility with the line of

97
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,599
business over

98
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,089
and c-level executives so and i'm in
knowing the enterprise readiness of

99
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:37,350
those is another value that has products
off so what goes into determining

100
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:44,790
whether or not an application is
enterprise-ready well most of them look

101
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:52,529
at present to you general information
about the application how long they been

102
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:57,630
around where the red corner where the
data centers were they post that data

103
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,649
privacy laws coming into play

104
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,319
you need to be very aware of to wear
that is being stored you know how long

105
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:11,310
have they been registered whether
they're public or private all the way

106
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:17,130
down to what regulations and compliance
regulations they've achieved within the

107
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:24,420
organization and all the way down to
triple-a features like whether or not

108
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:31,680
they offer a restriction of access by IP
address are supporting little bit factor

109
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,489
authentication or single sign-on through
the fs and other means and of course how

110
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:44,009
do they treat their data whether or not
the encrypted at rest even if they do

111
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:49,560
encrypted data stay on the keys you know
those keeps so you know you have to know

112
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,420
whether or not you need to think about
encrypting the data reporting gets up

113
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:01,649
there and of course SL hygiene making
sure that they have strong ciphers in

114
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:06,779
place and if they're not honorable to
the latest happens so all those risk

115
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:14,939
factors go into deciding whether or not
that is enterprise rig so the second

116
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:20,399
strategy is understanding the role of
cloud within an organization

117
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:28,640
the the days of denying access to things
your you're not aware of our are over

118
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,410
you know because companies are realizing
that they can increase their top line

119
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:41,000
growth by implementing agile development
cycles and making sure that more

120
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,560
thorough testing and and increasing
their competitive advantage

121
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,660
there's costings involved they can spin
up as much infrastructure as they need

122
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,730
to roll something out with the
pay-as-you-go box and and of course the

123
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,910
lower barrier for entry so companies and
lines of business are are looking to the

124
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,910
cloud and it's a good strategy

125
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:11,990
it's amazing how quickly things are
moving so the third strategy

126
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:17,150
the third thing you should make sure
you're in front of it is collaborating

127
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:22,910
with the heads of making sure that
you're involved in those meetings that

128
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:29,540
where were these things are discussed
you know these peers have to be your

129
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,310
champions and they have to ultimately
have your back things go sideways is

130
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:41,030
always side right so your vision should
align pretty closely with what they're

131
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:46,640
doing and what their strategy but you
have to know there's in order to do that

132
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:53,960
and it should be staged you should / s
to make the investment needed to get

133
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,710
there

134
00:13:54,710 --> 00:14:00,770
your first few SAS applications is
learning curve for because it's

135
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:07,100
something you need to build a learning
curve and there are your lessons over

136
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,910
time and then consider how you're going
to deal with shadow like those

137
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:19,430
unauthorized apps that your users are
using because they think it's an easier

138
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,430
way to get things done or

139
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:29,529
publishes activity you have to have
policies around how to deal with and

140
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:39,100
applications and reports is to actually
implement safe cloudy day in England and

141
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,380
and this can be done by traditional
methods first you have to discover

142
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,600
what's out there you have to know what's
out there before you can make good

143
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,390
decisions on how to control that step
you have to find out how many cloud apps

144
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:01,149
are writing and how user you're using it
being able to drill down into risky

145
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:06,490
usage of that sense you can have a
high-risk application

146
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:11,950
it's ok to use because the data going
into is is very low rates you know like

147
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:18,250
brochure where marketing at something
that really doesn't have much value to

148
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:26,020
malicious users and by the same token
you you can have a very secure app that

149
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,760
is enterprise-ready that still poses
some recipes controls around dlp

150
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,430
encryption organization and being able
to get to where you can have greater

151
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,719
control and say yes you can use that
apps but sorry but I'm gonna let you

152
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,240
upload things to or we're not going to
let you download product so having a

153
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:58,329
granular control over those applications
and then you gotta tie it all up and

154
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:02,199
about you got to basically have a
strategic roadmap so that you can

155
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:09,880
consistently evaluate new SAS apps and
brought to your attention by those line

156
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,970
of business owners who you have
relationships with and be able to very

157
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,589
quickly established the risk involved so
that they can ascertain the risk

158
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:25,660
involved in working with that SS
application and and feeling

159
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:31,638
and creating a sense of co-ownership so
that you know there's never a battle

160
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:38,029
behind because there's there's usually a
good business case behind usage have a

161
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:42,439
lot of tabs and you know what when
things go right make sure you crazy

162
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:50,509
these guys and he Bandhu praise and make
sure that their success in the sex of

163
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:57,350
their their project is tied to yours
sets so they went to business wins and

164
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,299
you all will have made it happen through
very good plan

165
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:10,250
let's take a look at the purities cases
here requirements and how to solve

166
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,939
because like as being as you'll see
coming up

167
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:19,789
compasses a wide range of features a
wide range of controls so it starts with

168
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:25,010
the basics here basically discovering
what's out there and you can do that

169
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:33,260
through various means some more granular
than others but it's very important that

170
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,740
you get a deep understanding of what's
going on in the cloud

171
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:44,480
what's being used even identifying
duplicate usage showing the line of

172
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,320
business might have a marketing at that
you want everybody to use but

173
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,269
everybody's saying hey this one works
better I'd rather use that so you have

174
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:58,309
to make sure you can make the line of
business folks aware of overlapping

175
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:04,340
applications that are being use and you
know finding those who attended absent

176
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,740
in and assess the risk you know making
sure you look at the risk factors on

177
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:16,610
disaster after adopting to make sure
that you can provide it and put back to

178
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:25,309
curing light bulbs second is of course
to safely enable the Ascension now you

179
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:33,200
know you need to have to apply the same
governance and risk and compliance rules

180
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:40,190
that you've formulated for your business
to these applications so that requires

181
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:47,210
greater visibility and the ability to
discover new apps as they come up and

182
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:53,120
lock ways up right around him and and
detect and remediating things such as

183
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,770
malware you know that's that's a feature
that select Academy vendors have the

184
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:05,539
ability to apply threat intelligence to
the data scenes and also utilizing the

185
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:14,330
machine learning bass anomaly detection
user behavioral health network analysis

186
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:19,639
is the new thing that everybody is
looking and we want to make sure that

187
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:25,459
you can implement that within your has
be solution i'm sorry your day would see

188
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:37,909
it and also making sure that you can
integrate that solution with your

189
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:44,240
existence . tools so i mean is this
example you know Bob and accounting he's

190
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:51,799
uploading customer data to onedrive it's
it's the sanction that well no might not

191
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:55,970
be a sanction that those are the same so
he's going to onedrive but he's doing it

192
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:01,309
from his mobile phone you know which
which is in compliance type of activity

193
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:10,639
the things you can discover within Casby
solution so the last requirement is

194
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:17,809
around system system granular governance
for all the absence you sanction as well

195
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:23,149
as the shadow ITF so again being able to
discover what's being used being able

196
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:29,600
identified a shadow IT and gain control
over them and having visibility and

197
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,030
control access to all the cloud apps and

198
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:37,200
making sure you can do it from any
device whether they're within the

199
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,900
perimeter of your network or outside the
perimeter as a mobile workforce making

200
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:51,000
sure you can identify and stop data loss
dlp solutions should be able to be

201
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,010
integrated with you can be solution
either via cloud-based offering or

202
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:02,670
candle with your hand in hand with your
brand you know the number

203
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:10,050
LP solution and making sure that you can
show compliance the auditors who are

204
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:17,399
never going to come around and ask about
how that is being used so this is the

205
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,110
part I like you know I came up as an
engineer deployed firewalls and proxies

206
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:28,050
and other controls throughout my career
so where does it pull within you know

207
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:36,180
quasi OSI model here later form below
you got your firewall IPS UTM those days

208
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:42,000
are long gone today you have next-gen
firewall and web process as you'll see

209
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,220
later those firewall next-gen firewall
and with Roxy manufacturers are very

210
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,440
quickly gobbling up as be starts because
they realize that they have the

211
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,440
technology and inner workings within
them to serve some of the same functions

212
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,690
and some of these functions do overlap
you know as far as identified

213
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,980
applications

214
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,350
one popular next-gen firewall out
there's is all about control you know

215
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,939
their their their claim to fame is there
a tidy engine you do it very efficiently

216
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:22,560
but but they never probably never
expected the number of SAP's out there

217
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:31,530
to expand not tens of thousands so with
has be you're able to look at the a

218
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:35,940
player and above so you're able to see
the activity that's going on you're able

219
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:41,250
to see the data is being stored within
those has within those ass applications

220
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,730
and and allowing for control

221
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:53,130
safe stable so so let's take this a step
further this is this is an example that

222
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,870
I like because you know in the old world
you get these this level of information

223
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:04,169
out of your box your firewall logs you
got web session and started you can see

224
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,580
the person login you can see where from
the browser they're using you can see

225
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,929
where they're going

226
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:17,010
you can see what type of HTTP operations
are doing you might be able to look into

227
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:23,730
the headers and and perhaps the post
body itself into a little filtering and

228
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,840
your sim presents you with this
information

229
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:36,090
you know what the cast device you get a
much more richer feel and feedback from

230
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:43,560
this same session so we can say see that
yes Mary logged in but you used her /

231
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:49,590
gmail account as your box ID and she's
logging in from a macbook which isn't

232
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:55,770
sanctioned device and the box like she's
going to date is actually going into

233
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:01,950
Germany know and that might be a
violation right there

234
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:07,020
and by the way she's sharing it with
that guy named John from New probably a

235
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:12,750
competitor so and within their when they
had the application later you can see

236
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:18,840
that the file storage and gives you a
risk great and those risk ratings are

237
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:26,310
used to help you in alerting and making
you aware of a novelist behave and on

238
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:30,870
top of that you can see all the activity
done within the application because the

239
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:37,199
canopy provider has very detailed
information exactly the operations can

240
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,320
be performed in a SAT and you know the
data itself you can determine whether

241
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:51,780
it's sensitive data API I pci-e HR and
other classifications so the summary you

242
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,360
get perhaps into your

243
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:01,199
a more or whatever dashboard you like is
much more rich then you get out of a

244
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:10,320
traditional firewall boxes so I want to
go a little deeper into deployment

245
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,790
options you know because that's where I
that's what i like and at the far left

246
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:24,149
and you can gain some visibility fly
pulling your information from your web

247
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:32,250
proxy firewall some has be most can be
vendors have been running this month and

248
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:43,170
plug into a port mirror Pat loop and
preferably decrypted screen and give you

249
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:49,980
the discovery basic basic activity how
risky is it because they know the

250
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:56,700
destination you're going and they can
assign some risk risk level two so you

251
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:02,640
go from there to the API connector and
the API connector itself most of these

252
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:14,160
saps have various levels of api
functions and more mature has apps have

253
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,290
rich api that allows you to see exactly
what's going on

254
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:23,879
see what's been stored see the activity
level of each user see where they login

255
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:31,080
from and all this rich set of data so
the more mature the Casby application is

256
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,909
the better because they have tied into
and documented built into the product

257
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:47,370
the api's for these saps and can give
you a single dashboard very fine layer

258
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,030
granularity audit capabilities

259
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:56,220
what's going on within that sat so they
use the API connector then not even use

260
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,430
the admin user for that particular sat

261
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:08,510
so that they can actually do near
real-time visibility into what's going

262
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:13,940
on is again this is this is on someone
else's computer so in order to see

263
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:21,140
what's going on beyond the boundaries of
your network need a connector into that

264
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:28,790
application so the API in the reverse
proxy are are the two deployment methods

265
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:36,320
that are most commonly used for
ascension applications so you'll find

266
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,770
your cash be vendors have specific
connectors into a variety of the most

267
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:50,960
popular SAS office 365 service now and
others and that's the realm with which

268
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,570
the API connector and the reverse proxy
pencil because in the reverse proxy will

269
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:01,820
see it on the next slide better
illustrated the reverse proxy and api

270
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,860
connector especially when used in
conjunction candle at each other gives

271
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,510
you a very rich data center of what's
going on and then the forward proxy

272
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:16,910
deployment method is to control
unsanctioned application you know your

273
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:20,870
next-gen firewall in your current wood
boxes they have the ability to do that

274
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:27,709
limited application sets but they're
very rapidly building in the cats be

275
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:35,270
dictionary call it for lack of a better
term of applications that are out but

276
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:42,980
with the forward proxy you're able to
deploy it to your remote users and make

277
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:49,580
sure that you can control at global
workforce and as well as well and we'll

278
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:55,820
see that that later but the for specific
forward proxy methods are using a pack

279
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,760
file for this proxy chain watching chain
from your existing property technology

280
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,790
you have

281
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:09,540
you can change it I'll tell you how it
comes catching up on has field and using

282
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:18,240
the s3s you can . clients to specific
ip's or deploying Malaysians actually

283
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,960
performed the same functions when
they're outside network so all the way

284
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,170
from visibility to governance of
sanctioned apps to full control section

285
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:37,260
section apps so this just illustrates
the previous slide you know and in the

286
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,760
example number one and a port in a
forward proxy deployment you're

287
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,100
basically allow real-time visibility and
policy control because you can stop

288
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:54,149
these sessions as you see him happening
for on from users accessing publix and

289
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:59,220
then use case for number two is your
mobile workforce real-time visibility

290
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,670
being able to determine what they're up
to

291
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:08,460
what cloud apps they're accessing when
they're at home not work and be able to

292
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:14,250
apply the same controls the third
example is reverse proxy real-time

293
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:23,400
visibility and policy control for either
outside partners or using itin apps and

294
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:31,200
for attention that applications and then
number for finance API connector getting

295
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:39,510
that real-time visibility in distinction
questions on deployment methods i know

296
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:48,629
it's the opening up by indoors box here
at this this is what a lot of people

297
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,170
need to keep in line when they're
talking to the cast members so that you

298
00:30:52,170 --> 00:31:02,070
can know your mind exactly what features
they can offer you based on there . so

299
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:11,159
another important very important feature
that has evolved with the more mature

300
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,220
has be solutions out there is the
ability to integrate

301
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:21,460
security controls nothing's more
important that you don't need a control

302
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,270
that you need to reinvent the wheel with
you should be able to leverage your

303
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:31,000
existing controls and have that has the
solution working conjunction with you

304
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,150
know the automated integration to web
proxies firewalls in the area you're not

305
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,780
going to log into an API and
automatically create a rule but that

306
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:47,649
features cut invest your bottom dollar
that features but for now when you have

307
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,419
visibility you can at least use that
visibility that dashboard into all of

308
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:59,440
your applications and use it to create
policies are walls it should integrate

309
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,770
easily with your sins so that had him
can take that data and incorporated into

310
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:10,330
all the other data streams that are
coming at allow for good security

311
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:18,309
intelligence training SL is is is
integral to the product you really

312
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:25,870
wouldn't want to deploy ASAP to manually
manage all those usernames and passwords

313
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:33,250
it should be integrated into your
in-house users or using Active Directory

314
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:42,340
links or ad FS or federated Identity
Management should also integrate with

315
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:49,539
your DLP a lot of help providers our
cloud-based house has be providers have

316
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:57,850
a level of dlp but but it should be
validated by your internal deal because

317
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:06,158
you spent all this time money and effort
in setting your policies around dlp when

318
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,770
you implemented in the cloud you're
simply extending the same controls

319
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:17,020
policies that you've already established
internally but you can pull suspected

320
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:24,760
violations and then send them on VIP app
to your internal LP solution and have

321
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,919
them do it scanning and vinyl

322
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:33,159
whether it's a violation and coach the
users on violations and threat

323
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:37,989
prevention being able to use a threat
intelligence you know whether that be

324
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:43,600
your own thread intelligence speed or
trustee has be provided to pull in

325
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,879
enough feeds from various sources really
have a rich data set so that you can

326
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:54,668
block the no malicious stuff that's out
there and also you can't forget about

327
00:33:54,669 --> 00:34:01,210
your mobile workforce you have to be
able to control what's going on at work

328
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:11,740
force being able to automatically deploy
applications into the user store in the

329
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:21,098
MDM identifying I'm sorry automatically
distributing little profiles and being

330
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:28,270
able to employ about . have providers
don't have relations look one has a

331
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:35,500
mobile agent and so we're just about out
of time here i just want to do sort of a

332
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,869
recap some of the market activity just
to illustrate how quickly things are

333
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:44,980
moving so you know sky fence

334
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:53,710
let's go some of these other players
again started coming on board around

335
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,470
2012 very quickly

336
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:01,390
other manufacturers determine that hey
we need to get in this game so imperva

337
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,859
was one of the first to see that got
skype that's been running with that ever

338
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:08,170
since it's a great product

339
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:13,839
akamai pump money into fire layers who
you'll see later on checkpoints started

340
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:22,450
using to help enrich their has be
capabilities HP entered into a reseller

341
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:27,339
agreement with that alone and an abalone
got gobbled up by Microsoft you know

342
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:34,900
but not five months later how often
networks they acquired 0 secure that's

343
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:40,690
now the aperture so fans aperture
product was a result of the series here

344
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,340
acquisition

345
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:48,160
look up look up to two acquisitions they
bought perspective notice LG it's not

346
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,940
fully functional so then later on they
also bought elastic to help provide the

347
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:02,260
foxy technologies that are required to
incorporate as possible and then you'll

348
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:09,490
find blue coat check . and others are
all rapidly trying to catch up to the

349
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:18,879
next ghosts and Scott and it goes on and
on and on so IBM developed their own and

350
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,290
true IDM fashion and cisco announced in
there

351
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:30,130
cisco live club which was one of the
last hole valves and then just yesterday

352
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:35,890
oracle announced they are buying polara
but we also that writing on the wall

353
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:42,850
good color was started by X or hole
that's all I got

354
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:50,259
I wanted to try to keep it within 45 50
minutes here but one thing i like to ask

355
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:55,570
and it's amazing results I cat is there
anybody out there is actually

356
00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:03,460
implemented some level of hasbe
technology anybody at all

357
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:11,410
that's the exact reaction of this is the
third I said chapter had no hands so

358
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:17,170
you'll find that can be vendors are out
visiting c-level executives hopes like

359
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:25,420
me LOL product guy used to be an
engineer but I am trying to build not

360
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:31,420
interest in the product but pointing out
the need for this products that within

361
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:38,800
so many cycles coming to play might want
to consider as

362
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:50,380
participation any questions I well I
thank you very much for your time I hope

363
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,440
the rest of the day is productive for
him
