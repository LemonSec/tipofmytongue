1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,370
oh we're going to invest oh I said when
you have you know whatever helps you

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,830
didn't see we're going to talk about a
transition process from risk assessment

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,139
of risk management we're going to talk
about this in two different perspectives

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,210
one being the transition of the focus
for the shift of focus i was in the

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,130
regulatory world from pushing on risk
assessments to pushing risk management

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,650
and we're also going to talk about for
your organization's how do you how do

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,439
you successfully make that transition
risk assessment of risk management

8
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,450
perspective comes from the trenches on i
do this kind of work with clients all

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,399
the time so i'm kinda telling you
stories from the trenches as opposed to

10
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,030
just content i started in IT in 1996
which feels like a really long time ago

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,739
I can't even remember that at this point
given information security alliance

12
00:00:52,739 --> 00:01:00,538
about 2,500 miles at STG blue or in
healthcare consulting services

13
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,360
particularly the risk assessments risk
management transitioning client at risk

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,729
analysis and risk management and I'll
lead RVC iso practice square . look to

15
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,408
us to manage these kind of process for
them there's a couple certifications if

16
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:23,280
you care at all about those sober
assessment we all know what the risk

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,479
assessment is its according to Omaima
video a security program that's how i

18
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,409
establish what other risks of my
organization so that i know what i want

19
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,939
to do about those and you're also where
it's a very core component of the

20
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,669
regulatory compliance efforts most
regulations so you must conduct a risk

21
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,500
assessment purposes you must conduct an
accurate and thorough assessment risks

22
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,390
was accurate and thorough means about
the definition for that table for you

23
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,040
but organization spend millions of
dollars to meet those compliance

24
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,880
requirements to determine risks are
trying to avoid a breach

25
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:08,739
when I was doing risk assessments for
clients in 2013-14 2012-2013 i was doing

26
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:13,930
that risk assessment from their first
one now i see many clients who have been

27
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,269
doing those risk assessments overtime in
2016 many of those are on notice annual

28
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:23,500
updates to that risk asset only really
adding changes to you know IT

29
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,420
infrastructure changes to what was the
cloud vs on friends maybe a change in

30
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,920
staff for outsourcing services those
kind of things and that's a good

31
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,599
impression but too many of those same
organizations have a show where three

32
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,220
years worth of risk assessment reports
it so what does that mean we're not

33
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,640
doing anything with the inspiration get
to do the risk assessment they

34
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,230
understand what all the risks are ok i
fulfilled it is important let me put

35
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,690
that up there on the shelf and I'll
eventually get back today

36
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:59,739
what's the problem we never get back to
it so we're shifting the focus from

37
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:06,130
assess to manage risk regular the
regulations in this year the honor

38
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,250
moving from the assessment focus the
management focus what does that mean

39
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,569
we're going to talk about specifics of
the language of each of the regulatory

40
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:18,069
bodies for a few of those but they're
shifting over to that

41
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:20,768
okay you've done your risk assessment i
want to see what you're doing with those

42
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,359
risks you've identified an area of risk
management and I think they're making an

43
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:28,750
assumption and all organizations and
under risk assessment that's probably

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,599
about something i had many clients that
I work with now that we see blue work

45
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,480
with were doing your first risk
assessment they're doing their first

46
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,709
risk assessment that's beyond the
checklist really literally go down a

47
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,780
list and checking boxes and then many of
those happy and have a risk assessment

48
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:53,470
where they still got the risks they had
three years ago shifting focus from OCR

49
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:59,650
for healthcare organizations OCR
enforcing body behind human services in

50
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,270
2012-2013 when they went through

51
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,560
the hottest they said show me a copy of
your most recent risk assessor that's

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,100
where they started in many cases that's
where the end if you did not have that

53
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,970
risk assessment they're going to slap
you on the hand if you had few other

54
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,170
weaknesses that may find you a bit but
they never really got into risk

55
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:23,150
management even know in some of me use
language in some of the OCR language or

56
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,840
the typical language it says there's a
warrant you risk management didn't

57
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,500
really focus their focus was in show us
that risk assessment let's see what

58
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,170
rescue identified now in this second
phase of audit they even gone so far as

59
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:41,000
to change the audio protocol they used
to organizations this is the language of

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,360
the bottom but essentially we want to
see the results of your risk assessment

61
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,770
we want to see what steps are taken to
remediate those risks so that focus is a

62
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,190
big shift from what they were going to
last time for those of you in the

63
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,540
healthcare world

64
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,040
you probably are aware that phase two is
ongoing at this point they started doing

65
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:04,580
desk wats mo see or hear some guidance
from fic for the financial world

66
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,229
effective risk management process
involves these factors these are all

67
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:15,080
going to the dependent on your risk
profile with NC and your maturity level

68
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,919
as an organization where you are regard
to risk assessment of risk management

69
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:26,810
but again the focus here is on managing
risks not just assessing one more

70
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:33,680
framework you use here is ISO 27001
they've got this risk creating

71
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,550
implementation you have to apply
security controls you have to transfer

72
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,150
the risk or avoid the risk accept the
risk of the things we're going to talk

73
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,370
about a moment but they're talking about
getting creative and finding a way to do

74
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,820
something with those risks that have
been identified as opposed to just

75
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,790
putting them on paper

76
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:57,760
so what's your plan so your organization
now has a risk register you understand

77
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,780
here's my big list of risks what I do
with those what are some of the key

78
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,130
elements that make me successful and
transitioning out of having a list of

79
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:12,159
risks to getting to work that risk that
list down to live minimizing risk reason

80
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,700
eliminating some risks depending on what
the risk needy so anybody in this room

81
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,700
to like they have a rock solid plan

82
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:31,719
yeah i could say that most wanted our
good so what next step should be looking

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,470
toward risk assessed and documented now
what

84
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,470
so where do we go from here how do we
tackle this

85
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,180
lolz wat steps and risk management of
the organization homes are finished

86
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:49,210
not one person 19 part one person
compliance dept not one person on risk

87
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,200
management committee

88
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,860
it's an organizational thing we're going
to talk about that goes all the way from

89
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,240
executive management down the alt or
implementing the controls to minimize

90
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,590
the wrists our risks prioritized this is
a big one so this may attach themselves

91
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,419
to Human Resources Group fantastic
themselves in accounting department and

92
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,380
acts themselves to mighty everyone's
going to be coming back working for

93
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,630
money and people to remediate those
risks that we prioritize the side which

94
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,530
one happens first which one gets the
money and which ones left to be accepted

95
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:30,429
or let the list and the one is the
process complete respondents never

96
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,770
really complete you make strides your
mediator risks and then about the time

97
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,590
you finish to get us to pop up as these
changes in the organization technology

98
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,859
so step one develop a treatment response
strategy for all risk based on

99
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:54,730
governments from manage all this risk
tolerance how much risk is my

100
00:07:54,730 --> 00:08:00,990
organization willing to tolerate and
that can largely be dependant 114

101
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,060
this is that's going to be defined at a
top level of the organization don't want

102
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,260
people in the attacker technical side of
risk management making the side of

103
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,039
decisions

104
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,460
this can come from a risk management
committee if that community is

105
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,719
influenced by the organization as long
as they're not operating a silo where

106
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,790
they're not taking input expansion or
from I'm sorry executive management so

107
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,470
for example of a group may say we want
to accept all of risks and we're going

108
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,030
to remediate everything manage
everything that's medium and high so

109
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,360
this is where executive management gets
involved in the process and they help

110
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,500
you establish what your baseline is I'm
going to remove all those lows from our

111
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,970
list and i know i have eyes to the wrist
so how am I going to address those this

112
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:51,510
is where the transition starts this
tolerance as we talked about is driven

113
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:57,120
by one or more three these three factors
very much driven by regulatory

114
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,150
compliance i have heard got this morning
talking about radios working appliances

115
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:08,640
headed down to the low end . scale talk
a little about material moment and agree

116
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,180
with that to a degree but often when i'm
trying to manage risk regulatory

117
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,839
compliance is my driving force to get
any dollars to help manage those risks

118
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,780
so that's where a lot of risk tolerance
comes from based on where i need to be

119
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:31,230
in line with regulations i'm going to be
able to talk more or less risk security

120
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,660
risks associated information technology
assets how much toleration have for risk

121
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,699
in my core system versus some ancillary
system that's on over in some department

122
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,080
that he doesn't have any influence
certainly going to a different level of

123
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,520
risk them probably will do its it and
then industry and competitive pressures

124
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:56,310
that certainly can find trying to
deliver some new service or prove on

125
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:01,439
some service or do something new
something more cutting-edge i'm going to

126
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,570
take on more risk with that particular
service because I'm willing to do that

127
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,890
marketplace and then most of
organizations it's some combination of

128
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:18,470
inspectors that leads to defining your
risk tolerance step to find documents of

129
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,460
strategy for ending risks and one of the
following categories except for

130
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,050
immediate transfer to avoid we're going
to focus on one thing here

131
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:34,189
not all risks are mediators anyone agree
with that statement me

132
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:40,520
ok some risks cannot be appreciated it's
just pulling the world works

133
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,540
so now that you're transitioning risk
management start for the clear plan

134
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,319
developed based on governance input from
management as we talked about before

135
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,010
this is where the crystal displays in so
if i have made that assumption that made

136
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,360
on a couple slides ago that says all
risks below medium or going to be

137
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,380
accepted i'm going to put that in itself
bucket and now i have to use these other

138
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,370
strategies for the rest of those risks
we're going to step through a few

139
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,550
examples and i'm going to ask for
participation this group doesn't see

140
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:20,030
this a lot so here's a scenario I've got
a legacy application not managed by T as

141
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,589
many active users who are no longer
employed all day and the application is

142
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:29,540
duplicated in other current production
application systems anyone want to say

143
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,589
what you would do with this risk with
one of those for treatment strategies

144
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:40,340
avoid cat all good answer

145
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:47,900
anticipation makes my job easier gonna
notice an area critical software vendor

146
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,740
has stated that their application due to
restrictions longer performance and

147
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,370
stability cannot buy windows updates
norton anti malware technology

148
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,600
you can run on the system your software
is critical to the operation costs as

149
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,470
its orbit of to change the new vigor
within the next two years

150
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,970
what we're going to do this

151
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:24,830
anyone else wanna answer except i have
to accept that risk is when you have

152
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:30,800
things that we can control so wrong
answer then we got things that we can

153
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,540
control we can't apply basic very
elementary level security controls to

154
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:42,680
this application and we've also got a
cost that we can't justify for changing

155
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,979
visitors to try to get out of this
application so we ultimately have to

156
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,360
accept that risk do this more often
especially the healthcare space got

157
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,070
applications that are have been there
for a long time they're running windows

158
00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:00,560
2000 and the bigger says that systems
too unstable we can patch it became to

159
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,569
this and then they're trying to get
replaced but there's a you know 250,000

160
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,520
or cost to read that application
implicit something else because it's

161
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,180
also attached to a specific x-ray
machine or it's attached to some other

162
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,069
medical device another scenario
executive management has been reading

163
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,700
lots of articles information about
reaches a building panic that story

164
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,100
during a race increasing management
meeting the CFO recommend purchasing

165
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:38,490
purchasing cyber insurance just in case
transferred that was easy

166
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:44,190
that's really the best example of
transference of risk there are a few

167
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,210
other if you get specific and get down
into the details if you think about

168
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:56,460
scenario where it's just more on the
tape world back at so if i have a lot of

169
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,240
back updates and I home those and it's
it's-- responsibility to get those out

170
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,800
of the building and all side every day
and they don't do what they're supposed

171
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,109
to end up staying in Mexico car or
whatever i can transfer their risk to

172
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,010
some her your service to take those
tapes get more involved secure them in

173
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,180
the vault

174
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:21,719
i can transfer by taking data principles
to dispose of on hard drives on tapes on

175
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,830
whatever and have shredded or Iron
Mountain one of those folks coming in

176
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:31,140
destroy data for us give us a long-
destruction that's also transference of

177
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:37,800
risk all the organization stated that
all that top devices were protected with

178
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,400
the disk encryption has been determined
that a significant number of devices no

179
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,260
longer have full disk encryption stall
workstations have local admin rocks to

180
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:53,819
users and pull this has been disabled
got disabled because i had 11 months

181
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:03,240
anyone want to guess on this one so I
know this one that i'm going to tell you

182
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,880
that it's actually a little bit of other
part of all kinds of things so we got

183
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,640
our mediator mediate and probably a bit
of magic a cake so remediating one thing

184
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,650
is he thinks it's a good idea to have a
little and workstations many many of our

185
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,550
clients

186
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,990
and then pull this condition has been
disabled talked about yet that

187
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,100
redeploying back to those workstation so
for mediation meeting two different

188
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,420
pieces of radiation and also again
probably a bit of educate develop those

189
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,229
end users understand that software was
put there for a reason so let's don't

190
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,540
killed

191
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:45,899
step 3 so now we have decided all the
risk that we've got left after we either

192
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:52,140
likely acceptable risk is over low
whatever strategy has been we're now at

193
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,890
the point where we've got to put that
into a plan and communicate that up to

194
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:01,860
management so that later on when we
ready to execute on that plan they are

195
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,450
aware of what we're doing in risk
management and really be more apt to get

196
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:12,360
our people in our dollars that we need
to go to mediate these risks you can see

197
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,089
here the statement that i make this
point processes for many organizations

198
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:20,519
breakdown if you don't do that upfront
management has until we're all along all

199
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,399
the sudden out of the blue I come to
them and say we have to go through all

200
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,040
the stuff we've got to do a full
description we've got to get cyber

201
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,219
insurance and we've got to do all these
things we just power on

202
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,600
where's this coming from what's coming
from faculty colleagues risks and we

203
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,770
have to get rid of the more really not
quite going to be at risk of breaches

204
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:43,920
except receptor so prioritize your
initiatives which are required to manage

205
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,649
risk and associate those initiatives to
resources need again equal and funds i'm

206
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:55,709
going to talk a little bit about some
practices that by utilizing clients and

207
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:59,250
it's been pretty successful in
conjunction with management determine a

208
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,230
list of initiatives related to my
sincerity compliance prioritize those

209
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:11,819
and work with the client in my case
here's your side internally work with

210
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,319
your internal stakeholders to say what
are the most important risks on this

211
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,849
list for us to recreate those maybe ones
that were identified for a risk

212
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:23,379
assessment if they get things added to
it

213
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,970
we're going to acquire this other
organization we don't know what risk for

214
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,330
bringing and we are part of that other
organization so we're going to put that

215
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,770
on the list of priorities so I go
through that pass and prioritize within

216
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:39,340
the first time many of those folks
looking as they just just put some

217
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,090
property on and i'll do that you
actually and say okay let's work

218
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:48,370
together we have to work together to get
this list right um we prioritize the

219
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:54,280
first time with no cost i always do this
without cost the first time the second

220
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,930
time to go back and do it with cost
attached because things certainly can

221
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:07,030
change when I had those costs their
priorities changed when i had costs vary

222
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:14,680
because it's something needs two hundred
thousand dollars it 500 man hours for

223
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,840
the next three months to remediate it
may move priority landing on the

224
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,610
organization course suggested practice
number to your list of the dishes

225
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:30,310
develop a roadmap this roadmap to take
into account and establish baseline gold

226
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:37,929
for managing risks the road should leave
you to the engine destination three the

227
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:43,450
destination of the vastly different from
organization together we're how far is

228
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,560
one organization going to go and risk
management with regard to maturity

229
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,480
another deck is certainly vastly
different in our client base first spark

230
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,270
very different in your organization's
you may have some organizations

231
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,290
investing you know millions of dollars
information security appliance you have

232
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:07,030
others who may spin a fraction of their
IT budget on information theory

233
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,320
wats new approaches they're different
the process should be different but the

234
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,050
mindset the approach behind it is going
to be different

235
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:17,430
my roadmap is a small 50 user
organization

236
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:22,620
you look different than enterprise
corporate park it just has to because

237
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,620
the funds and people just aren't there

238
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,140
this is a sneak peek this is the first
time i think this has been publicly

239
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,270
presented it's just literally a sneak
peek at this point we have bounced

240
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:41,250
around whatever you're doing this but i
decided to do it anyway so sdt blue is

241
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:46,500
actually developing a majority model
which allows you to establish that

242
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,680
baseline set up the target profile and
then build that roadmap over time it's

243
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,970
being built to work with organizations
where your teeny-tiny 50 years

244
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,950
organization or your enterprise class
organization you can see here some of

245
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,780
the various domains i think a couple of
these have been renamed the past we're

246
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,970
working on this very diligently this .
hoping to try to get it to some graphs

247
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,470
stake here so a few of these domain
names have changed but you can see

248
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,450
across the top you go anywhere from 0 to
5 from non-existent all that through

249
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:28,080
optimizing so the stars may indicate a
particular case study where someone

250
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,980
wants to be defined and proactive and
asset management but they are you know

251
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,340
they're sitting right on three of that
one so there within their prep their

252
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,149
maturity level so this is their target
the blue and the star indicates where

253
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,020
they are we have standards that baseline
their roadmap they say within the area

254
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,070
of risk management i want to be a force
I want to be measured and verified I

255
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,629
want to be able to say I know that

256
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,260
agent is successful because of these
particular metrics and i'm going to

257
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,750
measure on so that's again take
something we're working on we believe

258
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,130
it's going to allow for more effective
risk management because i'm measuring

259
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:12,010
and get something solid as opposed to
perception of measuring against

260
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:18,550
regulatory compliance in what we call
this practices step forward to find risk

261
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,260
owners and said clear completion dates
for remediation activity this is the

262
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,150
executable part of the plan

263
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:31,660
I have to know if a remediation if an
avoidance of risk acceptance of risk

264
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,670
returns for wrist needs to happen to
manage to replicate the risk and no

265
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,140
homestead hold someone responsible
otherwise i can is that that's the case

266
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,130
management but in this case managing
risk we have to know who's responsible

267
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:53,140
make sure that person meets the deadline
for getting that good tools for doing

268
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:59,800
risk management particularly when we get
into the executable phase those larger

269
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,399
enterprise organizations are probably
going to have some kind of GRC solution

270
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,140
in the house and they're going to manage
against maybe 12 35 different frameworks

271
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,230
and they're going to have the ability to
do that

272
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,220
stepping up the scale visit you see it
product they're called want something we

273
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:20,650
utilize its very niche based its for
healthcare organizations to assess and

274
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:26,290
manage risk we use that total dark lines
that's very niche center and then the

275
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,250
rest of the world which is probably a
big percentage is doing the best they

276
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,380
can and spreadsheets or backwards

277
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,130
unfortunately now that's very time
consuming for those of us that live in

278
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,890
the risk management world but if that's
all you have

279
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:44,320
it's better than passively just going
about your business or just leaving at

280
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,070
risk assessment report sitting on the
Shelf because i don't have the best and

281
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,070
GRC tools or anything automated to help
that process

282
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:58,820
fine performance indicators to measure
successive and control she saw in step

283
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,678
forward or step 4 of the maturity model
or it said that we can measure and it's

284
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,289
defined as to what success is says here
they're going into the process of risk

285
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:14,299
management processes on the link is we
all know that things change the

286
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:19,250
application chain environment changes
from its infrastructure you know staff

287
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:25,280
changes acquisitions happen so risk
going to change so we have all how do we

288
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,970
know that controls we're putting in
place are effective without some type of

289
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,320
metrics to measure them so in this case
we have to define what those performance

290
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,730
indicators hard to say my remediation
controls are being effective my

291
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,760
processors are being affected and
minimizing risk how do I know that

292
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,929
because that's I circled back around the
next year i'm able to evaluate those

293
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:49,220
metrics overtime going to reassess my
risk again and I'm going to see that i

294
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:55,159
have removed risks from the list from
your prior continuously report status to

295
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,150
management the risk management committee
or other platform any of your

296
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,950
organization's have some type of his
management team or risk management

297
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:11,929
committee you're all in larger
organizations know what about the

298
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:17,510
smaller faults this is probably going to
be putting partisan someone's job is

299
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:24,679
making its officer really be information
security officer it maybe cio with the

300
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:28,940
United directory maybe someone else
maybe twenty percent of someone else's

301
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,340
job to manage this on a regular basis so
in continuously keeping management

302
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,439
involved can sit before implemented and
process process very early on and

303
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,980
continuously keep them updated so that
when you are asking funding to remediate

304
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:50,929
you're much more likely to have success
there some resources that some of this

305
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:55,340
data comes from and just some from past
experience myself if you're in the

306
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,760
healthcare space you're probably
familiar with

307
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,460
tsa tinder guys 30s was mentioned this
morning as well risk management

308
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,330
framework from yes certainly a good
place to start when you're in the

309
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:13,540
healthcare space or not but most of the
regulatory governance organizations . to

310
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,370
music as the framework follow it
explicitly say you must use this is

311
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:23,620
gonna be easier I stock up you're
familiar with that organization they

312
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,479
have a lot of good risk management
framework documentation through coat

313
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,120
it's very good stuff i would recommend
taking a look at those if you have not

314
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:41,709
and then the direct links to the nest
837 there's also 830 update 37 focuses

315
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:46,180
more on risk management whereas thirties
more onerous assessment but as we do

316
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:53,380
that transition process being aware of
those are certainly important I said I

317
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,120
would help you get out of here earlier
today and I met that goal of any

318
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:04,300
questions anybody face this challenge of
your organization understand the risks

319
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,750
are but just not being able to execute
on number mediation risk management

320
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:18,190
process see people smiling and raising
eyebrows any stories or stories normal

321
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:25,540
alright thank you all very much
appreciate your time hopefully learn

322
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,080
something useful if you have any
questions feel free to not helping

323
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,129
around for Cubans a person giving
