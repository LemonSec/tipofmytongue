1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
untitled like group therapy and so like
any of your therapy welcome i'm not just

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,129
branded on user of the LPM also
apparently really good at so hopefully

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,780
when I can share with you today you take
back to your own shops and maybe get

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,009
your program off and going and running
and doing more than what you are doing

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,519
with us today or maybe just like any
good group therapy if you think you've

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,630
got that you start listening to this you
realize my god i might just have a great

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,660
program going on I don't know

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,920
so what you cannot go to figure out .
system here

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,899
so what we're gonna go over today is a
little bit of how it works

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,940
why you should be using it maybe some
tips to dismantle right i don't know if

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,780
anybody here has any problems talking to
your leadership about why this is so

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,850
important aah and then how to do the LP
and maybe some creative ways good

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,760
examples maybe not so good examples
downright dirty business and then how to

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,048
look over all just enhanced security
once you actually get going in your deal

15
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,850
p program start finding things when do
things about now before i started gotta

16
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:16,470
understand the speed to so Joe hands how
many people here have a current day loss

17
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:25,470
prevention product program in your part
27 how many people here are getting

18
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:39,420
ready to try and do a dlp program 1-30
inside joke sorry just and then how many

19
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,030
here are just here is it seem like cool
the tracks that you were given a choice

20
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:50,280
alright nobody's here but you feel
better

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,000
alright well first I'll before we get
going you know there's going to be part

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,329
of this that are more prescriptive where
I'm going to be talking and even use

23
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,610
guys there are going to be great with it

24
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,120
presentation we're really looking for
impact

25
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,360
your input so I called a good there feel
free to try it and let you know those

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,350
moments are because every program is
going to be a little different and where

27
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,250
you work

28
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,410
customers environment so I was like
start everything off with a joke

29
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:24,859
I just I can't be serious I you know
those up what my mom thinks i do1

30
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,970
brother thanks i do you kids think I do
things they loss prevention of different

31
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:34,400
right you know what society thinks of us
is glorified mall cops family seems to

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,510
think I'm just great Sherlock Holmes ok
my boss and I like to take my boss

33
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:48,290
definitely thanks job customers on the
other hand you know they always think

34
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,299
that my life trying to find the bad
stuff of course I think I cool my

35
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,200
glasses and my little earpiece and then
lastly what I really do is just sit

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,940
screen all day looking for patterns as
that's the reality of the situation it's

37
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,900
actually not so what is the deal page is
real quick

38
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,299
there's really two kinds of data loss
prevention right it's when things leave

39
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,340
your organization called a loss all
however when things are shared and

40
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,870
appropriately within the organization
that's more of a leak leave the

41
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,310
organization but it's not staying there
should be no lot of people when they

42
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,890
think that their loss prevention if
they're having trouble understanding the

43
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,850
concept one of the things you relate
back to them is that hey you know when

44
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,410
you go to target you go walmart aware of
those fancy places are and you've got

45
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:41,359
the stalls gates and the top security
guards and tags and everything

46
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,320
electronically with that lot of ways for
trying to get this information for

47
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,450
leaving the store trying to losing money
your business or being an embarrassment

48
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,650
now you might ask why is vital if you
need talking points for people that just

49
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,220
don't know whatever one you know
regulatory compliance is always a good

50
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,840
reason right

51
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,110
you know a lot of times you can justify
getting dlp program in because

52
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,480
you're being told to you have a problem
is if you don't have that you know one

53
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,409
of the negative side effects to be find
yourself some legal consequences right

54
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:24,480
there have been a lot of losses that
spin from intellectual property loss of

55
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,490
privacy loss things like that because
people did not do the basics to protect

56
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,010
that information

57
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,080
same thing with intellectual property
more and more business shit you know and

58
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,060
it's not every sector but more i'm
seeing that the value of an organization

59
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,320
is the intellectual problem the
intangible stuff it's not necessarily

60
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,920
that tangible asset that you're worried
about someone stealing the idea that

61
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,480
plan the recipe patent you know you want
to make sure that information space

62
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,950
within your organization

63
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:01,620
how many people here just curiosity
curiosity out of curiosity what the

64
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,830
pharmaceutical industry make drugs

65
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:12,270
nobody healthcare smell

66
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,919
yeah so it turns out there you copy
worries that you know there's minds OCR

67
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,870
coming down on you because you've lost
patience and you know one of the biggest

68
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,780
breaches in 2015 was and i'm given some
credit i lost my information have a very

69
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,739
slick website help me you know we lost
your information but it's gonna be okay

70
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,419
to use bread business which
coincidentally called me about 20

71
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:49,229
minutes after launch saying there is
activity all work but again when you

72
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:55,230
lose IP potentially facing Glaus a
competitive advantage now you probably

73
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,490
noticed you're not keeping out yet
talking all these pains GOP turns really

74
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,540
talking business because a lot of ways
that is a cornerstone of your successful

75
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,590
program you've got to really impact the
visits you can speak their language not

76
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,570
gonna get that far prevent disclosures
you know that really goes towards the

77
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,930
upper two and again loss of public
perception

78
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,680
how good does it look for the office of
performance or personnel management when

79
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,490
they lose

80
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,539
everybody's records yeah thanks guys you
lost my records

81
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:29,969
that's awesome did I get proper credit
credit protection from OPM know because

82
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,810
the government's really good making the
rules not following rules growing notice

83
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,289
that

84
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:40,199
so what are some strengths and
weaknesses of a good deal p program

85
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,580
first off you know a lot of these
programs you can get out-of-the-box man

86
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,770
tag mag the you know there's a dozen of
them out there i'm more more companies

87
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,120
that deal with transport data are
offering you deal he like capabilities

88
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,380
so many of them are essential
administration policy they are always

89
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,210
power to be easy boy

90
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:09,508
that is true most of them are very easy
boy he were a boy and some even ship

91
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:12,449
with some anti-tampering products which
is important if you've got a very

92
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,740
constrained environment that is heavily
regulated you have to make sure your

93
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,710
products are not be PCI environments for
example and they work best though when

94
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:30,840
you have policies in a classification
flip side you know oftentimes most

95
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,198
healthy products are limited to what
they can actually strapped out something

96
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,300
right now there is a ship coming in OC
are some other things like semantic just

97
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,139
avail

98
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,310
they're going to be able to start doing
some texted the protection on images

99
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:49,229
which is huge because that's always been
sort of easy way to date a scanning it

100
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:53,190
out nobody can read it I mean unless you
have a dedicated those who are things

101
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,949
going on but there's always a way to get
past the lp usually really expensive to

102
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:04,530
right i mean in an age where 2015 also
many reaches it more so than the

103
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,330
previous four years you know since
people are no that's a lot of sales guys

104
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,080
are good but they're talking to my
bosses in the executives say you need

105
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,219
this protection you need where it is
help drive by otherwise you're gonna all

106
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,560
cracked skull and people are less you

107
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,740
because now they're seeing other things
happen in the industry will talk a

108
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:29,400
little bit about that later but I want
everybody to keep something in mind

109
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,468
GOP is a product is great if you don't
have a program that product is not going

110
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:40,050
to do you like do it in my program I
mean there's a lot more than just put in

111
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:45,630
semantic system and start the scan
you've got actually start doing some

112
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:50,040
things before that you need to do some
risk assessments to justify you have

113
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,569
governance body that should really be
over the whole thing so they understand

114
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,470
what they're getting out of it and they
can advocate for you as well run into

115
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,779
those executive roadblocks compliance is
always a good thing

116
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:10,110
policies are excellent you know deal
piece of tool like hand right you're

117
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,710
going to use it to build something if
you don't have a blueprint to model it

118
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:18,240
against you're going to build a really
long looking bird house okay

119
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,500
same thing with this every mediation
those are always the end steps and most

120
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,750
people like to do this backwards radical
the people that have the DOP in their

121
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,740
shops they only go backwards for sorry I
tried to go backwards let me tell you it

122
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,930
doesn't work very well at all in fact
the only reason I got good at doing this

123
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:43,290
was because I failed a few times where I
actually . out got right you know

124
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,780
there's some other ways you can do
things you know this is more of a

125
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,680
helpful slide just to give you an idea
very steps that go along with trying to

126
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,479
figure out what to do you know you gotta
identify what tech that's always a core

127
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,190
pillar of IT in general whether your
security operations you don't have the

128
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:06,390
asset control how can you know what fact
you know what you have numbers

129
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,819
composition location so having to ask
controls important but that includes

130
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,959
your data

131
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,199
most people miss that step no I got
5,000 notebooks

132
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,800
that's great what's your day look like I
don't

133
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,300
ok figure that out

134
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,699
one of the big steps into getting into
any program and doing all the stuff i

135
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,029
just talked about you gotta get
management amor that sometimes

136
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:35,450
management comes to you because it go to
Gardner seminar or something like that

137
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:53,240
and speak for short better just go to
garden x7r the year was worried they'll

138
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,769
come back and let's do they'll be well
that's great that's good right

139
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:02,390
catalyst ok advising that they need to
use prior steps like hey let's get

140
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,829
Governance Committee yeah let's look at
our policies and define our data and if

141
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:08,239
we have done that already

142
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,019
let's make yeah but and if it's more or
less

143
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:17,360
they're coming by you and they're not
have bought in management well these are

144
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,079
some things that you can talk to them
about you know the identity theft

145
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,339
Resource Center's a good place to go get
some stats on various sectors and

146
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:28,850
records lost at work

147
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,970
oh alright

148
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:43,250
another one is the risk-based security
website now they are they also offer

149
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,730
some nice reporting and what's
interesting about their reporting is

150
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:53,029
they're focused here on where with
thread back in or out in most cases it's

151
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:57,110
kind of almost a drawl you know in my
personal experience two out of every

152
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,310
three incidents i investigated was
always an internal job be an accident

153
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:06,829
very few delicious but rarely was
actually somebody from the outside

154
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:12,949
breaking in doing something it's mostly
joblo as computer doesn't know better

155
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:16,550
doing something bad he doesn't even know
he's doing it

156
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,079
what's really interesting in that same
report as they they realized that in

157
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,300
2015

158
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:32,390
if you notice something there's a cycle
here so eighty-nine percent of those

159
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,920
records loss for electronics

160
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,219
you know in the physical security world
that's part of our domains we always

161
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,600
learn put locks on Canada's locks on
doors he passes here and there but we're

162
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,790
done with the same thing too much with
our date yet that's the predominant

163
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,160
factor by which it's stolen

164
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,980
now reach level index dot coms another
good place to go this is just an example

165
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,019
of what I like these is because their
management print their credit management

166
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:03,050
doesn't necessarily need to know the ins
and out the details and stuff they want

167
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,769
to know big numbers because what they're
looking to gauge when you talk to them

168
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:13,130
is what my exposure how much of a
problem is going to be and will I get in

169
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,269
trouble for this

170
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:20,000
you know we talk a little bit about what
kind of incidents we have no identity

171
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,019
theft seems to be predominant right now
we're also seeing that with health date

172
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:28,670
because now it's really easy to do you
know the one so credit card that

173
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,620
whatever also help date

174
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:38,300
Sango make false claims to get paid
government still our friend thanks to

175
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:44,660
OPM a few other poorly designed
government websites you know when you

176
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,329
look at the world as a whole in 2015

177
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:52,099
I mean I know americans love to be
leaders don't want to be leader in this

178
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,180
category

179
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,829
what does that tell us as a group
perhaps America is not doing the right

180
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:02,959
thing or mercy we are doing a good job
but we're just the number one park

181
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,810
I like everybody picked on Windows not
so much off apple now if they really

182
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,018
does management involved they're
stubborn you know let's take into

183
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:17,899
account the experience of one mr. Hardy
CEO who lost his job after they leave

184
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:22,519
all those records out and you know they
even had to send one of the guys go time

185
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:28,370
testify the senator al franken he's not
a fun guy to talk to

186
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:34,610
I mean I know he's a comedian . but fun
and you just imagine being in that chair

187
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,700
and what do they say was the idea

188
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:45,010
ok so what are some of the pitfalls of
trying to get through this dl

189
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:50,410
implementation right well maybe you get
the DOP you install it you don't have a

190
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:55,630
policy double glorify network monitoring
system and without a policy to

191
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:02,080
accurately tune to what you end up with
is a very noisy network monitoring

192
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,880
system you see me as anyone ever tried
to use data identifiers or pattern to

193
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,720
recognize social security numbers and
when traffic anyone ever run into

194
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:17,830
target.com I like to pick on target that
is your dumb thing was from targeting

195
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:23,980
here i called it but you know they made
their product catalog numbers three dash

196
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:33,040
to dash anyone want to guess here with
the last combination is wat row or

197
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,050
that's the same pattern you special
security i'm still working on a little

198
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,589
experiment i'm trying to map everyone
social security numbers in the company

199
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:46,690
and do a query back to target i wanna
see what kind of products we are as that

200
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:54,520
I'm probably a garden hose myself I'd I
seems so but this is an example where

201
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,079
someone's poor programming choice is
directly caused me to not be able to

202
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,560
detect accurate social security numbers
going hard

203
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,489
well there is a way to get past that
we'll talk about that in a minute but if

204
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:11,320
you don't have any management or it's
just like a flag on the play start over

205
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,670
you're just not going to go into
guarantee you that I've tried it didn't

206
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,860
work out I could convince my bosses this
is cool and POC it's cool

207
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:26,230
find all the stuff that's ridiculous ok
why because if you don't turn your

208
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,880
systems and get out false positives do
you have a truly trusted system

209
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:37,329
or you have just this noise maker that
looks cool management not gonna trust

210
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,489
and trusted system

211
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,279
I'm going to trust the noise machine
they want something that's gonna work

212
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:48,220
now do you expect a plug-and-play
solution you again our I'm sorry it's

213
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,139
not going to work a lot of vendors will
come in promise you this is great plugin

214
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:54,490
and we'll have all your stuff

215
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:00,579
note that that is great i've seen it
then try it hasn't quite worked out it

216
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:04,688
looks good enough to impress people that
buy stuff but not the people that use

217
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:11,079
most importantly how many people here in
their shops actually show of hands real

218
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,698
quick have a awareness program people
that talks about data classification

219
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:19,030
talk about how to handle things
separately

220
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:28,389
ok educating the employees is king again
I always live by the philosophy you know

221
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,130
it's a layer eight world

222
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:36,970
you understand the OSI model network
goes one step the eight-part mean you

223
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:41,650
people actually use it and unless you
can get people to bottle their behavior

224
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,650
correctly it doesn't matter what kind of
controls and put into it mean

225
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,010
arnon you could cut the internet
connection that's about it we'll do it

226
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:54,669
was telling up to it takes a lot to
change the human viral lastly you go

227
00:17:54,669 --> 00:18:01,419
you're very enthusiastic if you decide
on going all-in biggest poker tourney

228
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:07,210
lock on that is not going to work that
is going to be rail your program quicker

229
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,669
and your package walk out i do not have
catering the block out immediately

230
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:17,290
because if you don't bury the
environment people managers the

231
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,270
expectations because a lot of what
you've got to do is to net product to

232
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:26,740
meet your organization's process and
there may be believing it takes awhile

233
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,700
so let's talk about my personal
experience or just meant as an example

234
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,980
like i said i failed a few times now you
know I'm doing this for a long time but

235
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,929
this is more or less about my where I
work now and you know they did they got

236
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:42,790
really excited about this program

237
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:47,590
spent the money that bought it put it in
there doing great right everybody's

238
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,870
expecting big things

239
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,020
ah that's not quite how it worked out

240
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:59,470
it didn't go very well it continued to
not go very well and then there at me

241
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:06,790
now i am going to hold the hire me and
I'm like all we ever do this and we did

242
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,350
we wiped off the current installation
and we started from scratch with program

243
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,639
and one of the first steps that we did
was to knit we turn it on we target very

244
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,830
specific types of data and we just
turned and it took a while because some

245
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,280
processes in your organization's may
have picked off on a monthly basis or

246
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,530
weekly basis they may be quartered maybe
biannual they just maybe yearly and you

247
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:34,540
really got to watch for those things and
it takes a lot of work to discover how

248
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,230
those things work specially institutions
anyone here working a place that's

249
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:44,320
mostly inside head knowledge you know
people don't necessarily write it down

250
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,540
it's always like what's going on here

251
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,570
oh you gotta go talk to Joe and finance
he knows all about that

252
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,050
ok go talk to Joey they all used to do
that you have to talk this out she took

253
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,909
over you find yourself just chasing your
tail trying to figure out the script

254
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:03,160
works or what this process doing or why
he's done that way and most of the time

255
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,920
when you do find the people you're quite
done this way I don't we need to yours

256
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,430
well it is getting that's just how we do
it that's how we're gonna do it that's

257
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,660
how we've always done

258
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:19,900
ok so then you finally arrive at what I
call a promise right we're actually able

259
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:25,510
to be effective block in the deal p
world there's the monitoring and that's

260
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,430
all building up in the affected world is
the lot you can actually start paying

261
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:37,060
dividends to the risk people saying it's
time to pay off that makes you win

262
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,760
that's right i supposed to have some
positive face on there I'm

263
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:51,129
that let's talk a little bit about
traditional use cases right controlling

264
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:55,238
information data classification drive
control anyway doing these things now

265
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:59,950
some people who use their data class
their data loss prevention product as

266
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:05,019
means the sort of ferret out where the
gold is kingdom and that's not a bad way

267
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:09,879
to do it okay if you've got a file
problem capability like a semantic

268
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:15,939
discover or Mac products on like that go
out and actually troll the terabytes

269
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,590
reading device in my case of data out
there figure out what's going on and

270
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,090
that's a good way to start

271
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:27,039
I wouldn't call it in-game the big thing
is you gotta be able to use data

272
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,989
classification device controls always
nuts because ultimately but always blue

273
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:35,529
controls in there and I just walking
with USB devices certain bedroom also if

274
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:40,809
you don't have some kind of removable
media in there a problem control the

275
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:48,428
data but there are some non-traditional
use cases anyone here actually using the

276
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:54,220
GOP to do employee monitoring you might
not want to raise your hand on this one

277
00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:00,220
who's in the room you know I've used in
the past what I call a naughty word list

278
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,149
right

279
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:04,689
most products shipped with a naughty
word list you know kind of different

280
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,190
things actual tossing I'm quitting

281
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:17,109
I'm cheating sabotaging were looking for
espionage like that some of them are

282
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:21,668
better than others i've experimented
with turning them on prymatt and

283
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:26,649
worthless starting off but they're not a
bad way in an environment where people

284
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:32,469
are quick turnover sometimes it's a good
way for you to sort of get that heads up

285
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,119
that somebody might be leaving same
thing with malware detection of blocking

286
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:43,178
you give you some examples so for the
employee using country use cases right

287
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:46,840
maybe somebody decides you had enough
this place on the lead what people

288
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,279
always do for the bail especially
salespeople again

289
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:57,149
no no you gotta bring everything here's
everything I worked on is everything I

290
00:22:57,149 --> 00:23:01,289
might need you know it's my body of
knowledge as a professional that I want

291
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:03,929
to take with me because I could just
reuse it

292
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:07,469
that usually means they're going to read
the hell out of your network

293
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:12,689
maybe they're hopeful so in this
particular case maybe you start looking

294
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:18,210
for something that means a threshold
like most times they be whatever so so

295
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:24,899
every day every week for some reason the
last week I've seen this person maybe

296
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:27,718
want to go take a look at what that
person's doing where that information is

297
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:36,239
going as me not you know again patterns
of reactivity but you know they may not

298
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:40,019
fit the base line it's not hey I'm gonna
look at my mailbox and I'm gonna look at

299
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,499
my group folder and I'm going to look at
my home folder its i might be looking

300
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:49,440
more sporadically ok i work an idea why
am i doing so much reading the finance

301
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:57,359
older I work in sales wise i doing so
much in a house pale so that's where

302
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:03,210
having groups within dlp can help you
look for those have rights education

303
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,259
duties sales people need to be looking
at a house available

304
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:14,129
probably not probably more concerned
about how Steve sabotage that's where

305
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:18,059
you start looking for some patterns of
right activity somebody's actively

306
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:22,649
modifying things may not be your
knowledge same kind of deal that may not

307
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:26,939
fit the baselines you look for the
outliers some programs like semantic the

308
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,099
European good looking at that as others
Upsy back he always had a nice little

309
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:38,039
outlier program i like but everyone
through cell and then when i call the HR

310
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:42,719
early warning radar right that's a
non-professional language so you're

311
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:46,950
probably asking why does a deal person
care about this very morning

312
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,359
ninety percent of the time when i
actually get something to get blocked

313
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,899
its I gotta go to that person that owns
date

314
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:59,360
and I gotta get them on board there's a
little bit of evangelization that goes

315
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,399
on and there's some trust that has to
fill last one I do is program so we

316
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,670
decided hey let's go after the Pro cards
because people are screwing it up and

317
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,540
let's see if we can get the program's
block will have a decrease in the number

318
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:17,360
of fraud issues detective on our company
cards so I don't talk too late you think

319
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,340
she was just like I'm sure you're
jealous now she looked at me like I come

320
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,080
steal her firstborn should not have so
it took a couple of meetings

321
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,270
trust-building in order for me to
convince her and fortunately i spent 14

322
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,810
years working with Louisville Metro
Police Department's little bit cred with

323
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:40,429
me that I could use to gain your trust
and I promised her that she would be my

324
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:45,170
partner every monday i sent her a report
violated it

325
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,220
what did they said and here's a nifty
little management graph to show your

326
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,600
boss she left it is great i don't have
to chase those users you know who

327
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,189
doesn't she does look all I did was give
her the means to an end

328
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,660
I'm just too but by doing that I was
able to start blocking those numbers

329
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,220
I've made myself a value and not
somebody that is causing a distraction

330
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,170
for end-users to get mad

331
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,840
here's the situation where we have a
bunch of people that are trying to pay

332
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,990
bills use that power of their best guess
what I got the management get out of

333
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,520
jail free card on this one

334
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,520
goodnight

335
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:27,500
so one of the ways you can use dlp Tom
for malware is this some some typical

336
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,240
scenario right jump comes into the mail
of web gets circulated on the computers

337
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,620
and then most of the time people are
looking to exploit data they want to get

338
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:41,000
out of your organization that's where
you start looking for things and so if

339
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,180
you've got a deal p product that's
sitting in line with firewalls maybe

340
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:48,560
you're doing some SL decription you're
able to look inside those secure streams

341
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:53,540
or your integrated as a mail relay so
the question is even a big deal unless

342
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:58,790
you're actually encrypting the message
itself so you remember the Ashley

343
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:04,250
Madison leak you know that was a big one
right all the membership got some you

344
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:09,410
not to the web a bunch of that what they
call it when you blackmail

345
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,120
what's that called there's a better word
for that anyways bunch of guys got

346
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:20,179
basically tuned up by people looking to
extort money from them by blasting them

347
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:25,520
out on the web at the other cheaters
well think about where in a generation

348
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,010
now where we still have employees in our
workplaces their first working address

349
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:36,170
the first work email address was their
first email did you know this is before

350
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,380
we have a nice piece on this is
something to work is my congratulations

351
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:44,240
you have any not okay and then captain
that is they don't see the difference

352
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,810
between do it work and personal life so
my god they're going to sign up for

353
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:53,210
maybe shady service user records they
don't think anything of it so I'm

354
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:58,550
looking for these fortunate in finding
you have you no morality of work but

355
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,909
that's another example where you can
take an outbreak or you can take a

356
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:06,770
recent breach of a questionable matter
and you can look for that activity to

357
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:11,810
make sure that your employees are not
getting extorted you can help because i

358
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,230
mean if if I was gonna get started I
like go to my boss

359
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:22,040
I need some help no I don't think I
wanted to know that I've been you know

360
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:28,460
inappropriately using the website about
finding crypt around malware ransom

361
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,120
notes you know that's problem critical
now where is that it's so quickly

362
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,830
evolving right what's the one constant
about the antivirus people are having

363
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,639
trouble keeping up with the actions the
IDS's are having trouble keeping up with

364
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,290
the endpoints involved in it but you
don't seem to have things like a ransom

365
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:50,240
note where they go and look for the race
now is that is great is blocking it

366
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,360
no but it's my early morning right now
that we've got a big problem because the

367
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,610
earlier you stop crypto malware the
better your end result is going to be

368
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:03,139
because the longer you let it build more
Kate it's going to print which equals

369
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,140
out to the long restoration top

370
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:11,870
I can't partner / current players had
this problem but i have been witness to

371
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:20,510
this before and brutal they got us and
snapshots about ossification unfamiliar

372
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:25,430
with application for people sort of
translate the code and something else

373
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,990
speaking in three pilot to get there a
lot of times those commands they would

374
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,220
use the trick

375
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,840
maybe trick something in navy but if you
know what to look for this is all based

376
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,510
on essentially building my own malware
right it's based on a couple process it

377
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:46,760
has a text pat dry detective but you
always gotta make sure you test rules

378
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:52,520
okay don't always put a rule out there
and just saying good guests it for you

379
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,780
get burned

380
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:58,639
I subscribe to a number of threat
intelligence services

381
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:04,430
I like crabs a lot of folks I mean this
is not something that's very broad very

382
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,270
quick

383
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,990
it takes a lot of work on your part to
do this because you got to extract the

384
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,470
information from these services you
gotta figure out how can you look for in

385
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,220
your environment but a lot of times
he'll he's plugged into a lot of

386
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,030
announced it gives you an extra layer
visibility that some of these other

387
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:24,830
detection engines don't necessarily
offer you or they're controlled by other

388
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,939
groups that you don't have access to and
dlb usually falls in the purview of

389
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:35,060
security you have things like you
ascertain four-guard Sands has a blog

390
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,409
Krabs has a good one

391
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:41,000
proof . we emerging threats is what i'm
working on we subscribe to emerging

392
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,320
threats i'm trying to figure out how can
i extract that list into an actual you

393
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:52,879
know whatever it is nine million IP list
and use it as an endpoint file on my dlp

394
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,660
clients

395
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:59,030
I mean how many people in force show of
hands real quick when they're done let's

396
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:04,250
go off network are your users allowed to
connect to any wireless network go to

397
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:08,270
any website or do you force them back
through VPN SE lot

398
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:13,019
ccs is so how the heck are you watching
where the date is going when they go

399
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:15,869
into the shadows

400
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:20,009
daddy'll be agent machine it has a
carriage network their catch do but you

401
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:24,599
know unique / network he did mostly
leave all the parents house right there

402
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,619
is no cool rules of firewalls is
whatever you got on your machine you're

403
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:33,449
putting emerging threats list on their
you trying to extend that garbage to the

404
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,169
machine

405
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:37,529
no matter where they are and you get
some nice alerts from two of the trip

406
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:42,450
it's just writing the script actually
get that works challenge apparently

407
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,369
turning side note 8 notation into an
actual list of ip's it's hard for this

408
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:55,168
old but you always got a certain measure
on rules in case you overdo it and you

409
00:31:55,169 --> 00:32:00,720
got quickly is something the problem is
your classes are going to get stale real

410
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,769
quick you know malware breaches things
like that all fats a change you know

411
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:13,830
that as a rule has been active for
months now real quick detection tweet

412
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,139
tweet that easy

413
00:32:16,139 --> 00:32:23,758
anyone seen this before you know this is
a huge pileup just a part deal p what

414
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,259
makes it difficult is detection finding
what you're looking for

415
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:39,090
does anyone see Katniss your hand you
see Kat tat still .

416
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:46,409
hi I'm sure with cat you see it now

417
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:55,799
this kid he's had years body you just
happen to blend perfectly with the

418
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:01,619
environment not unlike us sifting
through terabytes of data every day

419
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:10,590
trying to find that one string or that
one phrase or that 15 same challenge so

420
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:16,738
what are some of the best ways to do it
well i think that there's two real ways

421
00:33:16,739 --> 00:33:21,389
to do it is precise and there's a
precise emphasizes using patterns like

422
00:33:21,389 --> 00:33:23,609
dat identifiers and semantic right

423
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:26,908
hey match the pattern of a social
security number well I've already told

424
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:31,529
you about the target stores you know how
well that what about precise let me give

425
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:36,299
you some examples of precise methods
that work very well I've got a customer

426
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:41,789
database about 9am million customers has
your social and drivers license get a

427
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:47,460
copy of it every month i put in the deal
p and I encrypted in dlp so if you come

428
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,570
raid my dlp servers you're just going to
end up with a bunch of encrypted indexes

429
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:55,950
why that's important is because now
detecting while what is known good

430
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:02,039
information versus at so I still get the
hits part sometimes

431
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:08,129
ironically the few of our people match
product IDs figure randomness of it but

432
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:13,918
I don't get the hundred fifty 250 false
positives everyday and it's proven its

433
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,808
work out real well and I partnered with
our customer service manager she was

434
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:22,589
fully on board with this before we
started and she liked the concept

435
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:28,049
because her people were accidentally
replying out including people socials

436
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:38,819
and since hp5 in HB 2324 Tapia ask and
what is Karis 360 576 forget all that

437
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:43,980
stuff is not reportable that you have bi
for people going out the door without

438
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:49,289
protection so being able to do that is
important but you know there are some

439
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:52,799
problems like images versus text
obviously Texas very easy images are

440
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:59,788
difficult but again machine learning and
what they call a vector mission which

441
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:03,150
are newer technologies where they think
index and they see how things are used

442
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:08,309
on computer over time can build these
mental models that are very accurate so

443
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:18,180
it just depends what type data you're
trying to protect some transition

444
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:30,149
apparently internet bad car now there's
always bunch of ways to get around in

445
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:34,920
dlp and it's kind of funny encryption
right what we always tell people is

446
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,900
security professionals if you want to
protect it what do you do corrupt it

447
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:48,900
problem is if you can expect so you know
and there's a lot of unmonitored vectors

448
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,319
I talk about that shadow spot in
people's networks where you take

449
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:56,339
corporate assets off the network and you
allow them to go anywhere you want

450
00:35:56,339 --> 00:36:00,450
without being that's an unmonitored
vector ever remember when you first got

451
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:06,359
the first iphone hooked up at work right
was so cool you can do gmail and

452
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:12,029
corporate veil same time right like you
get gmail for somebody and if you just

453
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:16,829
want to send and work toward it it but
you just change the problem addressed to

454
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:20,309
your own so I mean it doesn't even come
from gmail it just comes from your phone

455
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:25,440
to the corporate mail it fits you know
now we got Indians out there that forbid

456
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,740
we talk about analyzing information as a
way to get through there are some things

457
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,140
called advanced division techniques
right notes are their brutal and they're

458
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:42,900
very hard to protect against and so you
are always going to have a problem with

459
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,130
people breaking data up you know if I
want to steal your credit card numbers

460
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,339
you know what i would do is take the
first portage to the list but it's all

461
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:54,869
five second 40 the third is and then
even better I would change zeros two

462
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:59,520
days you know wants to be next thing you
know you got alphabet soup and it

463
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,230
doesn't match your credit card had how
do you defend against them

464
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:12,329
that's pretty strong that's so basically
become fools but it works so what is the

465
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:12,960
problem

466
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,490
how you even defend against that stuff
well the biggest thing is this its data

467
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:23,609
disorganisation network architecture IV
now its most of the stuff is just my god

468
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,609
the kids rooms more organized some of
these file servers are cross

469
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:32,339
you know and we're not just talking
about the stuff rest talk about the

470
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:33,359
stuff in motion

471
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,489
how many people are familiar with doing
dlp dated use anyone heard of that one

472
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:43,680
more couple of you essentially the
difference is that rests its static way

473
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,160
to hit in use is when our emotion is
when it's being moved around between

474
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,109
hosts to be used and then uses let's
take the database right i'm in a

475
00:37:55,109 --> 00:38:01,558
database and I'm doing things between
files or gold fields tables

476
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:06,209
how do you know manipulate how do you
protect them from manipulating man

477
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:09,569
that's older than most people just stick
with it using motion

478
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:13,140
well first things you can't protect what
you don't know you heard me complain

479
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,140
about you know the lactobacillus man

480
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,940
most people you gotta have some kind of
label insist right me go to a doctor's

481
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,229
office

482
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:27,509
it's always against the wall you see the
whole chart right labels green bangles

483
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:31,680
hello labels tell me different things
you look at most of our file systems in

484
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,808
its its it's messy it's spaghetti
junction is usually done by group who

485
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:40,589
owns the day it and then they do
whatever they want it's all mixed out

486
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:44,969
how many times you've done a lot of
positives find out you realize that

487
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:51,539
everyone's performance reports like read
everyone I'll well now wait we should

488
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:54,630
make sense yes yes we don't want
everybody reading everyone else's

489
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:59,039
performance report those kinds of things
so using some kind of labeling system

490
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,660
whether it's a pseudo military one your
own proprietary one potential versus

491
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,930
privileged person public something is
better than nothing

492
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:11,969
you know ultimately what you want to
arrive at is you don't want to be able

493
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:15,630
to take that messy file cabinet you got
to put it together and get organized and

494
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,739
that's the part most people don't want
to do that pain of the program is

495
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:23,880
getting people to retroactively clean up
their rooms and rather just kind of like

496
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,880
can we just do it going forward

497
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:33,410
the other part of the network's you know
traditionally networks if you're in an

498
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:37,100
established organization you know you
probably paid out big money . built a

499
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,490
network and then you piecemeal it
through maybe do a modern refresh every

500
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,879
once in awhile but the architecture
doesn't necessarily change

501
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:50,540
most people just say i will just put a
fire fire school and were protected set

502
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:56,570
ok but a lot of networks that you look
at it you want to do data loss

503
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:00,290
prevention you're talking about
controlling funneling information who

504
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:04,460
has access to it it's more than just
let's throw dlp program out there and

505
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,240
look at the stuff you've got to actually
set up those security zones trust

506
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:15,649
untrusted zone and then that way you
understand it's easier to do p when you

507
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:20,450
know the comment like you have no
knowledge so I have these databases of

508
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:25,220
my customers no good data precise method
but i also know that the data is coming

509
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:31,069
from this this being land this fileserve
again i know i should treat that

510
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:37,760
information as confidential doesn't
matter what's in its confidential so

511
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,450
again look at your big hits your email
your own clients for mobile devices

512
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:47,090
you know your internet those are all
major vectors for this stuff right and

513
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:52,040
then just do some basic steps don't do a
flat fee land creatures owns do use

514
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,930
proxies and firewalls you know look at
look at these stores tart tart is a

515
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,120
great example is not unlike network

516
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:07,910
I'm how many ways are into target out
just one and then and there's guards or

517
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:17,509
stop the wedding all thanked sensors it
right today their sensors at these

518
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:21,740
places that check every little product
on another for that tag again when you

519
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,890
look at some of these networks like one
senator Webb trap

520
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:33,020
promisee 50 people are all . here with
all these ingress ingress vectors how

521
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,670
are we supposed to monitor them all

522
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:41,870
I mean we're multiplying the problem
with so again it's in the network name

523
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:46,279
is where I'm kind of curious you know
want to be clear allow cloud services

524
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,170
from their company assets

525
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,170
I mean you may even use the time as I'm
just saying you know how many people

526
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:56,210
here your gmail g-drive and stuff now

527
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:02,509
yeah it was very restricted where I
worked have over where I'm at surprised

528
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:09,050
you know what about access to now
business websites most people do right

529
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:14,750
eight days but internet is almost become
right of the people even though you're

530
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:19,310
working your I don't know this work like
blood thing maybe I'm getting old but I

531
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:23,930
don't use personal stuff work maybe
that's also because on the security team

532
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:29,899
and I know what they look for so which
kind of takes the next question do you

533
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,280
monitor those channels i mean if you're
using SSL decryption you know the

534
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,210
problem is that we have great discussion
about this earlier is that most people

535
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:43,040
are starting their certificates that you
cannot do ssl encryption man little for

536
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:50,540
them which is great for privacy bad for
inspection and do

537
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:55,580
does anyone even have a policy for their
personal devices you know I mean there's

538
00:42:55,580 --> 00:43:02,150
a reason why brandon has two thumbs got
back home for all personal businesses

539
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:09,140
work from its lavender out anything on
there except work

540
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,419
why just 14 years working for a
government that would sniff all the

541
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,200
things going on the phone they expose
more information and you know

542
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,790
so my question is are there any real
solutions for everybody

543
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:27,830
another one you've got to start getting
in front of the stuff with requiring

544
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:32,509
classification data we do this now with
our projects get a project we all meet

545
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:36,020
up one of the first things out of my
mouth is what we're dealing with

546
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:44,060
confidential frivolous what do you got
put into this so i know how to treat and

547
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:50,060
that last me to build in those controls
that support the classification it's a

548
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:55,190
holistic approach again i have the
classifications to support my policies

549
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:59,330
when every built our deal problem for
platform basically made all the rules

550
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:05,630
mirror our data classification policy of
course you build those policies to

551
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:08,930
protect business

552
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,930
don't forget to get buying from the top
bring it all down

553
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,840
it's when you forget the environment
from the top it's like marrying the girl

554
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,070
without asking dad for permission just
not starting off on the right foot

555
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:27,350
I made that mistake he'll do it and make
it a win always highlighted stakeholder

556
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:31,549
benefit so like I partnered with our
person who does the program i partner

557
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,640
with our customer service manager who
did the data records for our customers

558
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,230
you make it about that you enable them
to look good you know by keeping those

559
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:43,940
incidents down by helping her with
training her who lives better by helping

560
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:48,620
our program person rain in this use
hopefully we're gonna make you look good

561
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,390
when it comes to the number of fraud

562
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:56,990
she's got a deal with if you can't
monitor it my rules don't allow I've yet

563
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:02,660
to actually get this one to fly anywhere
that then it's not bad i mean what you

564
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,270
don't know can't hurt you in the day
lost world

565
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:11,240
so with that I'm just going to say it
starts with simple things like teaching

566
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:16,459
your users a lot desktops and why change
this was because I got saying on this

567
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:21,350
earlier this week we have one gentleman
at work with Tory's you Kelly knows my

568
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:24,890
pocket well if you leave your desktop
unlocked you will be sending love notes

569
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:29,660
the group usually the sign it and
unfortunately it was my turn

570
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:35,180
and so you know i had stepped away for
just a minute and got sings and their

571
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:41,390
course very very cordial replying back
so I like that little me now learns

572
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,500
Death Star plans were stolen

573
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:49,350
desktop so here's someone a copy of
reference material that I used with a

574
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:54,569
lot of stuff when you're constructing
your argument you'll probably want to go

575
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:57,990
out and get updated copies of these you
know the stats vary depending on the

576
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:02,609
selection method and the analyzation
behind it so you're going to see some

577
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:06,060
discrepancies when you compare different
providers of reports

578
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:11,160
well that's what size are you the Alamo
says 52-percent yeah either one works i

579
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,629
think the difference is that there's a
lot of dated being lost to people's

580
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:20,970
ability to do the right thing so that
being said that's it concludes our

581
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,270
presentation you have programs where we
get out the top spot some questions

582
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:37,350
anybody questions start was starting to
think that is wondering is there during

583
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:48,480
my overriding are you wanted are you
windows box or is well he's gonna do

584
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:55,110
when the wind blows no i I've had a lot
of trouble with windows by logging in

585
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:58,920
the past using seems and things because
you know that the central theme of

586
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,400
windows on it it's really like four
events that come through that you did

587
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,690
something or did you it and it's that
analyte e that makes it a challenge you

588
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,640
know you get a stream of events i mean i
could fill domain i feel very long about

589
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,650
three minutes with 3,000 people in Cir
boom

590
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,650
so is there an easy way to do it really
now

591
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:25,200
symantec guys and then I been during
these products that work so i got he'll

592
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,160
be on one side what it does it look at
the classification it has a partner

593
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:35,310
product updated inside they're actually
using mcs

594
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:41,690
I don't know they're already have to
send them events back to the david it's

595
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:47,180
like what it does is it figures out how
much of it are they doing and then he'll

596
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:51,618
be just jack say what classification do
you have that's how i'm auditing what

597
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,570
people are doing in sight

598
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,859
let's touch this data for a while we're
just were just leaving like 300 gigs

599
00:47:57,859 --> 00:48:01,460
sets day laying around is there a good
reason for it turns out there actually

600
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,609
it is all for compliance reasons we need
two people paid

601
00:48:04,609 --> 00:48:09,259
ok sure that's my call group there ESP a
lot did not

602
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:14,359
yes tell me this too that's good
question you know you might want a

603
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:17,330
person freeware products to do that I
don't know what kind of environment you

604
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:22,940
have what size or how old they are great
the worst up in there but you know a lot

605
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,869
of times just sort of i mean i get a lot
of you like to bring the discovery party

606
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:29,990
that's what you can work with your
partners and resellers to hopefully

607
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,830
going to get proof of concept where they
do come in and do a call you just give

608
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:39,920
you enough information to realize big
problem little problem well organized my

609
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,820
off base

610
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:44,750
did I don't know that's usually a very
inexpensive way to do it

611
00:48:46,550 --> 00:49:09,740
the questions Thank You mr. able to hear
you're not even a lot of our practice

612
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:25,669
has and of course sir how do you was
real question so establishing baseline

613
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:29,690
is an important part of doing that so on
the baseline in this particular case

614
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:35,869
would be where the authorized people's
to do this and can we maybe sort of not

615
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:39,170
alert for them when we know they're
going to be doing this on a regular

616
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:45,170
basis in this group of folders in this
location so with those two put together

617
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,080
i would say maybe we we don't send an
email

618
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,000
we might just register this

619
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,450
then close it you know it's there that
way if there's ever a question we go

620
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:58,759
back and say well yeah they did but
that's all but we do want to write it is

621
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,680
somebody outside group tries to do that
that would be going off base

622
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,140
you know I've got a couple people that
have some day they sent out that is

623
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:09,859
critical

624
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:14,870
I have to write some exclusions and
minimize their impact was in boys but

625
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:19,670
they're expected but it took awhile to
figure out work analyzing the data

626
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:25,580
question baselines hard to do it takes a
lot of time and people kind of get

627
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,940
frustrated with you because they're like
Wendy right was gonna be ready

628
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:35,930
it's gonna be ready when I'm done now
that's a very strange way to say that

629
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,149
you can obviously talk like that to your
manager

630
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:43,010
you have used terms life well if i was
to conclude the baseline too early that

631
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:46,340
would result in very high
disproportionate rate of false positives

632
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:51,650
resulting and unnecessary amount of cost
you especially possibility of you taking

633
00:50:51,650 --> 00:51:07,340
advantage that's something I honestly I
mean we suffer in this works one of the

634
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:13,220
problems IT security in general is
anyone with your incident poppers

635
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:16,669
okay what are they no easy

636
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:22,310
ok so what do what is the human energy
to do you get lazy

637
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:29,240
yeah but then you're missing the point
it so if you have something that fires

638
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:37,850
on a regular basis which is compliant
make partner an email or baseline

639
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:42,290
recorded wide say look at the stuff that
matters

640
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:48,529
ok listen to stuff that you know is not
right for you not see for now we've had

641
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:55,700
to do a lot of other isrc feel e.e and
you know it's nonstop process because

642
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,160
it's a reflection of your

643
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:02,470
apartment and innovative changes this
changes you've got those rules that hard

644
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:09,279
part only allowed to spend five six
hours we gotta do so it's something I

645
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:15,940
feel like I'm brain in other ways i
might be good i remember being cool and

646
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:23,619
they say you know that thing was taking
every I fired off a hundred thousand

647
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:29,079
emails and about 30 minutes and I
corrected within the first 10 minutes

648
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:35,470
but the system you so many incidents and
they were hating on me I thought they

649
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:39,038
were going to you know they were going
to fire or anything but my boss that I

650
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:50,859
turned I based in her little testing of
the rules come play like English in fire

651
00:52:50,859 --> 00:53:03,339
so I have a lot of experience with a
cavity in my products will be nine

652
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:11,859
series also probably using this man back
to be done to use it tries mantech

653
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:19,690
branded it will be our 1445 the school
working 546 actually start talking about

654
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:26,140
bringing an LCR technology the adventure
you have in arms that they go to our

655
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:32,410
look for changes people filling out so
you have to identify which feels it's

656
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,000
not quite there yet

657
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,950
good very well we got you can actually
written a dog's was great ability so you

658
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:46,598
like a drawings those stories are are my
information out so it's not probably

659
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:50,799
never get a hundred percent you know but
what really houses when you're in that

660
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:56,079
market remoted you can catch people do
lots of cool things you know I caught

661
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,789
somebody that 5000 whole security
numbers of other people that was great

662
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:03,670
catalyst possible winner winner

663
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:10,240
then we got next thing you know I say
that a lot of this office Pallister UNH

664
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,950
right i mean look anymore Michael right
maybe more bite

665
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:27,009
w-where vote icd 10 high all the time
like now you can help you do the right

666
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:31,930
thing but until they have real
post-college enforcement or director by-

667
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:47,589
election and associated tap on the
outside of the biggest the workstations

668
00:54:47,589 --> 00:55:00,970
laptops is their products that work it's
magic magic scary part of the cover is

669
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:07,779
slow for all this look like flowers / oh
yeah

670
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:16,720
Metal Machine you know obviously has the
right to privacy of any de la mejor a

671
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:23,950
and entertaining using into that is back
so as they pass through it it was that

672
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:28,808
and that's why people hate the agent was
hard because things like Outlook rock

673
00:55:28,809 --> 00:55:40,660
very well ladies and okay got data that
was oh how light breeze there's more

674
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:47,890
than one way to baseline machines God is
probably a past three months for all our

675
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:51,069
a on just use

676
00:55:51,069 --> 00:55:54,910
yeah i mean i had quite a lot of value
most
