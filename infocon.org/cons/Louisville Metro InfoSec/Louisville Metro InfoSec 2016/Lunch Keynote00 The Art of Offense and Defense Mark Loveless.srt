1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,960
parts of their windows value left going
out there and national there

2
00:00:17,279 --> 00:01:04,319
let's go stable up there will also bring
your card drop them off right . so what

3
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,619
time are all

4
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:21,270
love you back

5
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:38,820
ok ok this is kind introduction and
Melissa senior security researcher and

6
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,619
security isn't right for you

7
00:01:44,820 --> 00:02:04,228
well I also known as a simple nomads the
internet i have someone in mind you I'm

8
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,399
sorry

9
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:33,510
probably i'm sorry things have only
everything was just telling you that

10
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,630
this is my industry my things

11
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:46,920
soft-sell general security thing and it
has

12
00:02:52,230 --> 00:03:14,040
so all right so many of these security
things out there are different and how

13
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:36,149
many are basic first I mean obviously
it's like a true zero i want to talk

14
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:51,599
about that want to work history lesson
10 way software on floppy disks those

15
00:03:51,599 --> 00:04:03,899
things you your hands and generally
using looks anyway one that's out all

16
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:17,190
the software being so great that and
make copies for brands one and this was

17
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:28,800
something very there were actual lie
detection is having we're talking about

18
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:41,370
the person that got this was my lobby to
my house i'll do that now

19
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,729
Wallace interesting about is attacking
you use a break

20
00:04:48,880 --> 00:05:02,440
monday and then rotate in that we
consider us we then things are getting a

21
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,690
little bit more for some of this

22
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:21,789
we're also at this time was very well
you know I work for you got friday i'm

23
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:37,630
going to write protected and 0 available
exactly is your name is later on you in

24
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:50,409
the break anything the manufacturers in
fact this level 0 now since a lot of

25
00:05:50,410 --> 00:06:01,660
hacking and culture lot of that era and
run that back in $YEAR census had our

26
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:20,020
ability and software and uses that as a
zero because not exactly zero use

27
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:41,950
technically love hanging out like 10
because it was probably was as happy

28
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,000
that's what we do

29
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,830
is Rachel right now we're even

30
00:06:48,830 --> 00:07:06,110
not a little exporting those reviews
hearing it which is whatever the whole

31
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:12,740
idea behind this is that if there's a
real way actually lost

32
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:27,590
let's say that order wearable in this
say so they're sending this is this is

33
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:50,059
will the first actually graphs that need
to be looking at all so 0o0 day

34
00:07:50,060 --> 00:08:10,669
word is not my angle so we're going to
talk about my class like to discuss

35
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:23,750
something that we used to do you going
to sit easy way and verse and all that

36
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:40,729
you know Papa easily with very simple
means that's one way least you should

37
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:57,579
yeah you always 01 really wanted that
party was no other way in and to worth

38
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:19,329
burning here is so you're bringing in
design whatever Party grants words in

39
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:32,170
there then probably resort doing is
you're acting experience that was that's

40
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:46,149
what we did also back in the day I
skilled system and there was one thing

41
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:50,949
is typically with passion system
hypothesis

42
00:09:50,949 --> 00:10:17,709
I love you some easy lot that way .
ruining my other thing was to monitor

43
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:29,349
system happens here walking around to
help Rob something legitimately wrong

44
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:41,170
system i remember a particular server
that is that I was really Marshall is

45
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:47,050
certainly a great story and so I
wouldn't want that

46
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,030
and

47
00:10:48,030 --> 00:11:21,600
patch up ash bring jobs i don't care so
that you know thanks and just roll to

48
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
your side

49
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:33,870
the other thing is once your detective
so you're out there trying global air

50
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:54,480
just kicked off our monitors travel
again just who added know you do buddy

51
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:17,040
envision miles and one hell out of the
middle . sure that's what we did with

52
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:30,839
this lock your door so that whole new
school

53
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:40,709
this is that shameless and basically and
these are

54
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:58,629
world use the easiest way to find out
about your lady and this kind of

55
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:21,069
background spider expression various
water 2014 arts project so i felt when i

56
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:39,669
was there lying stop and that basically
they use the easiest thing hospital said

57
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:56,679
says all forgot to ask you and lick
every morning possible negative and and

58
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:16,720
i were really really wanted in r0 and
after all the environment is over all

59
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:35,589
that's always hot as far as skills that
case not and there is a little bit of

60
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:41,379
that where their parts in it

61
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,959
this is going down require

62
00:14:47,560 --> 00:15:02,949
this version is that and that and as far
as the president goes they don't care

63
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:12,880
they don't care they don't care about
those juicy parts for them so they're

64
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:23,920
going to go ahead and hit the agency's
mission they have a tendency to learn

65
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:34,029
the environment so i'm back and say is
you're looking at a piece of malware in

66
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:51,850
the system and the internal internal IP
addresses web crossing executable that's

67
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:59,800
alarming things your way up

68
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:08,199
so this is how things are now another
thing happens here

69
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:20,860
the past is looking forward reason the
monetization and this is the overall

70
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:29,470
security landscape as well when I say
violation of exploits i'm talking about

71
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:40,720
is actually Louis wants and so I'm not
for example

72
00:16:42,449 --> 00:17:00,508
places active members cost problem i
predicted my sock panel want to get a

73
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:07,709
handle and provided on this side

74
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:20,039
the guy was arguing with me was us-cert
and said this is not it was a weird

75
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:26,579
thing that you need to think that others
as well

76
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:41,039
ah I don't think there's anything that
this morning and was there were lawyers

77
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:53,760
they're getting paid my box that was how
i got i hang out the IT world and

78
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:23,340
security measure space specifically
intention of using a scanner to scan it

79
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:33,389
was just a small step for some water
work required to realign so nice little

80
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:41,549
violin and is what there's actually
people are making a little problem

81
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:54,220
particularly well-liked seniors you're
using us

82
00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:16,330
so you only have to find a couple of
work here at living that the the impacts

83
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:33,790
of this is the is something catch all
the more value so that are not normally

84
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:50,470
they were dropping or they were behaving
possibly cities measured and get in

85
00:19:50,470 --> 00:20:00,730
fashion patch and is more valuable patch
this is applied across borders on state

86
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:13,360
in general this does her long mad at us

87
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:36,169
los pies is more valuable weapon is
knowledge or some type of

88
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:50,029
concepts rather this is going to do is
log work at locking it will work and get

89
00:20:50,029 --> 00:21:18,169
in there and use the target the
weaponization like a very happy

90
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:26,809
it's loaded on all those things services
i think there's roughly $MONEY for every

91
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:33,529
user app or something

92
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:47,239
so if you don't mind all those were the
problem is is that it lowers our brand

93
00:21:47,239 --> 00:22:01,220
into this attack and so that somebody
just purchased space decided to tag and

94
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:18,799
this is rise to certain things you see
whatever feeling our team ly equal look

95
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:33,980
look it up pretty bad and they were able
to get in space a place they did have

96
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,810
her

97
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:51,710
well talk about off a little smarter and
was going on so we start with the

98
00:22:51,710 --> 00:23:04,910
marbles the original concepts those
layers are original box i just kind of

99
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:16,310
started tcp relevant through the seven
layers model application layer and

100
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:32,270
activated to date and really is there
you go that is expected to be able to

101
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:46,250
say well I'm gonna walk this data for
her in this hot in that direction the

102
00:23:46,250 --> 00:24:03,590
marble private now sorry park dead and
shared that nobody haha that's when with

103
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:21,230
because all now dominated and getting
homework so firewalls now still

104
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:35,330
maintaining on your network of muscle ru
hours routers have basic alive lemons in

105
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:39,860
the network so there's that

106
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,110
the other thing is

107
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:59,729
walls actually more particularly affects
your batteries and release date odds

108
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:14,190
flower and are all this is something
that I personally doing home network or

109
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:29,340
longer and there are actually living in
well and all the more English out later

110
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,159
use

111
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:40,049
I get away with this nothing has been
talking about evaded security

112
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:51,240
professionals so this is like a hot this
is hot as our are hard about whether

113
00:25:51,240 --> 00:26:08,309
still need a firewall fire moved to the
organization you guys remember was a big

114
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:22,649
thing is not for it really is bad
because everyone knows you know really

115
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:41,880
cares all know that Silas company figure
out our website going to know the words

116
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,530
everyone knows really know

117
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:57,280
needed and I i remember years ago it was
a big deal just great blow holes do

118
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:07,360
sometimes skin rotating figure out what
this is was running tests and he's busy

119
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:17,949
windows that is a big deal so entire box
for that

120
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:32,500
yeah pretty much the markets operate
much given up 21 is sitting you know

121
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:47,620
best buy and purchase you can looking at
the separate races and smart water you

122
00:27:47,620 --> 00:28:05,770
will notice starts because it's all and
depending on various settings and what

123
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:19,389
actually is her major version and and
Microsoft us all matching taxes not

124
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,590
included

125
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:36,189
I will be able to pass level model
system first thing he does he does that

126
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:52,620
so that equals your you know it's

127
00:28:52,620 --> 00:29:06,659
probably use and hard cash somewhere so
fast it's a little easier

128
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:28,800
alright is also press desktop and server
and yes well it is dead or it's all

129
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:40,050
security professionals at this point at
least researcher bring that is not

130
00:29:40,050 --> 00:30:06,570
working towards the back shop so for
using is what happens packers all the

131
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:15,330
guys know what they're doing they've got
their own fire / whole general copy

132
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:29,070
every single artist saw it right here at
least and then we'll test our avoidance

133
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:45,000
side that is custom make sure her and
then it's really fun

134
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,730
they use virustotal to check action so
they have a

135
00:30:53,730 --> 00:31:01,260
let's say they're going to attack you
say five sites each side will have a

136
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:08,610
custom Lyle Kane ever so slightly
different model signatures that

137
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,840
beautiful is sensitive spot occasions

138
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:24,870
once those locations and give some of
mine so mad and so is easy to get back

139
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:42,689
so kind of attack so that doesn't stop
you ask me what you want to use and say

140
00:31:42,690 --> 00:32:10,560
here are those losses matter is the
console sorry I guess is that these

141
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:27,450
things are usually all over the side is
that if you decide you still will not

142
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:54,420
process all all these are so that's
around you as those guys or not whatever

143
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,420
here

144
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:03,399
use IDs reduction the way it is intended

145
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:09,279
we're live production kills it

146
00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:26,739
I don't know personally as i know this
in that fashion . if you did break you

147
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:52,239
know that's often it's not as bad as a
lot of this is ben myers is actually

148
00:33:52,239 --> 00:34:24,069
into the OS good example of this is as
not cannot stand for and love I give

149
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:38,049
this time it actually is going to have
machines so do that

150
00:34:38,049 --> 00:34:53,469
sure that is is extremely useful its
string useful is basically talking about

151
00:34:53,469 --> 00:35:00,970
this is the direction of everyone

152
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:16,840
signatures you know if your hearts into
these alarms but nonetheless models and

153
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:24,850
he will set this gives you will die

154
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:40,150
I think this is the one area where all
the other areas is kind of one area

155
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:56,050
where r is raising his hackers least as
much as the attackers always so sorry

156
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:06,310
direction and that's what all these
things happen

157
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:21,100
our technology look at the singles lost
this is the big reason why this slice

158
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,700
and how long

159
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:33,460
typically these require personal you
have a large you have desktop is charged

160
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:52,750
on all are you have to start this is
their strategy said as long as the

161
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,750
science is shut up

162
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,010
sorry limits

163
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:20,590
they only look at these slices and and
with their resolve very expensive was

164
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:41,440
alone in this slice time doesn't tell
you a lot about yes there's a large and

165
00:37:41,440 --> 00:38:07,510
that is full story not modern one back
door leading to systems and then you

166
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:10,510
either live one

167
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:28,000
so then they go how shops were going to
investigate all that loss you know when

168
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:50,230
we lose your keys and your mind later
you know a lot of you have exactly laid

169
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:54,910
back to the mall

170
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:10,259
that does help but and this quote from
Pollard have said possible was all my

171
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:10,590
fault

172
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:23,790
possibly one wise so just like right
here to have this is good you know how

173
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:31,470
to search you know how to act Orleans
did together actually something together

174
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:38,009
and as hard as it may be because you
have have you

175
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:46,170
cause of the way these technologies
working away attackers things loves

176
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:56,880
puzzles for example some of the Chinese
listen we look at when they were

177
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:04,680
attacked they might do something like
let's say one particular thinning only

178
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:35,700
use send individual ok you block all you
want and using that pad then you might

179
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:53,279
be eliminating some female business so
you can already do that however it has

180
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:01,660
attacked was the International has
certain plot as a domain reckless

181
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:11,140
in the email here all that last Thursday
today's use it when you start pulling

182
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:24,670
those random technology up now you're
getting the future for things are ahead

183
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:38,079
so we have to use what we have because
we don't have any choice right thing and

184
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:50,470
all the technology to help . was
invented and pull this had the right day

185
00:41:50,470 --> 00:42:05,589
forward I got ahold of consoles cells
are extremely smart and now we're

186
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:24,339
talking you know are your line was
actually almost was that question and

187
00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:38,349
machine learning and are actually saves
the river now it's not well it is

188
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:41,740
certainly is not

189
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:51,368
scaybles babies work

190
00:42:51,369 --> 00:43:01,240
rob is most machine learning a whole
different

191
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:24,439
types of finding five say is hard reason
is because of g'morning requires using

192
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:36,320
baseline so we're going to take a whole
bunch one has the is not mad

193
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:51,050
all that's missing is a little trouble
making this is what was closer and

194
00:43:51,050 --> 00:44:05,060
stronger experiment Rowland is
struggling it's over

195
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:18,290
hey just testing you said in the lot of
bad things and the morning star rises ok

196
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:33,020
2 million events i found that but I
inside 10 anything okay great

197
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:56,600
Julian out really send arts its act and
you want to get your actual

198
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:10,340
so is a hard problem and you're just
going to have lots of awesome which is

199
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:22,400
going to in curiously or whoever's
responsible generates and the thing is

200
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:29,030
the other thing you have to look at this
with the other end as well have to prove

201
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:34,190
this person has stated that you actually
got ahead

202
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:46,910
this is something that i think a lot of
people for RIT this alarm is this real

203
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,379
person

204
00:45:48,380 --> 00:46:03,710
this is a real are all conditioned by
our rules or very mouth

205
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:20,060
this is a really really rude and and
this is as far as a lot so essentially

206
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:31,310
the solutions are going to have to be
very simple and easy to avoid years have

207
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:53,509
no agents is that last news yet another
John is and you have to work very well

208
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,640
sorry

209
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:17,368
several others while carrying out a
homework all some gotchas 2nite probably

210
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:32,760
right i got to the Internet of Things
things right that you know your testers

211
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:53,640
whatever and you start office also be
something that you like these guys

212
00:47:53,640 --> 00:48:06,868
there's a catcher phone network what the
hell is this anyway this is all this is

213
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:20,069
thing right here this is exactly what it
is all tell end and there's many other

214
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:27,240
things are going to her people going to
pull in the office he remembers its

215
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:35,038
wireless yeah all right

216
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:55,620
it's always good and it was said this
this want to take his laptop and uses

217
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:08,310
black ops is using your google network
and my laptop

218
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:22,290
walk tall still the net and lock that
because that ball and because I look big

219
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:25,290
in this office I don't care

220
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:47,640
isn't that always the way this is expect
more of this whole ice movement you

221
00:49:47,640 --> 00:50:01,529
start moving the data lab it's just
financial system and a lot of work or

222
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,640
whatever

223
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:12,420
hey I don't know a lot about the issuer
avoid black ops anyway and so is it on

224
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:21,570
this year was lying just walk and some
people to invite myself for example that

225
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:36,780
I do a lot so verse that smart got that
that's a real compliment and so you have

226
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:40,500
people who is all so mild

227
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:46,890
ah I wanna get some ice

228
00:50:49,740 --> 00:51:05,040
strong passwords negation is something
you have something something you know

229
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:21,120
the password something like one of those
20 year olds technology enables for you

230
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:31,589
like I need to limit communication
that's it doesn't make any sense

231
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:44,520
do not have that don't allow the
patient's all your voice is the access

232
00:51:44,520 --> 00:52:02,460
us-based there's that's why I had the
match and don't test pageants

233
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:19,590
okay this is probably getting drunk
already

234
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:31,799
after testing a lot of times there's no
actually tested it out where the entire

235
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,340
part and what he has to do that

236
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:43,919
during out how to recover from Patrick's
you just do that and just want to go

237
00:52:43,919 --> 00:52:44,879
back

238
00:52:44,879 --> 00:52:57,689
ok that's all you're going to do any
cash believe something like they started

239
00:52:57,689 --> 00:53:11,578
they just passed out because equal
driving lesson in mind this year

240
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:28,469
tire pressure testing testing for every
single hole is right for halo ways in

241
00:53:28,469 --> 00:53:32,369
which exit

242
00:53:32,939 --> 00:53:59,759
here's a list that's what it's about
sexing rating system that is 13 real job

243
00:53:59,759 --> 00:54:10,979
but the thing is the penetration testing
logging lot of investors don't get the

244
00:54:10,979 --> 00:54:22,439
respect they get his ability to provide
that is penetration tester a lot of you

245
00:54:22,439 --> 00:54:27,479
find all those rules no real production

246
00:54:28,289 --> 00:54:33,449
oh no attacking department

247
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:37,139
x-art access the variable

248
00:54:37,819 --> 00:55:06,799
no oh did that we're here plus i know
that i would slowly were reasonable i

249
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:25,880
want to attend right and what that means
for the ends and a red-hot researching

250
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:42,199
ways right now beginning there was
handled it asked me and you want to

251
00:55:42,199 --> 00:56:04,160
question you have something perhaps a
time with your Russian 11 good

252
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:23,119
normal anyway that's pretty much all i
have just asked whatever as you see it

253
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,769
one of the residents
