1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,270
executives about security or how to
we're going to talk about talking like

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,959
business folks have meetings about
having meetings there's gonna be a lot

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,259
of that so if you want to do it in
another session

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,600
this is your last opportunity to lock
the doors little bit of housekeeping if

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,000
if your neighbor starts dozing off

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,619
he's captured fall on the floor and
we'll go ahead and get started I said

7
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:40,230
everybody's it's coming in alright so
introductions again with my name's

8
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,319
Arlene contin there's some stuff in the
brochure be passed around the speaker

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,610
bios with credentials and all of that
here in this girl i don't know that

10
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,989
anybody cares too much about those
little bit about me not being a security

11
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,419
professional or enthusiast as i like to
say i'm a bad sci-fi junkie spend a lot

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,189
of time watching those awful awful low
budget films on the SyFy channel late at

13
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,960
night i love them

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,530
why I've been a fedora fanboy so the
linux distribution also the hat but most

15
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,979
linux since about $YEAR version 1 also
the guy if you're a developer of any

16
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,720
kind i'm probably that guy that you're
constantly rejecting four plus from get

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,600
up i was a developer in a former life I
think I ended up doing something

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,020
different because I maybe wasn't good at
it

19
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,829
no I just wanna know who's here and why
keep rejecting my request

20
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:44,250
I worked really hard on that code oh
also an attorney and I desperately still

21
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,500
trying to be cool so underneath the this
suit my lawyer costume

22
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,250
there are blue jeans and we

23
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,350
still doing cool things linux is still
hold all this culture in my head so

24
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:04,940
that's basically me and now for what
came for open up with a story from my

25
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,369
week so I had just finished a meeting
where we sat down with project managers

26
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:17,360
budget pulse some sales reps from
encryption company one of the big things

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,090
that we're doing my placement discussing
implementing encryption and some places

28
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,090
where we don't have it out of this
meeting

29
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,570
turns out the numbers are going to be
way more than we thought they were both

30
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:35,810
in terms of finances and resources that
will be needed and timelines so I go up

31
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,220
to the fancy with panel office or the
chief technology officer resides

32
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,110
he's an important guy software company
and most companies have a side figure

33
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,780
but here he's he's the big exact sit
down and I lay the news out for him and

34
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,190
I'm waiting for for the blowback it's
that I hear you no harm

35
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,049
that's that's what we have to do
security I've seen the news it's very

36
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:01,190
important

37
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,579
we're going to reallocate some resources
where we're going to get over with

38
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,630
accounting and make sure that we can get
this pay for and we're gonna get started

39
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:15,290
right away so I'm thinking sales teams
not gonna be happy about this there's a

40
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,890
whole host of new features that were
supposed to be coming in the next few

41
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,140
Sprint's that are going to make it sir I
say what about about these upcoming

42
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,160
feature one of the sales team he says
don't worry about the sales team

43
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll take care of them protecting the
data that we're hosting people's private

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,530
information is the most important thing
we do we'll take care of and I thought

45
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,760
as I walked out of his office that I've
arrived in my career that everything I'm

46
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,548
about to tell you today will help you to
have that scenario play out in your

47
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:51,170
online so i'm assuming everybody here
would like to know how to do that

48
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,420
well so what I because the next thing
that happened is my warm one-off I spend

49
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,649
all of my time drinking about this stuff
because it's hard it's really really

50
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,480
hard to communicate technical problems
businesspeople I think you all know that

51
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,440
that's hopefully why you're here not
because you didn't like the other three

52
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,200
guess so

53
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,519
that does raise the question tho of
these data breaches the past few years

54
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,048
they've been all over the news

55
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:24,500
millions of people have been compromised
identity theft issues lawsuits flying

56
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,460
everywhere executives having their faces
in the papers and the way they didn't

57
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,710
want them to be there and so business
leaders that we all work with they're

58
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,200
scared and they probably should be and I
see this is a good thing it's a wake-up

59
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,620
whole your organization's anything like
ours

60
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,120
security is getting a lot of attention
sometimes it seems like lip service but

61
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,080
attention from the folks up top so if
that's the case why is it then that we

62
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,560
never seem to get anywhere is it is it
because I tea or just viewed as part of

63
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,510
ID and it's--and costing and everything
that deals with ideas behind schedule

64
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:10,400
and over budget so business leaders tend
to write off mighty as long as they can

65
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,989
it could be but i don't think so maybe
it's because the security measures we

66
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,430
want to put in place the controls we
want to implement our pain in the neck

67
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,660
they get in the way of customer service
they get in the way of closing sales and

68
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,870
get in the way of delivering features
whatever it is that your business does

69
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,770
it always seems like securities another
hurdle that's getting in the way

70
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:40,490
business doesn't like turtles in the way
of making money it could be that but i

71
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,570
tend to look over at other areas of the
business so let's take the legal

72
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,510
department so the attorneys over there
constantly cranking out just volumes of

73
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:55,340
new contracts new forms new language to
be reviewed every time you hire a new

74
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,400
employee they have to go over the
600-page non-disclosure agreements

75
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,960
meet every time you want to close the
deal with customers all contract

76
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,250
haggling that has to happen to vendors
in the same way i would say the legal

77
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,199
department has a huge problem with being
a stumbling block but yeah it seems that

78
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,199
stuff they need to get done ends up
getting done

79
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:22,258
you could say the same thing about the
accounting departments maybe not so much

80
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,300
sales is they're making money so they
get what they want to save money but i

81
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,240
think it's because we're speaking
different languages not just from a

82
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,090
technologist to a business standpoint
which has been clichés they just don't

83
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:44,190
understand the technology problems so
they don't spend the money it really is

84
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,060
just two completely different modes of
thinking which is what i'm going to

85
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,940
elaborate on here so the first thing
that comes up when security people talk

86
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,039
to executives you see this all the time
I see a lot and it seems to be the

87
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,900
obvious approach so all of these data
breaches have been in the news if you

88
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,229
need to get funding out of the budget
need to get something implemented using

89
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:09,090
resources

90
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:16,650
why not . to those data breaches and try
to excite shall we say business leaders

91
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,340
in the plan ball and you paying
attention helping you do what you need

92
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:28,380
to do the problem with that is how like
the boy who cried wolf story so we spent

93
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,800
two much two are relying on fear
uncertainty and doubt because it's

94
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,669
really easy to do this stuff is scary
the thought of the data breach where I

95
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:36,120
work

96
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,310
that's a world any scenario where all
unemployed after that no one's going to

97
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,360
use our software sales pipeline is going
to grind to a halt and i'm going to be

98
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,630
waiting in the unemployment office I
suppose so it is very important so how

99
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:57,090
do you avoid creating the appearance of
fear uncertainty and doubt is what will

100
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,080
get you next because if you don't think
about that if you don't

101
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,150
try to be reasonable

102
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,929
try to be just a matter of fact the way
you're explaining this to executives

103
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,920
what's gonna happen is you're going to
become the squeaky wheel which has

104
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,880
happened to all those at some point and
you're gonna be the guide the lady that

105
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,520
just getting one and business leaders
are going to turn to all-tournament

106
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,680
voices to find out what they actually
need to do to protect them from a

107
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,180
liability standpoint and when that
happens who they turn to it's not the

108
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:37,159
Security leaders in the company then
they turn to the legal departments they

109
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:44,089
turn to the chief financial officer they
turn to regulatory bodies and what you

110
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:48,770
end up with when that happens is what
all too many of our organizations find

111
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:54,530
ourselves with which is a pure
compliance program is everyone knows if

112
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,510
you do something to meet regulatory
compliance it's a lot easier to sell but

113
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:06,050
regulatory compliance doesn't always get
you real security and so too many

114
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:14,780
businesses language in this world my big
red circle your red bad just if it's not

115
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:20,959
to do with HIPAA PCI DSS or mist or
whatever compliance framework you might

116
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:30,320
be under it becomes a very difficult so
so to speak the language of executives

117
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,780
of business leaders in order to persuade
them to see the issue the way we we're

118
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,199
not going to do that technical details
we're not going to do that with look

119
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,180
here's how easy it is to exploit the
vulnerabilities you're not really going

120
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,319
to be able to do it with vulnerability
scanning reports and maybe even auditors

121
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,240
ending on business until you can
translate that into a language that

122
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,230
business people understand so I'm going
to teach you a little bit of this

123
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,610
language I don't know it very well but I
know a few keywords most important of

124
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,640
those is risk

125
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,430
business is risk all businesses risk go
into business you're taking a risk you

126
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:15,250
think you're going to make money and uh
hopefully if you're a business that

127
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:21,280
wants to stay in business it's a managed
minimize mitigating risk but that that's

128
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,560
what practice of businesses so business
leaders their bread and butter is risk

129
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,510
to the business it's my risk reward
ratio if what am i risking this amount

130
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,780
of money forward to make this amount of
money am I going to spend a hundred

131
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:40,360
thousand dollars to land a clients who
may only bring the 50 grand revenue no

132
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,690
I'm not gonna risk wasting 10 grand slam
million-dollar client problem so it's

133
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:52,090
it's not difficult it's just different
from the way that we as technical people

134
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:59,110
not only so first step you approach
executive whether it's a meeting or

135
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,740
email

136
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,870
however it is you get in contact with
them the first thing you want to do is

137
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:10,750
start off the conversation with what you
need and by that I don't mean show up

138
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:17,260
with with a voice in your hand or with a
price estimate because that's not really

139
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,130
going to get you anywhere either want to
be squeaky wheel also don't want to be

140
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,510
the money pit

141
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:31,630
think about it this way if your aid CX
of some sort of any decent sized

142
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,740
organization

143
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,800
what is it that you do on a daily basis

144
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,910
what is your job well

145
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:46,959
politics is officially puts your child
function you make decisions right like

146
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,270
you're the decider George Bush design
right so you got to give an executive

147
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,860
decision if you're just coming to an
executive to say here's a problem i have

148
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,089
I need you to solve it for me or hey
here's a solution that we

149
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:04,209
we really want and here's how much it's
going to cost you to sign this check for

150
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:05,050
me

151
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:11,319
second is not making a decision right
you're just saying signed a check or

152
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:15,339
solve this for me which is an issue they
probably don't understand what you do

153
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:21,759
instead is coming to that business
leader and say here's a problem here are

154
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:27,579
different solutions that we've come up
with and the risks and costs associated

155
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:41,800
with each one of those so i like to say
dollars-and-cents Sen se Sano appreciate

156
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,160
because i'm still trying to be funny
cool you guys can live a little

157
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,529
oh you want your freedom in that context
and then put it on the table

158
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,870
business leaders to decide now if you're
really craft somebody mention politics

159
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,759
earlier so maybe you know where I'm
about to go with this really crappy you

160
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:06,069
can frame that in such a way that
decision is really kind of already made

161
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:10,839
because there's really only one decision
that could realistically be made the

162
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,679
trick is letting the executive people
want to make that decision

163
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:19,449
maybe they have an ordinance complex or
maybe they're very attached to the

164
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:24,160
business because they have a lot more at
stake than we do is employees could be a

165
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,089
lot of reasons

166
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:35,079
all i know is it unfortunately some of
it

167
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:38,529
the other point is when you deliver that
decision you made

168
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:43,809
you also have to commit to results and
that's something that we as technology

169
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:49,420
people a lot of us i used to not be so
comfortable with doing

170
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,360
we tend to speak in generalizations like
this should improve our defenses on the

171
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,189
perimeter and prevent these kinds of
attacks or hypothetically this will do

172
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:04,870
that we speak in broad terms without
making any kind of commitment part of

173
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,170
the solutions you have to offer in order
for a business leader to make a decision

174
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,560
is a Boston we do this thing

175
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,849
here's what will happen you have to put
some accountability on the line isn't

176
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,320
always easy especially if you're afraid
you might be wrong but when you do that

177
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,840
also tend to get better results
especially if you follow through with

178
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,980
that accountability and it seems fair
right you're asking the executive to

179
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:36,800
make a decision accountable so whatever
it is they decide you should be

180
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,589
accountable for the movie set the
results so not the answer to that

181
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:48,950
still no can't do it especially if it's
an expensive fun security boy like some

182
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,630
of our vendors have out here you take
their business cards back call them you

183
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,710
do the sales that was your soul but
never feel like you're going to get the

184
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,210
lineup in the budget to ever really see
them outside of this conference over

185
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:02,990
here

186
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:09,260
oh and that's because as a business
leader can't put yourself in their shoes

187
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:15,020
and I know it's really hard because I
struggle with this everyday i tend to

188
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,780
look at security like insurance so when
you're spending on on security dollars

189
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,850
you're trying to protect yourself
against a potential risk just like

190
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:32,600
insurance at the office Curie's on its
equipment and computers the insurance

191
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,650
that we have for workers compensation
insurance if you buy for your car house

192
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:43,100
you buy it for one of two reasons first
of which is a wall

193
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,060
no matter how small risk that risks
realized would be world ending for you

194
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,850
most of us by owners insurance because
if we lose our house we just can't

195
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,770
replace that need insurance

196
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,670
not likely but it would be just a
world-ending walls

197
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:05,510
the other reason is because the expected
loss costs more than what the insurance

198
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,530
costs so this is the lens you have to
look through when you're trying to make

199
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,630
your case to executives about why we
need one shiny toys out is to think

200
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,850
realize they're thinking of his
insurance

201
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:33,899
sometimes still disagree that that even
spill with occasionally out the risk

202
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,829
that I see this bad event happening is
still not worth what is going to call

203
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:42,029
for me to prevent from happening
especially when you're in some of those

204
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:48,630
six bigger pieces of software part of
why don't spill that a disagreement at

205
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,709
this point is because of the two
different modes of thinking that we have

206
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:57,239
security professionals vs business
leaders are going to have we tend to

207
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,160
approach things in very tactical man
most of us our day-to-day life is spent

208
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,389
putting out fires

209
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:07,980
something's on fire today is going to be
something different tomorrow security

210
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,390
incidents pop-up gotta do the
investigation there's there's

211
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,289
vulnerability scans and come back gotta
do the mitigating results you've got to

212
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:20,369
go talk to the patching folks make sure
they're up to speed and that's our

213
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:24,059
day-to-day world and we tend to view a
security breach or a bad security

214
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:30,510
incident as another giant fire that
we're trying to prevent business leaders

215
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,340
on the other hand they're inherently
strategic in there there at least if

216
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,629
it's a well-run business which I know
that's not the case everywhere business

217
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,710
leaders are focused on what are we going
to be doing tomorrow next month six

218
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:48,090
months from now five years from now
thinking any longer term context where

219
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,590
that security incident that security
breach that we're so worried about that

220
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:58,320
we feel that we need whatever this thing
is to prevent it happening when you're

221
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,490
looking at it on their time scale maybe
business leader you're trying to

222
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:09,179
communicate with doesn't see it as big
fires you do in the grand scheme so

223
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:13,799
there's still some waves to do some
persuasion even in this comment if

224
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,220
you're still getting now after you've
laid out the case in dollars and cents

225
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,539
you're still getting know after
everything we've talked about up till

226
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:22,230
now

227
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,030
but you're convinced that no this is
something that your organization really

228
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:35,100
needs then there's a another thing to
examine here which is human tendency to

229
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:43,980
40 risk avoidance also this is what i
really like so Peter guy i can never

230
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,850
pronounce his last name the guy with the
XPrize foundation always talk about risk

231
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:53,219
aversion is what really hampers human
progress i'm not drawing time you really

232
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,380
care about him anyway what this concept
that I'm about to go into is is that

233
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,419
human beings just evolutionarily
emotionally whatever the reason may be

234
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:10,890
most of us sends you create a much
deeper emotional attachment to Los then

235
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,410
we do the gains you see this all the
time in the stock markets were in the

236
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:21,570
casinos where you'll have to have that
individual move maybe they bought the

237
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,290
stock think it was gonna go up and it
starts to take it down turn they just

238
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,879
keep holding on to it

239
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,929
keep holding on to it because it's going
to turn around its gonna turn around and

240
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:32,400
never does

241
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,510
they lost everything you think why did
you cut your losses on that and just let

242
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,830
it go make money another day but
emotionally when it's your money on the

243
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:45,330
line is really hard to do that same
thing in the casino lot of lot of us

244
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:51,299
tend to not think about realizing a loss
until we catch that are chips so we

245
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,780
start running down just keep spending
more money thinking there's a

246
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,639
possibility i'm gonna make this back I'm
gonna make this fast and most of the

247
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,720
time you never do right

248
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,490
there's a lot of us that leave the boat
broke i like my father

249
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:11,910
so let's let's take a scenario here if
you had to choose one of these two

250
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:19,650
options which would be the first option
is you want a door prize $5,000 take

251
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:28,620
your check for $5,000 leave right now
you put it in the back four or you can

252
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,040
stay here with us take a chance to grow
up in will later and spend it

253
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,470
you get a 50-50 chance walking out of
here with ten thousand dollars instead

254
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:43,210
of haha course there's also a 50-50
chance that you're just going broke

255
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:49,360
so how many of you would take the first
option in this scenario five thousand

256
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,780
dollars in your pocket right now what
about the second is our recent ok

257
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:09,970
oh I'm sorry problem let's put this
scenario on its head and let's look at

258
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:15,520
it a different way about someone you've
been fine $5,000 by the FCC because of

259
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,680
some body language you use on facebook
got paid to find it so you get your

260
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,630
checkbook out you can write the check

261
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:29,260
leave it here you can go on your way or
we can bring out the wheel again i like

262
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,790
to call this the wheel federal revenue
you can give that wheel spin there's a

263
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,470
50-50 chance that that fine we wait you
don't know anything

264
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:48,669
it's also a 50-50 chance in 10,000 pop
so who goes off you want and option G

265
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,990
lawyer up

266
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,540
we don't like lawyers so all the way
they were in the first

267
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:07,750
yeah that's true so where we're going
here is in either case is we're talking

268
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,040
about the same amount of money

269
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,090
both of these scenarios either you're
spending by brand you have my grand

270
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:19,000
still it's $5,000 you're still talking
about 50-50 shot at $10,000 whether it's

271
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,760
a loss or gain an extra five where the
theory i'm going after goes is that we

272
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:31,330
are much more likely to lock in games
early investment terms you start to make

273
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:36,399
a little money or in the business cases
will get back to a moment you tend to

274
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,130
take things as quickly as you can with
his problems just human tendencies

275
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,490
whereas if you're suffering the walls

276
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:50,070
you don't have to realize feel that
walls until until it actually happens so

277
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,879
all of this plate out i don't know you
guys in the front can see the people

278
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,110
behind but in the first scenario the
vast majority of us that option one

279
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:04,860
rather have money in my pocket and a
chance of not perfectly consistent but

280
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,629
on the second option

281
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:11,820
most of us went with choice number two
which was we'd like to take the 50-50

282
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:18,840
shot of avoiding that balls so when you
look at like this and put yourself back

283
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:24,480
into business leader she's going back to
make your case one last arm or why we

284
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:33,330
need why one of our vendors products if
early cissp here I figured there'd be a

285
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,439
few so all of you are intimately
familiar with these letters appear on

286
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,370
the screen

287
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:45,209
el es le AR 0 and all those fun things
but this is the annual loss expectancy

288
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:51,570
is equal to the single balls expectancy
times the annual rate of what you have

289
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,889
to do to make your case last time you
have to put some dollar figures on stuff

290
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:00,180
you have to put a dollar figure on the
event that you're worried about

291
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,560
happening what's it going to cost the
business should this have you have to

292
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:11,250
put a likely benefactor how likely do I
think this is to occur before we

293
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:18,000
purchase one of our winter sports wear
and then you multiply those together and

294
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,160
what you get is what you expect to lose
anyone from this particular security

295
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:28,830
incident this particular thing happening
and you get a dollar so that's what it

296
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:33,419
calls so let's say you've got to talk
about physical security you want to buy

297
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:39,000
something better secure the perimeter
around your data center and you're

298
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,380
worried about somebody walking off with
the server that for some reason you just

299
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,440
left three standing on the floor because
people still have our servers

300
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,760
and it's really just pick up and walk
out with its a ten-thousand-dollar piece

301
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,519
of equipment but there's only a five
percent chance that somebody's gonna

302
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,049
walk out every year you think there's a
five percent chance

303
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:07,330
so what that would mean is annually your
expected loss your annual walls

304
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:15,100
expectancy on that server 5% of 10,500
dollars so if the cage for the walk or

305
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,149
whatever it is you want to click in the
data center cost less than five hundred

306
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:20,559
dollars in here

307
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:26,289
you made a very compelling case that
that this is an investment you're

308
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:31,059
showing it to business leader as what
were actually doing here saving money by

309
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:37,539
spending this money now based on these
numbers we're going to see otherwise the

310
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:42,549
human tendency that executive this may
still be where their frame of mind is is

311
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:47,950
paying for that security product paying
for that control whatever it is that's

312
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,909
going to cost the business model that's
a multi have to realize right now but

313
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:56,799
there's a chance that whatever boogeyman
it is you're talking about is never

314
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,539
gonna have so maybe I'm going to take
that chance because I don't want to

315
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:04,899
realize that most it's that same casino
type thinking we just went through with

316
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:10,989
the spinning wheels so what you have to
do is get them out of that mindset shown

317
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:16,090
that this is a call see and for those of
you who done the cissp program or

318
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:20,740
something like it you also know that if
you can't make this argument maybe we're

319
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:27,250
the ones in the wrong we don't actually
need it as we think because when the

320
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,840
security business leader decides to
accept the ritz we're all scared people

321
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,809
we want us guard people's private
information we safeguard financial

322
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:42,850
information whatever information maybe a
lot of us accepting the risk to save

323
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:48,399
some money order mind that some of us
it's absolutely unethical you just can't

324
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:53,500
let it go we have to realize that
security is not the only remember back

325
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,559
to the beginning

326
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,590
this is risk that business leader you're
talking to

327
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:03,889
you're not the only person who's coming
to his hands out to check we really need

328
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:08,779
this is a crisis and we get it's
difficult sometimes because again we're

329
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:16,070
seeing in our little world scary world
it's hard to see outside

330
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:21,379
we just want to protect the day we were
hired to do not give us the money we're

331
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:24,379
gonna protect the data sometimes it's
not worth protecting

332
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:30,799
just from that risk standpoint from the
business business can absorb the cost of

333
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,330
Everest easier than it can absorb the
cost of mitigating it and you're never

334
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:41,389
going to get it you can make all the
slideshows bring up all the flood you

335
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:42,350
can send yours

336
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:46,309
yo new stories every day and when this
happens to some other company never

337
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:50,990
going to get anywhere because if it
happens walls from that event smaller

338
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,980
than what it's going to cost me to
mitigate and thatthat's just business

339
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:01,940
and it's hard to deal with our ethical
dilemmas with that is i have the two and

340
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:08,299
but until you can do that you're never
going to get anywhere in the sorry but

341
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:13,340
the other point here and this is the
last results this is after got in the

342
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,840
first time major case clearly the word
for the second time we did third time

343
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,590
you came in with the numbers and the
probabilities and showing the savings

344
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:27,830
decision still we're going to accept the
risk haven't completely lost the war

345
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,090
just that

346
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:34,340
so the next step here is to hold that
business leader all that decision maker

347
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,100
account that's what you asked me to do
right

348
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,279
business leaders make decisions that's
your decision

349
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:44,899
you got you didn't make the decision so
why should we live with the

350
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:50,090
accountability for that decision that's
why the guy upstairs this big box and us

351
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,590
not so much

352
00:28:52,590 --> 00:29:00,629
so first point there is that you have
the document document document keep

353
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:08,010
records of the risk you identified the
proposal that you may numbers that you

354
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:12,750
put together the correspondence from the
executive where they said here's why

355
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,570
we're not going to do it if they bother
explaining it to you sometimes in our

356
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,620
world

357
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,158
don't bother it's just no that's okay

358
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,659
their business they pick up they don't
want to do it you have to document this

359
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:28,710
otherwise when I think a little bit
happens somebody comes to you and they

360
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,789
say Harlan why didn't you apply the
thing from the vendor at the conference

361
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:40,710
and hey rat rod you use that no you
didn't make a clear enough case you

362
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,220
didn't somehow it's going to fall on you
and you're going to be the person

363
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,809
walking out without a job without the
promotion or whatever so you have to

364
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:51,120
keep this kind of documentation

365
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,678
also I know everybody's doing their
annual risk assessments right buddy not

366
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,750
say yes I want to know otherwise my
business but every year annually we all

367
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,590
know we should be taking a risk
inventory from a security standpoint

368
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:09,840
organization look over everything you
determine where your wrist points are

369
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:16,049
mitigating controls you put around them
what this documentation part of that

370
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:17,399
process

371
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:22,199
hey we've identified a risk here here's
the information you have about it

372
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,130
here are the controls we've adapted
which by the way you should even if we

373
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,970
can't get the shiny brought up from the
hallway there's no other things we can

374
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:34,470
try to mitigate the risk and as security
professionals that's still our job we

375
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:40,350
get told no close the whole best we can
never get up the holes left goes in the

376
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:44,850
risk assessment you're somewhat large
organization that risk assessment finds

377
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:49,770
its way to the chief financial officer
or what and/or finds its way to the

378
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:54,389
General Counsel's office and if you
think business leaders all risk all the

379
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:59,760
time and that's their language it was
sneaking off the waters so nice that

380
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,309
they may have an entirely different
opinion the CEO and a lot of times you

381
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:10,678
say the exact same thing to the CEO you
know when the company attorney comes in

382
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:13,830
and says hey if you don't do this you're
getting sued and all things are

383
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,970
happening

384
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,499
watch how quick the mind changes so you
may not have lost the war waging the war

385
00:31:19,499 --> 00:31:25,769
just lost the bet so you hold that
decision maker account keep records tell

386
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:29,249
people when the auditors come and if
anybody does

387
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:35,850
ssae audience or other independent third
party audits if depending on what the

388
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:40,320
risk of is saying you should throw your
company under the boss but also don't

389
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,529
hide the ball they find it explaining
its documented maybe customer see you so

390
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,529
maybe you're not the only one that
thinks this is important

391
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:55,950
then again maybe we are and that's
that's kind of what I'm getting at in

392
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,029
this whole thing we have to take the
time to put on the executive at think

393
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:09,269
about what are they think why can't I
get this one see the worst-case scenario

394
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:13,559
this one this one is my personal
favorite and i say that it's in this

395
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:17,700
malicious and bringing like I like to
watch it on TV I don't like when it

396
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,129
happens in econ weights which is why
call decision dodgeball this happens if

397
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:27,570
you've done everything that we talked
about before there's a decent

398
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:33,299
probability that decision maker is going
to hide behind your arms

399
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:39,749
why do why businesses develop your agra
see anybody know the core reason why

400
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:44,009
you're obviously things to grow up
around the business to avoid

401
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:48,929
accountability right stuff we're talking
about beginning your armor shield people

402
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:54,330
from being account so decision-makers
may try to add behind the bureaucracy

403
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:58,049
and not give you an answer or drag it
out forever and hope they can just keep

404
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:03,480
putting you off so that could be you
submit your request for capital

405
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,730
budgeting if your organization does that
and then when the budget comes back it's

406
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:12,360
just mysteriously gone and that that
committee in the boardroom struck out

407
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,310
no one said while you're at it

408
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,850
it could be that they just keep
rescheduling meetings are not answering

409
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:24,840
emails because they realize if this is
what's happening then get back to the

410
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,399
insurance idea that business leader
knows that this is insurance made a good

411
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,680
case they don't want to put their name
on the decision to say no they also

412
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:40,080
don't spend money they don't want to be
the person who house burns down and

413
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,350
their signature is on the waiver form
for homeowners insurance saying I don't

414
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:48,480
want nobody wants to be that person so
the only way to get around this

415
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,780
I don't really have much in the way of
good advice here other than be

416
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:57,420
persistent fur don't be injured and that
should go without saying all of this

417
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:02,610
nature so you bring it up when it's when
it's relevant

418
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:06,330
so you're talking auditors you're
talking illegal whoever don't bring it

419
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,050
up all the time

420
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,170
don't don't fashion lady over the head
with it every time you see her in

421
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:15,690
hallway because then you're going to get
put in that box and that guy same person

422
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:22,139
I said you don't want to be able to
begin the other thing I I like to do is

423
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:26,580
you have allies that you may not know
about elsewhere in the organization

424
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:33,000
talked a little bit about legal who is
incredibly risk-averse group of people

425
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,980
within your organization there's there's
finance some companies the chief

426
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,150
financial officer advantages financial
risks with insurance and things like

427
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:47,400
that they want to go to that person I t
if if your separate from my team which

428
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:52,320
you should be in a decently sized
organization man-hours over there that

429
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,910
can help lead this case and if you have
the fortune of working in a software

430
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:01,410
company i do sales driven everything's
about sales sales always gets what they

431
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:09,420
want a little bit sometimes security
feature especially now the data breaches

432
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:15,510
in the news talk to the sales chief
sales whoever beads and look you know

433
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:19,470
CEO doesn't want to play ball on this
budget item we got but here's how we can

434
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,470
spend this custom

435
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:25,029
saying we're doing x y&z for you and my
clothes and make yourselves because it's

436
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,520
on

437
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,300
that's kind of a last-ditch scenario
vary greatly our security and sales and

438
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,300
alignment but when they are you'll get
what you need

439
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:43,629
so the underlying theme promise is keep
your security department in the context

440
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:48,190
of the business when we forget that
we're not we're a support role in the

441
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,520
business we have a protection roll to
the business but it's about the business

442
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,420
we forget that that's when we get
stonewalled by business leadership

443
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,460
become the squeaky wheel gets ignored
and pushed off to the side and that's

444
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:06,790
when we stopped getting anywhere and my
last point is always preaching i enter

445
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:11,380
notice in the beginning how security is
more important than compliant bring this

446
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:15,400
up at every opportunity you get to
address a business leader they are

447
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,230
paying more attention to security now a
lot of business folks have this

448
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,130
misguided idea that if we just checked
regulatory boxes were going to be okay

449
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,940
it's our job as security professionals
in our own little corners of the world

450
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:35,020
to dispense with that idea as quickly as
severely as possible you can bring up

451
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,410
examples whenever whenever high-tech
rolled out last time

452
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,730
if your business had to spend a lot of
money your health care has been money

453
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:47,980
and acting all these controls that was
required high-tech you could point out a

454
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:52,390
business leader a head we've been
focused on a security first mindset we

455
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,299
would not have had you all of this stuff
because would have already had

456
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:01,570
regulatory frameworks are only getting
more and more burdensome as governments

457
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:06,130
try vain to get zeroed in on security
they're never going to do it

458
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,290
there's going to continue to be more and
more rules and so continued to sell the

459
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:15,400
idea of investing in security is an
investment against future costs that

460
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,240
we're going to occur when the next
regulations along because if we pay

461
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,770
attention to our security first in-depth
security there's a good chance we won't

462
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,450
have to spend any money

463
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:31,930
when the office of Human Rights or pci
accounts or whoever decides to just drop

464
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:39,759
only loaded so unfortunately i don't
want to take any more time I have

465
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,619
enjoyed talking with you

466
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:46,810
well we do have about technically five
really 15 minutes if there's any

467
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:52,630
questions comments scenarios you want
paint and see if I can pull them out the

468
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:55,839
puzzle probably can't but I'm up for a
challenge

469
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:03,310
nobody wants all of you have something
that executive management right now is

470
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:07,779
telling you can't have you thinking and
you brought I say you think I don't need

471
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:15,910
to be integrated probably actually
they'll so nobody wants to share stories

472
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:21,700
maybe a big accomplishment group they're
alright well put your arms

473
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:55,689
oh there's 1i will be shot right so that
angle can I use that angle all the time

474
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:00,640
again because the software company so
healthcare software and customers by

475
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,598
healthcare software are extremely
concerned about the security reputation

476
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:06,280
so I . now

477
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:11,109
hey we have a big data breach we get on
the ball chain I show them how the

478
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:14,348
office of civil rights being things this
list of companies that have had major

479
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:18,130
HIPAA reaches any of those you move
through and you think through that list

480
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:23,290
you find a technology company if that
breach was more than a year ago everyone

481
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,130
looked at the technology company

482
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:32,690
no longer exists they're gone so i use
that Ghost executives find it again with

483
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:37,940
the insurance idea if that applies in
your case then you use the insurance

484
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:42,680
idea where homeowners insurance you're
unlikely to ever needed but you can't

485
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,509
afford to not have and you take it
matters that data breaches just not

486
00:39:47,509 --> 00:39:52,549
tolerable to the business at all but if
you're a publicly traded company you're

487
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:58,700
not feeling and healthcare or I don't
want to say finance because one of those

488
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:04,339
companies are referring to is financial
for stock prices i noticed that too

489
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:08,690
don't seem to take much of the hip
people don't switch their bank when you

490
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:12,619
get a letter in the mail from your bank
saying hey we have a data breach and

491
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:18,349
here's your new card please call us if
you have any identity theft and people

492
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:22,250
don't run out and go to a different bank
so i think it's hit or miss with that

493
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:26,720
particular theme i'm fortunate enough to
be an organization where is very much

494
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,279
hit in the middle with that so I you
said that because right when you decided

495
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:35,599
my boss sitting over here is going to
look like when you bring that up but

496
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,509
very good . thank you

497
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:44,720
there's nothing else guys are free to
wander the next session I'll be hanging

498
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:51,439
around anybody wants to chatter as many
personal questions president like that

499
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:51,559
you don't
