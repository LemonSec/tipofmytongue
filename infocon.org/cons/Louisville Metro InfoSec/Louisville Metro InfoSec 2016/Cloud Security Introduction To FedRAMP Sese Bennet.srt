1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,879
well hello my name is DC event and we're
going to talk a little bit about

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,070
security and production to rain so
before I get into my heart just want to

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,198
kind of get an idea maybe some of that
the background audience many folks here

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,949
are familiar with done business with
been one person

5
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,949
ok a couple of God may have heard of it

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:32,668
ok you up how many people here have
heard of you guys are familiar with

7
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,390
cloud we're going to talk a little bit
about security and we're going to talk

8
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,129
to transition into the bedroom so I'm
not going to spend a ton of Tamil cloud

9
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,849
because i'm sure that you've probably
seen probable call presentations in your

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,570
lifetime already did you probably won't
ever admit so we're going to talk a

11
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,899
little bit about just set the background
and we're going to talk a little bit

12
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,010
more specifically about brands with
federal program is kind of how it works

13
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,260
fine if you're interested in

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,399
okay couple quick background things get
a sec and we'll be able to the

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,780
information security evart services we
are security based company based out of

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:18,270
National Cemetery in brentwood probably
robot our offices there so they were

17
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,770
kind enough to come up in the present
here a little girls over privilege to be

18
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,740
here and thank you for attending this
presentation will get some good

19
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,710
information out of it

20
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:34,889
so what is cloud this is kind of generic
explanation of a cloud but basically

21
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,280
follow scalable flexible actually
services and people are interested in

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,060
flower lot of different reasons some
people interested in cloud because they

23
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,490
want to use a technology that they can
scale up very quickly and it's very

24
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,839
quickly based on their needs a lot of
people take advantage

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,979
because of the economy of scale so you
probably use cloud using your business

26
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:59,689
probably using your personal life use
Facebook use Twitter things like that

27
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:05,750
he's club so we can talk a little bit
about kind of how it it really has a lot

28
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,470
of benefits but also a security risk and
we have to be aware of as well

29
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:16,459
ok so this is the flick of the finger
Tory cloud overview slide so we talked a

30
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:19,580
little bit about just this slide because
i want to give you an idea of kind of

31
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,160
what we're going to be talking about it
ran when you think about plot problem

32
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,989
comes in a couple different models

33
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:31,400
obviously there's a public cloud there's
a product while because there's kind of

34
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,769
a great versions in between those two
different types of plow public loves the

35
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:40,940
public stuff that you're used to seeing
you on facebook sand and things like

36
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,390
that

37
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,048
private cloud maybe cloud that you
deploy within your organization so

38
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:48,980
inside your organization looking at
being able to go out something quickly

39
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,649
being able to store a lot of David and
very cost-effective way they cloud maybe

40
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,040
something that you interested you may be
interested in maybe something that you

41
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,420
look at in the past

42
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,040
ok and then hybrid cloud is really kind
of a version between the two being able

43
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,358
to use it sometimes Republican sometimes
profit but being able to deploy clout

44
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:12,109
quickly to really realize the benefits
of cloud and you can see some of the

45
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:18,049
pros down here at the bottom capture the
bottom of the slide off but cloud some

46
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:22,730
of the Rosary is on demand scalable
elastic so I can shrink and grow it

47
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:28,220
needs to low entry costs it's it's
really simple goes cloud you decide that

48
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,819
you want to go out and go to Microsoft
Google or Amazon stand up services in

49
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:35,929
about 10 minutes

50
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,989
I just depends what you want to do is it
10 minutes is not going to give you the

51
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:42,590
time to look into the whole security
aspects of it to kind of do the planning

52
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,040
that does associated that you should you
when you look at cloud but it's very

53
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,900
fast you can do it very quickly look at
your cost choice and agility tons of

54
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,680
solid bodies out there you guys know
that big names and and it's of the

55
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,920
choices about

56
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,390
and the last one down disaster recovery
it's always nice feeling to know that

57
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,579
your day is being backed up its
redundant had that ability to recover in

58
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,319
case of a disaster

59
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,980
ok so let's talk about some of the types
of pop services

60
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,690
there's an infrastructure-as-a-service
at the bottom and something that you

61
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,608
migrate to build on or you you migrate
to and then you build upon it with

62
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:23,849
platform-as-a-service and its offer a
service

63
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,419
ok so when we talk about
infrastructure-as-a-service we're

64
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:33,030
talking about the basis of how the
Collins bill it's things like networking

65
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,010
security business disaster recovery
business continuity system management

66
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:43,080
things like that it's really kind of the
basis of how it's really the same faces

67
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,760
that you build a regular network card
acceptance and file and we talked about

68
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,620
platform-as-a-service application
development decision support web support

69
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,240
with things like we're streaming
streaming videos those are all platforms

70
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,430
that you can build a blind those are
platforms that we use a lot everyday the

71
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,990
previous presentation general talking
about store in Thomas streaming videos

72
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,010
and everything we only use it while so
much nowadays we always take grandma to

73
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,229
think about it we just something that we
do especially for generations and then

74
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:22,140
up top software-as-a-service something
that we consume email crm collaboration

75
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,840
tools erp use Salesforce that will be an
example of software-as-a-service so

76
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,219
these are just three kind of main areas
that we can we talk about cloud that's

77
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,479
because those are three main areas that
we talk about now the interesting thing

78
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,349
about these three areas that on each of
these three levels there are security

79
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,289
concerns specific security
considerations that you have to think

80
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:44,219
about

81
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,880
there's obviously security around
infrastructure their security around

82
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,270
probably build out your applications and
of course their security around how you

83
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,690
use and how you figure your application
so we can talk a little bit more about

84
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,420
these and how they all fit

85
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:05,210
is a global role FedRAMP picture cloud
has a dark side to anyone named off work

86
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:14,419
characters my name on hold i'm not
making you angry interview anybody

87
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,420
yeah okay i'll give you gas and not
think about we'll come back to it

88
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,660
I know everybody knows that the person
will be able to corner I guess when

89
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,110
either

90
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,350
alright alright who's happen . later
right

91
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:37,730
was it Samm yeah this was one usually
gets everybody is that it and force last

92
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:46,700
got that all right somebody Google you
guys google google television figure out

93
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:54,050
what that is and we'll get you a little
processor something I so many things are

94
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,270
ok you got it you got your google it
fast enough

95
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:10,789
ok alright cloud threat so again cloud
Bob does have a dark side so it's not

96
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,080
you know it's not all rainbows and
unicorns it there are dark side to the

97
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,409
cloud and these are just these are
something just primary areas and I'm

98
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,040
going to talk a little bit about these
very briefly then we're going to get a

99
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,960
little more into that how we can
mitigate some of these things so we're

100
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,169
looking at cloud there's a lot of
different types of security risk the

101
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,820
data loss and blind environment and if
you want to talk about cloud five years

102
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,940
ago that was probably one of the main
things that the security guys felt

103
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,620
comfortable with here are taking taking
data outside of my network put it

104
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,729
somewhere else and I can't see what's
happening to that date I don't know

105
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:49,210
maybe doing anything they could be
security over the worst they could not

106
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,049
secure and they could they could be you
know everybody can have access to it i

107
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,189
can't see it I can't control it so I'm
not comfortable with it so that was that

108
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:00,879
was a big issue that's coming a little
less of an issue but it's still an issue

109
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,129
you put your day off how do you know
days baby carrier commingling of data

110
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:11,349
share technology vulnerabilities of
service attacks if your cloud your

111
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:15,460
information when environment a cloud
server and that sort of against taking

112
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,710
down or gets so how message from a
security perspective positive that you

113
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,979
how does it impact your organization
that's a big thing that you think about

114
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:28,058
right so that's one of the things that
is a security risk and then there's a

115
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:31,120
course there's a whole list of I'm not
gonna sit here and read the slides but

116
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,899
the other area that you have to talk
about this compliance you know how do

117
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:38,320
you make sure that if you go to cloud
that you're still going to maintain

118
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,070
compliance society organization
compliance and cover number of different

119
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,479
things

120
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:50,230
any one of your subjects pci
organization people credit cards what

121
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,100
about HIPAA ok season hands up now

122
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,399
ok alright so if you're definitely
probably familiar with high-tech as well

123
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,420
so you know those are regulatory
requirements that you have to think

124
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,370
about it and right now there's not any
any hard-and-fast guidance around hip up

125
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,510
around hot as far as the clouds concern
but you guys that are in the healthcare

126
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,569
field you know this coming you know that
something that you have to think about

127
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:16,839
you know something you have to deal with
it so we're going to talk today a little

128
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,089
bit about how to handle from the federal
government perspective but but my

129
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:26,260
forecast you look into my crystal ball
is that a lot of the same apartment that

130
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,780
you see for the federal government's I
especially around

131
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,510
this we're gonna be slowly being
integrated healthcare side o the last

132
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:34,960
one

133
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,930
legal-contracts that's a huge this kind
of one that's always overlooked but when

134
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,500
you're going to the cloud a lot of
people will do the technology will make

135
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,680
sure that it's Carol make sure it has
all the bells and whistles but they

136
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,660
don't think about how am I going to make
sure that contracts are favorable for me

137
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,760
favorable for my organization so if
something does happen while back you

138
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,660
know how can I go and make sure that the
cloud service provider is keeping my

139
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:07,089
date with us inside of the four winds
out of the state's things like that

140
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,959
how to handle discovering legal whole
issues those are all things that are

141
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,790
huge and those are the kind of issues
that you don't really think about until

142
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,140
they become a problem then they become a
problem they become so that's something

143
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,470
that you have to think about especially
around cloud is how you handle the legal

144
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:30,790
aspects of it so i thought this was an
interesting slide talks a little bit

145
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,920
about a solid option that says
eighty-five percent of nearly 150 chief

146
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,490
information security officers said their
organizations are moving to the cloud

147
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,990
but nearly half expect a major cloud
provided to experience a security breach

148
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,850
does anyone else find it kind of other
than me

149
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,920
hey eighty-five percent are going to
move to the cloud but they know they're

150
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,930
going to be breached interesting right
that's not what's a great people like

151
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,589
that like to see we don't like you know
we know we're going to be really like

152
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,340
black-and-white it's either going to
secure for sports not secure we like it

153
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,830
one way or the other but the reality of
it and you guys know this is that as you

154
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,190
move to the cloud as you adopt new
technologies things are going to happen

155
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,240
things are going to think that things
are constantly changing especially when

156
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,120
you're working in common apart because
you don't have total control over that

157
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,460
entire army so you have to make the best
effort order to secure the best you can

158
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,030
and that's what we're going to talk
about how we can do to make that effort

159
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:35,189
so how do you mitigate some of these
security risk that that this kind of

160
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,140
study talking about

161
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:43,230
well there's a there's sort of a
five-step model that I like to use it

162
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,460
it's called an obligation model the
first thing that talked about is defined

163
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,910
language show understanding what you're
talking about and there's a whole

164
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,910
presentation of happiness and if you're
interested in this lot you some more

165
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:58,500
background detail on it but the first
one is defined the language to talk

166
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,170
about you know you're talking about
software talking about infrastructure

167
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,280
are talking about platform and make sure
that when you're talking into finding

168
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,819
that language books that you're talking
to your business folks you're taking

169
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
folks they're all talking the same
language one of the same page because

170
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:18,000
you'd be surprised if you're your CEO
you ciose is so come to you maybe want

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,450
to deploy this in 12 because it's going
to save us money marketing folks are on

172
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,020
board we're ready to go and everybody
gets together and start talking about

173
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,199
cloud so you're talking about the
technical aspects of your marketing

174
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,040
people are talking about how they're
rolling out marketing fashion they want

175
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,230
to roll out platform-as-a-service
because they don't care I'll

176
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,230
software-as-a-service they don't care
about the other aspects of it you're

177
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,140
your networking guys looking at
infrastructure-as-a-service before you

178
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,050
know it you've got three projects that
aren't even really talking to each other

179
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,300
right so make sure that you understand
the language and you're all talking with

180
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,560
the same page is going to be extremely
important design your apartment

181
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,770
make sure you have your non-negotiable
items in your requirements and include

182
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,790
your contracts some things you can
negotiate on me you know you may be able

183
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,480
to go shoot on your service level
agreement SLA but sometimes you gotta

184
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,140
really saying we want it this way it's
got to be done this way and you have to

185
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,790
have it so there was one of those who
cannot negotiate polite okay identifier

186
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,349
you tools look at your contract look at
your processes and honest look at your

187
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,860
technologies look at your class service
provider and say you see whether they

188
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,270
have things like horrible in the cloud
do they have intrusion detection in

189
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:24,900
awhile

190
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,670
do they have monitoring the important
thing I do have an incident response and

191
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,540
cloud all the things you do this on your
own four walls for your own network you

192
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,969
still have to make sure that they are
all available in cloud utilize that and

193
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,710
develop the checklist

194
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,280
what are the things that you need to
know from ya go through that checklist

195
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,160
to make sure you don't miss your flight
is going to be extremely important

196
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,160
because the worst thing you can do is
get to the end of the process and

197
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,550
understand you know you're always
through ready girls ready to be deployed

198
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,240
and you missed this major step because
you thought someone else was doing it so

199
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,830
that's important make sure that you
follow that checklist and then finally

200
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,880
follow best practices there's tons and
tons of best practices out there that we

201
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,790
all follow the day-to-day basis if you
follow this if you follow I so whatever

202
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,180
your security program follows and you
want to make sure that you follow the

203
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:21,510
best practices that are associated with
all right so let's talk a little bit

204
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:27,300
about some cloud security standards and
i'm going to get a little more into up

205
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:32,609
it's a bit random I said I'll keep it
brief with the app with other stuff so

206
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:38,490
has anyone ever heard of the cloud
security alliance couple of folks at

207
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,020
have you guys have you guys use the
carpet roll matrix for ok did you find

208
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,040
it useful

209
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,260
yeah yeah it's a good document for those
men have heard of it the cloud security

210
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:55,710
alliance has a document called the CCM
and it's a it's a document that was put

211
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:00,450
together bus the cost alliances used to
be kind of mine security controls for

212
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:07,470
various types of security standards so
it has a matrix that map's things like

213
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:14,430
FedRAMP in pci and socks and you named
some really obscure ones as well and

214
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,400
it's very good because if your if your
organization more than likely you have

215
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,120
at least one security standard for
compliance regulations

216
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,900
you have to give you probably have
multiple ones so this document is the

217
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,010
weight of being compared although so
that when you deploy solutions inside of

218
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,430
your environment especially ones that
are related to trial you can see how

219
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:37,800
applies across the board is in the same
time it also can help you build a

220
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,000
security strategy about how you want to
attack those very black market society

221
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,020
organization so i encourage you to go
out and check it out there's the URL to

222
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,370
get to it and again it's called Bob
control matrix i think its version 3.1

223
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,440
and all right and then right

224
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,529
this is that this is kind of that the
start of the day we're going to talk

225
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:03,150
about here just a second so fabric the
certification process and we're talking

226
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,449
more about kind of where it came from
its history and everything but if you

227
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:11,400
want to go out check it out at
www.kik.com and if you follow any of the

228
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,720
federal government's Lofton things like
that you'll see that I'm veterans

229
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,420
program it's even though it started back
in $MONTH 2010 is it the program is that

230
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,349
still maturing they're still fighting
over a lot of stuff about how it should

231
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,830
be done

232
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:30,029
who knew was how should you know day
lines and requirements and things like

233
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:33,870
that so we'll talk a little bit about it
but i encourage you to go out and take a

234
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,839
look at the website and sign up for some
of their newsletters and things like

235
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:37,260
that

236
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,470
I think you're fine

237
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:47,760
alright so what is FedRAMP the federal
risk and authorization management

238
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,589
program with a convicted rapist and more
as you guys know the government is never

239
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:56,910
short on acronyms its US government
program created to standardize our

240
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:02,610
federal Information Security Management
Act afisma lot of cloud computing

241
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:07,199
services get that anyone here subject to
FISMA is anyone here have any business

242
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,530
here we have reversed

243
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:14,800
ok so so you know that his mother is
members are very closely resembles based

244
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,240
on the same set of these standards and
you can see that this whole federal

245
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,290
program was developed in cooperation
with Miss with the Department of Defense

246
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,730
with GSA and with the Department of
Homeland Security so it was a program

247
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,400
that was put together to address number
of means and we'll talk a little bit

248
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,940
more about some of the key dates with
the program is built to do

249
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,030
ok so just a little bit of history on
FedRAMP december $YEAR 9 2010 cloud

250
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,350
first policy was enacted and basically
what this policy said was that if you're

251
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,250
looking to go in the . new technology
order to implement new technologies out

252
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,700
of your environment you need to consider
you're going to the club using the cloud

253
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,680
as your first option

254
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,660
ok obviously some there's there's some
data payloads and things like that can

255
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,680
go to the cloud but in those cases then
there's other solutions around here and

256
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,250
then and they will prove it but after
things that could go to the cloud could

257
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,150
possibly go to the cloud cloud is going
to be the first option that they would

258
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:18,190
want you to look at these over the
eighty thousand levin that's when that

259
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:25,030
the federal program was established and
then in June 2014 they require all

260
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:29,830
federal agencies federal army so that's
kind of just really you know

261
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,429
thumbnail view of veterinary program
that the important thing to know about

262
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:39,130
the program is that since $MONTH 2014
the program is really a lot of lots

263
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:44,890
teams you'll see that organizations are
are going to the program being forced to

264
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,310
go to prevent parcel the agency
perspective or at least utilize the

265
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:55,600
program the part that probably has more
more seen anything else is it along with

266
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,580
this requirement to move to the
requirement for cloud service providers

267
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,439
for companies that are interested in
doing business with the federal

268
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,090
government

269
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,899
you also adopt that same level
certification so that's what we're going

270
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,300
to talk about you know you're obviously
terms ESP if your si señor cloud

271
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,810
service provider and you want to do
business with the federal government is

272
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:22,919
GSA or or whatever HS or any other
federal agency then you're you're

273
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,400
probably thinking about well how do i
get certified black and participate in

274
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,180
this program because they're forced to
pick from this pool I need to figure out

275
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,990
how to serve on my company so that i can
participate and pull that's what we're

276
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,890
going to talk about

277
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:44,640
okay so here's the purpose of FedRAMP
standardized methodology to see which

278
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,400
security assessments authorization
continuous monitoring cloud-based

279
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,700
services so they want to come up to
wanted to come up with a way to

280
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:56,520
standardize the process and as you know
security assessments authorization to

281
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,000
continuous monitoring if they have every
agency did it differently every

282
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,170
organization differently it would just
be chaos so they said well let's come up

283
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,830
with a standard way of making sure that
everybody does the same so that we can

284
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,879
do it once and we can we use that same
authorization or authority to operate

285
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,800
multiple times and that's really what
that second bullet is so once you once

286
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,909
you define organization organization go
to that compliance process and they get

287
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,900
certified then that that certification
can be used for other multiple agencies

288
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,960
we're going to use for all agencies
including the part which path you decide

289
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,960
to go down the nice thing also about is
that provides a repository of authorized

290
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,830
packages so you'll see this time you
start looking at some of the veteran

291
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,939
documentation authorized secure cloud
packages basically what that means is

292
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,299
it's a already operate or it's a
certification from

293
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,480
grant program management office this is
that you've gone through the entire

294
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,700
process and using your solution is
secure and it is able to be used by any

295
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,340
federal agency that participates in the
veteran program so once you get that

296
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,759
authority to operate then you're kind of
in that bucket so when they want to use

297
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:05,249
the service whether it's an
infrastructure-as-a-service will be your

298
00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:08,460
platform as a service or
software-as-a-service they go they open

299
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,820
that bucket and they're able to utilize
your service so it gives you the ability

300
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,149
to kind of have a heads up on the
competition because you don't have your

301
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:19,559
authorized and you're in you're in kind
of selective full versus everyone else

302
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:23,279
it's kind of your kind of a big fish in
a small pond versus small fish in a

303
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:24,359
really big

304
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:30,119
alright then we kind of talked about
that it's the last one and it's

305
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,549
standardized contract like you can get
back to what we were talking about

306
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:35,940
contract language there are some
standards that you have to meet for

307
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,639
FedRAMP that make sure that you have all
those require language arts in your

308
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:45,449
contracts in your agreements and things
like that so it's nice because now you

309
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,440
don't you kind of remove that ambiguity
you're not gonna miss anything because

310
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:58,649
it's part of the audio alright so with
despair and cover it covers of the whole

311
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:03,959
list of things I'm going to us but you
can look at but you can see that pretty

312
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,809
much covers most of the things that
security professionals they were

313
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,070
thinking about right

314
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,908
it's going to cover like audit testing
is going to cover continuous monitoring

315
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:15,210
is going to come along ability
management so that includes all your

316
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,200
testing and vulnerability scanning and
all those good things that we like to do

317
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,369
but it's also uncover some of the things
that we probably are really excited

318
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:28,590
about data data jurisdiction and
ownership is also going to cover the

319
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,649
security of data at rest and transit
today includes all you types of

320
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:36,238
encryption you're only 15 scripture
levels of things like that it's going to

321
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:40,509
cover privacy confidentiality it covers
everything is a very comprehensive

322
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:45,639
assessment for comprehensive audit and
it's something that once you're done you

323
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:51,428
feel like you've been doing on it but
it's a it's a it's very hot gas and

324
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:55,389
covers all these primaries and along and
i don't think i have this in

325
00:22:55,389 --> 00:22:59,139
presentation but I'm when you go through
these all these audits there are about

326
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:05,198
325 audit steps that are associated with
favorite body so very comprehensive

327
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:09,129
alright so let's talk a little bit about
the players i've been talking about the

328
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:13,988
program but i want to give you a little
bit of information about who really is

329
00:23:13,989 --> 00:23:18,549
involved in the training program so
there's really four main components and

330
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:23,379
i'll start with the middle one cloud
service providers on five survivors

331
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:26,559
those the that those are the those are
the clients are interested in doing

332
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,209
business with the federal government

333
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:32,379
some people call service providers
people call appliance something about

334
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:36,099
organizations that looking to sell
services whatever you want to say those

335
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:39,399
are the guys that really drive separate
program for the most part

336
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:43,779
ok the next I'm going to talk about is a
grand piano in the joint authorization

337
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:48,729
board the PMO stands for the program
management office that's an organization

338
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:55,059
that that run by the FedRAMP or group
i'm out of DC and then the jammed with

339
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:58,959
authorization board that's another group
that's running on the FedRAMP office and

340
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,669
they do really two different things

341
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:05,379
the FedRAMP PMO kind of organized and
runs the federal programs and the

342
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:09,908
Federation jab is that is a group of
those organizations that are showing the

343
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:15,579
first slide that came together and they
authorized different packages so once we

344
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:20,198
get to an audit that audit results go
through the jab and then jam is the

345
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:24,279
final say on whether they feel that that
audio package is sufficient has also

346
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:28,239
Mission Control place it will talk a
little more about those second as well

347
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:31,479
now hear the bottom three videos

348
00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:37,929
threepio's are really the organizations
that do not think they're the ones that

349
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:41,049
conduct audits 30 states for third-party
assessment organs

350
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:45,220
stations and basically they're the ones
they work with the cloud service

351
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,480
providers to provide all of its so they
come in they do the audit and once

352
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,440
they're done providing the audience than
the results from the audience are set to

353
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,159
the FedRAMP PMO in the bedroom jail in
and then the final one up here is that

354
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,259
is the federal agencies so the federal
agencies are really the their clients

355
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:09,489
they're the ones that businesses looking
to do business with federal agencies

356
00:25:09,489 --> 00:25:14,619
have the their role and the entire
process is that there's ones they go out

357
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:18,850
and they work with the cloud service
providers to look for services so if you

358
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,168
have a service that you provide backup
in the cloud so the federal agency may

359
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:27,429
say you know we need me to come back of
the pile they look for costumes about

360
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:30,970
the top search bar goes out they thought
it through do they get their audience

361
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,980
down into the fabric jab you know that's
kind of flow so kind of kind of works

362
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,149
from federal agencies crossroads of us
three videos and then branch at so it's

363
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:44,408
really kind of a sort of an ecosystem of
cooperation between these four

364
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:48,820
components and then once those four
components are done the federal agency

365
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,869
of course they can do business directly
with that pasta water because they

366
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:54,488
haven't authorized package

367
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:58,330
ok any questions on that that part and
useful

368
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:10,720
yeah alright so i want to talk a little
bit more just a minute about federal gas

369
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,210
assessments and FedRAMP readiness
assessment and federal audits and if you

370
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,239
look at initially you say what's the
difference between a gap assessment and

371
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:22,539
readiness assessment because they almost
kind of mean the same thing

372
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:27,429
well in the in a typical autoworld a gap
assessment is when you come in and you

373
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:31,299
look at a client environment you
determine with their escapes you know do

374
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:34,090
they need the requirements are there was
something that they're just missing that

375
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,909
you need to go out to make sure that

376
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:42,030
place before you actually do all that
and you would be right then but in this

377
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:46,980
case the FedRAMP gap assessment is
really is an informant informal

378
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,040
assessment that can be done by any
organization you can gas has been

379
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,990
internally yourself it's one of those
things that you can you can have that

380
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:59,430
conducted yourself or you can bring your
favorite audio company or your favorite

381
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,480
technology company or your favorite
partner they can you take a possessive

382
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,040
but it's more of an informal process and
now when you get out of the bed ready is

383
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,790
assessment that's more formalized
process that's actually part of the

384
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,720
audit this kind of the precursor to
number three the federal audit and i'm

385
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,840
going to talk about all three of these
in more detail and i'm going to give you

386
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,560
some information some background oneness
that may help you if you're looking at

387
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,320
going down this path

388
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,760
ok so the federal tax assessment the
initial step in determining where gaps

389
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,760
exist inside of your environment so it's
the first thing that you would want to

390
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,890
be interested in FedRAMP doing an
assessment because I 325 control do you

391
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,360
don't want to go through that twice

392
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,370
you probably want to do it want to get
it done done done in over with so i'm

393
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,340
doing an assessment understand where
your vulnerabilities are before you

394
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:52,110
actually start going on the path the gap
assessment of value-based documentation

395
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:58,080
processes procedures and technology it's
also a consulting engagement so it's

396
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,570
separate from the readiness assessment
is not something as part of the

397
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,080
readiness assessment is not something
that gets sent in with the audit results

398
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,980
is something that you completely
separate so if you know if your

399
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,380
organization is ninety-five percent
there then you probably have a very

400
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,280
short get your organization is ten
percent there that you have ninety

401
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,330
percent of work to go do but no one's
going to do about that name

402
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:21,590
work except you in your position so when
you go and you create those gaps

403
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:27,649
hey we talked about it does not have to
perform by the video hit the 30 performs

404
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:31,160
the assessment they can't do the
readiness assessment work a lot so

405
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,820
that's important so last time you have a
favorite relationships with the

406
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,960
organization through KO but they can't
they have to bring in someone else

407
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,590
actually you the radius assessment
because if they don't then it becomes an

408
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:48,080
independence issues conflict of interest
that that that FedRAMP PMO it's not okay

409
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,199
and there's no course there's no
timeframe associated with you get

410
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,200
assessment you can do it can be as short
or as long as you like

411
00:28:54,710 --> 00:29:15,650
you can do whatever you like okay let's
pick ups sorry we go back there is no

412
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,700
you okay

413
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,290
the fabric readiness assessment so let's
talk a little bit of readiness

414
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:26,120
assessment so their readiness assessment
is a loss process is used to go out and

415
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,060
look at your environment want to get
that you have assessment if you decide

416
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:34,310
to do one but it's really part of your
audit so it's kind of a precursor to

417
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:39,350
your audit so interested in going down
to do the full audit then you have to do

418
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:43,520
this first and basically what this is
it's a process of going in and looking

419
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,820
at your environment in determining
whether you have capabilities in place

420
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,770
versus the documentation

421
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:54,650
ok so what that means is that early on
and grant program in this history many

422
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:58,670
organizations were submitting their
their packages for review but the

423
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:03,920
organizations have all the documentation
documentation was was with stellar they

424
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,220
had nothing everything

425
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:10,409
no two-factor implemented now they
didn't have security controls implement

426
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:13,799
happened didn't have policies and
procedures implemented around passwords

427
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:18,389
so so the FedRAMP PMO look at this is it
you know what we're not going to spend

428
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:23,159
our time evaluating all these going back
for these companies anymore so what

429
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,400
we're going to do is we're going to have
his readiness assessment process that

430
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:32,789
front end the odd so what this does is
basically it forces the concerts robotic

431
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:38,250
to create a document that's done by 3pm
that basically says that we have all the

432
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,580
capabilities in place and we have the
ability to do two factor authentication

433
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,780
have the ability to do encryption we
have the ability to do back disaster

434
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:50,158
recovery like that and it goes down the
entire list and that's something that's

435
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,620
done early on in the process so the
FedRAMP PMO in the jab they look at this

436
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,799
document and they determine whether
you're ready to proceed to the rest of

437
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,370
the FedRAMP process because in India if
you think about it really is a benefit

438
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:06,600
to the cspc positives from honored
because you don't want to go you don't

439
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,899
want to start this process and get all
the way through to the end and find out

440
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,919
that you don't pass you know that's a
lot of work a lot of times probably

441
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,000
impacted from a business perspective so
when you get through this process takes

442
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,020
about four weeks you'll know whether
you're to a point where you're likely go

443
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,860
through the rest of the federal audit
process successfully that's what this

444
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:31,678
expense to do is really kind of into the
engaged to the 3cs be but also kind of

445
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,610
an indicator to do the rest of the
veteran amo that you're likely to get

446
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,149
through the rest of this process
successfully one of the benefits of this

447
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:43,350
readiness assessment is that once you've
done this and you have to read this

448
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:48,120
assessment portion your company was put
up on the bed ribs website is being the

449
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,070
FedRAMP ray it's that basically means
that you can go out and start using low

450
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:56,590
going to start selling with it you can
start saying that were you know

451
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,770
only two completely separate process and
then it kind of takes you back to work

452
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:03,400
this slide we look at it with that show
the agency you can start having this

453
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,250
conversation with the agencies and says
you know now we're getting to the point

454
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,150
where we're getting close now let's
start talking about appointments and

455
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:14,020
contracts and things like that so gives
you kind of ability to let everybody

456
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,690
know that your day you're going down
that path and you're likely to be

457
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,659
successful with that that process

458
00:32:19,659 --> 00:32:25,720
ok and then the next one is odd very odd

459
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,370
ok so this is this is the this is kind
of the big enchilada this is the the

460
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:36,760
work part talked about 325 controls so
it covers all 325 controls the space on

461
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,039
this 853 standards called community

462
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:45,250
those must be performed by 3pm ok and as
we mentioned you can be the same video

463
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:49,450
that performs a readiness assessment but
it can't be the same organization that

464
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,419
performs the cat says it's really
important

465
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:57,700
three fields working see this piece of
develop beyond components and this is

466
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,950
something that's probably going to be a
little different from the artists that

467
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:06,220
you used to going through in this case
Threepio actually sits down with the

468
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,370
cloud service provider and they
developed the test plan together

469
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,639
okay so it's not it's not that we would
walk in the door when we say okay this

470
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,460
is our test plan we've got to locate
when we say it was talking with this

471
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,299
evidence and artifacts and I starting to
look at people's shoulders in the zone

472
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:23,440
in this case you actually have to
develop it together and then once it's

473
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,340
done you have to submit to the federal
govt review and then start testing after

474
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:32,439
that sucks so they give you just got to
work with them but really you have to

475
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,190
develop it together and it has to be
something clickable to the environment

476
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:41,799
and the next last next bullet three
kills were conceived pc complete annual

477
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:46,690
recertification requirements including
continuous monitoring if you haven't

478
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,140
heard this term for continuous
monitoring for

479
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,850
the ramp is really a process of looking
at things like vulnerability scans

480
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:58,050
looking at your logs to come off your
security devices monitoring your

481
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:02,940
environment when a continuous basis year
after year month after month the other

482
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:08,159
day so that's something that it had it
tested initially but it's also tested on

483
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,690
an annual basis along with likely
one-third of the controls that veteran

484
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:19,200
amo designate as critical controls an
injury review and oh one of the things I

485
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,620
want to mention about the previous slide
races that's been graded assessments

486
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:28,259
should take about a month to complete so
it's fairly short exercise the audit

487
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,370
should take about 90 days to complete
what about six months to get through the

488
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,630
entire process

489
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:39,360
ok that's what they're saying so i'm
kinda skeptical and six-month part but

490
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,810
i'm going to be positive and in hopes
that we start getting some through in

491
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:47,070
about six months but it's a long process
you have to go through the six months is

492
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:55,050
around that the top-ranked they're
estimating ok so these are some of the

493
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,920
documents documents that you would have
to provide a party FedRAMP you guys are

494
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,000
probably familiar with much of these the
information security policies you all

495
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,430
have policies and procedures contingency
plans and send response plans system

496
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:12,299
security plan if you've never heard of
the system security plan and i encourage

497
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,230
you to go out of every website and
download the template if you're

498
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,070
interested in a gram that probably be
your first step that i would recommend

499
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:24,060
because if you if you don't like
documentation that you may want to do

500
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,820
something else

501
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,200
it's a very long document but it will
give you an idea of some of the areas

502
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,240
that will be involved obviously involved
in audit but all

503
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,640
bigger than an idea of that of the
document that you have to create systems

504
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,410
utilize range anywhere in the range of I
think the template is about 400 pages

505
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:44,890
long

506
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:48,879
no information in it so it's and data
and you know you're looking at a pretty

507
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,560
pretty empty document so particular
system security plan the authentication

508
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,210
template talks about how you you tied to
the kind of data classification

509
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:04,000
government-level 5199 control
information summary

510
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,510
these are all in for me these are all
the templates that are provided by the

511
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:11,410
FedRAMP PMO and they all deal with
helping you to sort of put your date and

512
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:15,670
have buckets and define our date is laid
out in your environment and then to find

513
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,390
your controls how you control it out of
your apartment and you would put them in

514
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:23,830
these templates and you provided as part
of your body results when you automated

515
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:34,450
to Europe auditor ok alright so pass the
certification there are two different

516
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,919
paths for organizations that are
interested in certification ones agency

517
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,160
sponsorship and the other one is a joint
authorization board the jet that we

518
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,000
mentioned earlier so let's talk about
agency sponsorship and then we'll talk

519
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,570
about you have to draw the distinction
between the two HD sponsorship requires

520
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:56,859
review on it but it doesn't it doesn't
require your readiness assessment

521
00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:00,759
it's not an absolute requirements it's
highly recommended but you don't have to

522
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,619
do it you go down agency

523
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:08,140
ok very certification applies only to
the agency that is the sponsor so if the

524
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,339
Department of Homeland Security decides
they want to sponsor a company and they

525
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,750
go down the agency path then when that
company gets their certification it only

526
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:20,320
lasted Department of Homeland Security
doesn't want any other agency in the US

527
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,800
that's gonna be a difference from that
between that and in jazz additional

528
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,930
agencies can review previously submitted
documentation so if another agency like

529
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,850
HS decides they want to use that same
tool that the HS

530
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:40,230
reason they can go out and pull that
that cloud service providers package and

531
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,440
review it and they can improve
themselves and they want to use it but

532
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,730
they start to go down their own approval
processes individual process for each

533
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:51,660
organization if you're looking at it
from the FedRAMP agency or from the

534
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:58,560
agency sponsorship hello CSB's work
directly with the agency so this fashion

535
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,340
pass the certification what that means
is that instead of working through the

536
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,270
jab

537
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,600
I'm going through kind of the whole
gamut of everything that you have to

538
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,230
review if you work with an agency agents
you decide that they don't want to

539
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,560
they're not interested in a certain
security level more certain security

540
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,820
component they can say you know what
doesn't want our agency we don't care

541
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,800
about it like pitt cars we don't have a
card if you don't have cars and you know

542
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,310
that maybe a an issue another agency but
it's not an issue for us we're going to

543
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,930
go ahead and move forward with you

544
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,779
we're going to conditionally approved
based on the fact that you have gift

545
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,190
cards when you go to Carly and all the
future so the agency in this case has a

546
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:38,940
lot of latitude to decide what they want
to accept as far as risk for their

547
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,760
agency that's basically what it comes
down to

548
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,930
so if you're if you're going down this
path and you have an agency then you're

549
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:49,500
probably work very closely with the days
where your security requirements going

550
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,300
to be and again in an agency is working
with you they can move that process a

551
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,210
lot faster because they're going to be
the ones going to be reviewing your

552
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,510
packages initially never make
recommendations to send it to the

553
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:04,890
Japanese any additional review forward
so that this can be a much faster path

554
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:10,950
to certification but the downside is
that it only apostle Dez that's response

555
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:16,859
alright okay let's compare that to the
the job of the joint authorization board

556
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:22,230
path the jabhat requires to the
readiness assessment report and review

557
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,680
or audit both to be completed so there's
no show

558
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,578
as far as readiness assessment you have
to do it if you're interested in a jab

559
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:33,890
one of the reasons why you have to do
both obviously is that federal education

560
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:38,990
plus all federal agencies so once you're
done certification through the jab your

561
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:42,618
your company can do business with any
federal agency that participates in the

562
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:48,500
program . okay no restrictions as
agencies or anything like that it's out

563
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,660
later they decide they want to use it
then they have optimization once the

564
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,660
FedRAMP certification packages submitted
the FedRAMP PMO makes the determination

565
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:01,308
of the submitted package qualifies for
certification evaluation

566
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:06,740
ok so this is a gotcha for the FedRAMP
over the joint authorization board if

567
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,828
your company you want to do business and
you go to this pass you say i'm going to

568
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:14,869
go ahead and jab happen every agency to
be able to use my tool one widget you

569
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:19,730
have to make sure that you have at least
a decent level of interest in the

570
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:24,380
federal government level or the agency
level so that when they go those agency

571
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,309
go talk to the FedRAMP certification for
the FedRAMP PMO even if they're not

572
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:30,140
looking sponsor you

573
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,629
it has to be that level of interest
because the bedroom p.m. i know they

574
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,859
have the ability to say you know you
have you have a fantastic tool will have

575
00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:39,950
three agencies are interested only have
one agency that's interested in it so

576
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:43,430
we're not going to waste our time going
through and certified you're told

577
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:46,250
because you don't have enough agencies
that are interested nigga say we're just

578
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,970
gonna pick you and we'll look at you in
six months we'll look at you in a year

579
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:53,868
look at you never so that's that's
something that you have to think about

580
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:59,299
so that's not really a federal agency
thing that's kind of more of a your

581
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:02,390
company thing you know working with your
business development folks to make sure

582
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,509
that you have that level of interest
developed so that when you go and you

583
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:09,710
submit your package to the fabric to the
to the jab the jab knows that they're

584
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,770
interested out their agencies may your
man

585
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,940
relationship with the agency to agency
may go with you say ok you know we have

586
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:21,260
four agencies within our agencies that
are interested in and these in your

587
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,040
package and let's let's talk about how
we get these guys to process without

588
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,940
even without the meeting your sponsor
that does that make sense to everybody

589
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:34,160
that that's an important thing that done
that there that's one of the things that

590
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,509
they're looking at trying to fix that so
that organizations don't start this

591
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:41,510
process can happen through it and find
out that they don't have enough interest

592
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:46,610
to be able to really complete the rest
of the evaluation by the jab because you

593
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:50,330
know you can imagine you spent 250
thousand dollars on it you know you

594
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:54,740
spend $300,000 implement technology get
all the way to answer the last part you

595
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,520
submit everything in favorite Jam
letting go you know

596
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,240
yeah yeah it's nice but nobody's
interested in doing it so we have

597
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,450
limited snap we're not look at it then
that's probably not going to go over

598
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:09,290
very well with the organization so
looking at trying to figure out ways to

599
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:13,880
be able to fix that so that everything
is submitted can be evaluated right now

600
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:20,030
it is a cute they have a cucumber
involve you and if you don't qualify you

601
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,880
don't qualify then you know that you
know you're not going to get evaluated

602
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,670
and CS work directly last bullet with
favorite pmo enjoy authorization board

603
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:33,560
to achieve certification so you work
directly with people you work with an

604
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:39,320
agency and that's what you need to do
for certification any questions only

605
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:47,840
alright so key takeaway points Father's
Day presents some unique challenges but

606
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,620
it's it's a technology that we've kind
of grown accustomed to we know that it's

607
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,290
going to be something that's not going
to go away it's something we use

608
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:58,400
everyday traditional security models
that we are typically used to

609
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,180
implementing it out of old four walls
really don't cover all of security

610
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,569
requirements around while it's different
cloud is a different environment we just

611
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:10,430
have to adjust ourselves to continue to
do that and we have to adopt . this

612
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,160
practice in

613
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,160
let's make it happen security best
practices that are specific club's

614
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,240
security organizations that are
interested in expanding their marks of

615
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,359
the federal government bedroom is a
program that you should be looking at

616
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,710
right now okay that may change in the
future but right now it's the best

617
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:30,240
option out there or repeatable processes
is with federal agencies looking at the

618
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,609
mandate have it is what really kind
provides that that standards around

619
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:40,410
language approach tools checklist and
best practices so even even if you're

620
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:45,149
not looking to go to the file right nail
as far as from the federal perspective I

621
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,840
still encouraging problem mr. hundred
fifty three stages look at the FedRAMP

622
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,410
requirements because it only can help
your organization you if you're doing

623
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:59,100
any kind of business in ok alright my
report comes to the conclusion that

624
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,740
cloud technology is of no use of this
company

625
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:05,640
uploaded to dropbox so you can take a
look at my favorite

626
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:09,540
yes that's it everybody uses it

627
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:14,160
we all kind of denying people say that
you know has a bit but we all we all

628
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,799
have our lives in the club whether you
want to or not

629
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,800
