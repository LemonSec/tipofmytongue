us to talk about the evolution

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,759
and end point deduction and response

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,280
so over to you i'm miss arti

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,000

having me today i'm excited to be here

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,479
so give me one second to share

45
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,840
my screen

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,920
can everybody see my screen okay yes we

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,960
can see your screen

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,000
okay great all right um so today

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,959
i'm going to be talking about um

50
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:11,680
endpoint

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,200
detection and response right so um

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,239
endpoint detection and response edr as

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:18,959
we call it

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,160
right um is the technology

55
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,080
that is responsible for keeping your

56
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,440
machine safe from malware from breaches

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,720
right so um crowdstrike right where i

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,360
work

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
um we've built a number of great

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
products in the cyber security domain

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,720
but uh edr um is our

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
signature our flagship uh product that

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,959
we pioneered more than a decade ago

64
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,160
uh to protect uh computers from always

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,560
right

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,840
so today um over the next um

67
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,959
uh hour or so um i'm going to be sort of

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,239
um walking everyone through the journey

69
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,280
of um edr as it started

70
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,879
from antivirus up up until

71
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,239
uh next generation edr right

72
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,280
so um very quickly um

73
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,879
this is what we're going to be looking

74
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,480
at today um

75
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,239
so we'll start off by looking at

76
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,080
antivirus software

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,480
then we look at why there was a need for

78
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,360
edr

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,040
right um we'll look at uh what edr

80
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,200
is how it works what are some of the

81
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,480
strategic principles

82
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,879
uh behind edr and then we'll wrap up

83
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,640
with um the future

84
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,239
of edr right um okay

85
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,360
so i imagine that uh

86
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,239
most people in this room um would be

87
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:42,879
familiar

88
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,360
with antivirus right we've all used it

89
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,560
uh the big vendors

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,760
in this space um are semantic and mcafee

91
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,680
right um but to basically understand edr

92
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,400
and why

93
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,959
it was needed um we first sort of need

94
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:57,680
to go back

95
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,640
in time um rewind a little bit uh to

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,519
look at

97
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,640
um antivirus right um

98
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,360
so um this is probably going to be a

99
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,959
quick refresher for

100
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,040
um those of us that are familiar with

101
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,640
antivirus already right

102
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
um so essentially antivirus right uh

103
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,199
similar to edr

104
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,839
is meant to protect your computer right

105
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,720
from malware

106
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,320
right that's the end goal and so um

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,160
how does antivirus do this right so

108
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,040
imagine that i'm downloading a file

109
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,680
on my computer but before i run this

110
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,919
file or before i open this file

111
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,720
uh antivirus would kick in to make sure

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,919
that my file is safe

113
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,199
to run right if my file is

114
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,240
saved it is allowed to um be opened or

115
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,440
executed right

116
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,120
but if av finds my file to be infected

117
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,360
then it would either quarantine my file

118
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,800
it would delete my file

119
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,560
and basically block my file from running

120
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,479
right um

121
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,479
so uh how does av actually work

122
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,720
under the hood right so um

123
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,759
basically what the antivirus software is

124
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,560
doing

125
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,680
it's looking for indicators of

126
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,199
compromise or iocs as we call them

127
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,720
right so what are these iocs

128
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,840
right so iocs

129
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,199
are basically unique identifiers

130
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,240
for malware right um

131
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,000
each malware has a unique set

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,280
of iocs associated with it so you can

133
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,080
think of these

134
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,840
as traces of evidence that the malware

135
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,199
leaves behind when it runs right almost

136
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,080
like a smoking gun right that you would

137
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,479
uh

138
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,639
find at the scene of a murder iocs are

139
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,240
somewhat similar

140
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,520
so ioc iocs for example it they could be

141
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,639
file names

142
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,000
they could be um file hashes right

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,240
these are files that the malware for

144
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,160
example would create on disk when it

145
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,960
runs

146
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,720
or um an ioc could be an ip address

147
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,080
of um basically

148
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,800
a network connection right that the

149
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,680
malware

150
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,520
is setting up right or an ioc could be a

151
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,880
domain name again that the

152
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,720
malware is establishing a connection to

153
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,160
right so some um

154
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
basic examples of iocs so um

155
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,560
what the av vendors do they are the

156
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,840
authority

157
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,199
on all of the known malwares out there

158
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,479
in the world right

159
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,600
so they keep a

160
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,880
database of all the known malwares

161
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,080
as well as their associated iocs right

162
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,479
and they work hard at keeping this

163
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,240
database up to date as you can imagine

164
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,280
it's a hard job

165
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,039
to keep track of all the possible

166
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,199
malwares but there is a database

167
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,880
that is tracking all of these malwares

168
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,400
and their iocs right

169
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,759
so when my file is about to be executed

170
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,039
on my machine

171
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,080
and av's job is to make sure that it is

172
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,720
safe to execute what the av does is it

173
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,440
checks

174
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,639
um this files ioc against

175
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,560
its database of all known iocs of all

176
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:14,960
known

177
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,199
malwares right and it checks to see if

178
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,960
my files ioc exists

179
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,160
in this database right if the ioc

180
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,039
exists that means that my file is bad

181
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,000
it's corrupt

182
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,800
it's infected so av should block it from

183
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,880
running if the ioc is not found

184
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,880
my file is good to go right um

185
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,639
so again this is just sort of a

186
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,240
pictorial um

187
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,039
view of what i just talked about right

188
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,240
um

189
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,319
so i have a file i've downloaded this

190
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,919
file let's say from the internet i'm not

191
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,479
sure

192
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,639
if this is a good file or not right so i

193
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,160
ask av to do a scan

194
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,280
of my file right so what av does is

195
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,639
it computes a hash

196
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,240
of my um file right so

197
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,759
um the hash is um essentially

198
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,639
um a unique signature for my file right

199
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,039
every

200
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,319
file would have a unique um

201
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,759
hash and um this hash

202
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,960
for the file is checked against

203
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,479
the um ioc database that that av vendor

204
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,879
has

205
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,240
built right um if that ioc

206
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,599
is found that means

207
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,520
that this file is bad right if the ioc

208
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,479
is not found in the database then per

209
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,519
the av

210
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,679
this file is a good file right

211
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,080
and i can execute that file right if the

212
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,440
file is bad

213
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,600
then av would either quarantine that

214
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,480
file

215
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,880
or it would basically uh delete that

216
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,920
file altogether

217
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,279
right all right

218
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,760
so um so we looked at how

219
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,120
um avs work right and

220
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,959
um avs um were

221
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,240
a good first step back when they were

222
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,959
invented

223
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,040
somewhere in the 1990s in protecting

224
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,480
uh users machines from um malwares right

225
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,519
so they did

226
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,640
well in the first few years right but as

227
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,120
you can

228
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,680
imagine um av uh solutions have obvious

229
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,279
limitations right um and basically av

230
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,080
solutions

231
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,640
could not keep pace with increasingly

232
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,680
sophisticated

233
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,959
attacks right so um hackers uh

234
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,680
found it increasingly easy to bypass to

235
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,240
evade

236
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,040
uh the av software right um so we look

237
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,760
at

238
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,640
what some of these limitations are that

239
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,240
made avs vulnerable

240
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,080
to attacks right so um first off

241
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,360
um avs by the nature of uh

242
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,680
the way they operate they are reactive

243
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,120
right so you have to have

244
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,680
um seen that malware before you need to

245
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,440
have that malware present in your

246
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,240
database

247
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,560
of known malwares and only then would

248
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,360
the av

249
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,360
catch a particular malware right

250
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,800
because they are reactive avs cannot

251
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,600
guard against zero-day malwares right so

252
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
what is a zero-day malware

253
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,640
it is a piece of

254
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,680
malicious code that has previously not

255
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,519
been seen or previously

256
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,160
not known to the av software which means

257
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,279
that that malware

258
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,560
is not in the database of malware

259
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,000
signatures or iocs

260
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,279
as we call them right um so if

261
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,760
my file is infected with a zero day

262
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,560
malware

263
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,440
av is not going to detect or prevent

264
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,320
this malware

265
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,360
right um so um i think

266
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,680
recent research shows that um

267
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,720
a majority of um

268
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,920
malware um are um

269
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
basically zero-day malware right so avs

270
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,519
fail um miserably

271
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,519
in this regard right um and then uh avs

272
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,160
cannot

273
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,000
guard against self-modifying um malwares

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,640
right so over the years malwares

275
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,760
themselves became

276
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,640
increasingly sophisticated so we now

277
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,760
have malwares

278
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,519
that can self-modify their signature or

279
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,560
their iocs

280
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,079
right as they jump from machine to

281
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,560
machine so which means that

282
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,079
the malware has multiple

283
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,200
associated signatures or ioc against it

284
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,120
which makes it difficult to track in the

285
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,480
database right so

286
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,279
avs don't do a good job with self

287
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,000
modifying

288
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,839
malwares and then uh lastly

289
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,600
um the avs don't

290
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,639
do well with fileless malware right

291
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,920
um fileless malwares are those

292
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,040
that do not um need to

293
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,079
write a file right on the user's machine

294
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,839
to actually sort of infect the machine

295
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,639
and propagate

296
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,959
right these are file lists and by

297
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,079
definition

298
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,519
avs work on um file based

299
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,000
malwares right av needs a file that it

300
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,880
can

301
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,760
create an ioc for look up this ioc in

302
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
its database check if that file

303
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,680
mark that file as good or bad right so

304
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,000
if there is no file for the malware

305
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
what is the av going to do essentially

306
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,120
nothing right

307
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,880
um so because of these limitations right

308
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,920
there was a need for

309
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,560
a better solution that could actually

310
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,440
work

311
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,720
to protect a user's computer right

312
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,839
so this is where um endpoint

313
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,880
detection and response edr

314
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,160
came in okay so uh edr

315
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,600
was um pioneered by crowdstrike

316
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,680
um about 10 years ago to in 2011

317
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,720
starting 2011 to be precise

318
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,480
um in response to overcoming

319
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,200
some of the limitations of av as we saw

320
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,000
right

321
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,279
so uh the goal of edr

322
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,839
is exactly the same as the goal of av

323
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,680
the goal is to protect

324
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,160
a user's machine from bandwidth right

325
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,440
the approach

326
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,959
that edr takes to solve this problem

327
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,880
is very different from the approach from

328
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,560
the ioc based approach

329
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,600
that uh av takes right so

330
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,959
um edr uh solutions we'll talk about

331
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,720
what how exactly they go about

332
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,959
uh solving this problem but at a very

333
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,920
high level

334
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,079
edr uses a signature less approach or an

335
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:44,720
ioc

336
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,079
less approach to detecting malware right

337
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,040
now um so um basically we'll

338
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,399
cover how evr works what over here

339
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,399
um we'll look at some of the strategic

340
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,600
principles that an edr

341
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,800
solution employs right i'll go into more

342
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,959
details in further slides but

343
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,360
to touch upon this right now basically

344
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,720
edrs right the way they detect malware

345
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,480
right is by looking at indicators

346
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,839
of attack io is not

347
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,720
indicators of compromise or iocs right

348
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,399
we'll talk about what i was are

349
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,760
right number two right the principles

350
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,160
that edr works on the focus is on

351
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,360
providing visibility into

352
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,560
all of the activity that is happening on

353
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,320
the user's machine on the endpoint

354
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,760
machine we'll talk about why

355
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,639
visibility is so important um and why um

356
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,800
edr is based on this principle of

357
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,680
providing

358
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,880
visibility right and then um

359
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,720
last um edr

360
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,360
believes in keeping humans in the loop

361
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,800
right so the fight

362
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,000
is um humans and machines

363
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,720
are together uh fighting other humans

364
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,320
the adversary right it's

365
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,240
um good humans are fighting the bad

366
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,000
humans together with machines right

367
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,040
unlike av

368
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,760
where machines are single-handedly

369
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,560
fighting

370
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,040
um the adversaries right

371
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,240
okay uh so now let's sort of dig into

372
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,639
these

373
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,720
principles a little deeper and really

374
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,920
understand what they mean

375
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,040
so um

376
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,040
what are ioas right um

377
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,160
so ios stand for

378
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,279
indicators of attack right

379
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,720
ios are the means by which um

380
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,160
an edr solution would detect a malware

381
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,360
right if you remember av solutions

382
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,480
use iocs or static signatures

383
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,519
to detect malware

384
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,959
ios use io

385
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,240
i'm sorry edr uses uh ios right

386
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,360
um so ios are essentially

387
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,160
behavioral patterns that indicate

388
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,959
suspicious

389
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,440
behavior right that indicate malicious

390
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,240
activity

391
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,880
so uh edr looks for behaviors not static

392
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,160
signatures right

393
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,519
um which means that edr solutions

394
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,600
because they're looking for behaviors

395
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,560
uh bad behavior are more proactive than

396
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,920
av solutions

397
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,240
because av solutions are essentially

398
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,839
looking for static signatures and that

399
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,040
makes them

400
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,880
reactive right um

401
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,720
okay so now we'll look at um

402
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,800
some of the differences um between ios

403
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,639
and iocs and how they solve this problem

404
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,759
of detecting

405
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,880
malware um differently right and how ios

406
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:05,839
ios are more effective than iocs

407
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,679
all right so to understand um how

408
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,119
ios and iocs work we'll

409
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,919
look at a physical uh real world

410
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:16,640
scenario

411
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,039
right and try to understand how ios and

412
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,240
iocs would have

413
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,799
um approach this problem differently

414
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,119
right so imagine that

415
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,160
you have a robber who is planning

416
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,520
uh and executing a robbery at a bank

417
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,720
right so uh before

418
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,280
the robber actually robs the bank he

419
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,360
does reconnaissance on the bank right

420
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,400
maybe he

421
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,799
visits makes a few visits a few days

422
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,520
prior

423
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,240
he sort of circles around the bank to

424
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,799
find

425
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,280
multiple entry points he tries to figure

426
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,120
out where the security systems are

427
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,000
located

428
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,919
right and then on the day of the robbery

429
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,000
on the night of the robbery rather

430
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,120
the robber arrives in his um car

431
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,559
right um he disables the uh security

432
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,520
alarms

433
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,039
and he breaks into the bank

434
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,440
proceeds to go to the vault where all of

435
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,720
the money is stored

436
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,039
he cracks open the wall and um

437
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,400
makes his way with the loot that he's um

438
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,919
uh gathered from the wall right now

439
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,360
um so this is the scenario and if um

440
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
let's see how we would basically detect

441
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,120
and prevent this robbery

442
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,120
if we were to use um ioses

443
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,960
right so iocs if i'm using

444
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,919
an ioc based approach i would basically

445
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:40,840
be looking for

446
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,880
evidence um of a robbery happening

447
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,720
based on uh previous cc tv footage that

448
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,440
i have

449
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,360
of a similar robbery that has taken

450
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,559
place right

451
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,400
um so i would let's say look for a signs

452
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,760
that somebody comes to the bank

453
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,799
um driving a mahindra jeep okay or

454
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,120
i would say that a man has entered the

455
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,360
bank and he's wearing a mumbai indians

456
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,320
t-shirt

457
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,559
right um or uh i would say that

458
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,039
somebody has broken open the wall using

459
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,799
a drill and liquid nitrogen

460
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,640
right now as you can probably figure

461
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,000
all of these are sort of very brittle or

462
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,280
sort of unreliable approaches to

463
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,039
detecting the robbery right because

464
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,120
if the robber let's say doesn't arrive

465
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,039
in a mahindra jeep but he's using

466
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,440
some other suv for example my ioc is

467
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,240
going to fail

468
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,160
or if he has a different if he wears a

469
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,600
shirt not a t-shirt my

470
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,480
ioc is going to fail and if he uses

471
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,600
basically

472
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,400
a different modis operandi to break into

473
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,280
the bank

474
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
uh my ioc is not going to catch him

475
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,120
because my ioc was looking at previous

476
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,200
cctv footage and figuring out what

477
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,960
the um what his sort of modis operandi

478
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,480
is

479
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,600
now if ioc ioas

480
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,799
are to basically

481
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,760
detect and prevent this robbery how

482
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,679
would they go about doing it right

483
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,200
so an ioa as i

484
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,240
mentioned earlier is looking for

485
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,280
suspicious behavior right which makes it

486
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,400
more sort of

487
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,679
robust right so um examples of

488
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,039
suspicious behavior

489
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,880
in this case would be let's say there is

490
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,200
a car which is circling around the bank

491
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
multiple times right

492
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,400
that's clearly suspicious or another

493
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,760
unidentified person

494
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,080
is entering the bank at night right it's

495
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,600
not a security guard it's not an

496
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,960
employee of the bank so who's this

497
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,799
person entering the bank at night

498
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,159
or it could uh another ioa could be that

499
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,080
the vault is not being opened using a

500
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,679
combination lock it's being

501
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,840
basically broken open right so all of

502
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,440
these are suspicious behaviors

503
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,960
that um basically um are not really

504
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,360
reliant on a particular modus operandi

505
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,120
they are more sort of generic they're

506
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,799
more robust right

507
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,320
so um now uh

508
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,679
mapping um coming to a sort of

509
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,799
more um cyber security

510
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,799
scenario of how ios and iocs

511
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,159
would work differently right

512
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,000
so um this is a um example

513
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,039
of a phishing attack right

514
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,159
um so you have an email

515
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,039
a phishing email that is sent let's say

516
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,159
to a user

517
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,679
the email says that

518
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,400
you need to pay up your mobile bill

519
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,000
immediately if you need your

520
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,240
if you want your service to continue

521
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,600
right so

522
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,640
um and then that mail has an attachment

523
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,840
for an invoice

524
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,799
um and it prompts the mail prompts the

525
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,440
user

526
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,919
to open that particular invoice to pay

527
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:56,799
pay that bill

528
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,080
to settle their views right so um there

529
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,760
is a word document attachment

530
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,679
in that email right which is which is

531
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,120
basically uh

532
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,520
that word document is infected with

533
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,559
malware right

534
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,880
so imagine that the user opens this

535
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,840
particular

536
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,039
attachment invoice attachment and

537
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,679
um let's say they go ahead and enable

538
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,799
macros

539
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,360
on their word document right which means

540
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,080
that

541
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,080
the malware code which is basically um

542
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,360
wrapped up as a macro would execute

543
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
on this word document right as soon as i

544
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,039
enable macros

545
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,559
and this bad code would then

546
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,760
proceeds to fetch a script right from a

547
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,600
command and control center

548
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,799
um in uh china all right so

549
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,280
uh this script is basically downloaded

550
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,720
onto my user's machine

551
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
right um this is the user that received

552
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,919
the email the the script is downloaded

553
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,760
on my user's machine

554
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,159
it's a powershell script which is then

555
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,280
executed

556
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,400
um on my machine right

557
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,760
now um basically

558
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,960
this powershell script then

559
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,320
essentially ends up stealing and

560
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,880
exfiltrating data from this user's

561
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,520
machine

562
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,320
to the command and control center in

563
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,280
china right

564
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,880
so the the hacker has succeeded

565
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,320
in um his objective of uh stealing data

566
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,440
from a user's machine

567
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,400
right this is the scenario now how would

568
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,360
um

569
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,480
the iocs and ios

570
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,720
help in preventing this particular

571
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,000
attack right

572
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,480
if i was using iocs again because they

573
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,880
they are static they are signature based

574
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,360
they would look uh we would create iocs

575
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,159
based on

576
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,360
um evidence uh based on previous such

577
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,640
phishing attacks right

578
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,440
so for example my ioc would say that i

579
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,080
know that

580
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,520
um an attack is underway underway if i

581
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,120
um see an email with the subject

582
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,559
immediate payment requested right or

583
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,360
um and another ioc could be if an email

584
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,279
comes in with the attachment

585
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,559
uh name invoicefund.doc

586
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,279
or the ioc would know the file hash

587
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,440
of the word document attachment right

588
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,880
and it could check to see if this word

589
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,240
document that i received

590
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,960
is this has the same file hash right now

591
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,000
as you can imagine

592
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,440
again it's very easy to basically tweak

593
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,640
the modis operandi and evade the ioc

594
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,159
right i could change the email subject

595
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,039
very easily

596
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,159
i could change the name of the

597
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,880
attachment right and i could just

598
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,720
tweak maybe the content of that word

599
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,000
document

600
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,240
and change my file hash so that i could

601
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,200
escape

602
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,279
detection for my av system because the

603
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,640
av uses iocs

604
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
it becomes very easy to bypass these

605
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,320
iocs

606
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,600
so how would ioa then work to

607
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,600
prevent this particular

608
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,960
attack right so the ios right they would

609
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,720
look for um behavioral patterns

610
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,360
suspicious behaviors right um so in this

611
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,000
case

612
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,360
uh suspicious behavior would be

613
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,120
a windows process right um

614
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,880
because so you op because if you

615
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,400
remember in the scenario

616
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,279
there was a word uh attachment right the

617
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,440
user clicked on that word attachment

618
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,039
and then as soon as that word document

619
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,520
was opened the macro inside of that word

620
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,240
document

621
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,039
launched a powershell process right so

622
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,760
if you look at the process chain

623
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,360
the windows word process

624
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,520
is launching a powershell process which

625
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,679
is clearly a suspicious behavior it's

626
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,120
anomalous behavior because this

627
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,640
typically does not happen

628
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,960
um in in good scenarios right

629
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,000
so if windows word is launching a

630
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
powershell process it's bad behavior

631
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,520
that and that would be

632
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,640
basically be modeled as an ioa or

633
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,480
if um my edr technology

634
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,760
detects uh unusual network connections

635
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,039
from my user's

636
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,120
machine to to a server in china which is

637
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,360
basically the command and control center

638
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
then it would flag it could flag it as

639
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,039
anomalous behavior because

640
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,520
this user typically does not ever

641
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,039
connect to

642
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,000
any machine in china right so ios are

643
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,039
more robust because

644
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,679
they are looking for behaviors not file

645
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,320
names

646
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,679
or file hashes okay

647
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,960
now um some

648
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,960
um example uh some more example ios that

649
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,240
typically edr technologies would look

650
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,880
for

651
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,000
right to detect malware so the first one

652
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,279
we talked about um so it's basically if

653
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,240
windows uh document is launching

654
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,360
powershell right

655
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,720
that's an example or if a pd when i open

656
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,000
a pdf file

657
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,880
that causes a call to a remote server

658
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,760
right

659
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,120
or if my internet explorer

660
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,000
process is launching a command shell on

661
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,039
a windows machine

662
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,159
right all indications of malicious

663
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,200
activity or

664
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,080
if for example notepad right process is

665
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,600
spawning a child process which ideally

666
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,720
should never happen

667
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,080
if a notepad is working correctly right

668
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,000
so these are just some examples there

669
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,679
are plenty more

670
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,240
that exist all right now um

671
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,840
uh how does um this slide basically

672
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,120
shows um the differences

673
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,480
in approach between again iocs and

674
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,520
um ios right so

675
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,039
um iocs are looking for

676
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,320
point in time evidence of an attack

677
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,159
right um it's the like the proverbial

678
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,640
smoking gun at the scene of a murder

679
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,919
right these are

680
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,399
uh traces of evidence that the malware

681
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,679
has left behind for you

682
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,520
for example it could be file name file

683
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,679
hashes registry keys

684
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,039
ip addresses right the ios

685
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,960
on the other hand they are looking for

686
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,200
suspicious behaviors right because they

687
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,520
need to look for suspicious behavior

688
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,799
they need to record all behavior

689
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,000
or all activity that is happening

690
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,039
on the endpoint users machine

691
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,159
right so um they are providing

692
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,520
a real-time view of all of the activity

693
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,399
that is happening

694
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,679
on the user's machine so in that regard

695
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,559
you can think of

696
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,760
ios as a flight data recorder which is

697
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
basically recording all activity

698
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,080
inside of a cockpit right

699
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,000
all right now um

700
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,399
coming to the um second

701
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,840
principle of edr which is

702
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,840
provide visibility of all activity

703
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,760
that is happening on my um

704
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,840
endpoint machine right so this is the

705
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,039
user's machine

706
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,799
on which uh edr is meant to protect from

707
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,440
malware

708
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,799
so edr focuses on providing visibility

709
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,039
on that machine so we'll see why it's so

710
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:23,919
important

711
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,120
to provide visibility right

712
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,799
why is this one of the cornerstone

713
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,320
principles of

714
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,360
edr right

715
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,279
so um edr right

716
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,320
unlike av is built

717
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,520
on the assumption that it's hard

718
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,799
if not impossible to always stay ahead

719
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,840
of the bad guys

720
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,480
right so um basically um

721
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,320
edr acknowledges that it is

722
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,840
not possible hundred percent of the

723
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,000
times to prevent all attacks right this

724
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,559
is it's

725
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,120
it's simply an unattainable goal right a

726
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,640
more realistic goal

727
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,520
is to make the job harder for the

728
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,240
attackers

729
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,080
right um so unlike av in av

730
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,159
the end objective is i should prevent

731
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,520
hundred percent of attacks

732
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,720
edr says i should

733
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,679
record everything that i see i should

734
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,520
focus on providing visibility

735
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,720
right um and i can make a best

736
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,880
um attempt to detect malwares

737
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,440
and prevent them right but if i cannot

738
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,600
detect and prevent malwares i should at

739
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,240
least

740
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,880
have visibility on the machine so i can

741
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,760
sort of

742
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,000
after the fact at least detect the

743
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,600
malware after the attack has happened i

744
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,120
can detect the malware

745
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,960
and i can uh sort of take corrective

746
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,240
action right so um uh

747
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,440
basically this since edr

748
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,360
is based on the underlying assumption

749
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,640
that all preventions

750
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,720
and detections are not possible the

751
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,240
visib what edr

752
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,600
does is um it collects all of the data

753
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,519
all of the events that are happening on

754
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,120
a user's machine

755
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,200
and sends that to a central place we'll

756
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,640
see how that works

757
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,919
it sends it to a central place so that

758
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,919
humans have visibility into all of the

759
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,840
activity happening on the user's machine

760
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,480
right

761
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,960
when humans have visibility they can

762
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,159
basically

763
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,200
improve um

764
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,159
the base the system right you can have

765
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,159
basically a feedback loop

766
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,039
where humans can do threat hunting on

767
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,799
the data that has been collected they

768
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,240
can manually investigate

769
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,279
the data that has been collected

770
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,640
they can figure out detections they can

771
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,720
do incident response and provide this

772
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,440
feedback

773
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,440
to the system that look you missed this

774
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
particular detection and prevention and

775
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,519
then this is how you can automatically

776
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,440
um detect and prevent the next time

777
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,559
around right so it's basically a

778
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,360
continuous

779
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,840
feedback cycle going on because you have

780
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,960
visibility

781
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,080
right also basically um

782
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,519
visibility helps humans to

783
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,760
uh basically uh do forensic

784
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,600
investigations after an attack has

785
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,080
happened

786
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,519
right uh figure piece together

787
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,080
at the activity timeline how exactly did

788
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,120
the

789
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,600
attacker get into the system what were

790
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,200
his entry points what is his modus

791
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,000
operandi

792
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,919
right where is command and control all

793
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,120
of that information

794
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,519
can be pieced together because edr

795
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,000
provides visibility to humans

796
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,600
right um now to meet

797
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,960
the goal of visibility right um

798
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,559
edr products make use of a cloud

799
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,200
native architecture right so um

800
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,679
we look at what the cloud native

801
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:48,559
architectures

802
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,360
are right um so basically

803
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,240
what is a cloud native architecture and

804
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,120
how does

805
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,159
cloud native architecture uh help edr

806
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:00,640
why

807
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,080
edr systems use cloud native right um

808
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,679
so from day one ebr products

809
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,960
were built for the cloud unlike av right

810
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,039
um i think i imagine that most people

811
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,240
are familiar with

812
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
cloud right but essentially what that

813
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,919
means is that

814
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,279
the edr system is um

815
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,440
running outside of the customer's

816
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,799
environment right it's running in the

817
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:25,440
cloud

818
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,600
obviously you need some sort of an agent

819
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,200
or a sensor which is running on the

820
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,320
user's machine

821
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,600
in the customer's environment but the

822
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,360
sort of the data collection the

823
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,200
processing the storage

824
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,799
um is all running in the cloud right um

825
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,039
why would an edr um lay so much stress

826
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,440
on being cloud native right so

827
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,919
essentially when you're cloud native

828
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,279
that means that you can sort of

829
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,480
very easily scale to handle

830
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,519
petabyte scale data right now because

831
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,480
edrs are essentially flight data

832
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,240
recorders they are collecting

833
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,080
all possible information on the user's

834
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,079
machine there is tons of data to be

835
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,320
collected right so imagine millions of

836
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,440
users machines are sending data for

837
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,679
processing and storage you need the

838
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,918
cloud to be able to basically handle

839
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:18,879
this kind of scale

840
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,440
um and to be able and also the cloud

841
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,639
then provides

842
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,560
elasticity and uh scalability right so

843
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,560
if i have increased traffic because i've

844
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,918
added new um

845
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,440
machines that i need to basically

846
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,280
monitor um or

847
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,320
if my endpoint machine starts sending um

848
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,839
uh many factor many magnitudes of

849
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,199
data more right um the cloud can very

850
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:43,760
easily

851
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,280
scale to handle um the increased load

852
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,719
right now uh

853
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,239
so this is sort of a 10 000 foot view

854
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,359
of the crowd strike um architecture

855
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,800
right uh for our edr system right uh

856
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,160
so you have um two pieces essentially

857
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,640
right on the left you have the customers

858
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,359
environment

859
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,960
right these are customers paying

860
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,880
customers of crowdstrike who have

861
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,320
uh paid for the crowdstrike product

862
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,400
to protect their users machines from

863
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,240
albany right and on the right you have

864
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,520
the cloud platform

865
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,240
uh the crowdstrike cloud platform right

866
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,480
so you have these crowdstrike sensors

867
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,240
um running on the users machines the

868
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,920
job of the sensor uh is to act like a

869
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,839
flight data recorder collect

870
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,480
uh all events all activity happening on

871
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,680
this user's machine

872
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,760
send it to to the cloud for further

873
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,880
processing right so you have the

874
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,000
endpoint data

875
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,560
going into the cloud right now all of

876
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,440
this data

877
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,800
that is being collected is being um

878
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,920
stored in our threat graph

879
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,079
right um so this threat graph right

880
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,920
um is uh in many ways crowd strikes

881
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,359
secret sauce um it's um a

882
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,560
sort of a core um uh

883
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,440
foundation for um our crowdstrike

884
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,160
platform

885
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,359
and instrumental to our success as an

886
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,400
edr vendor

887
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,760
right um so um what the threat graph

888
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,560
does is it's collecting all of this data

889
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,119
that has

890
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,920
uh come in uh from the user's machines

891
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,240
and

892
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,240
it is building a graph visualization

893
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,480
of uh all of the activity happening on

894
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,359
the user's machine

895
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,560
right um so basically um

896
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,359
essentially the threat graph is building

897
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,000
process

898
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,760
chains um right so it's it's saying that

899
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,520
um process a launched process b

900
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,880
process b launch process c right these

901
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,079
process streams are um

902
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,440
what makes crowdstrike so strong at

903
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,839
detecting and stopping malware right so

904
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:58,640
if you uh

905
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,839
uh go back to the examples that the the

906
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,200
cyber the phishing um

907
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,599
attack scenario that we were looking at

908
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,480
right um

909
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,599
where essentially a strong indicator

910
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,800
of the phishing attack was the windows

911
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,079
uh word process launching um

912
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,119
a powershell process right if this data

913
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:19,760
was fed

914
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,720
into the crowdstrike threat graph the

915
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,240
threat graph would build a process

916
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,440
change saying that

917
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,960
the word parent process launched

918
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,720
um a powershell child process right and

919
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,079
this is immediately

920
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,599
sort of um suspicious uh

921
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,599
process behavior right and it would come

922
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,720
to the attention

923
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,200
um of our security analysts right so um

924
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,599
all of these process chains are stored

925
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,040
in the threat graph

926
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,920
and you have all of this data these um

927
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,200
this graph data

928
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,240
is exposed uh in our console right in

929
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,119
our ui

930
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,560
um and our security analyst teams

931
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,440
they make use of this data to do threat

932
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,079
hunting

933
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,040
right um to basically manually look for

934
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,480
suspicious behaviors

935
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,640
to um query this data to understand how

936
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,078
attackers are working right

937
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,280
okay so um now uh

938
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,599
this slide um right has some numbers

939
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,800
that show the

940
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,599
uh power of the crowdstrike platform

941
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,320
right

942
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,359
um so this is basically

943
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,720
um as i said our cloud platform

944
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,880
is built to handle petabyte scale data

945
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,000
right so

946
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,760
every day right our threat graph

947
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,119
um sorry every day

948
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,520
uh we are processing 500 billion

949
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,640
events per day right

950
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,760
to put this in perspective whatsapp

951
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,040
processes 100 billion messages

952
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,400
a day so crowdstrike is doing 5x

953
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,760
the number of events per day our threat

954
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,560
graph

955
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,760
stores 2 trillion vertices

956
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,079
right

957
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,320
we have 25 000 breaches

958
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,520
that we um stopped uh in the last year

959
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,079
so it's

960
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,200
it's simply amazing right the the power

961
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,760
of the

962
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,960
crowdstrike uh platform right and um

963
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,280
as i'm finishing up the sentence we

964
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,119
would have processed an additional five

965
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,079
million events

966
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,320
in the time that it takes me to uh say

967
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,280
the sentence

968
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,359
um so all right uh the last principle

969
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,480
um uh for of edr

970
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,800
right um keep humans in the loop

971
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,490
right so um

972
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,480
[Music]

973
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,520
as we were basically um

974
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,640
talking about a av

975
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,680
um says that machines

976
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,480
should be fighting um the adversary

977
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,079
right

978
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,079
what edr says is that machines

979
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,680
alone cannot fight the adversaries right

980
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,319
um

981
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,599
humans are the final and

982
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,079
the best line of defense against attacks

983
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,440
right so in edr

984
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,800
uh machines and humans work together

985
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,800
to fight the adversaries right the job

986
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,720
of the machine is to make

987
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,280
the job job for humans um easier right

988
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,240
so the machines

989
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,960
they provide visibility as we saw right

990
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,400
so they are collecting all of the data

991
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,440
that they can

992
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,400
and they are working to detect and

993
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,119
prevent

994
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,040
whatever attacks they can but machines

995
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,359
cannot detect and prevent 100 of the

996
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,480
attacks that is where

997
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,520
humans come in right so humans are

998
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,200
in the loop right um to basically look

999
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,960
at all of the data collected to

1000
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,880
detect any sort of attacks that the

1001
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,560
machine has missed

1002
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,960
so for this humans are basically doing

1003
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,079
threat hunting

1004
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,599
on top of all of the data that was

1005
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,560
collected and they are also responsible

1006
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,480
for incident response right

1007
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
so um when humans are doing threat

1008
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,920
hunting they can sort of

1009
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,079
look at uh patterns that the machines

1010
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,119
may have missed on

1011
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,839
uh provide this feedback back to the

1012
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,680
machine so that the next time around

1013
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,680
the machines can do a better job at

1014
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,319
detecting um

1015
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,640
the attacks right so it's sort of like a

1016
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,920
continuous feedback

1017
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,359
uh loop right and then besides this

1018
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,400
threat hunting

1019
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,119
um humans are also involved in incident

1020
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,480
response right

1021
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,760
so um incident response

1022
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,040
is basically um what do you do

1023
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,160
when you figure out that a particular

1024
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,079
machine or a particular customer's

1025
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,160
environment has been breached right

1026
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,200
so incident response could be maybe

1027
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,680
just basically um disabling a particular

1028
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,880
user's account because that user

1029
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,520
account was used by the hacker to gain

1030
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,880
access into the system

1031
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,119
or it could be blocking a malicious ip

1032
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,720
address right or it could be

1033
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,920
quarantining a certain

1034
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,560
infected host basically isolating it

1035
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,839
from the network right all of these

1036
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:10,720
actions

1037
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,000
are what humans could take as part of

1038
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,920
incident response right

1039
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,680
okay now um summarizing

1040
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,040
what we just saw earlier right how

1041
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,160
av and edr work differently

1042
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,440
to achieve the same end goal right so

1043
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,560
um as we saw

1044
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,760
av solutions are reactive right uh

1045
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,839
they don't look for behaviors they look

1046
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,440
for static signatures like

1047
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,000
file names or file hashes right edrs on

1048
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,040
the other hand because they're looking

1049
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,079
for behaviors

1050
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,839
not a particular method of attack um

1051
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,520
are more proactive they're more

1052
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,240
fail-safe right um

1053
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,440
so avs are based on iocs while

1054
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,839
edrs are based on ios right

1055
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,359
avs are focused on preventions av does

1056
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,359
not care about providing visibility

1057
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,640
it does not care only on detecting

1058
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,839
the malware av says i want to prevent

1059
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:14,720
all my malware

1060
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,640
right that is the end goal of on the

1061
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,480
other hand edr

1062
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,680
primarily focus is on visibility and

1063
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,200
make a best

1064
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,400
attempt at detection and prevention

1065
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,560
right but as we saw humans are in the

1066
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,720
loop to do detections and preventions

1067
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,200
that

1068
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,800
um the machines cannot do right um

1069
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,720
so uh av right by definition because the

1070
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,200
system is fighting alone humans are not

1071
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:41,920
in the loop

1072
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,560
while in edr humans are in the loop to

1073
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:44,960
help

1074
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,359
to work together with the machines right

1075
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,640
okay uh now uh so we basically

1076
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,680
covered um what edr is

1077
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,160
um what are its principles right how it

1078
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:58,960
works and

1079
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,480
why it's better than av right um so

1080
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,520
um basically edr is

1081
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,079
in many ways considered as next gen

1082
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,119
antivirus

1083
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,800
essentially right um edr is slowly um

1084
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,359
and steadily displacing av solutions uh

1085
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,160
in the market

1086
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,800
right but let's quickly uh look at uh

1087
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,480
what's the road ahead

1088
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,800
for uh edr right um

1089
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,240
so uh edr right um

1090
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,920
it edr does a great job

1091
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,599
at uh basically protecting

1092
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,880
the endpoint machine right so the scope

1093
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,119
of

1094
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,880
edr is limited to the end point machine

1095
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,440
the

1096
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,960
edr the edr agent um or the sensor runs

1097
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,560
on the endpoint machine gathers all of

1098
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,720
that

1099
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,319
uh it provides visibility and

1100
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,079
tries to detect and prevent whatever it

1101
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,680
can on that machine right

1102
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,800
so all of the um sort of the the job of

1103
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,359
evr

1104
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,359
is focused on a particular endpoint

1105
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,560
machine right

1106
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:11,359
however um the endpoint machine um

1107
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,839
alone is sort of um cannot

1108
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,839
capture um all malicious activity right

1109
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:20,240
it is

1110
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,680
um so you have other um

1111
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,520
security and networking devices in a

1112
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,680
corporate environment you have firewalls

1113
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,520
you have vpns you have email you have

1114
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,040
active directory right

1115
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,920
and all of these other data sources they

1116
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,319
have

1117
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,599
rich information right about maybe how a

1118
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,079
hacker is moving through the network or

1119
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,359
a particular sort of

1120
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,839
a phishing email that has come in um

1121
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,280
right um

1122
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,680
so all of this information because edr

1123
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,359
is just focused on the endpoint

1124
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,240
is missing today for edr right uh if we

1125
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,119
were to capture

1126
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,800
all of this informat additional

1127
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,280
information from all of these additional

1128
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,560
devices it would add far more meaning

1129
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,000
to the data that edr already has about

1130
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,119
the end point right you could add

1131
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,240
additional context

1132
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,440
you could do a better job at detecting

1133
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,000
and

1134
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,079
preventing um malware right um

1135
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,599
so this is where xdr comes in

1136
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,599
so xtr stands for extended

1137
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,560
detection and response right so it's um

1138
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,280
endpoint

1139
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,319
data plus network data

1140
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:33,680
and cloud data right um so you have

1141
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,040
um so xdr solutions take

1142
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,800
the endpoint data that is coming from

1143
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,359
edr and aggregate this data

1144
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:45,040
with um for example firewall data

1145
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,480
or your aws data cloud data right

1146
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,520
um or emailed logs right

1147
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,560
and they build a single sort of

1148
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,240
holistic picture of a corporate

1149
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,960
network's overall security posture right

1150
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,319
so they are providing

1151
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,040
single pane of glass visibility into

1152
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,480
everything that is happening

1153
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,440
across um the the customers environment

1154
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,160
not only

1155
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,599
on the end point right

1156
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,880
so um very quickly um i

1157
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,119
will take a look at some of the use

1158
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,079
cases

1159
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,280
that xdr

1160
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,680
addresses right i probably won't go into

1161
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,559
all of them but

1162
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,800
let's look at the first one so um here

1163
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,400
you you have edr which is

1164
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,960
running on the endpoint machine it's

1165
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,400
telling you that

1166
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,920
um there has been um a malware detected

1167
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,280
on that user's machine

1168
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,480
right now if i'm if i use

1169
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,520
xdr in this context i can sort of

1170
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,040
enrich this data this detection

1171
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,839
that edr has provided me with additional

1172
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:56,880
information

1173
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,880
coming from other data sources which

1174
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,960
will help my security analysts

1175
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,200
do a better job at containing this

1176
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,280
particular malware which was detected by

1177
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,880
edr right so um what xdr would do

1178
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,079
is it would correlate this malware

1179
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,040
data that was detected by edr with the

1180
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,359
vpn data so that it could find

1181
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,280
which user was logged into this

1182
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,559
particular machine

1183
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,000
at the time that the malware was

1184
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,559
detected and it can also correlate

1185
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,280
this data with let's say active

1186
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,559
directory right so if you're not

1187
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,559
familiar active directory is

1188
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,440
the system that controls um logins right

1189
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,319
for uh

1190
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:38,000
in a windows system so um xpr can

1191
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,680
correlate

1192
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,960
the um this detect malware

1193
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,680
detection data with active directory to

1194
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,559
indicate

1195
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,160
um or determine if the user

1196
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,319
if this particular machine belongs to a

1197
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,280
vip user

1198
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,760
right so now i have additional context

1199
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,280
on this malware detection

1200
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,240
right i know that this particular

1201
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,000
malware was detected on

1202
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,720
a regular employee or a vip user right

1203
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,040
which

1204
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,240
which will aid my security analyst in

1205
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,640
doing a better job at basically doing

1206
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,000
incident response right how do they

1207
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,599
prioritize this particular

1208
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,720
malware incident right uh they have

1209
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,920
additional information

1210
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,480
to do that right so uh just one of the

1211
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,839
use cases where

1212
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,119
xdr comes handy and it can sort of

1213
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,800
aid easier in doing a better

1214
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,839
job right so uh yeah that was sort of a

1215
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:32,400
quick

1216
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,520
look at xdr um and i think

1217
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
that's uh i won't go into the other two

1218
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,119
use cases for now and

1219
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,680
leave time um at the end for questions

1220
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,160
so

1221
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,240
uh that's it from my side

1222
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,279
