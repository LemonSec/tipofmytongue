level of cyber security threats

just the first half of 2020 36 billion

13

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,680
this panel

109
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,720
um what i'd like to start with is uh

110
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,799
perhaps uh what we've all gone through

111
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,000
last year

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,439
so the kubern 19 pandemic has completely

113
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,120
changed the way we live

114
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,239
and do things and it has also made us

115
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,280
highly reliant on digital transactions

116
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,400
much more than ever and so this brings

117
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,799
us

118
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,560
to a rather important question some of

119
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
the statistics uh that

120
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,199
savita shared comes from this fact that

121
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,040
of our high reliance on digital

122
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,280
transactions and digital media

123
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,080
so how has really uh the last pack

124
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,199
really affected

125
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,880
the area of cyber security and uh

126
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,800
you know we've we've heard of various

127
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,240
different warnings from various

128
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,160
different organizations of how

129
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
this will continue to impact both

130
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,440
individuals and

131
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,400
organizations and what i mean is looking

132
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,199
at

133
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,680
attacks in the medical sector surge

134
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,560
because of

135
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,320
you know work from home learn from home

136
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,680
type of activities

137
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,479
internet banking financial institutions

138
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,120
uh

139
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,840
and this has really really created a

140
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,720
high toll

141
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,840
in fact on cyber security institutions

142
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,039
and potentially staff and also a

143
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,520
a large delay potentially in in the type

144
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,880
of responses we can give

145
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,600
so i'd like to actually uh ask each of

146
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,720
you to maybe share

147
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,600
as part of your opening remarks um what

148
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,639
has your exp personal experience been

149
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,120
in this last year in really dealing with

150
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,759
this first

151
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,800
hand or directly or indirectly

152
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,840
maybe we can start there i'd like to

153
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,758

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,720
evolved

163
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
in this domain of cyber safety and

164
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,000
security

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,319

very eventful year

167

i come from the law enforcement

169
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,199
background and we have been dealing with

170
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,280
the consequences of cyber crimes

171
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,600
more from the individual and

172
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,440
organizations perspective

173
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,720
rather than in respect of

174
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,520
security incidents whether crimes which

175
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,199
target individuals

176
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,479
be it for online harassment related

177
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,319
related things or when we talk about

178
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,080
online frauds or then coming to

179
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,039
security incidents like ransomware

180
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,800
security breaches

181
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,440
data theft and so on so it has been a

182
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,360
very eventful year

183
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
and at the same time you know we got

184
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,840
this opportunity also

185
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,120
to actually make sincere efforts to

186
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,840
address

187
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,759
the concerns that are there these

188
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,039
concerns have been

189
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,360
we have been talking about at various

190
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,880
quoras

191
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,120
about you know lack of coordination

192
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
between different stakeholders

193
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,000
the very fact that we are part of the

194
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,599
government

195
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,720
and the regulatory mechanism but

196
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,160
the entire domain of what we call

197
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,599
cyberspace

198
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,360
is primarily uh owned

199
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,560
by the private sector mostly

200
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,319
and what we find is that despite the

201
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,800
acceptance or realization of this fact

202
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,319
that

203
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,599
you know every one of us are vulnerable

204
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,319
to

205
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,360
any you know cyber incident and this

206
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,680
relation has created

207
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,479
you know across across across age groups

208
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,080
across

209
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,520
classes communities but still

210
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,720
when we make our efforts to counter the

211
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,120
threat of cyber crime we find that there

212
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,039
is very little headway

213
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,160
the reason for lack of headway uh we can

214
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,800
do a

215
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,240
analysis in the hindsight of what

216
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,080
happened over the last one here

217
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,599
is that there is a very strong

218
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,319
reluctance on the part of the private

219
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,680
stakeholders

220
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,800
to actually make genuine efforts

221
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,840
to address the concerns address the

222
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,759
issues

223
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,599
for instance like we have been facing

224
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,879
challenges in getting the otts getting

225
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,240
the platforms

226
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,080
to actively you know collapse

227
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,360
collaborate with us

228
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,000
in sharing information in you know

229
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,519
proactively identifying

230
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,399
unlawful activities and so on and so

231
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,279
forth

232
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,519
another thing that we find is that you

233
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,039
know our efforts

234
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,120
are still in bits and pieces

235
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,839
and they are more you know symptomatic

236
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,120
rather than looking at the

237
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,000
problem in totality and addressing it in

238
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,600
a 360 degree manner

239
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,440
so there are institutional bottlenecks

240
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,680
for instance we we don't have

241
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,200
international cooperation mechanisms

242
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,160
where we can

243
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,839
actively share information with each

244
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,000
other on crime and criminals

245
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,839
we don't have regulatory framework where

246
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,360
we can you know

247
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,279
all these private players they can

248
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,720
because you know directly the government

249
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,360
cannot

250
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
engage with each and everything there if

251
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
there is a regulator which the industry

252
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,560
respects

253
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,880
it will make the job much more easier

254
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,080
for all of us

255
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,000
so that kind of framework is still not

256
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,120
there

257
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,680
at the same time we find that the

258
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,200
citizenry also

259
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,160
despite the very fact that you know

260
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,760
everyone is vulnerable and they have

261
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,800
this relation

262
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,360
at the same time we find that there is

263
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,920
still

264
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,200
an element of experimenting with the new

265
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,720
technologies new

266
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,440
methods of interaction new methods of

267
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,640
social interaction

268
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
performing financial transactions you

269
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,120
know new applications that are coming

270
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,160
to experiment with them and uh throw

271
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,680
caution to the winds

272
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,880
and in in course of that we find that

273
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,480
people are becoming victims of

274
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,440
cyber crime so for instance uh if we

275
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,800
talk about online harassment we find

276
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,839
that a lot of youth

277
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,519
especially teenagers they are

278
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,680
experimenting on these applications

279
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,920
they are sharing their private you know

280
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,360
videos content

281
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,680
which otherwise they would not have done

282
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,120
and

283
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,920
you know either they are not aware of or

284
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,800
because of their

285
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,920
tendency to experiment uh they

286
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,680
are sharing content which ultimately you

287
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,959
know goes out of

288
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,279
their hands out of the you know the

289
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,480
immediate group in which they have

290
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,279
shared

291
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,839
and cause a lot of emotional uh trouble

292
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,560
to them

293
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,320
similarly a lot of people have we are

294
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,800
finding that they are experimenting with

295
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
uh investment schemes which have been

296
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,480
pushed through online

297
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,360
forums without you know doing due

298
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,880
diligence

299
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,399
just because they have been pushed

300
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,480
through online forums

301
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,160
for instance multi-level marketing

302
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,000
schemes what we call ponzi scheme

303
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,120
so we see that there are a lot of

304
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,440
challenges both human institutional

305
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,880
infrastructure related and ultimately

306
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,720
it is for the government for the various

307
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,399
stakeholders to come together and

308
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,560
make sincere effort to address these

309
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,440
challenges

310
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,440
this is my opening remark thank you

311
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,399
thank you mr anish uh i'd like to switch

312
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:16,880
to

313
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,839
uh miss lira you also work for the

314
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,079
government so what has your experience

315
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,519
been this past year

316
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,560
on these particular uh types of

317
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,519
concerns or raised concerns uh from the

318
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,560
school of pandemic

319
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,320
hello everyone um

320
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,519
look really the i think that the

321
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,000
biggest challenge that was in the last

322
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,640
year

323
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,079
um was all the theme of

324
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,680
social engineering um

325
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,040
the the biggest challenge is i know that

326
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,160
i can try to bring to my organization

327
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,440
the best antivirus i can bring the best

328
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,399
firewall i can bring the best team the

329
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,560
best workers the best analysts the best

330
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,760
investigators

331
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,760
but if someone gets a suspicious link

332
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,880
and

333
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,399
really presses it so it's practically

334
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,600
game over i mean

335
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
my antivirus and my firewall are not

336
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,440
relevant anymore

337
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,600
so i think this was the biggest

338
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,680
challenge in the last year especially in

339
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,560
the

340
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,920
in the israeli government we saw it was

341
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,040
also in the press

342
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,240
we saw also that israel enemies

343
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,160
tried to do social engineering to um

344
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,440
to different soldiers in the idf to

345
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,079
different people that work in government

346
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,040
and

347
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,480
imposters to a beautiful ladies and

348
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,600
try to get into the network of

349
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
israel in this way the social

350
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,639
engineering

351
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,480
so i think this is the biggest challenge

352
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,600
because this is

353
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,040
so easy to perform social engineering is

354
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,160
so easy

355
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,399
um i can check every one of yours is

356
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,279
social networks to see what you like

357
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,560
what is your hobbies

358
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,720
where can i find you where do you go on

359
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,279
friday night or a saturday night to hang

360
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,480
out with your friends

361
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,800
and just send you a link to and you

362
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
press it and then

363
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,760
all my work is not relevant anymore so a

364
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
little bit of pathways i had

365
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,519
um after we saw uh after we saw in the

366
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,920
press what happened to the soldiers that

367
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,040
was um was seduced by

368
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,839
our enemies and tried to get into the

369
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,600
network of the idf

370
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,720
uh we reconsidered everything we're

371
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,360
doing

372
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,560
we said guys we can

373
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,920
invest how many we want but we need to

374
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,800
focus on the social engineering i still

375
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,439
have a question

376
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,079
ah thank you uh miss lee redken i'd like

377
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,800
to just switch over to professor dave

378
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,639
chattery um being an arden researcher

379
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,000
you know you're neutral to uh kind of

380
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,360
uh you know several of these

381
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
perspectives on the

382
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,920
you know on what should have been done

383
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,920
and what could have been done and what

384
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,079
and and particularly what i wanted to

385
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,040
ask is

386
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,959
the united states is actually ranked

387
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,240
extremely high

388
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,199
on the global cyber security index and

389
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,399
it's ranked number sec

390
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,440
number two in the world and um in spite

391
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,079
of that

392
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,560
uh what has your uh you know what are

393
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,120
your thoughts on the types of uh

394
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,600
cyber instances uh seen from this

395
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,360
forward 19 attack

396
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,880
uh pandemic absolutely

397
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,360
uh thank you for the opportunity uh my

398
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,800
greetings to everybody

399
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,680
um special greetings to amma i haven't

400
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
had the pleasure of meeting her yet

401
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,480
looking forward to i'd like to thank my

402
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,880
good friend jody for this opportunity

403
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,800
to be here this morning at your end uh

404
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,959
midnight or two o'clock in the morning

405
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,639
at my end

406
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,920
it's a you know i heard the panelists

407
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,959
and they

408
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,480
they really touched upon the key points

409
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,279
cyber security is everyone's business

410
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,720
humans are the biggest strengths

411
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,920
as well as the biggest weaknesses and as

412
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,720
our friend

413
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,480
from uh the israeli defense

414
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,519
ministry said she's so spot on that

415
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,279
despite all

416
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,519
the measures that you might take just

417
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,320
one person

418
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,759
making an error of judgment

419
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,680
and you are breached and thanks to

420
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,440
the kind of digitization that is

421
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,839
happening the more digitized we get

422
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,720
the more vulnerable become because once

423
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,680
you are

424
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,240
able to penetrate one system you can

425
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,519
penetrate others

426
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,079
and that's what i have been seeing time

427
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:02,800
and again

428
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,320
i've been doing work in this area for

429
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,839
almost a decade

430
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,120
uh my book just came out you know every

431
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,519
company i talk to

432
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,639
the core challenge that i see is and

433
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,839
i think mr roy pointed to this

434
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,120
is the lack of proactiveness

435
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
and i know it's not fair to generalize

436
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,680
there are there are exemplars out there

437
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,880
but you often need legislation

438
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,759
regulatory requirements to get

439
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,519
organizations

440
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,480
to do things that they should be doing

441
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,959
normally

442
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,959
one has to take a very proactive

443
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,079
approach

444
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,399
a very proactive a multi-pronged

445
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,519
approach

446
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,639
a technocentric approach won't cut it

447
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,800
just you know getting the best tools in

448
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,079
the world will

449
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,360
not solve the problem because thanks to

450
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,839
coved and this has been happening over a

451
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,040
period of time

452
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,639
we are making we are becoming highly

453
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,199
distributed we are working remotely

454
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,480
so the boundaries are

455
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,439
getting broader trying to protect these

456
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,880
boundaries

457
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,799
is going to be hard unless you're able

458
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,559
to secure your people

459
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,199
it's not enough to secure devices it's

460
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,039
not enough to secure data

461
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,359
it's not enough to secure networks so

462
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,079
how do we

463
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,720
secure people we have to raise the level

464
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,839
of awareness

465
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,200
is that an easy task not at all it's an

466
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,039
extremely complex task

467
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,559
and that's precisely why even the very

468
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,720
best of companies are faltering

469
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
i can literally go through a list of

470
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,200
companies very well-known companies

471
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,120
who have been breached and billions of

472
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,600
records have been exposed

473
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,360
because one person or there was this one

474
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,000
vulnerability that was exploited what is

475
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,919
even more appalling

476
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,960
is they're gathering information they're

477
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,480
gathering intelligence

478
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,679
they have the intelligence to act on for

479
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,799
good reason

480
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,360
they're not acting on it so it's not

481
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,919
like

482
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,480
we don't have good principles good

483
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,000
practices

484
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,760
it's the ability to consistently

485
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,360
execute at a high level of precision

486
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,080
that's what will make the difference and

487
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,600
how do you achieve it

488
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
you achieve it by creating and

489
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,160
sustaining a high performance

490
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,200
information security culture founded on

491
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
three traits and i talk about that in my

492
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,760
book

493
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,480
commitment preparedness and discipline

494
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,160
and my research finds

495
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,320
under each of these traits there are

496
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,160
several success factors

497
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,400
and i don't mean to expand on those at

498
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,520
this time

499
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,400
but it's a very complex challenge it has

500
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,200
to be

501
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,559
handled diligently it's a

502
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,520
moving target

503
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,919
the pandemic that we are going through

504
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,880
right now

505
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,919
is nothing compared to what cyber

506
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,640
attacks

507
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,000
can lead to it can destroy our critical

508
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,360
infrastructure it can

509
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,480
cause biolog biological warfare

510
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,240
we can see another of these viral

511
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,080
attacks caused by

512
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,160
breaches to systems that's how

513
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,600
significant

514
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,039
this discussion is but how do you get

515
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,760
everybody on board how do you get that

516
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,679
level of commitment

517
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,480
the gentleman talked about youngsters

518
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,200
you know

519
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,360
freely sharing information that's become

520
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,480
our society

521
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,160
we have just given up you know

522
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,919
convenience trumps

523
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,280
everything so how do you get the social

524
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,120
consciousness to recognize

525
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,480
that we all have to operate with a

526
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,559
certain level of discipline

527
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,360
certain level of diligence certain level

528
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,640
of consciousness

529
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
that's the challenge

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,559

welcome and then um i just wanted to get

552
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,919
your idea on these some of these

553
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:40,400
thoughts

554
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,960
uh in fact africa duplicate the entire

555
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,400
continent of africa

556
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,679
uh and inclusive kenya uh africa has

557
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,440
been really investing a lot

558
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,679
towards digitization and digital

559
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,559
technologies

560
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,720
and you can see the banks and many other

561
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
institutions going online

562
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,360
uh and this is necessary and important

563
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,600
but definitely there's also

564
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,919
uh increases the level of threats and

565
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:04,960
cyber crimes

566
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,200
and insecurity it becomes more prevalent

567
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,679
so i just wanted to understand from you

568
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,520
how your past year has been

569
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,720
um you know with increased uh

570
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,600
instances of cyber crime and and what

571
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,320
has your

572
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,440
year been like uh uh under the

573
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,799
umbrella i think

574
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,840
uh the most aspect that has come up is

575
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,229
[Music]

576
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,919
can you speak closer to the mic

577
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,440
is it better now

578
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,280
yes it's better okay i was saying uh

579
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,919
the key item that came up with regards

580
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,400
to just

581
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,440
the people aspect is cyber bullying and

582
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,280
it's really been a trending aspect

583
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,120
as well especially when people have more

584
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,520
time to converse they have more time to

585
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,080
to create content so what has come up

586
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,720
and has been on the rise is mostly

587
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,240
cyber bullying especially around

588
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,000
children but that's not

589
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,159
uh that's not the but with regards to

590
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,760
different organizations

591
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,320
we might not have the best uh stringent

592
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,799
mechanisms to protect our employees

593
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,559
especially when it comes to working from

594
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,480
home and with regards to bringing your

595
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,440
own device

596
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,280
therefore mostly data leakages among the

597
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,840
things that

598
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,640
have come up and uh most organizations

599
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,559
rather the banking industries

600
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,559
suffer a lot from internal attacks and

601
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,159
how best can we implement better

602
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,440
platforms

603
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,559
to support that so um how best we work

604
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,440
as she hacks is

605
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,520
to just push more awareness to different

606
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,880
organization also

607
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,600
and also the different um employees that

608
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,480
they have

609
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,080
so for that you're able to have the

610
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,159
knowledge of we need to have

611
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,960
privileged access management to the

612
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,200
co-banking system on co-platforms

613
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,600
that support the different uh banking

614
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,640
industries because

615
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,360
in fintech industries actually the best

616
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,600
part is that uh in kenya

617
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,360
among the key things that are really

618
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,280
picking the market is uh the fintech

619
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,080
aspect

620
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,960
and also the banking industries so uh

621
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,200
for fintech another another key

622
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,640
problem that comes up is social

623
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,360
engineering so for social engineering

624
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,640
it's easy to to to manipulate a user to

625
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,520
provide their

626
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,720
password or pain for example and in that

627
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,200
case

628
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,880
they might not be aware that this is

629
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,039
something i am not able

630
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,799
i'm not supposed to share to another

631
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,880
party so the best thing that

632
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,039
different organizations do and among the

633
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,400
biggest organizations we have is

634
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,600
safarico

635
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,480
is regular training to these users even

636
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,240
just simple messages like

637
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,720
uh your pin is your own secret therefore

638
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,880
you shouldn't share to any other person

639
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,200
and we just put it in the language that

640
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,640
people understand here because we have

641
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,320
around 42 languages

642
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,480
so we have the essence to translate

643
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,080
those different users

644
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,000
in those different categories of

645
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,840
languages to understand

646
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
what exactly does it mean that my

647
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,080
opinion is my own secrets

648
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,880
so such do help with regards to user

649
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,919
awareness

650
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,080
and then organization now need to put in

651
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,840
more effort in terms of

652
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,440
implementing um actually in in terms of

653
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,559
uh investing more uh tools that can help

654
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,320
them and also training for the different

655
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,200
employees

656
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,840
so with that we're able to have a better

657
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,279
signages and better

658
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,640
ways in which you can manage the

659
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,640
different risks that might come in

660
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,480
thank you so much evelyn one of my own

661
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
personal thoughts is actually

662
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,640
the world is actually favoring cyber

663
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,080
attacks in fact

664
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,320
you know it is so easy to launch these

665
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,200
attacks

666
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,120
they're extremely cheap to do the scale

667
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,520
and the enormity of the impact is so

668
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,320
high

669
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
and the chances of actually getting

670
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,600
caught is so low

671
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,279
right so uh my question to mr amnesia is

672
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,600
in this scenario where you are at a

673
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,760
significant disadvantage

674
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,480
how do you really go about coming up

675
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,559
with a framework to be able to address

676
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,120
this

677
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,400
in a country like india where there is a

678
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,039
very very large adoption uh like you

679
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:19,679
said

680
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,880
earlier about of devices people getting

681
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,320
more and more online

682
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,360
every single day so so this is this is a

683
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,880
growing problem and i'd love to know

684
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,400
your thoughts on how

685
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,919
we can go about addressing it

686
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
ma'am we look up look look forward to

687
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,600
people like you

688
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,440
to provide us solutions for you know

689
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,039
addressing these issues

690
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,600
but whatever comes to my mind uh you

691
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,360
know i am the end user in fact of all

692
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,320
the

693
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,120
technology and you know procedures and

694
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,840
processes that

695
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,000
uh people who are experts in this domain

696
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,880
can device

697
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,679
but yes definitely as the end user i

698
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,120
have my wish list

699
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,000
and uh we we request the various

700
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
stakeholders actually we push them

701
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,480
how to you know give us what we want to

702
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,679
enforce the systems so that

703
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,080
citizens can be protected so challenges

704
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,919
definitely you know everyone is

705
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,120
now having a smartphone which is as good

706
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,600
as

707
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,120
the computers that we use to have 10

708
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,120
years back and

709
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
they are all connected with each other

710
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,640
they have multiple applications that

711
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,120
that

712
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,520
run on them these applications can be

713
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,400
downloaded

714
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,320
you know with a simple tab uh you can

715
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,640
push these applications through

716
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,960
uh as simple a thing as a whatsapp

717
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,760
message

718
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,400
which everybody now can operate in this

719
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,360
country

720
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,039
so definitely people are vulnerable and

721
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,200
as as uh it was said that social

722
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,159
engineering is

723
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,000
uh the biggest threat and

724
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,559
as we say that uh you know jain is as

725
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,919
strong as the weakest link

726
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,480
so the weakest link are in fact the

727
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,279
human elements placed in these uh

728
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,840
setups for instance a person who is

729
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,679
having a mobile phone

730
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,240
uh he works for a very secure

731
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,279
installation

732
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,360
but in that secure installation there is

733
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,960
a wi-fi network

734
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,559
now this mobile phone gets connected to

735
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,399
that wi-fi network and

736
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,520
you know ultimately the person uses it

737
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,120
for his own personal purposes also and

738
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,399
downloads so many things

739
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,720
and ultimately through the wi-fi network

740
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,679
it actually

741
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,720
infects that secure installation

742
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,440
these things have happened in our

743
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,279
vicinities we are aware of that

744
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,720
so this is how the single person who

745
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,440
probably because of social engineering

746
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,799
or other means

747
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,360
gets compromised and that leads to the

748
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,039
compromise of the entire

749
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,760
organization or the infrastructure how

750
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,279
we can go ahead with

751
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,399
you know protecting our systems

752
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,720
first and foremost i believe that

753
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,559
creating awareness

754
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,919
uh is important is i believe the

755
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,200
only aspect on which we can you know

756
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,120
work as much

757
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,559
as possible because people actually are

758
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,480
not aware of the consequences of a

759
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,600
single tap

760
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,360
on their mobile phone screen they are

761
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,279
not aware of it and that is why most of

762
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,880
the time they are making mistakes

763
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,200
so making them aware of the consequences

764
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,880
and making them aware of it

765
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,200
you know as many times as possible

766
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,320
during a day

767
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,360
or a regular basis across board wherever

768
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,559
they are

769
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,279
and making it more targeted it is like

770
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,640
you see

771
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,120
these platforms these big ott platforms

772
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,320
they they do

773
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,480
targeted advertisements if i make a

774
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,159
search then they will

775
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,760
you know bombard me with advertisements

776
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,919
related to that search so that kind of

777
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,279
approach is required

778
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,880
when we actually want to make people

779
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,520
aware about the threats that are there

780
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,240
so can we have a targeted approach like

781
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,919
somebody is going online

782
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,000
he's making certain you know he's doing

783
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,120
some certain things

784
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,080
which will ultimately lead to some

785
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,440
vulnerability or some

786
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,159
malware creeping into his device now

787
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,720
systems can identify it can we target

788
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,279
him

789
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,720
that person with uh specific awareness

790
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,799
literature about

791
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,000
that particular action that he has done

792
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,399
so that he can be born there and then in

793
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,480
real time about the consequences

794
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,159
so that kind of approach is needed as

795
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,679
far as individuals are concerned

796
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,679
a very targeted approach right now what

797
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,520
we're doing is more of a mechanical

798
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
awareness programs you know literature

799
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,960
which is spread

800
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,120
across forums without targeting the

801
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,399
actual behavior

802
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,720
second aspect that is needed probably is

803
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,240
that you know

804
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,640
there are micro small and medium level

805
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,840
enterprises

806
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,480
uh which are performing the bulk of uh

807
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,919
you know

808
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,080
industrial activity manufacturing

809
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,679
services etc

810
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,520
and people are in fact mostly

811
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,720
interacting with them

812
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,399
and they found the bulk of employment

813
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,960
opportunities also now these micro small

814
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,399
and medium enterprises

815
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,000
they are actually not investing

816
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,480
almost anything into securing their

817
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,600
systems

818
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,080
so they are becoming victims of simple

819
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,880
frauds

820
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,320
like for instance business email

821
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,559
compromise now it involves

822
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,279
a compromise of single email account

823
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,360
which is used to interact with different

824
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,720
other enterprises and that leads to uh

825
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,279
fraud involving you know loss of maybe a

826
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,000
crore or

827
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,640
rupees or more than that we have had

828
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,600
cases where people

829
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,840
small enterprises they have lost seven

830
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,039
to eight crores

831
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,159
which in today's term is like one

832
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,559
million dollar uh because of a single

833
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,000
compromise of an email account

834
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,600
and these are very small enterprises

835
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,279
seven crore eight crore is a huge amount

836
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,080
for them

837
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,399
similarly enterprises these days are

838
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,279
getting targeted

839
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,640
through ransomware attacks and these are

840
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,559
very small enterprises

841
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,159
so we don't have a system wherein

842
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,240
these enterprises can avail the services

843
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,960
of cyber security experts or you know

844
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,320
id security experts because

845
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,399
it has not been pushed by any regulator

846
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,480
or by any forum whatsoever

847
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,279
making it more you know readily

848
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:11,919
available

849
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,960
making it more accessible making it more

850
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,200
you know financially viable to avail

851
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,240
these services

852
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,399
this is something where governments and

853
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,000
you know other institutional players

854
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,360
they can come into the picture and

855
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,519
provide this kind of a setup

856
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,080
over the next three four years where you

857
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,720
know we have

858
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,159
enough trained human resources who can

859
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:32,960
provide

860
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,000
id security services to small micro

861
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,720
medium

862
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,480
level enterprises big enterprises

863
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,000
definitely they have all the resources

864
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,640
in the world

865
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,880
to secure their systems to train their

866
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,320
people but

867
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,559
what is happening right now is that

868
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,840
micro levels small

869
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,760
and medium level enterprises are getting

870
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,840
targeted so we need to focus on them

871
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,918
to secure our systems thank you

872
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,600
uh ms leora you come from israel and you

873
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,159
know

874
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,960
israel is considered a leader in cyber

875
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,000
security

876
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,120
so what are those intelligence systems

877
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,159
that you might actually employ to really

878
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,200
look at this kind of a you could say

879
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,000
an oxymoron situation where you really

880
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,320
had the best of talent on the one side

881
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,880
but

882
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
uh also that best of talent could

883
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,159
potentially also cause

884
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,440
damage um so how would you

885
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,159
uh look at you know governmental

886
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,399
initiatives to be able to address this

887
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,600
problem of

888
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,840
uh cyber security and cyber crime and

889
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,279
cyber attacks being such an

890
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,320
easy way to be able to cause

891
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,440
very very debilitating damage what are

892
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,000
some of your

893
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,279
thoughts and well

894
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,960
mr roy talked about the awareness

895
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,000
um another challenge of the awareness is

896
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,399
not

897
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,080
only the social engineering um

898
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,279
problems is also the awareness among

899
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,880
the i.t department at the end the cyber

900
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,159
security department

901
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,399
they don't touch the switches and the

902
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,279
routers

903
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,360
they don't make configuration on the

904
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,799
network uh

905
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,399
you we investigate we we look for the

906
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,360
alerts but

907
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,440
we're not making the configurations

908
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,559
because this is the id

909
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,760
guys uh this is the id guys doing so

910
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,600
another challenge in here

911
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,120
is to really um take this awareness

912
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,000
among them they are not cyber security

913
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,440
people

914
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,240
so but they have a lot of power so when

915
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,880
an id

916
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,559
guy goes inside the network device and

917
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,360
he tried

918
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,200
and he starts to make different

919
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,559
configurations on the

920
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,880
network device there are configurations

921
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,399
that securely

922
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,120
they are not allowed and when there are

923
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,720
when there is no awareness

924
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,080
among the i.t guys it can cause a lot of

925
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,080
damage to the organization

926
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,960
um so it's really important to also

927
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,399
take this awareness and talk about it

928
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,039
with the

929
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,879
i.t guys it's another challenge and

930
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,879
you asked how do we how do we manage the

931
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,440
threats

932
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,359
i personally feel we have to

933
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,280
think uh and you know be smarter

934
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,599
to some extent to be able to deal with

935
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,359
the situation because

936
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,760
uh you know we've always been on a

937
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,280
reactive mode

938
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,119
and what does it take to be on the

939
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,719
proactive mode

940
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,399
and what types of systems and

941
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,639
intelligence is required to be able to

942
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,760
do that

943
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,879
um and i'm looking at israel as a as as

944
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:43,520
a

945
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,199
world leader in this area so looking at

946
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,399
some of the thoughts and some of the

947
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,719
directions uh from

948
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,639
from your country okay so

949
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,760
everything that you are talking about

950
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,320
specific

951
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,079
systems

952
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,280
you can talk about any approaches uh

953
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,200
you know any type of directions

954
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,960
technical non-technical

955
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,480
um you know procedural any of those

956
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,200
types of endeavors or initiatives that

957
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,640
would be taken

958
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,800
to be able to address this one problem

959
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,920
like i mentioned

960
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,320
the problem is that it's so easy to do a

961
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,079
large amount of damage

962
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,160
and you can't really catch the person

963
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,520
that did the damage

964
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,920
in this kind of scenario what might be

965
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,480
the types of steps

966
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,520
yes so and you talk about the proactive

967
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,400
approach

968
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,160
i think also mr dave talked about the

969
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,680
proactive approach and we

970
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,480
really adopt this approach uh in my

971
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,160
organization at least

972
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,599
to really look for proactive uh

973
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,839
proactive attackers we don't only um

974
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,960
we are we don't depend on the sim system

975
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,000
to uh

976
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,119
to notify me everything because a really

977
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,720
smart attacker can also

978
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,560
pass the sim at the end the sim it works

979
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,320
it it's based on agents it's based on uh

980
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,440
on the connectors but a very smart a

981
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,280
a very small heart attacker will

982
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,839
probably disable the agent

983
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,400
it's not simple at all but it's a

984
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,280
possibility

985
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,880
we know that at some point it's not

986
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,520
always safe it's we want to get to the

987
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,079
100 percent safe and at work but

988
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,400
it will never happen we know it not

989
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,760
because we're not talented

990
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,240
because it's just not possible it's

991
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,520
never 100

992
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,800
secure in every network in the world

993
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,839
so we really do adopt their proactive

994
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:46,480
approach

995
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,599
and this is the leading uh this is the

996
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,720
leading method

997
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,760
now to really always look for

998
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,920
something suspicious it can be in the

999
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,880
networking

1000
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,079
area uh just open the switch in the

1001
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,680
router and start to look for

1002
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,560
suspicious connections uh start to look

1003
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,880
for

1004
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,400
the suspicious files it can be in the

1005
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,320
servers linux servers are very popular

1006
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,480
these days we need to know how to

1007
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,240
get into the service and start to

1008
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,320
investigate all the files all the stuff

1009
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,280
inside

1010
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,320
and also um everything

1011
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,160
that at the end the importance of the

1012
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,280
israeli network is really high and it

1013
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,640
gives a lot of a very sensitive users

1014
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,680
um what they need and their information

1015
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,119
so our main goal is always

1016
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,720
to give the users um the opportunity and

1017
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,320
the option to work

1018
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,920
um if we are facing a cyber event

1019
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,240
the main goal here we will be running

1020
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,520
and we'll be working

1021
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,880
all the time 24 7 to give the users and

1022
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,160
to give the people

1023
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,200
back the opportunity to work again

1024
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,320
and this is the the main part

1025
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,920
also a very big challenge is and we know

1026
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,320
that

1027
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,400
uh israel enemies really want to get

1028
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,000
inside the israeli network

1029
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,640
and get the information and get the data

1030
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,119
we

1031
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,320
store in so this is another really big

1032
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,680
challenge

1033
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,160
that israel is always working on to

1034
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,280
really secure

1035
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,880
the data itself to secure the packets uh

1036
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,240
of the data and especially in the cloud

1037
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,680
area which is really

1038
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,839
a very popular subject right now

1039
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,119
everything that

1040
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,119
goes above cyber security um

1041
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,320
in the cloud and um

1042
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,400
we want to secure the all the data in

1043
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,560
the cloud it's a really revolution now

1044
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,440
in israel

1045
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,520
in israel everyone is talking about the

1046
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,680
cloud and transformation to the cloud

1047
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,240
but

1048
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,119
again here is a conflict all the it guys

1049
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,920
all the devops guys all the system guys

1050
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,640
they go to the cloud but sometimes they

1051
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,359
forget

1052
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,480
you need to secure your cloud

1053
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,680
and sometimes they like they were

1054
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,440
the secure people the security people

1055
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,119
remind them listen

1056
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,280
you need to secure your cloud unless

1057
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,800
your data will go wrong

1058
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,880
and it will in your data will be lost

1059
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,960
and your data will be linked

1060
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,800
so this is the the main things that we

1061
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,520
deal with them now

1062
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,280
thank you man and miss leora um i would

1063
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,560
actually love to

1064
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,560
get questions from the audience as well

1065
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
so that we can ask the panelists

1066
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,119
so do put in your questions uh in the

1067
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,240
chat

1068
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,960
now my next question is to professor

1069
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,160
dave

1070
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,920
you hail from india so you can

1071
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,560
definitely relate to what i'm saying

1072
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,320
uh most of the panelists really talked

1073
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,599
about awareness

1074
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,320
uh you know and educating people so that

1075
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
they're secure but you know that this

1076
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,880
country

1077
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,240
70 of us live in villages

1078
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,720
they don't have absolutely any exposure

1079
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,160
to information

1080
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,400
in fact many of my own colleagues are

1081
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,280
very very

1082
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,880
uh are not savvy about uh you know the

1083
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,200
the

1084
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,079
the in the impact from potentially a

1085
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,200
cyber attack

1086
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,000
so so you're talking about the extremely

1087
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,119
vulnerable

1088
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,319
uh you're talking about people who may

1089
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,240
or may not have access to the internet

1090
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,760
may or may not understand the

1091
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,079
information out there

1092
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,800
on their own in such a situation what

1093
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,280
would you

1094
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,319
really look at as a strategy for cyber

1095
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,359
security readiness

1096
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,240
fantastic question i wish i have a good

1097
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,640
answer but i will try

1098
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,760
so first and foremost let's keep it very

1099
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,560
simple

1100
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,359
and what do we mean by simple let's ask

1101
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,880
ourselves

1102
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,280
what is most important to us that we

1103
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,800
need to secure

1104
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,359
and that applies to anybody at any

1105
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,520
economic strata

1106
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,880
and then let's ask ourselves what are we

1107
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,920
doing to secure

1108
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,960
itself the secure the data or that that

1109
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,920
asset

1110
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,119
because we can't afford to lose it so if

1111
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:11,760
we take

1112
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,880
that kind of a very focused prioritized

1113
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,119
approach

1114
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,880
then we can start thinking about

1115
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,920
what are our options in terms of what

1116
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,400
are our

1117
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,520
options you're exactly right

1118
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,640
means probably the majority have little

1119
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,520
or

1120
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,760
no idea of what it takes to secure

1121
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,560
digital assets i have been fortunate to

1122
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,720
travel to different parts of the world

1123
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,119
give talks in different countries and

1124
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,880
i've been surprised

1125
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,640
by the lack of basic awareness

1126
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,680
so that begs the question or

1127
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,119
the discussion that can we start cyber

1128
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,560
education at a very

1129
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,079
basic level from it from an early age

1130
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,040
and that could be in the form of like mr

1131
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,560
roy was talking

1132
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,240
you know simple ads that can be pushed

1133
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,880
to everyone whether it's a cell phone

1134
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,760
device

1135
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,560
or at a hoarding you know giving them

1136
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,200
some

1137
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,720
simple tips keeping it very simple that

1138
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,800
you know switch off your device when

1139
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,400
you're not using it

1140
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,560
uh you know you can think of a whole

1141
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,599
bunch of things don't

1142
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,680
keeps or don't upload stuff that you

1143
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,160
think might come back to hurt you

1144
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,640
so giving them some simple tips that

1145
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,079
might be

1146
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,119
a way to get this discussion going

1147
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,760
and try to mobilize support i'd like to

1148
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,680
touch on a few other things that relate

1149
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,040
to this question

1150
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,960
and was addressed by the other panelists

1151
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,800
it is very important that the leadership

1152
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,680
makes an active commitment that means

1153
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,000
they

1154
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,800
all have to get their heads in the game

1155
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,400
does that mean that i'm expecting the

1156
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,240
prime minister the ceo

1157
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,240
to become cyber security experts

1158
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,520
absolutely not

1159
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,599
but does does that mean that i expect

1160
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,240
them to be engaged to understand what

1161
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,319
the vulnerabilities are

1162
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,960
what the strengths are what steps are

1163
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,240
being taken

1164
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,599
what rewards incentives and other

1165
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,520
measures are in place

1166
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,040
to ensure conformance to policies to

1167
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,319
procedures

1168
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,359
those are the kinds of things that

1169
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,079
are essential i don't care how much

1170
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,760
technology you have

1171
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,240
but unless you have good governance

1172
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,839
unless you have

1173
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,520
active commitment we're not talking

1174
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,040
about passive commitment

1175
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,960
everyone can send out an email to the

1176
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,160
organization and say

1177
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,560
this is important please do your part

1178
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,839
you have to lead

1179
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,359
from the front so so those are certain

1180
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,119
things that come to mind

1181
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,560
as we discuss about raising

1182
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,599
global awareness another point

1183
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,359
human nature we don't act or we don't

1184
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:01,920
react

1185
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,599
unless it happens to us

1186
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,640
what we should be doing and in fact i

1187
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,079
have been advocating this in the

1188
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,680
organizations i talked to

1189
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,920
in the united states i tell them that

1190
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,880
you all do a lot of

1191
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,520
fire drills do you all do information

1192
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,839
security drills

1193
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,319
they are many organizations do tabletop

1194
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:23,359
exercises

1195
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,480
many organizations do simulation i am

1196
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,440
a proponent of more extensive security

1197
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,040
drills

1198
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,640
i came from audit i'm a chartered

1199
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,720
accountant from india

1200
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,760
the traditional audit is too reactive

1201
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,640
we need to get into more real real-time

1202
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,000
proactive audit

1203
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,560
so that we can identify vulnerabilities

1204
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,000
immediately inform

1205
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,520
take action and mitigate risks

1206
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,640
so that's the kind of proactive mindset

1207
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,680
we need to have but it has to start from

1208
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,640
the top

1209
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,160
if the top continues to be oh it's not

1210
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,359
my problem

1211
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:02,720
and yes one more thing that i want to

1212
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,079
add please do not outsource security

1213
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,960
to a team and tell them that's their

1214
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,400
responsibility and

1215
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,240
if something goes wrong we get rid of

1216
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,680
the cso

1217
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,359
we've done our part such a symbolic

1218
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,720
wrong approach everybody

1219
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,280
there has to be shared ownership shared

1220
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,960
responsibility

1221
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,240
that's how we will move forward or else

1222
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,720
we'll keep scratching the surface and we

1223
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,800
will be reinventing the wheel over and

1224
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,760
over again

1225
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,480
we will not be making in any progress

1226
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,280
towards

1227
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,800
getting better at dealing with this

1228
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,440
phenomenon

1229
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,680
great wonderful you do definitely have a

1230
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,800
lot of experience

1231
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,800
i do want to mention that professor dave

1232
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,280
is actually calling us directly from the

1233
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,319
us and

1234
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,160
in his time is local times like

1235
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,920
something like 2 a.m so

1236
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,160
i totally appreciate him being with us

1237
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,599
uh today

1238
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,880
um evelyn um you know

1239
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,480
um one thing that you are uh you know

1240
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,319
a co-founder of is this she hacks key

1241
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,680
did i pronounce that right um

1242
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,240
[Music]

1243
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,720
anyways i would love to hear and the

1244
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,640
audience would love to hear

1245
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,000
um what are some real uh case studies

1246
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,640
uh that that you have personally

1247
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,079
participated in

1248
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,880
that has really made a large impact uh

1249
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,839
in the movement

1250
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,240
uh uh you know again cybercrime in

1251
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:34,880
africa

1252
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,000
if you could share please

1253
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,960
okay so i think uh the best ones i could

1254
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,520
mention

1255
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,040
is mostly education and uh

1256
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,040
on an on campus basis and also

1257
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,680
partnering with different organizations

1258
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,520
that are more mature i hope you guys can

1259
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,880
hear me well right now

1260
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,200
yes you're still a little feeble if you

1261
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,720
can speak a little or we we can

1262
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,160
definitely hear you but if you can be a

1263
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,200
little louder like

1264
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,319
like me then probably the audience would

1265
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,839
hear you very well

1266
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:07,119
okay let me try be a little bit louder

1267
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,720
yes very good thank you okay

1268
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,040
so i think the best thing we've done so

1269
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,480
far is partnering with

1270
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,440
more mature organizations because i can

1271
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:17,760
give

1272
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,760
like an example of among the mature

1273
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,440
organizations here is

1274
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,280
they have really implemented a nice

1275
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,520
platform in terms of their defense

1276
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,559
mechanism

1277
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,040
it's even an extent of having and log

1278
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,720
orchestration tools

1279
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,119
that will help them cap incidences as

1280
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,839
they come

1281
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,880
and not wait until there's a significant

1282
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,520
impact uh compared to like the small and

1283
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,200
medium enterprises

1284
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,040
so with such it's able to give a better

1285
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,960
lesson to different people and

1286
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,200
you're able to learn that it's really

1287
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,319
possible

1288
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,119
to have something that is that is really

1289
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,000
impactful

1290
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,920
and that can gather us against our

1291
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,200
different attacks

1292
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,760
so for such perspectives the key success

1293
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,720
factors is

1294
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,000
partnering with more mature

1295
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
organizations who can

1296
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,480
give better lessons so they can they can

1297
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,720
educate people on the different

1298
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,680
uh lessons or take homes to what they

1299
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,160
have done

1300
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,400
that has worked well and what they can

1301
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,920
do to enable them

1302
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,520
to get to that level that they are in

1303
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,839
yeah and then i think the next thing is

1304
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:20,640
uh

1305
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,280
uh keeping organizations aware that they

1306
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,200
need to segregate tools in terms of to

1307
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,160
have a really

1308
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,359
separate cyber security team because at

1309
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,480
the point where i

1310
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,680
come from is uh it uh the last two years

1311
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,440
it was really hard to find

1312
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,040
different organizations having

1313
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,559
segregated roles

1314
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,559
in the organization that are specialized

1315
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,000
in cyber security

1316
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
so it became a gap where we're not able

1317
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,160
to meet the demands that cyber security

1318
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:46,880
comes in

1319
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,280
and therefore we now become reactive in

1320
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,319
terms of

1321
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,559
this uh there's a risk or a fraud that

1322
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:53,520
has happened is when

1323
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,240
canal do we need an expert to come in so

1324
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:56,960
that became

1325
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,359
a problem and at least organizations

1326
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,720
have started picking up

1327
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,920
to pick talented cyber security that can

1328
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,559
help them

1329
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,200
and or support them and now she has come

1330
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,520
in in a way that we are able to

1331
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,160
to educate more students or more campus

1332
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:12,960
leavers

1333
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,680
so by the time they decide the career

1334
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,760
path they want to choose they're able to

1335
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,640
to get into the cyber security industry

1336
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,640
so in that way we're able to

1337
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,599
to to contribute a significant impact to

1338
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,119
the community

1339
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,680
to our industry in how we are able to

1340
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,160
provide

1341
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,720
talent with our resources to different

1342
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,079
organizations that

1343
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,119
are in need of that yeah and then um

1344
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,920
on i think on the lesson on our scenario

1345
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,240
for

1346
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,720
the small to medium small and medium

1347
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,599
enterprises

1348
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,240
i think that has been mentioned earlier

1349
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,280
but for such

1350
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,400
uh there is luck to to

1351
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,720
not really interested in cyber security

1352
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,400
because our key concern is

1353
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,640
is our solution working is it providing

1354
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,400
the support that we needed to give so we

1355
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,400
can make a profit out of it

1356
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,440
so security now comes in when the

1357
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,680
uh the different regulators ask them we

1358
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,119
need a report

1359
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,520
can we get that so when when a request

1360
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,440
of we need a report comes in is when now

1361
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,240
they can hire

1362
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,800
talent or they can hire someone on a

1363
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,000
short-term basis

1364
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,720
which is not really proactive approach

1365
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,200
compared to when you have someone

1366
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,440
who will be able to to pick up any

1367
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,400
threat or

1368
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,480
any vulnerabilities that are in the

1369
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,160
systems before

1370
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,400
deployment or before this the system is

1371
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,160
now used by customers

1372
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,839
and among the things that are really has

1373
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,280
really contributed to

1374
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,760
better regulations is uh there was an

1375
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,559
act on

1376
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,000
data privacy in kenya that was in um

1377
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,200
that was pushed

1378
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,280
by the government and it's mostly

1379
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,119
centered towards the gdpr

1380
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,760
so with such a platform people are able

1381
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,559
to now

1382
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,160
be more aware like we really need to

1383
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,680
secure our data and now that's

1384
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,520
that increases the chances of different

1385
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,880
organizations

1386
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,040
picking up uh different cyber security

1387
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,920
talents

1388
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,880
uh so that they're able to to adhere to

1389
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,599
the different

1390
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,200
um requirements for data privacy and for

1391
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,200
my data because that is what is really

1392
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,920
key and anyone can get it and sell it

1393
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,720
as mostly the freelance parties in in

1394
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,400
africa rather or in kenya

1395
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,400
they're really smart and they have

1396
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,240
different ways and they're very skilled

1397
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,920
and they can do anything and everything

1398
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,559
to get that data and they're able to

1399
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,680
to use it for malicious activities

1400
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,880
so i hope i've answered your question

1401
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,920
very well in fact evelyn you hit home a

1402
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,480
very very important point that kind of

1403
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,559
addressed my earlier question which is

1404
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:39,200
really

1405
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,480
training school children when they are

1406
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,040
young

1407
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,400
to be able to uh you know understand

1408
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,760
these types of

1409
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,280
issues and really be prepared and be

1410
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,960
defensive in fact that's what amrita

1411
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,119
does in fact we do a very very large

1412
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,000
program reaching out to school children

1413
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,920
and we've seen several other countries

1414
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,960
also do it

1415
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,000
uh very very well and that's how we feel

1416
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,559
people are able to you know take a a

1417
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,720
significant amount of acceleration in

1418
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,440
terms of

1419
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,559
really propagating information to uh you

1420
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,720
know the large masses like you can say

1421
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,800
uh you know teaching a child means

1422
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,000
teaching an entire family

1423
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,680
potentially or you know trying to be

1424
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,359
secure because they would proactively do

1425
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:21,839
that

1426
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,040
how large is your organization

1427
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,520
uh i think we are it's a thousand

1428
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,880
participants but

1429
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,800
for campus we have different we have

1430
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,599
around more than 100 campuses in kenya

1431
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,680
so we have different representatives

1432
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,760
from the schools that are able to plan

1433
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,119
activities and

1434
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,359
just source for trainers from the

1435
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,440
experience team like myself and any

1436
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,160
other person

1437
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,319
in our team who can support them for

1438
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,000
such training sessions

1439
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,319
that's very very impressive i'm not sure

1440
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:51,359
if we have uh

1441
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,920
any such organization here in india but

1442
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,640
uh

1443
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,640
anyway we look forward to uh

1444
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,000
collaborating with you

1445
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,319
uh and learning from you as well um

1446
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,720
now i just wanted to like uh change the

1447
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,240
direction of our talk

1448
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,480
we'd be focused a little bit on covet

1449
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,920
and it's impact

1450
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,359
but let me just uh uh share a quote uh

1451
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:16,720
with you from our uh from the founder of

1452
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,920
the world economic

1453
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,960
forum uh claus uh schwab

1454
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,440
um he says that basically we all know

1455
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,640
that cyber pandemic could be worse than

1456
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,720
the current global crisis which is

1457
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,520
uh related to covet 19 we all know but

1458
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,160
still

1459
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,599
paying sufficient attention to the

1460
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,200
frightening scenario

1461
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,440
of comprehensive cyber attack which

1462
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,240
could really

1463
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,720
bring a complete halt to the power

1464
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,680
supply

1465
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,720
transportation hospital services and our

1466
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,400
society as a whole

1467
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,839
so in that situation uh the covert 19

1468
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:52,640
crisis

1469
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,720
would seem in this respect as a very

1470
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,000
small disturbance

1471
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,040
in comparison to a major cyber attack

1472
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,079
so my question to you mr animesh uh raw

1473
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,520
is do you plan or do you

1474
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,599
envision something like this happening

1475
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,920
to a large city like delhi for example

1476
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,240
the capital city of india

1477
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,960
are we really prepared to look at a

1478
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,520
potential for a cyber pandemic or do you

1479
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:25,520
think it is imminent

1480
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,680
you see ma'am it's a continuous process

1481
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,520
i mean it's a work in progress

1482
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,440
uh if we say that you know

1483
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,040
identifying the threat assessing its

1484
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,400
magnitude

1485
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,760
and uh making

1486
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,359
uh or taking measures to address it

1487
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,640
so it is not something which uh uh

1488
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,240
small if we if we check if we see at a

1489
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:52,799
global

1490
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,200
global level a small law enforcement

1491
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,319
agency for a

1492
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:57,599
you know national capital directory of

1493
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,680
delhi can alone do it

1494
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,240
it is something which has to be done at

1495
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,319
the global level because the threats

1496
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:07,920
do not uh originate from my territory

1497
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,599
they originate from across the country

1498
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,480
or rather from across the globe uh for

1499
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,280
instance

1500
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,920
when we talk about covet in fact we have

1501
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,280
come across

1502
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,799
uh malicious applications

1503
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:23,359
that were run initially in the name of

1504
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,040
you know providing information related

1505
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,640
to covet

1506
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,480
uh which came from across the borders in

1507
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,680
fact so

1508
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,799
they were they were being pushed through

1509
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,599
instant messaging apps later on when

1510
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:36,559
vaccine came

1511
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,520
we came across uh you know websites

1512
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,200
selling like vaccines

1513
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,400
to individuals in india

1514
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,559
you know and they were all fake sites

1515
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:47,599
and they were also

1516
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:52,079
coming from across the borders so

1517
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,200
you know addressing this issue uh by

1518
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,240
taking action on

1519
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,040
our end individually is something which

1520
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,480
is not going to solve the problem we

1521
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,599
know that

1522
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,839
and we have been escalating our concerns

1523
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,960
with

1524
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,040
all the stakeholders through the

1525
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,280
appropriate government authority

1526
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,839
for instance in india we have an indian

1527
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,400
cyber crime coordination center ifoc

1528
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,920
which foresees and which

1529
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,839
coordinates action among all the

1530
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,200
stakeholders

1531
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,359
on such issues so we have been

1532
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,520
escalating our concerns to them

1533
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,079
they have been taking it up with the

1534
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,359
corresponding ministries in the

1535
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,760
government with other stakeholders

1536
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,880
uh across you know platforms

1537
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,559
so as to address the concerns so it is

1538
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,599
something which is an evolving challenge

1539
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,000
now that we are all connected with each

1540
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,599
other

1541
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,119
we have systems or hardware which come

1542
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:49,839
from

1543
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,040
across the borders we don't know whether

1544
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,480
they are you know

1545
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,400
pre-emitted with something which can

1546
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,640
affect our national security

1547
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,680
uh or other challenges so there are

1548
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,839
there are concerns which uh are

1549
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,640
there and are in such huge proportion

1550
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:08,960
that

1551
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,440
uh for any law enforcement agency or for

1552
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,319
any in fact

1553
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,319
sector of the government to individually

1554
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,160
address is difficult

1555
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,480
we need to have a very coordinated and

1556
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,920
comprehensive approach

1557
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,160
across board to address all those issues

1558
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,119
for instance

1559
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,359
i can i can tell you about a very

1560
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,960
particular case

1561
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,960
uh in which malicious applications

1562
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,520
in fact there were some malicious that

1563
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,559
they were

1564
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,799
tagged as malicious by two three

1565
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:37,599
different different

1566
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,400
uh you know like virus total and others

1567
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,400
as malicious and

1568
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,000
these applications they were being

1569
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,680
pushed uh

1570
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,720
in the guise of you know online games in

1571
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,000
the guise of online

1572
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,040
uh you know advertising

1573
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,240
in the guise of digital marketing

1574
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,559
applications

1575
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,680
through instant messaging apps

1576
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:05,599
and to spread them faster

1577
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,839
the technique that was being used was of

1578
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:09,040
multi-level marketing

1579
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,760
so the persons who were the initial

1580
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,720
recipients of

1581
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,200
these malicious app links once they

1582
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,799
downloaded the app

1583
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,480
they were asked to share the link with

1584
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,599
others so that they can benefit from

1585
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,920
the subsequent activities being

1586
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,280
performed by the others this is the

1587
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,880
typical mlm rule

1588
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,960
so it was being pushed through instant

1589
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,119
messaging which is a very popular

1590
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,319
you know method being used in india

1591
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,960
they were exponentially spread using the

1592
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,880
technique of mlm which is a you know

1593
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,079
a time tested method of uh pushing uh

1594
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,200
unlawful things and

1595
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,520
the worrying part is that not only the

1596
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,119
apps were malicious and they were you

1597
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:49,599
know

1598
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,319
compromising the basic data security of

1599
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,079
individual devices

1600
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,520
but they had a method in them wherein

1601
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,760
they were targeting the social media

1602
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,200
presence of

1603
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,400
the users who were targeted for instance

1604
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,520
one of these applications what it was

1605
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,400
asking

1606
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,599
individuals was that you please

1607
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,720
like and follow specific

1608
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,760
social media accounts on social media

1609
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,280
platforms such as facebook

1610
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,720
youtube instagram and so on

1611
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,359
and these accounts and profiles they

1612
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,359
were kind of anonymous accounts

1613
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,440
from the their perusal of these accounts

1614
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,559
you cannot make out

1615
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:33,200
who is the custodian on the owner of

1616
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,799
that particular account so they may be

1617
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:35,520
operated by

1618
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,520
individuals who have some malicious

1619
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,359
intent some vested interest

1620
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,040
and by liking and following these

1621
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,400
accounts

1622
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,680
basically you are pushing yourself into

1623
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,799
their trap where

1624
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,920
later on they can push

1625
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,319
feeds which will manipulate your thought

1626
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,559
process which can you know guide you

1627
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,960
towards certain activities which may be

1628
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,160
detrimental to

1629
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,200
your safety to your country's security

1630
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,280
and so on and by pushing these

1631
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,880
applications through the multi-level

1632
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,240
marketing route

1633
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,079
to millions and millions of individuals

1634
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,280
within a country

1635
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,520
you are basically hacking into the minds

1636
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,119
of an entire nation

1637
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,599
so if this kind of an activity is being

1638
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:16,480
done

1639
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,839
in the guise of suppose forward or

1640
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,839
you know just because people have been

1641
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,440
using more devices

1642
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,119
are more connected during the covet

1643
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,960
lockdown periods

1644
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,720
this is something which is very varying

1645
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,000
we have escalated it

1646
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,839
to the government and government is also

1647
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,280
taking corrective measures

1648
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,480
but but just to stop such things

1649
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,839
you know you have to speak to the

1650
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,440
counterpart in a different government

1651
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,079
different

1652
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,480
territory altogether and i i believe

1653
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,760
that it is a

1654
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,079
task which is not that easy so the

1655
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,680
challenges are there

1656
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,040
our job as the law enforcement entity is

1657
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,000
to identify these challenges proactively

1658
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,119
to articulate

1659
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,920
our concerns and escalate it to the

1660
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,640
government

1661
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,559
to all the stakeholders concerned so

1662
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,880
that appropriate measures can be taken

1663
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,680
to counter them

1664
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:10,160
wonderful thank you so much my next

1665
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,040
question is to miss

1666
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,400
uh basically like you know

1667
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,079
uh again addressing the fact that uh

1668
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,960
a cyber pandemic could happen uh what

1669
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:21,440
would

1670
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,440
uh you know israel say security

1671
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,200
operation centers or their computer

1672
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,480
security

1673
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,760
incident response team do uh you know or

1674
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,040
what is it doing in

1675
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,960
for preparing itself for such a

1676
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:38,480
potential pandemic

1677
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,559
um i just want to um repeat the question

1678
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:45,119
when you mean pandemic you mean the last

1679
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,640
so i just quoted

1680
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,000
i just quoted the world economic forum

1681
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,319
um founder mr claus schwab's quote

1682
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:57,359
saying that the code pandemic might look

1683
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,359
like a small disturbance

1684
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:02,160
uh in comparison to a potential cyber

1685
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,119
pandemic

1686
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,400
where there could be a complete havoc

1687
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,119
cost by shutting down of various

1688
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:10,880
different supplies the transportation

1689
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,760
the financial

1690
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,799
the banks uh the water supply the

1691
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,960
hospital services etc

1692
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,079
so obviously this is a potentially uh

1693
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,640
you know a scenario that can be very

1694
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,599
easily

1695
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:25,680
recognized and realized today because

1696
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,960
you're seeing this

1697
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,440
you know exponential growth you know in

1698
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,359
these types of cyber crime and how are

1699
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:34,799
you really preparing yourself for it

1700
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,599
right so how do you prepare a serve for

1701
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:38,480
it

1702
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,520
um i think the best way to prepare

1703
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,880
my workers my teams for this is

1704
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,920
really trainings we do trainings all the

1705
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,400
time

1706
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,400
to our teams we simulate a really cyber

1707
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,079
pandemic we simulate

1708
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:57,039
that all our organization computers are

1709
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:57,680
down

1710
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,240
or the network is down and nothing is

1711
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,119
working

1712
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,240
so training is a is the number one

1713
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,920
solution uh for my opinion we have a

1714
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,119
pen interesting a penetrating

1715
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,559
test teams that also help us in this

1716
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:15,200
goal

1717
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,920
to really prepare our teams to the real

1718
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,359
pandemic

1719
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:22,319
so i can bring myself and my workers my

1720
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:22,960
teams

1721
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,559
to the best level i can that in the next

1722
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,559
cyber pandemic or in the next uh

1723
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,039
event that will happen i will i will

1724
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:33,920
come

1725
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,039
as prepared as i can sometimes the

1726
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,480
cyber world and the war

1727
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,680
world are there are a lot of matches

1728
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,799
between those worlds um sometimes i find

1729
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:47,520
myself

1730
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,640
thinking like how do i attack back how

1731
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,480
do i manage all these things

1732
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,680
um where did the attacker came from i

1733
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,119
need to find it

1734
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,280
it's like sometimes i really feel like

1735
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,280
i'm going on a war right now

1736
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,119
against the attacker and i need to know

1737
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,480
what to do so

1738
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,079
training trainings is the number one uh

1739
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,480
thing that we do to really prepare

1740
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,599
ourselves

1741
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,240
and the second thing we do is also we

1742
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,920
are always looking for

1743
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,119
a the new things that the

1744
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,160
attackers do online if there is a new

1745
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:22,559
thing

1746
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,680
there is a new language

1747
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,640
i mean software language that attackers

1748
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,000
like to use right now

1749
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,119
so we are looking for it and we are all

1750
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,000
always we are searching for new things

1751
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,280
always searching for new

1752
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,000
vulnerabilities that a cat that come

1753
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,799
online

1754
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:43,839
and uh we're thinking how to

1755
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,400
manage those vulnerabilities and how to

1756
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,400
uh protect our organization how to

1757
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,520
protect israel

1758
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,359
from those vulnerabilities um also

1759
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:56,559
my job in my organization is really to

1760
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,680
take this awareness and work on it it's

1761
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,440
not simple to work

1762
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,799
on awareness among people and that don't

1763
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:06,480
practice cyber security

1764
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,359
not easy task at all uh it's always

1765
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:10,559
there because

1766
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:14,480
those people have power on the network

1767
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,960
they hold very very high very privileged

1768
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,240
users with very privileged permissions

1769
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,359
and it's really hard task and it's also

1770
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,680
something we're working on all the time

1771
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,640
and

1772
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,960
also we are always looking for new

1773
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,839
technologies

1774
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:35,920
a new new technologies new antiviruses

1775
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:36,319
where

1776
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:38,720
we don't want to be left behind in the

1777
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,720
technology of the cyber security

1778
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,160
so it's something that we're always

1779
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,160
looking for uh

1780
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,960
and also always looking for the things

1781
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,359
that

1782
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:50,720
is wrong in our network uh for example

1783
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:54,079
a user that this worker is gone in the

1784
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:54,640
network

1785
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,480
i mean this user uh has been fired

1786
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,760
like last month so but his user

1787
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,319
with privilege permissions still exist

1788
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:05,359
in the network

1789
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:08,160
so we're looking for always these tiny

1790
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,200
things that

1791
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,839
can give the attacker let's say gifts

1792
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,599
and we don't want to give the attacker

1793
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:14,400
gifts

1794
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,480
in our network and so this is also

1795
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,079
and we also are always looking for

1796
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,200
new techniques and new um

1797
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,000
new identifications of attackers and

1798
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,599
today attackers

1799
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,760
they're not only attacking their

1800
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,400
attackers and specific tools that have

1801
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,680
a behavior specific behavior

1802
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,359
that you can identify so

1803
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:44,640
when we see a code we see the malware

1804
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,200
and we're looking for the code we can

1805
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,079
see

1806
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:53,440
specific type of writing and then we can

1807
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,920
we can try to identify the attacker by

1808
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,880
the writing

1809
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,000
usually attackers they they change

1810
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,160
the way they attack but they don't

1811
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,000
change the way they write their malware

1812
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,039
and they don't change the their

1813
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,760
their professional techniques so there

1814
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,280
are a lot of attackers

1815
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,319
in the network that have this uh they

1816
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,240
say identifications

1817
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,359
um i think this is there really the most

1818
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:22,480
thank you professor dave

1819
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,240
i would love to hear your thoughts on a

1820
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:29,839
cyber pandemic

1821
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,640
absolutely in fact i'd like to add to

1822
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,280
something

1823
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,680
the question that you asked me last time

1824
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,319
so how do

1825
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,799
how do you raise the level of awareness

1826
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:40,720
in a country like india

1827
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,039
where you know a majority of the

1828
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,960
population is under poverty level they

1829
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,039
don't don't have access to the best of

1830
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:48,880
technologies you know the thought comes

1831
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,960
to mind is

1832
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,000
uh we should we should have movies

1833
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,960
with cyber threats cyber security as a

1834
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:57,920
team

1835
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,160
we should have shows i've even

1836
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:00,960
envisioned

1837
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,319
writing something for a broadway show or

1838
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:05,520
something just

1839
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,680
to kind of popularize the significance

1840
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,319
of this phenomenon and how we all need

1841
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:14,079
to do our part

1842
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:16,479
and that would be another way over and

1843
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,000
above the training

1844
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,399
that your organizations are imparting

1845
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:21,920
and i think that's a

1846
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,880
phenomenal initiative and i'm sure you

1847
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,319
are building in

1848
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,880
uh training that is very interesting

1849
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,640
lots of gamification

1850
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,479
because one thing i have seen in the

1851
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,640
corporate world

1852
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,880
in fact there is a lot of research that

1853
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,120
has found that training becomes

1854
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,479
ineffective

1855
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:43,120
if it is not customized if it is not

1856
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,719
personalized

1857
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:48,080
and if people are not having fun with it

1858
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,960
training also becomes ineffective if

1859
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,359
properly proper assessment doesn't

1860
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,960
happen

1861
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,080
we all have our yearly training in our

1862
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,920
respective organizations

1863
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,520
and i don't mean to be critical it's

1864
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,679
always a challenge to do the best you

1865
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:04,479
can

1866
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,920
but it's very easy to find workarounds

1867
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,920
and not really hone in on what is being

1868
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,799
said or what is trying to be taught so

1869
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:17,279
the approaches need to be more rigorous

1870
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,238
there needs to be better ways of getting

1871
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,120
feedback

1872
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,960
the assessment system needs to be more

1873
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,158
effective

1874
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:25,920
so those are certain things that came to

1875
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,719
mind another point i'd like to make

1876
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:30,319
and that is from the standpoint of

1877
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:31,759
preparedness

1878
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:34,319
how prepared are we as a nation as a

1879
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:35,839
globe

1880
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:39,920
as we saw with the coronavirus pandemic

1881
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,359
we were so not prepared and not to put

1882
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,880
any blame on any specific organizations

1883
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,799
who whose prime job is

1884
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:54,000
in this area of you know

1885
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,880
watching over these kinds of uh

1886
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,960
pandemics

1887
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,960
i think in a bigger scheme of things a

1888
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,000
couple of things needs to

1889
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
happen leadership has to think a little

1890
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,040
beyond the short term

1891
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,840
i can speak for at least the united

1892
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,960
states

1893
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,520
they're focusing on taking steps to

1894
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,000
improve

1895
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,679
the economy healthcare is important

1896
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,040
but it isn't it's kind of down

1897
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,320
stream you know oftentimes we tend to

1898
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:30,800
ignore certain areas which if

1899
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,520
compromise can hurt us really bad which

1900
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:33,920
is

1901
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,159
what corporate needs to recognize that

1902
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:37,199
yes

1903
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,360
cyber security is not why you are in

1904
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,800
business

1905
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,000
but on the unfortunate reality is cyber

1906
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,080
security needs to become a core

1907
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,360
capability

1908
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,199
cyber security needs to become a

1909
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:51,199
strategic competency

1910
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:54,080
if you want to survive and thrive and i

1911
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,600
don't believe the message is

1912
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,640
any different for a country

1913
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,159
another point alignment

1914
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:04,719
unfortunate reality 50 states in the

1915
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,320
united states

1916
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,199
we don't have a single standard we can't

1917
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:09,600
do

1918
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,520
anything in a coherent cohesive manner

1919
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,080
and i believe the problem is not unique

1920
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,360
to the united states

1921
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,920
it's everywhere but when you are dealing

1922
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,159
with a global phenomenon

1923
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:24,880
such as a cyber security pandemic or a

1924
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,640
coronavirus pandemic

1925
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,560
we need to come together we need to have

1926
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,640
some cohesive plans

1927
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,600
and it's no doubt it's it's easier said

1928
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,320
than done

1929
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,040
but at least the leadership mindset

1930
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,719
needs to recognize

1931
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:42,320
and every effort be made to

1932
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,600
stay together and execute

1933
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,280
consistently effectively one final point

1934
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,719
from a performance assessment standpoint

1935
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:54,880
there is no doubt that despite all

1936
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,360
efforts any organization can or will be

1937
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,400
breached

1938
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:02,400
what is more important is to assess

1939
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,320
is to strive to improve your recovery

1940
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:06,960
time

1941
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,719
how quickly can you recover from a

1942
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,199
breach and be back to normal

1943
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:13,199
and that applies to companies that

1944
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:14,719
applies to nations

1945
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:16,640
and that's where there has to be

1946
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:17,920
proactive efforts

1947
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,600
there has to be simulations um

1948
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,480
so a lot more thought needs to go in the

1949
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,800
national or the international

1950
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,360
you know consciousness in this area

1951
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,159
needs to go

1952
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:32,960
up so a lot of things has to happen and

1953
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,239
there needs to be

1954
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,800
more widespread cooperation or

1955
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,560
coordination because if we don't have

1956
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,440
that

1957
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,080
you know it's uh it's easy for the

1958
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,679
hackers to break in

1959
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:46,800
um so it's a big challenge and i'm glad

1960
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,440
we are

1961
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,839
having this discussion today

1962
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,880
uh you actually touched on the point

1963
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,960
that mr sandwich mentioned earlier which

1964
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,239
is really a lot of

1965
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,719
reluctance on the part of many

1966
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,480
stakeholders to really make genuine

1967
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,320
efforts to address issues

1968
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,520
now if you really see many companies uh

1969
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,760
even the large companies i think this

1970
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,080
morning we heard a talk from dr

1971
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,560
uh pretty shivasta from intel where she

1972
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,400
mentioned about even google

1973
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:23,599
not wanting to share uh data uh you know

1974
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,920
or or you know share more information on

1975
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,920
on data breaches and i don't know if

1976
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,000
i got her completely right but that's

1977
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,600
kind of what she mentioned and

1978
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,520
any of the audience that participated in

1979
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,960
her talk and correct me

1980
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,199
if i'm wrong by by stating so in the

1981
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:39,760
chat uh the point is that companies

1982
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,800
are not likely to come out in public and

1983
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,600
even if they

1984
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,719
uh do not in in uh so

1985
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:49,040
so because they feel very embarrassed

1986
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,960
very ashamed of the fact that they

1987
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,600
have become a victim of cyber crime is

1988
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,880
that something that you see

1989
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,199
constantly uh you know in interacting

1990
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,120
with these multinational companies

1991
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,440
uh how do we really go forward i mean we

1992
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,719
are talking about this

1993
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:04,480
you know they are going to benefit

1994
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,719
themselves potentially in the long run

1995
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,199
uh with with a more open um mindedness

1996
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:13,679
so so what is your suggestion or what is

1997
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:14,719
your thoughts on

1998
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:18,159
on really addressing that so um

1999
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,480
you know again i'm glad you brought

2000
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,840
brought this point up

2001
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,600
because you know uh when i was writing

2002
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,520
my book i was searching through court

2003
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,719
records

2004
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,080
to learn more about um you know what was

2005
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,159
compromised how it was compromised what

2006
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:33,120
were the damages

2007
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,880
because you're exactly right no company

2008
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,400
is going to come out and and tell the

2009
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,199
world

2010
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,120
hey here is our vulnerability we got

2011
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,400
compromised unless

2012
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:44,559
they have to when they are being sued

2013
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:47,600
the two key themes kept coming up time

2014
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,320
and again

2015
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,880
one was companies were found to be

2016
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,239
negligent

2017
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:56,239
they were found not to do due diligence

2018
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:58,400
they were not doing the basic things

2019
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,679
that need to do

2020
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:02,480
to secure data of all relevant

2021
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,080
stakeholders

2022
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:08,320
the second transparency

2023
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,960
they need to inform the affected

2024
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,040
individuals the victims

2025
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,480
as soon as possible what has happened

2026
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,360
i know of several cases where it took

2027
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,560
not one attack

2028
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,440
two attacks before the organization said

2029
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,719
okay okay

2030
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,199
we we will talk and we will share now

2031
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:28,960
they thought the first attack

2032
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,000
you know it happened you know they can

2033
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,640
just

2034
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,679
keep quiet about it maybe it'll pass

2035
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:37,920
and that's precisely the wrong approach

2036
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,280
they didn't take

2037
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,120
the reactive measures leave alone

2038
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,280
proactive measures they got again hacked

2039
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,199
now this time they sit up and they start

2040
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:46,320
sharing

2041
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,120
so why is this happening again research

2042
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:49,840
finds

2043
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,960
unfortunately when a company is attacked

2044
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,719
breached there is not that significant

2045
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,159
data to city especially large

2046
01:15:58,159 --> 01:15:59,360
organizations

2047
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,800
that that hurts them long term

2048
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,600
there is some impact on their stocks but

2049
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,920
long term they are still okay

2050
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,640
so companies feel that you know what

2051
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,400
this is a tough challenge

2052
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,960
this is not why we are in the business

2053
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,719
we don't want to ignore it but we don't

2054
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:17,280
want to

2055
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,760
really hone in on this i'll give you an

2056
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,560
interesting

2057
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,960
share with you an interesting story the

2058
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,280
senior leadership of a hospital

2059
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:29,199
were meeting and the ceo of the hospital

2060
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:32,000
looked at the leadership and said folks

2061
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,040
we are here

2062
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,320
to provide quality patient care

2063
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,600
being secure digitally is important

2064
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,000
but that's not our mission so please

2065
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,760
focus on quality care

2066
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,560
if something were to happen we'll figure

2067
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,480
out figure it out then

2068
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,960
another anecdote again from the

2069
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,719
healthcare industry

2070
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:55,440
this gentleman says you know our

2071
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,440
networks are so complex

2072
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,280
and then we interface with external

2073
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,679
service providers

2074
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:04,640
i actually would like to be breached so

2075
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:04,960
i

2076
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,920
know where my vulnerabilities are

2077
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,800
because we are too

2078
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,400
complex i'm at a loss to figure out

2079
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:15,840
what to focus on so that's the kind of

2080
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,440
muddled approach

2081
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,719
to cyber security preparedness that i

2082
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,880
have seen in fact i have an article

2083
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,679
with a couple of co-authors on a model

2084
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,600
approach to cyber security

2085
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,920
which i have found in many healthcare

2086
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,640
organizations

2087
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,440
wonderful i would like i would like if i

2088
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,360
made to a

2089
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,839
yes please

2090
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,600
i would like to comment to a mr dave

2091
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,960
um first when he said before about the

2092
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:51,920
trainings

2093
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,080
i couldn't agree with you more the

2094
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,280
training should be

2095
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,960
effective and it becomes not effective

2096
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,000
when the people

2097
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,800
are not in joining are not enjoying it

2098
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:03,920
so

2099
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,880
i really really agree with you and the

2100
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:07,199
this

2101
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:10,159
is another challenge in the trainings to

2102
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:11,040
let people

2103
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,840
enjoy the ride not only enjoy the ride

2104
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:14,880
and also

2105
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,920
give them a feeling of capability

2106
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,880
you want to give the the people that a

2107
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,560
feeling that they can

2108
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,239
to manage this complicated event

2109
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:29,760
and in in israel we have a lot of

2110
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,920
organizations to do cyber security

2111
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,199
uh we do a lot of trainings uh also

2112
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:37,199
white box grey box black box

2113
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:39,199
anything that can simulate any kind of

2114
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:40,880
enemy and it's really

2115
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,080
er i don't want to speak for every

2116
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,440
organization because i don't know what

2117
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,080
happens

2118
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,040
we have a lot organizations but we

2119
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,320
really

2120
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,400
do the best effort to really simulate it

2121
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,520
exactly as

2122
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,840
a true attacker and after that you said

2123
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:58,640
about

2124
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,239
um the organization itself how they move

2125
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:03,520
on after a

2126
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,719
a cyber event really complicated mission

2127
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:09,360
i think you're a i think you're right

2128
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,719
very complicated mission

2129
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:13,760
and the right way to do that is really

2130
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,360
not to take the heads down of the people

2131
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,480
and really give the awareness to the

2132
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,360
people because

2133
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:25,520
you said uh correctly that when the ceo

2134
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,719
and when the when the rest of the people

2135
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:31,199
of their organization say this is not my

2136
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:32,400
responsibility

2137
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,040
and let the cecil handle this so they

2138
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,159
will find themselves

2139
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:39,199
in a very very tough situation when

2140
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:42,080
there will be a cyber event and that's

2141
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,559
it thank you

2142
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,199
thank you ms lira for your thoughts on

2143
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,480
that um

2144
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,000
i had a question for miss evelyn um

2145
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,560
uh uh ms edwin you said that you're a

2146
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,320
computer scientist right so

2147
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,920
um you would uh uh probably have heard

2148
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,159
of this terminology called trust

2149
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:04,560
uh you know computer science is a very

2150
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,600
elaborate

2151
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,520
definition of trust and trust

2152
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,280
is kind of the reason you could say

2153
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,800
fundamentally why

2154
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,679
we become so vulnerable uh if we did not

2155
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:16,159
trust

2156
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,639
probably we would take more precautions

2157
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:19,520
i would say

2158
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,880
um right um uh so so i don't know what

2159
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:23,920
your thoughts are so

2160
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,000
so i guess this technology is really

2161
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,760
evolving towards the direction

2162
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,719
through trust really where zero trust

2163
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:33,040
means it only allows

2164
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,639
very specific limited access to services

2165
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:39,760
data applications etc

2166
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,040
and and and also to people whose

2167
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,040
credentials are verified

2168
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,199
and just for the amount of time that

2169
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:48,239
they need to

2170
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:51,520
is this something evi is doing um from

2171
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,480
in your understanding

2172
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,239
i hope i've continued correctly so uh

2173
01:20:58,239 --> 01:20:59,440
basically

2174
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,800
run around trust right so

2175
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,199
uh my opinion to that is uh the key

2176
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:06,719
thing that we work with or

2177
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:08,719
the key motor for our organization or

2178
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:09,920
where i work for

2179
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,320
is just you can trust but you have to

2180
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,880
verify that this is exactly

2181
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,320
what i trusted am i able to come to the

2182
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,440
ground that i'm

2183
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:22,560
this is actually true or not because um

2184
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,440
that's how social engineering works

2185
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,159
because

2186
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:28,639
let's give our best example like as you

2187
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:31,199
go to the festive season of christmas

2188
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,400
or the okay from my perspective so

2189
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,719
in that way we we have different offers

2190
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,639
from different organization

2191
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:41,199
so you you're shared for a link so for a

2192
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,120
normal user who doesn't really have an

2193
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,560
idea of what that is

2194
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,400
they can always trust but they cannot

2195
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,400
verify whether that link is a malicious

2196
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,040
link

2197
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:52,000
or it's not a malicious link so uh from

2198
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,120
my perspective

2199
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:56,320
trust is there but you have to verify

2200
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,760
that that aspect of trust and if i talk

2201
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,400
about

2202
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,239
maybe something like privileged access

2203
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,719
management why do you have such things

2204
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,920
for different organizations so uh with

2205
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,000
that it's able to trust and verify

2206
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,360
also in terms of this is

2207
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,520
the actual user that was trying to log

2208
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,280
into this particular system

2209
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,520
and what exactly what they're trying to

2210
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,800
manage or to do

2211
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,880
so when you have a platform that can

2212
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,719
help you verify the trust as

2213
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:27,760
perspective is it's it's gonna work

2214
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:28,719
magic and

2215
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:31,280
i think that in that way you're able to

2216
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,159
to counter

2217
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:35,760
different different uh different uh

2218
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,639
different attack scenarios or different

2219
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:40,400
malicious intents that could come

2220
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,360
up so the key aspect i'd always believe

2221
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:43,760
is

2222
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,600
you can always trust but make sure you

2223
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,840
have the verification to it

2224
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,040
and make sure that there's some

2225
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,840
governance around that trust perspective

2226
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,760
so with governance you're able to have

2227
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,840
like a roadmap in how best you can

2228
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,600
manage our

2229
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,360
trust yes thank you so we are actually

2230
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,080
coming to

2231
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,480
almost uh the end of the session so i

2232
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,000
would love to welcome your

2233
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,719
uh closing remarks mr anwaresh roy you

2234
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,960
could just uh summarize what

2235
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,159
you'd like us uh to take away as key

2236
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:15,199
thoughts from you

2237
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,760
uh potentially to work on or to share

2238
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,520
with this audience please please

2239
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:23,280
feel free to share in a minute or so

2240
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,120
thank you ma'am as all the panelists in

2241
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,159
fact have

2242
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:33,920
raised very valid issues and concerns

2243
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:34,639
and

2244
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:37,040
we all you know identify the problems

2245
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,400
the handicaps

2246
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,159
the obstacles the bottlenecks

2247
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,840
bottlenecks

2248
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,159
uh the thing is that you know everybody

2249
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:45,840
has to

2250
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,280
move in the right direction in a

2251
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,040
coordinated manner

2252
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,000
and how how we can attain that from the

2253
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:52,719
government's

2254
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,840
perspective we like to have solutions

2255
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,880
which are simple

2256
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:01,120
and enforceable one one solution that

2257
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,840
comes to my mind is that you know like

2258
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,360
for instance we have corporate

2259
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:09,040
social responsibility which is mandated

2260
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,400
by law now

2261
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:14,080
so similarly we can have an id

2262
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:17,679
security responsibility for

2263
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:20,719
you know organizations of a certain

2264
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,239
level and above

2265
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:25,600
and so that they can you know

2266
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,719
be mandated to devote a certain portion

2267
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:30,080
of their

2268
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,840
revenues on securing

2269
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,800
the id infrastructure that they have and

2270
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,920
because ultimately

2271
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:41,520
it is a problem of prioritizing your

2272
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,800
finances to secure the assets

2273
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,080
so depending on the nature of the

2274
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,719
organization its scale it can devote

2275
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,000
proportionate resources to secure itself

2276
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,360
a second area where your

2277
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,080
institution is working and definitely

2278
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:58,800
there are

2279
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,480
other organizations which are working on

2280
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,000
it is to

2281
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,719
create good human resource

2282
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:10,400
which can service the i.t security

2283
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,920
sector of this country so

2284
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,960
presently what we are finding is as

2285
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,400
one of the panelists raised this issue

2286
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,560
that they have their i.t guys

2287
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,480
but these it guys are actually not aware

2288
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,840
of the

2289
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,000
security concerns that the organization

2290
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,719
faces and they are basically doing

2291
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:31,280
the routine you know id related

2292
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,639
activities rather than

2293
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:36,159
looking into you know to

2294
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:39,280
update the security patches

2295
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,760
to ensure that the best practices are

2296
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,120
followed and so on

2297
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:46,159
so we need to have a sufficiently

2298
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:47,120
trained

2299
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,320
human resource which is available at a

2300
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,199
reasonable cost to the organizations so

2301
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:54,320
that they can

2302
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,199
avail their services so these are the

2303
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:58,000
broad

2304
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,840
things that we can do and at the same

2305
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,000
time as the human element

2306
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,159
appears to be the most you know critical

2307
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,639
one and the weakest link

2308
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:09,679
we need to inculcate more uh

2309
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:13,199
you know specific literature and

2310
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:17,520
more direct ways to expose them to

2311
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,719
concerns about you know what are the

2312
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:22,719
cyber threats that they are facing and

2313
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,639
what are the safe online habits

2314
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:27,760
that they need to inculcate and practice

2315
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,480
to secure themselves and their

2316
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,480
surroundings their organizations

2317
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,360
so by by having an institutional

2318
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,159
approach

2319
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:38,080
with infrastructure support with

2320
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,199
proactive you know

2321
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:41,679
nudge from the government from the

2322
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:43,679
regulators

2323
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,760
we can create a system which is more

2324
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,440
proactive because ultimately the

2325
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,960
stresses on proactiveness

2326
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,199
so which is more proactive in addressing

2327
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,239
the concerns

2328
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:55,440
this is all from my side thank you miss

2329
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,199
salira would you like to share your

2330
01:26:57,199 --> 01:27:00,799
closing thoughts in one minute

2331
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,199
and yes i will just say i really enjoy

2332
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:04,239
the panel

2333
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,880
and i think you really gathered the the

2334
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,199
best mind in here in this panel it was

2335
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:09,679
really

2336
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:12,480
a really a really nice panel and i

2337
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,800
really liked everything we talked about

2338
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,320
uh last thoughts um i think

2339
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:21,920
we all share the same minds and the same

2340
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:22,639
thoughts

2341
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:25,679
about how the cybersecurity world is

2342
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:26,480
evolving

2343
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,520
is changing and how we should all uh

2344
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:33,199
gather around this um this effort

2345
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:35,600
to make the world a much more secure and

2346
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,280
to

2347
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,920
and to be really secure from different

2348
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,760
attackers and

2349
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,600
a cyber terror um i think to be

2350
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,560
on the side of the the of the defense is

2351
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,040
much

2352
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:52,080
harder than being an attacker because

2353
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,719
being cyber security defense you always

2354
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:55,199
need to

2355
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,280
find those virtues and defend but an

2356
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,960
attacker

2357
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,199
needs to find only one bridge and get in

2358
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:03,280
and i think that everyone here is

2359
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,040
very talented in what they're doing and

2360
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,719
just keep going with a good job

2361
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:14,000
thank you

2362
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,800
uh thank you thank you ms leon mr dave

2363
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:17,679
your uh

2364
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:21,280
thoughts in a minute absolutely

2365
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,760
once again thank you for the opportunity

2366
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,199
i'd like to echo

2367
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:28,080
what leora said very exciting discussion

2368
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,560
great panelists

2369
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,400
i'd like to end using an example that i

2370
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,760
normally share

2371
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,239
when i'm talking to corporate when there

2372
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,960
is this intent to outsource a problem

2373
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,679
and not deal with it head-on and the

2374
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:45,760
example is that when you send your kids

2375
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,520
to school

2376
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,679
do you assume that okay i'm sending my

2377
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,600
kids to a good school i can just look

2378
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,880
the other way

2379
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,760
or as committed parents you still

2380
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,520
provide oversight

2381
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,000
because at the end of the day your goal

2382
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,480
is that my kids must turn out right

2383
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,040
and i will not just rely on an

2384
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,520
outsourced organization

2385
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,040
who have the expertise i want to

2386
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,520
leverage the expertise but i still will

2387
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,760
do my part

2388
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,440
the best i can so my kids turn out right

2389
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,760
and i use the kids and analogy to draw

2390
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,560
attention

2391
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,040
to the leadership that that's the level

2392
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,760
of genuine commitment that is required

2393
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,960
if we want to make progress in reality

2394
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,239
will that happen

2395
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:32,400
unfortunately not so what's the

2396
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,080
practical aspect of it

2397
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:37,600
we need legislation we need laws

2398
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,520
from the united states standpoint where

2399
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:40,960
serbians oxley was

2400
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,000
introduced because accountants were

2401
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,040
fudging numbers

2402
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:48,400
they were not willing to state the fair

2403
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,639
state of financial affairs similarly

2404
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:52,080
with cyber security

2405
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:55,280
you need that kind of uh

2406
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,840
you know punishment in place for

2407
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,280
organizations

2408
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,320
to do their part but i hope we can find

2409
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:05,679
a balance and we can move forward

2410
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:07,040
thanks for the opportunity to

2411
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:10,480
participate in this discussion today

2412
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,040
thank you so much how about uh you uh

2413
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:13,920
miss evelyn

2414
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,080
uh you're able to share your final

2415
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,040
thoughts

2416
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:20,000
in a minute thank you so much for the

2417
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,600
opportunity

2418
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,239
and i think i'd just like to echo one

2419
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:26,480
element that dave mentioned in terms of

2420
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,080
laws and regulations

2421
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,159
that really contributes to a bigger

2422
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:31,600
impact today to

2423
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,239
the different organizations and entities

2424
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:35,920
that we have

2425
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:39,199
secondly regular security penetration

2426
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:40,159
testing or

2427
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:43,280
regular auditing of systems

2428
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:46,159
for different organizations and thirdly

2429
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:48,239
make sure that we have defense in depth

2430
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:49,440
in the different

2431
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,400
organizations for their defense the

2432
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:53,040
different

2433
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,440
defense teams so we are not able to

2434
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,280
provide loopholes where

2435
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:59,840
our security intruders or attackers can

2436
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:00,960
come in

2437
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,520
yeah and one last thing for the

2438
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:05,600
different participants we have

2439
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,600
for you to understand the different uh

2440
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,040
bridges that has ever

2441
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,760
have ever occurred in the world that we

2442

2443

that were bridged are able to

2450
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,600

uh i thank each one of you for your real

2455
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,920
uh thoughts from that's coming from your

01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,840
in-depth experience dealing with this

2457
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,679
day in and day out

2458
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:46,400
i i also feel at the end of this

2459
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,760
discussion there's a lot

2460
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,880
more to do you know and we

2461
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,960
have just touched the tip of the iceberg

2462
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,639
as they say

2463
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:57,120
and i think we you know take back with

2464
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,719
us all of these thoughts

2465
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:01,280
on uh you know directions that we may

2466
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,040
have to pursue with the

2467
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,960
you know as much as we do not want to

2468
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,120
panic everybody we do have to understand

2469
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,960
that unless it's a collective

2470
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,840
effort to be able to address this uh you

2471
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,679
know we absolutely cannot solve this so

2472
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:15,920
bringing all the right stakeholders

2473
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,560
uh to uh forums uh for more and more

2474
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,159
discussions about this

2475
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:23,600
um bringing academia bringing industry

2476
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,159
to be able to solve some of these in a

2477
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:27,520
very systematic

2478
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,320
but comprehensive way would probably be

2479
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,080
a potential way to address it in a

2480
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,840
relatively short amount of

2481
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,560
time so with that thank you again for
