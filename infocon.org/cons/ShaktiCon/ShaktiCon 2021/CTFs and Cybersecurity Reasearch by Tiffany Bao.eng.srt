at arizona state university she received

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,480
her phd at

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,800
carnegie mellon university and her

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,239
research

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,320
interests are in the area of software

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,360
security

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,840
particularly focusing on the techniques

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,800
measurement

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,600
and strategies to discover assess and

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,160
defend

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,640
software vulnerabilities and this is

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,559
going to be a very interesting talk

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,280
as tiffany will share her experience of

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,320
ctf

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,600
and introduce ctf related research

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,680
which is cyber autonomy in software

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,800
security

32
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,640
you know we all know that security

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,240
researchers have been

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,240
pursuing automated vulnerability

35
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,680
detection techniques

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,080
however you know the human bottleneck

37
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
always remains a challenge

38
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,880
uh so in this talk tiffany will discuss

39
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,560
you know how we remove these

40
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,360
bottlenecks uh because it requires

41
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,280
automatic techniques and intelligent

42
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,439
decision making

43
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,840
and she's also going to leave you with

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,360
some future steps

45
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,680
i know that can mature the cyber

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,880
autonomy into

47
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,840
real world practice uh so over to you

48
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,560
tiffany

49
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,280
and uh yeah looking forward to your talk

50
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,680

my story with you

61
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,439
and talk about the research that i'm

62
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,119
interested in and also

63
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,199
and unlike many of the we're from the

64
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,440
community of like minority we're female

65
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,160
where we have

66
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,440
we are also other minority uh people i

67
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,920
would like

68
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,400
to also share some of my experience my

69
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,879
feelings of you know being a minority

70
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,400
all right so let's first start with

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,959
an interesting uh video it's also

72
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,840
something that's

73
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,879
kind of like how i start to kick off my

74
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,680
track

75
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,800
of cyber security so this

76
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,319
happened when i was an undergrad student

77
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,680
that was in my year two and i was happy

78
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,760
i happened to watch a movie it's like uh

79
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,280
it's called wharf

80
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,599
games i don't know if you have heard

81
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,200
about this before but it's like

82
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,480
it's an old movie it has been

83
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,680
20 or even more years already but this

84
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,200
movie was very interesting

85
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,280
it has something very fun about cyber

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,560
security

87
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,480
so i would just like start with there

88
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,000
and give me a second let me

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,680
enable audio so that you will also be

90
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,879
able to hear that

91
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,760
you're really into computers huh yeah

92
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,239
what are you doing dying into the

93
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,840
school's computer

94
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,760
they changed the password every couple

95
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,120
of weeks but i know where they write it

96
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,580

128
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,680
face back again

129
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,080

good cool okay

132
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,160
first thing first please don't do this

133
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,720
please please i mean when i show this to

134
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,639
you i didn't mean to tell you that this

135
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,160
is the right way to do this is

136
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,120
like so cool so that we need to do that

137
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,759
no

138
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,800
but i mean this is just like a fun thing

139
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,120
that

140
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
really makes me attractive to cyber

141
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,319
security

142
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,880
and i want to see that you know can i do

143
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,840
that although

144
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,280
i know that i'm not supposed to do it

145
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,360
but like just like technically

146
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,720
speaking if i will have that skill

147
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,199
to be helped become like a hacker to

148
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,840
become

149
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,240
you know um a like to have a better

150
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,039
position

151
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,280
in doing something in cyber security so

152
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,960
this really ring fixed me and then

153
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,479
started my career as a people like as a

154
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,440
cyber security people and when i was in

155
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,360
undergrad there's no like cyber security

156
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,199
specific program unfortunately

157
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,600
but that really just opened in my mind

158
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,199
and it made me determined

159
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,960
to do cyber security as my life career

160
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,639
so okay yep and then next is that you

161
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,600
know after that

162
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,560
i start to get to know about ctf like

163
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,280
many of you

164
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,160
in this talk i know that many of you

165
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,639
have

166
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,919
um or uh like have joined a ctf team a

167
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:52,960
place in the app

168
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,280
or at least have heard about ctfs before

169
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,240
so for me

170
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,599
i started to know about ctf since my

171
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,960
second year and then i started to play

172
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,919
city apps

173
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,280
with those hackers uh like

174
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,720
back then they're not really hackers

175
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,639
like mostly they're just like students

176
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,639
we have a very little knowledge about

177
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,479
cyber security but we're interested in

178
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,400
that and we're interested in ctfs

179
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,080
and we started to play and after that

180
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,919
you know i just learned more and more

181
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,720
about city after cool things especially

182
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,639
uh you know cool competitions such as

183
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,800
defcon and i know that

184
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,919
in um like a def con conference it has

185
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,440
not only the ctfs

186
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,000
it also has other different kind of cool

187
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,840
hacking techniques that people

188
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,599
talk about such as how to break your

189
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,520
phone how to you know

190
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,120
break your car how to contest uh do all

191
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,720
different kinds of very interesting

192
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,360
things

193
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,479
and that made me very attractive

194
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,120
and then after that the morning when i

195
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,319
played ctf

196
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,120
and later on you know i went to arizona

197
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,400
state university as

198
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,919
a professor then a joined team is called

199
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,879
the word earned

200
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,120
overflow not sure if you heard about

201
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,160
that but this

202
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,039
is a team who is currently hosting

203
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,000
organizing

204
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,199
defcon ctf which is one of the top

205
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,400
cyber security hacking combination and

206
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,840
we started since i believe it's 2018 and

207
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,000
yeah i think it's 2018. this is our

208
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,199
third year

209
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,240
it's very close to the call right now uh

210
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,199
uh if you're just afraid to you know

211
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:29,840
attend

212
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,640
the call which is going to be around

213
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,679
april 30

214
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,080
actually now it's the time for us really

215
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,880
focusing

216
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,679
on preparing and organizing defcon ctf

217
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,039
qualification

218
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,799
um it's pretty intensive to be honest i

219
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,320
mean it's a lot of work

220
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,920
because we need to not only uh host

221
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
all the technical component components

222
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,040
but also come up

223
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,680
with challenges and usually those people

224
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,440
who attended def con city if they're the

225
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,560
top hackers

226
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,800
there were the top packers and you have

227
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,160
to come up with

228
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,600
cool challenge that is like really

229
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,080
great challenge that please everyone and

230
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,160
make everyone be interested in that

231
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,920
um so those two are the pictures

232
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,519
in 2018 uh this is the final

233
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,399
of defcon if you've been there you must

234
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,240
be very familiar like usually there is a

235
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,000
stage and we're just

236
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,399
the organization team are there and then

237
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,920
the other teams they will be

238
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,000
in different tables they're just spread

239
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,519
around in this entire

240
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,680
i would say like plaza age thing like

241
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,720
the room

242
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,720
and then just people play that for

243
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,279
eight hours and you can see this is me

244
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,320
on the right hand side i didn't look

245
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,560
very well because that was the time that

246
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,200
i didn't sleep for i think it's 48 hours

247
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,040
it's like two consecutive nights i

248
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,519
didn't

249
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,360
manage to get in sleep because we're

250
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,600
fixing different bugs there's always

251
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,040
unexpected issues coming up so that was

252
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,519
happening

253
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,920
all right uh and then

254
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,760
next is that um i think it's 2018 or

255
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,440
2019. i started to check

256
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,560
i started to attend some women

257
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,680
uh exclusive or say like women-only ctf

258
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,279
which is pretty fun

259
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,480
i was very impressed that there are

260
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,880
women's specific ctfs such as power of

261
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,000
xx

262
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,120
i believe this poster is for year

263
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,480
2018 and

264
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,079
um that was the time that we

265
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,399
uh i find some of my female hacker

266
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,839
friends and then we just

267
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,480
uh have a team and then we attended and

268
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,160
i was very impressed to be honest

269
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,120
because um i found there are many teams

270
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,240
over there

271
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,440
and also it's so competitive

272
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,200
i i was honestly like surprised by

273
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,399
the skills of our women hackers i'm so

274
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,560
proud of it

275
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,040
so those are the very fun part of you

276
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,200
know you become a cdf player you play

277
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,240
ctf

278
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,360
and then you attend um like uh

279
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,480
you know attend as a host to host

280
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,600
some of those very fun competitions but

281
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
as many of you ever know about that like

282
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,120
uh

283
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,480
being a city effort being a player

284
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,760
is pain because there is always

285
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,519
many things that need to learn there are

286
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,920
always many things that you have to

287
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,839
you know like just keep yourself there

288
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,680
it's like you become an actual athlete

289
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,800
right so you need to keep

290
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,519
practicing in order to make sure that

291
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,120
you have the good

292
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,839
uh status when you play the ctf

293
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,880
so here what i'm showing is

294
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,079
a calendar from ctf time.work so those

295
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,279
are the city of events that are showing

296
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,279
it's not the complete like not all the

297
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,800
states in the world

298
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,480
but still you can see that there are so

299
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,639
many city apps basically

300
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,000
you can find um city apps

301
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,920
almost every day and especially during

302
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,839
the weekend because usually people

303
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,839
will have more time during weekend

304
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,040
that's why usually

305
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,880
um you know major cities are hosted

306
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,399
during the weekend

307
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,880
so you see that there are so many ctf

308
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,839
games

309
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,440
and if you want to practice you can

310
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,040
always just find one instead of that

311
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,440
and also usually you know ctf is kind of

312
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,959
restless

313
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,880
are different ways of ctf but usually

314
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,800
they're just like 12 hours

315
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,480
48 hours or you know 72 hours restless

316
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,800
sometimes you're just so deprived of

317
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,480
sleep because you don't want to stop

318
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,560
you don't want to sleep while other

319
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,760
people are still

320
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,800
making effort right and also sometimes

321
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,360
they're so competitive just the power of

322
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,160
xx

323
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,639
i remember because that competition was

324
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,560
held in career

325
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,079
and we don't have a good time work i was

326
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,360
in us and then the the game you know

327
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,720
was held in the korea korean timeline

328
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,880
and then there was time to just we the

329
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,160
team play

330
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
and to the very late night and then we

331
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,240
worked the top and we're very proud and

332
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,720
then

333
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,639
we know that the winner like the 10 as

334
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,000
long as you got the 10th position you're

335
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
good you'll get someone worse

336
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,839
so i just decided that okay let's just

337
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,639
go to sleep

338
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,880
not worried about that there is there

339
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,279
are only like one hour left it should be

340
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,480
fine for us just to

341
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,279
sleep and it's to secure the position

342
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:23,680
and

343
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,959
actually unfortunately um one hour later

344
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,560
which is the end of the game

345
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,240
we ended up with position 11 so just

346
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,600
only one position um close

347
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,800
to this tenth position but you can see

348
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,120
how competitive it is

349
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,480
you just don't spend the last

350
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,519
one hour and my our rank

351
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,079
become like just dropped from the first

352
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,199
position to the 11th position

353
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,800
and also there are many times you just

354
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,399
realize that oh i

355
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,120
got the key but it's only three minutes

356
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,639
or it's only like a

357
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,519
half an hour after the game and of

358
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,199
course that he won't count

359
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,920
it's very unfortunate but you know there

360
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
is like the moment you feel that oh i

361
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,480
should have happened

362
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,320
or should have made this happen early i

363
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,920
mean i should have discerned it early in

364
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,199
order to get the key

365
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,040
and win extra credits for my team

366
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,320
so speaking of getting started i know

367
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,360
that some of you

368
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,480
you know about ctf but you may

369
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,680
haven't started yet um honestly speaking

370
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,920
that's also the pain part for ctf which

371
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,639
is that

372
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,680
the barrier or say the like the bar

373
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,880
is a little bit higher than most of the

374
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,399
other competitions

375
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,120
so you first of all need to write

376
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,079
program properly

377
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,079
you need to know how to write program

378
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,199
you need to

379
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,839
um also be able to read other programs

380
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,120
especially for c

381
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,600
because usually there are many c or c

382
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,800
plus plus related

383
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,240
challenges you also need to understand

384
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,959
assembly languages like access things

385
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:01,360
are

386
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,680
leaps or different kind of instruction

387
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,480
sets

388
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,639
you need to understand how operating

389
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,839
system works

390
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,160
um you also need to know like things

391
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,079
about why before you are interested in

392
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,839
web challenges

393
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,600
then you also need to learn like a

394
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,839
database works because usually there are

395
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,839
vulnerabilities associated with the web

396
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,360
that will have something like about

397
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,519
database you need to also learn

398
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,040
database in order to understand

399
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,360
vulnerabilities such as sql ejection

400
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,800
so there are many things that you have

401
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,880
to learn in order to

402
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,160
identify where what's wrong from

403
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,519
those programs or those applications so

404
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,839
after you learn about those applications

405
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,040
after you know

406
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,120
why is this happening like you know in

407
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,560
the essentially

408
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,079
what is happening what's the system

409
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,160
looks like what is the server looks like

410
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,399
now you can officially start because you

411
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,160
want to tell what is wrong

412
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,440
and do you know how it works

413
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,000
for example like you know ida pro i

414
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,839
believe that many of you have used this

415
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:00,639
before

416
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,160
right so if you haven't used it before

417
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,480
and

418
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,560
if you don't know about those contacts

419
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,720
when you look at this it can be pretty

420
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,399
overwhelming to you

421
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,480
you just don't understand why there are

422
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,240
errors and then there's a graph there

423
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,920
but what is the relationship between the

424
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,480
graph and the actual program so it will

425
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,040
really

426
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,320
like confusing but the time that you get

427
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,440
used to it

428
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,839
you maybe spend you know like i would

429
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,480
say like

430
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,880
hundreds of hours of practice in order

431
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,519
to really

432
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,199
be familiar with it and when i say be

433
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,519
familiar with it it's like not only just

434
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,040
click around but also be very

435
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,519
efficiently identified and use the tool

436
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,639
to achieve your goal i mean you just

437
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,360
need

438
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,079
to practice you have to do this again

439
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,839
and again again so keep yourself

440
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,240
on the same page and keep yourself you

441
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,920
know be familiar with this tool all the

442
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,240
time

443
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,680
especially that's some of the tools that

444
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,279
just keep changing they just keep

445
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,240
improving

446
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,959
so you also have to you know make sure

447
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:57,279
that

448
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,000
you always catch up the uh the latest

449
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
tools the latest version

450
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,680
and i feel that especially during the

451
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,760
past three years caps has been changed a

452
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,160
lot

453
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,559
there are so many new techniques and

454
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,919
then like uh

455
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,959
you know uh new city of players

456
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,439
and the new teams emerging and you can

457
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,319
see a

458
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,559
quick being there like the development

459
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,520
is so fast

460
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,679
that you really have to keep practicing

461
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,559
in order to keep

462
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,760
yourself on the stage

463
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,360
okay so that's everything about ctf so i

464
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,160
you know get interested in ctf and then

465
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,320
i also get interested in cyber security

466
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,720
research especially software security

467
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,080
and after i got my phd then i um

468
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,600
joined asu as a tenure track assistant

469
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,160
professor as you already know and this

470
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,440
is a picture

471
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
of the group that i joined which is

472
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,480
called

473
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,480
stefcom we have

474
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,520
right now we have five professors and

475
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,720
we have a 30 plus pg students

476
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,080
we have also many master and

477
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,720
uh undergrad students who like to play

478
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,160
ctf and do

479
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,640
very cool cyber security research with

480
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,440
us

481
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
and this is a picture i think is from

482
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
two or three years ago it was a

483
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,240
old picture and now we're having more

484
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,799
and more

485
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,840
female students i think last time when

486
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,320
i did a statistics on our recovery group

487
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,400
members we have more than one third of

488
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,360
the students

489
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,919
are female or like minority students

490
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,360
which we're very proud of

491
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,520
i know that this is not the end we need

492
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,960
to make more progress

493
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,080
but i'm very happy that during the past

494
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,400
three years efforts were having more and

495
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,120
more

496
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,760
minority students join in our security

497
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,080
lab

498
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,840
so for those people i i can't just

499
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,880
introduce

500
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,320
them to you one by one but i can't

501
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,840
have a very high level introduction

502
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,640
about those

503
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,679
about those people um i like to divide

504
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,480
them

505
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,080
into two groups of people so

506
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,120
the first group of people i would say

507
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,400
they're calling called good people

508
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,120
like they what they think is about like

509
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,600
oh

510
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,640
how to make the world more secure how to

511
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,600
you know defend how to defend against

512
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,000
those

513
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,200
attacks how to um you know secure

514
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,320
the systems or the applications and

515
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,360
then there are also the bad people who

516
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,960
obviously think about

517
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,280
how can i attack this application how

518
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,000
can i

519
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,440
find a bug and make myself get a room

520
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,240
right so there are two different kinds

521
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,120
of people

522
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,280
and then they're kind of competing with

523
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,240
each other

524
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,720
because there's always this nice defend

525
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,679
and attack

526
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,559
perspective and actually it's nice that

527
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,120
both

528
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,039
people exist in a big security lab

529
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,960
because that is the way that they can

530
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,120
co-evolve in order to

531
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,919
make the world or make the application

532
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,960
make software

533
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,120
more secure in the end so you really

534
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,280
have to have them to come back with each

535
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,840
other

536
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,240
so that we can have a more and more like

537
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,919
a better dynamics we can achieve a

538
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,120
better better security

539
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,240
and as i said you know the ultimate goal

540
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,880
for us

541
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,480
is to make the world more secure it's

542
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,320
just like sometimes people would like to

543
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,919
think that from a defense

544
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,320
perspective and someone would like to

545
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,360
think about this from

546
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,679
offense perspective like find what's

547
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,039
going on right now

548
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,640
so that we can come up with a better

549
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,159
solution right

550
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,960
so but ultimately we want to make the

551
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,840
world

552
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,120
more secure so how to make that right

553
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,440
maybe i think um i mean there are many

554
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,559
many different ways

555
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,440
but i would like to talk about part of

556
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,640
my research

557
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,000
by telling you a story and this story is

558
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,559
about

559
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,520
the wannacry attack i believe that many

560
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,440
of you have heard about this

561
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,320
wondercard attack before it was one of

562
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,039
the biggest

563
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,080
ransom attack in history

564
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,799
so there was a story and i would like to

565
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:09,600
talk about this

566
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,720
story in the uh like in a word

567
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,240
of time um so this attack

568
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,640
happened in 2017 or 2018.

569
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,280
i forgot we will see that i believe it

570
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,240
is 2017

571
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,400
but then actually back to 2012 which was

572
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,520
five years ago nsa has already

573
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,480
discovered

574
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,520
this vulnerability

575
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
but anesthetic didn't disclose this

576
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,280
vulnerability

577
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,880
into 2017 generally

578
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,360
uh january when and this has learned

579
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,200
about a possible leak

580
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,320
about this vulnerability so they realize

581
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,240
that this is really the time for them to

582
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,840
tell the software vendors so that they

583
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,360
can release the patch

584
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,840
and then you know every s are called a

585
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,280
citizen but like every

586
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,360
victim user will get a chance to to be

587
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,679
pat to patch the vulnerability

588
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,039
so in february 2017

589
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,280
nsa disclosed this vulnerability to the

590
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,799
software vendor which is microsoft

591
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,679
and then march microsoft released the

592
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,520
dispatch which is pretty quick i would

593
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,039
say that you know microsoft did a great

594
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,200
job

595
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,400
and then two months after that so keep

596
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,200
in mind that

597
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,600
it was two months after the release of

598
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,720
the patch

599
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,840
wannacry attack started so

600
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,039
by the time that attack started it's

601
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:37,840
already

602
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,799
two months after the patch was released

603
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,600
but still

604
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,039
there are many people that hadn't

605
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,559
hatched themselves and this ends up with

606
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,760
300 000 machines being affected

607
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,960
by one account attack and the tag

608
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,240
cost 4 billion loss which is really

609
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,480
a lot so i see two issues

610
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,960
or yeah i would say two issues or maybe

611
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,559
three but uh

612
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,159
in general like on a higher level say

613
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,919
two issues uh one

614
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,600
issue is in binary analysis techniques

615
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,720
uh back to 2012

616
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,200
that was the time nsa know it and then

617
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,360
back to 2017 that is the time that

618
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,600
unless it disclosed the vulnerability

619
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,440
and before nessa disclosed the

620
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
vulnerability

621
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,440
it was only an essay that discovered

622
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,039
this vulnerability

623
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,320
so the question is that why didn't

624
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,440
i sign this bug why didn't you find this

625
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,720
vulnerability why

626
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,559
didn't anyone else that find those

627
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,840
vulnerabilities

628
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,200
and we know that if one of us managed to

629
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,799
find this vulnerability

630
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,559
then we will go through the you know

631
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,720
like the responsible disclosure process

632
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,400
and then a better chance there will be

633
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,480
maybe a you know a higher chance

634
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,640
and that's the software vendor which is

635
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,480
microsoft will be able to know about

636
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,080
this vulnerability earlier

637
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,520
so that they can release the patch

638
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,679
earlier

639
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,200
the root cause is that it's just like

640
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,520
currently unfortunately

641
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,039
their analysis testing that's still not

642
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,960
scalable enough and it's still i heavily

643
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,559
relies on human

644
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,840
to find a bug

645
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,880
on the other hand there is also issue

646
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,320
in decision making so first of all

647
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,960
unless they decided to withhold this

648
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,159
vulnerability

649
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,200
for five years and also

650
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,640
for users like you and me uh or say for

651
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,440
those victim users

652
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,679
there are two months over there for them

653
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,240
to to patch but they just didn't patch

654
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,000
within the two months

655
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and also i like to just ask yourself how

656
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,520
many times that you

657
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
click the remind me later button when

658
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,960
you see a security update in your

659
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,840
computer

660
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,640
i have to confess that i did i did that

661
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,880
and did that for many times before

662
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,600
and in fact it's now you know just like

663
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,799
right now when i

664
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,799
talk to you and if there is a message

665
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,159
popping up telling

666
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,760
the hey tiffany now is the time for you

667
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,480
to update your security like update your

668
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,039
system

669
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,760
and the reboot i will just click remind

670
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,400
me later

671
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,919
again and then maybe later on just

672
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,840
forget about that i will never get a

673
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,200
chance to patch or

674
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,279
i will not be able to pass in time so

675
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,640
you see that there is

676
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,360
issues in decision making not only from

677
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,000
the one who discovers the vulnerability

678
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,440
but also from the end users who

679
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,840
is like the actual victim because they

680
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,480
just

681
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,080
never bother to to pass it on time

682
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,320
and that makes or that leaves their

683
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,919
vulner their their

684
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,080
their laptop or their uh you know

685
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,039
operating system

686
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,799
to be insecure

687
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,840
so and also this is because those

688
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,840
decisions are making ad hoc way because

689
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
when we look at this

690
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,640
um like a message we we see this like

691
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,400
popping up window we just make a

692
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,760
decision right where we don't really

693
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,559
think about

694
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,919
what is the pro accounts and how should

695
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,080
i wait the pro accounts

696
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,760
so that i can make an optimal decision

697
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,760
sometimes we have to click remind me

698
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,880
later because

699
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,960
like right now i know that i need to

700
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,200
click it because i don't want to

701
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,360
uh pause my talk however there are many

702
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,320
times that

703
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,159
i know that actually i'm idle i know

704
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,679
that actually i should waste security

705
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:24,159
more

706
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,760
than you know having the computer run

707
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,799
so but because i don't have a systematic

708
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,400
way to really weight the pro accounts

709
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,679
and that make me to um you know make and

710
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,360
suboptimal decision

711
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,240
all right so from the story you know

712
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,880
that

713
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,679
techniques are important but techniques

714
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,480
are definitely

715
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,320
insufficient and my research

716
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,080
is cyber autonomy which is

717
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,159
a combination of both techniques

718
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,200
and strategies to mitigate software

719
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,320
vulnerabilities and in my mind i would

720
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,360
like to have

721
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,520
you know like an intelligent system i

722
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,799
also just sometimes call it

723
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,919
cyber bodyguard that you know

724
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,520
um it will be able to not only just find

725
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,880
the bugs for your system

726
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,440
but also give you an intelligent

727
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
decision for

728
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,399
maybe you should patch it right away or

729
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,799
maybe you should do some other means in

730
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,840
order to protect yourself

731
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,919
and then you may ask like why don't you

732
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,320
just study this separately there are

733
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,840
people doing

734
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,360
like vulnerability discovery or

735
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,760
automatic export generation techniques

736
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,000
and there are also other people who like

737
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,279
to tackle things like

738
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,320
strategies right so that why

739
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,399
do we why why i mean there's two

740
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,159
separate people working on this already

741
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,520
why do we want to have people like me

742
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,960
to tackle both parts

743
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,640
and the reason for that is because

744
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,320
actually techniques

745
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,399
and decision they complement with each

746
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,279
other and sometimes they mix it so well

747
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,279
that you just need to have this

748
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,279
knowledge and have the background

749
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,080
for both two parts so when we make

750
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,880
decisions

751
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,120
for offense or defense decisions it

752
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,880
requires to know about

753
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,760
the security domain knowledge and also

754
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,520
when we create binary analysis

755
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,480
techniques

756
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,520
sometimes we need to know that what are

757
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,120
the techniques that are most

758
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,360
important what techniques should we

759
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,399
prioritize

760
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,720
when we develop them and in order to

761
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,399
know what techniques matters because

762
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,279
there's so many different

763
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,520
techniques that you can create so in

764
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,440
order to know what matters you need to

765
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,480
understand

766
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,600
given the current strategy what are the

767
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,240
current

768
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,559
bottleneck so that you know which

769
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,520
technique that you want to improve

770
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,399
and for me my research is to build a

771
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:52,960
framework

772
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,840
that can systematically reason about how

773
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,600
to mitigate software security

774
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,039
and use a whole approach combining both

775
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,000
techniques

776
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,279
and decision strategies

777
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,440
okay so that's pretty much the high

778
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,720
level of my research

779
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,520
and you know part of the stuff calm my

780
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,799
labs research

781
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,039
and uh due to the limit of time i'm not

782
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,640
gonna talk about

783
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,799
like every piece of it but i would like

784
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,840
to share

785
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,799
one or two uh with you guys which is a

786
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,240
very interesting

787
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,720
story it's nicely combined both

788
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,919
like strategy and techniques

789
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,760
so i like to start with the first one

790
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,000
which is the decision making part

791
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,520
which is how to come up with

792
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,200
an optimal decision an optimal strategy

793
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,320
that will help you to decide how to do

794
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,840
with software vulnerability

795
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,200
and to talk about this let's start with

796
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,679
cyber grant challenge cyber grant

797
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:58,640
challenge

798
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,840
is a competition hosted by darpa in year

799
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,440
of 2017.

800
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,799
so in the final of cyber grant challenge

801
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,000
there are seven teams coming with each

802
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,640
other

803
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,200
and they're all machines it's like ctf

804
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,679
but

805
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,640
there's no human in the ctf so every

806
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,600
machine

807
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,240
is a player and then they just play

808
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,960
against

809
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,240
each other um oh actually let me fix

810
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,919
that it's not in 2017

811
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,360
it's 2016. it's 2016

812
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,520
august so as i said there are seven

813
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,799
teams and

814
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,039
they're given a hundred about 100

815
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,320
vulnerabilities

816
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,840
in this game they're 95 rounds each team

817
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,159
so they want to find a buck and if they

818
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,039
find a bug

819
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,440
they can use this bog to attack other

820
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,120
team in order to win

821
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,919
offense score and then meanwhile they

822
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,679
can patch themselves

823
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,679
and according to the patch they can win

824
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:56,720
the according

825
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,519
defense score and also performance score

826
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,679
depending on if the patch will affect

827
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,919
the performance of original server

828
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:04,880
original service

829
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,399
so it's really like the attack defense

830
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,399
game in ctf but

831
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,880
this is the way that like but in this

832
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,600
game

833
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,960
every team is not human team they're the

834
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,159
actual machines

835
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,000
fully automatic compete with each other

836
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,600
and then the total score is a summary uh

837
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,640
for of this three offense defense and

838
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,200
the performance

839
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,240
so we look into this

840
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,080
cyber grant challenge we look into this

841
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,519
competition

842
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,880
and uh i was especially looking at

843
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,600
these strategies so given this game how

844
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,039
should we play it

845
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,159
if for example if i find a vulnerability

846
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,080
should i just use this vulnerability to

847
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,840
attack other people's right away

848
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,760
or should i just put in a hold because

849
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,679
if i attack other people

850
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,000
there is a chance that other people

851
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,960
realize

852
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,679
or capture my attack and they may be

853
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,000
able

854
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,279
to generate their own attack

855
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,360
because they receive my attack so they

856
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,480
kind of like can

857
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,559
learn from attack that i launched them

858
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,559
so you said there is a pro and con there

859
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,000
is a balance between

860
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,080
attack and uh defend and it's not always

861
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,760
the case that you should attack

862
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,720
right away and it turns out that my

863
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,399
strategy will be able to help

864
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,799
shellfish who was the original third

865
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,000
position team

866
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,840
to rank second if you know

867
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,480
they had applied my model for decision

868
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,279
making

869
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,840
so this is nice it means that we do need

870
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
a better decision-making protocol or

871
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,360
decision making

872
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,559
scheme that will be able to lead us for

873
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,440
a better result

874
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,480
and then we just keep looking into this

875
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,159
because you know we want to

876
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,120
look at more rather appro more about

877
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,799
their work and then we also

878
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,919
do a literature review to see

879
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,760
what has been done in terms of those

880
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,600
kind of vulnerability discovery

881
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,080
and decision process and very

882
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,279
interestingly

883
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,720
we see that in a past model uh first

884
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,799
for example there's one called cyber

885
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,200
hawk and there is also another one

886
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,480
uh um published by sram

887
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,519
at all so they found that

888
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,840
for those for those two models because

889
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,720
of their

890
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,960
assumption and then they conclude that

891
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,799
for a game like this at least one player

892
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,640
will attack the other people and also

893
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,880
if someone decides to attack other

894
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,559
people they should always

895
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,519
attack right away but it's actually

896
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,279
different from what we found

897
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,679
and that is because they have put you

898
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,840
know assumptions that are too strong and

899
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,960
that stop them from

900
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,760
finding the actual truth so for our

901
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,480
model

902
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,799
we actually found that very

903
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,760
interestingly

904
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,679
if players can retaliate

905
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,679
meaning that like they got something

906
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:04,960
they got attacked

907
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,360
and the revenge on the other people so

908
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,280
if players can retaliate

909
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,399
then it's actually possible that neither

910
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,679
players will attack

911
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,639
each other which is nice that means that

912
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,399
we have a very peaceful

913
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,119
peaceful world right so we also called

914
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:21,599
this

915
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,918
as mutual term i don't know if you heard

916
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,760
about this before but it's like

917
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,480
it's a dynamic it's a maintenance of

918
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,280
peace

919
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,800
between opposing side right and then by

920
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,199
each

921
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,119
having retaliate capacity to deter

922
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,679
the other people from initiating

923
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,480
conflict and

924
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,000
very realistic example will be nuclear

925
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,879
weapons

926
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,119
right so because of mutual terms

927
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,440
there's no one in this world will dare

928
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,359
to really just like fire

929
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,119
a nuclear weapon because they know that

930
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,480
if that happens

931
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,400
they might be got retaliated by the

932
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
other people and that will be

933
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,320
like no one will win the game everyone

934
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,079
just moves into the game so

935
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,640
it's great then the question is how can

936
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,760
we create

937
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,280
mutual deterrence we have to give people

938
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,839
this retaliation capacity

939
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,000
and then the question is how can we give

940
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,240
people this retaliation capacity given

941
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,280
the fact that

942
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,320
not everyone are sophisticated

943
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,680
ctf player not everyone are experts or

944
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,280
hackers

945
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,040
can we come up then can we come up with

946
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,720
automatic technique

947
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,160
that will enable everyone to

948
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,960
retaliate other people if they receive

949
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,240
an attack

950
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,640
and this comes to my research one of my

951
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,359
research

952
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,760
is to you know think about this question

953
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,960
how can we do

954
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,240
automatic retaliation or in other words

955
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,000
uh we call it automatic export reuse

956
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,200
so to be more uh like specific

957
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,079
we focus on control flow hijacking

958
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,280
exploits

959
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,119
which um uh you know in this expert

960
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,920
they can alter the program execution and

961
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,480
then run attackers malicious instruction

962
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,839
or aka payload or shellcode

963
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,839
right for example

964
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,440
this is a very simple control flow

965
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,200
hijacking example just in case that you

966
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,599
don't know about that before

967
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,920
so suppose that we have a buffer block

968
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,720
here

969
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,320
and then on the right hand side i'm

970
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,160
showing the stack um

971
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,079
there are local variables stored on the

972
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,280
stack and

973
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,560
this vulnerability suffers from a buffer

974
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,839
flow you see that

975
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,320
you know variable as it has only 20

976
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,640
bytes but actually ass can receive

977
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,839
50 bytes so that means that attacker can

978
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,119
overflow

979
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,400
this 20 byte argument

980
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,040
x and overwrite to save the return

981
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,440
address

982
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,920
right so here is the vulnerability and

983
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,960
someone can just

984
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,720
overwrite the return address and then

985
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
maybe point it back to the shell code

986
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,760
and then you know they can manipulate

987
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,960
the execution

988
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,640
using this new shell code

989
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,079
then the question for us is that suppose

990
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,280
we want to retaliate so we have our own

991
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
purpose we want to put our new shell

992
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,480
code into

993
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,040
this attack then how can we

994
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,119
automatically replace

995
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,480
the shell coat replace that by that we

996
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,040
want

997
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,079
so that we can have a new exploit

998
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,079
and we call this shell called transplant

999
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,680
and to be more formally uh first

1000
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,200
this question the question of shell

1001
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,440
called transplant will take a vulnerable

1002
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,320
program

1003
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,240
and an original exploit as well as

1004
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,079
a circle to be replaced as input

1005
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,800
and it will output a new axonoid that

1006
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,680
will trigger

1007
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,160
the vulnerable but the vulnerability the

1008
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,400
original vulnerability the same one

1009
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,119
and also execute the replacement gel

1010
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,359
code

1011
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,800
okay so we come up with this technique

1012
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,520
that enables to do that um i'm not going

1013
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,200
to talk about the details there

1014
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,480
there are many things i don't know if

1015
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,640
you're about symbolic execution or

1016
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,320
concolic execution

1017
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,560
um we use that and then we use different

1018
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,960
way that we kind of like change the

1019
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,720
layout of the shell code

1020
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,440
so that we can satisfy those necessary

1021
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,960
conditions in order to trigger the

1022
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,320
vulnerability

1023
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,480
um and then now i'll just like talk

1024
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,440
about the

1025
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,800
evaluation so we managed to have

1026
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,079
this technique and in evaluation

1027
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,839
we um test our technique we call it

1028
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:40,800
shell swap

1029
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,920
we test the system with 20 original

1030
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,640
exploits

1031
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,680
from the cyberpunk challenge and five

1032
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,760
replacement shellcode from three

1033
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,280
different authors

1034
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,480
so in this case we have 20

1035
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,040
times five testing cases because we want

1036
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,320
to try them for

1037
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,440
all for each of the original exploits

1038
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,960
and each of the replacement gel code uh

1039
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,480
how many of them can we manage to

1040
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,760
generate a new axoid that

1041
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,599
you know triggers the original

1042
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,760
vulnerability associated with the

1043
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,560
exploit

1044
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,839
and also executes the new replacement

1045
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,839
shell code

1046
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,960
and we found that shell swap

1047
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,000
in total like in summary charcoal

1048
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,200
uh sorry shell swap was able to

1049
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,359
automatically generate 85 out of 100

1050
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,320
new exploits and in the design of shell

1051
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,960
swap

1052
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,480
there are three different components um

1053
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,520
the um so

1054
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,800
the the one brain we call it just basic

1055
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,359
method

1056
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,480
and if basic method failed we will use

1057
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,079
the second technique called layout

1058
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,480
remediation and if that failed we then

1059
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,760
use the pathogens like

1060
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,800
three steps one by one

1061
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,440
the other like the other two is more uh

1062
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,160
skillful

1063
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,440
and say more challenging more more uh

1064
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,760
difficult than the basic method but so

1065
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,599
you always just want to start with the

1066
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,720
simple method

1067
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,200
and if simple method failed you then use

1068
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,960
the second and the third

1069
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,839
method so we found that every message

1070
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,000
counts every method has its own role has

1071
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,440
its own contribution

1072
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,680
that means that all those methods are

1073
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,640
necessary

1074
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,440
in order to build up this entire system

1075
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,760
shell swap

1076
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,880
and also we evaluate the time

1077
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,240
the performance of shell swap we measure

1078
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,079
the time that shuswap spent to generate

1079
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,839
those 85 exploits and very interestingly

1080
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:46,400
we see

1081
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,599
that there are 60 out of

1082
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,040
85 exploits can be generated within

1083
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,160
three minutes we do see a long tail

1084
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,680
phenomena meaning that like from the 80s

1085
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,319
to the 85 which is this part it

1086
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,240
definitely spends a lot a lot of

1087
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,960
time but for most of the experts it can

1088
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,560
be generated within a very short amount

1089
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,480
of time it's like three minutes

1090
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,200
and this means that you know you just

1091
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,839
you can

1092
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,800
you can start you can turn the technique

1093
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,680
let's just walk

1094
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,440
around and then go get your coffee and

1095
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,760
by time you come back

1096
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,240
your exploits for yourself customize it

1097
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,280
for yourself

1098
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,680
it's done you can have an excellent of

1099
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,480
yourself

1100
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,599
which is quite amazing

1101
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,400
so this is a very interesting and fancy

1102
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,280
technique

1103
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,839
and actually you see that while we're

1104
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,280
motivated

1105
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,319
we're it's the it's the like strategy it

1106
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:42,880
is

1107
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,680
origin the start of this technique is

1108
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,560
the strategy

1109
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,760
is that we realize that

1110
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,280
you know only we have this retaliation

1111
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,319
technique

1112
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,440
that will make us to build up this

1113
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,280
possible cyber deterrence

1114
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,520
uh sorry the mutual deterrence in the

1115
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,800
cyberspace

1116
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,640
and that is quite interesting and this

1117
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,000
kind of like form of

1118
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,440
my research i hope that we need

1119
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,839
to have i mean of course we need to have

1120
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
both strategy

1121
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,119
and technique but also more important i

1122
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,359
hope that our technique can be developed

1123
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,040
in a more directional way

1124
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,240
we're just we don't do this like just

1125
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:22,880
like

1126
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,640
oh whenever a technique has happened

1127
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,079
it's good no we want to

1128
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,280
prioritize that in order to really find

1129
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,200
the right technique to develop or to

1130
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,280
improve so that we can make our

1131
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,480
cyberspace

1132
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,920
more secure and then come back to

1133
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,640
shell swap this technique we show that

1134
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,319
automatic actual reuse

1135
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,359
is possible and also mutual determinants

1136
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,480
is possible

1137
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,680
in cyberspace from both the technical

1138
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,359
which is sales swap

1139
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,040
and strategic which is the

1140
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,400
decision-making model

1141
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,800
from these two perspectives

1142
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,880
all right so now's the time for us to

1143
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,800
talk about the future

1144
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,160
we talk about this very interesting

1145
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,079
story so like we

1146
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,119
we find this

1147
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,160
very interesting technique the finding

1148
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,760
of strategies then what will happen in

1149
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,440
the future how should we

1150
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,720
improve uh in the future to

1151
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,079
achieve the goal of like

1152
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,520
cyber space piece right so

1153
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,760
of course we need to keep advancing

1154
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,520
binaural analysis techniques as i

1155
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,400
mentioned

1156
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,920
you know vulnerabilities binaural

1157
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,240
analysis techniques most of them they're

1158
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:36,800
still not

1159
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,119
scalable especially for those dynamic

1160
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,839
ones there's no way for you to really

1161
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,119
like verify that the program is 100

1162
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,440
secure especially for large program like

1163
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,359
you know the software's that we're using

1164
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,880
right now

1165
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,280
so we really want to think about that

1166
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,400
how can we

1167
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,200
develop techniques more scalable

1168
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,560
techniques that will help

1169
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,319
us to find those bugs or say to help us

1170
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,160
to prioritize

1171
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,079
the discovery of bugs if we have to

1172
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,040
go through all like all path or all

1173
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,160
possibilities in the program states

1174
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,200
and then the next is that we need to

1175
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,160
keep

1176
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,200
um you know keep maturing the game model

1177
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,960
there are many things that we need to

1178
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,640
think about for example

1179
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,520
stu there right now in my model i only

1180
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,119
consider two players

1181
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,400
uh i can apply that in like a seven

1182
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,400
player scenario such as the cyber branch

1183
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,119
challenge game but actually we just play

1184
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,880
we apply this model uh time like again

1185
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,119
and again again for a single player

1186
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,240
like uh the single one player has six

1187
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,040
components

1188
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,800
opponent and then we just apply this

1189
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,480
game model for six times

1190
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,880
then the question is how can we make

1191
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,839
this game

1192
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,079
to it just extend it from two player to

1193
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,200
three player

1194
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,079
and it turns out that even extending

1195
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,359
from two player

1196
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,319
to three players it can be pretty pretty

1197
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,319
complicated for example

1198
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,800
you could do something like play a

1199
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,599
attacks

1200
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,640
player b but then player b

1201
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,040
if he wants to retaliate he doesn't

1202
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,960
really retaliate or say play

1203
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,520
play back revenge back on player a he

1204
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,560
will actually

1205
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,839
pass then attack team player c which can

1206
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,160
be

1207
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,880
like even more stronger like a very

1208
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,760
strong

1209
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,839
player and then player c will then

1210
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,760
back to player a so it can be like a

1211
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,040
three people

1212
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,960
three body problem they just like go

1213
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,560
through the cycle

1214
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,440
and that increase the complexity of the

1215
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,880
game

1216
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,680
so there are many things that we need to

1217
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,599
look into in order to mature the game

1218
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:48,960
model make this game model more

1219
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,000
comprehensive

1220
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,640
but also make this game still solvable

1221
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,359
within a reasonable amount of time

1222
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,560
and the third is about uh

1223
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,119
you know can we come up with more

1224
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:01,720
different

1225
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,400
decision-oriented techniques shout swap

1226
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,520
is one of them

1227
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,000
it's a technique that we realize

1228
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,920
important and useful

1229
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,040
um because of decision then are there

1230
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,920
other techniques that were also kind of

1231
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,400
um

1232
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,079
invented because of decision or impact

1233
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,400
the decision because of the existence of

1234
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,680
such technique

1235
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,920
for example i'm thinking about like can

1236
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,960
we

1237
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,480
make our patching uh more

1238
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,440
like you know faster because right now

1239
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,440
uh there's no way for us to

1240
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,760
just like automatic i mean we can do

1241
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,200
automatic patching

1242
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,960
but still it's gonna take some time to

1243
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,680
really um deliver this patch

1244
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,200
to a people and also you know there are

1245
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,240
some scenarios that users

1246
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,960
really want to come to and control and

1247
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,280
they don't want to enable automatic

1248
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,560
patching so then

1249
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,680
the question can we really pass this

1250
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,720
in the runtime without harming um

1251
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,839
the current existing environment

1252
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,520
maybe you want to have maybe two

1253
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,200
versions or something else

1254
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,960
but like this is something that is going

1255
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,800
to be interesting to think about

1256
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,520
how to develop more decision oriented

1257
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,359
techniques

1258
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,480
and in the long term i also think about

1259
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,400
the the interplay between technique

1260
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,440
and decision making so if

1261
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,119
say the word is a big game everyone is

1262
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:31,839
involved

1263
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,319
in this game in the cyber security game

1264
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,200
and then

1265
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,680
there are people developing more and

1266
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,640
more advanced

1267
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,720
technique then can we evaluate the merit

1268
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,920
of the technique based on how this

1269
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,720
technique

1270
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,280
could possibly change the game or change

1271
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,079
people's

1272
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,160
behavior change people's decision

1273
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,200
makings

1274
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,640
in this big cyber security game so

1275
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,599
this we in order to do that we need to

1276
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:00,880
have a framework

1277
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,119
that can just keep running and keep

1278
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,640
evaluating techniques

1279
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,680
and also we need a better interfaces for

1280
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,640
techniques to be plugged in in

1281
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,160
evaluation framework

1282
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,119
so that it won't increase actual burdens

1283
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:15,520
for

1284
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,319
those technical creator technique

1285
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:19,440
developer

1286
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,440
when they build up those technique

1287
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,440
right and even longer term i realized

1288
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:27,920
that

1289
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,640
you know in order to make our cyberspace

1290
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,440
keys

1291
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,440
it won't be not just technique and

1292
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,040
decision sometimes

1293
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,319
you need to depend on maybe law

1294
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,359
or policy and i remember that

1295
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,400
when i was talking to a security

1296
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,359
professor

1297
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,119
i was talking about this very

1298
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,440
interesting technique shelf swap

1299
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,839
and this professor asked me a very

1300
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,040
interesting question

1301
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,200
so he asked you know why do you want to

1302
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,079
have this technique

1303
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,119
will this technique really be helpful um

1304
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,480
because if like for people like you

1305
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,160
and me we cared about uh law we cared

1306
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:06,559
about

1307
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,680
those like policies if we really use

1308
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,880
this technique

1309
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,520
and we just attack other people whenever

1310
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,880
we receive attack

1311
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,079
then we may commit a crime because we

1312
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,880
attack other people maybe for like the

1313
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,280
real

1314
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,359
like the black hat the real black people

1315
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,800
they don't care because they

1316
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,119
violate the law all the time but for us

1317
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,640
we're nice people where

1318
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,559
we're white hats we don't want to do

1319
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,000
that

1320
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,480
then we just kind of have a barrier

1321
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,280
there to

1322
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,200
stop us from retaliating other people

1323
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,839
and there's no way for shock swap to

1324
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,200
come into play

1325
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,640
and i was really thinking about this i

1326
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,800
think this is a very interesting point

1327
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,520
of view

1328
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,839
please think about this this is like the

1329
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:50,880
question of

1330
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,119
whether or not it is legal for you to

1331
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,240
have a gun

1332
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,359
right so if you have a gun in your home

1333
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,400
and if someone breaks into your home can

1334
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:00,720
you

1335
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,800
protect yourself and then can you use

1336
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,800
this gun to protect yourself

1337
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,760
right so and this comes into play of law

1338
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,000
and policy what is the correct

1339
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,839
law that will also give us this right

1340
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,160
to protect ourselves when it is

1341
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,040
necessary

1342
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,599
in cyberspace although we may use

1343
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,400
something

1344
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,040
that is i would say brutal like calling

1345
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,040
for brutal but a little bit more

1346
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,680
more aggressive right like attack other

1347
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,400
people

1348
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,240
then we need a better law that can

1349
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,000
regulate the behavior

1350
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,280
and also protect us as you know

1351
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,440
a citizen in the cyber in the cyberspace

1352
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,839
all right so that's pretty much for my

1353
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,280
talk uh

1354
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,559
i would like to um give everyone more

1355
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:49,119
time

1356
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,000
for us to talk about you know um discuss

1357
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,280
this topic or talk about more

1358
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,000
interesting things

1359
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,680
and also i saw questions from the chat

1360
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,559
and i will answer

1361
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,040
the questions later on so for now let me

1362
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,319
just quickly

1363
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,680
conclude what have talked now so

1364
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,200
i hope that my talk give you

1365
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,000
um you know very interesting aspects of

1366
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,200
cyber security

1367
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,480
and ctf and i hope that you

1368
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,040
will be able to agree with me that

1369
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,119
hacking is a cool thing

1370
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,520
but also happiness pain because you have

1371
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,440
to you know do a lot of practice in

1372
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,319
order to really gain that skill

1373
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,680
however hacking is fun so

1374
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,960
be a hacker in a good way

1375
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,119
all right that's pretty much everything

1376
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:38,480
i have um

1377
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,319
feel free to contact me i'm very uh

1378
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,400
you're very welcome to talk to me

1379
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,440
for you know issues about maybe research

1380
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,599
you want to do for cyber security

1381
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,359
uh or maybe your concerns about ctfs or

1382
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,720
something that you are currently

1383
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,480
experienced related to

1384
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,760
education career cyber security etc

1385
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,240
feel free to shoot me an email also this

1386
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,079
is my personal webpage

1387
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,079
um also i like to um advertise for our

1388
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:06,800
lab

1389
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,440
so we are recruiting people we're

1390
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,520
recruiting not only phd students

1391
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,440
but also intern like we call it

1392
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,160
apprenticeship so it is a program

1393
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,280
that we welcome undergrads

1394
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,440
or masters students who are interested

1395
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,960
in work with us who are interested in

1396
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,240
doing further

1397
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,599
uh cyber security research so if you are

1398
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,680
interested in working with us become a

1399
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,920
hacker and do those fancy cyber security

1400
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,880
research

1401
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,240
you're welcome to shoot me an email

1402
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,440
talk to me or check this link so that

1403
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,240
you can see

1404
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,640
more detailed information about this

1405
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,559
program

1406
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,240
all right now i am uh

1407
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,720
open to all the questions but let me

1408
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,000
first answer

1409
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,480
uh fram i hope i pronounce your name

1410
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,760
correctly but uh

1411
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,160
let me answer the question first so the

1412
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,839
question is how do you think ctfs and

1413
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:01,520
game theory can be connected

1414
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,119
what could be some possible research

1415
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,359
directions very very good question

1416
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,880
so uh one direction

1417
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,280
would be like in ctfs there are attack

1418
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,400
defense game

1419
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,599
so what is the best strategy for you to

1420
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:16,640
play this game

1421
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,920
as i said um there are possible

1422
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,440
techniques that people can sneak for

1423
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,640
network actually for

1424
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,280
like deathcon or other attack defense

1425
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,480
game usually they

1426
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,599
relieve release the the pcap

1427
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,079
of the network traffic sometimes like

1428
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,240
there's a delay but they will release

1429
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,359
the network traffic and then there are

1430
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:41,280
um good teams that they would like to

1431
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,839
reverse engineer dual formation on those

1432
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:45,040
network traffic

1433
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,160
and then the extractor attack and then

1434
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,079
understand your attack and then user

1435
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,839
attack against you

1436
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,520
if you haven't patched yourself or use

1437
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,119
that attack to

1438
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,359
attack other teams so although they

1439
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,559
cannot get the first

1440
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,079
flood they can still waste our scores

1441
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,240
right so the question from a game

1442
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,000
favorites perspective is whether or not

1443
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,720
you should start

1444
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,800
attack even though you get you know how

1445
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,119
to attack you want to make sure

1446
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,520
that maybe one is the best time for you

1447
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,200
to attack maybe you don't want to attack

1448
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,079
right away

1449
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,920
because you know that the pcap will be

1450
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,200
released in

1451
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,440
five minutes right maybe you actually

1452
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,599
want to wait for a second

1453
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,640
uh or maybe wait until the

1454
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,280
uh maybe uh like very close to the end

1455
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,000
of the game

1456
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,640
so that even though you launch this

1457
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,200
attack

1458
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,240
even though they get your p cap there

1459
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,000
won't be enough time for them

1460
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,400
to reverse engineering or attack and

1461
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,640
then attack it back to you or other

1462
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,359
teams

1463
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:46,960
so those are just like one possible ways

1464
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,559
for you to um to like you know really

1465
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,559
think about what is the right strategy

1466
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,319
how to use game theory

1467
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:56,319
to come up with a good strategy to

1468
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,200
attack other people

1469
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,480
okay um question attackers can behave

1470
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,480
goofy many ways to escape from being

1471
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,760
caught yes

1472
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,559
how can we model this scenario yes

1473
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,400
that's a very good question too

1474
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,760
so in the game theory setup you could

1475
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,160
have a parameter to kind of describe the

1476
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:16,880
detection

1477
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,520
of attack um and actually right now

1478
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,160
there is

1479
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,319
in my current game series setup i do

1480
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,440
have a detection

1481
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,040
uh detection parameters like by a chance

1482
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,240
if someone launched attack then

1483
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,839
by like maybe 95 of the chance or by 80

1484
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,200
percent of the chance

1485
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,319
that their attack will be caught by

1486
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,720
the opponent which is like maybe the the

1487
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,160
the defender

1488
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,040
so in that way we can encode the

1489
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,799
possibility make this

1490
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:50,079
game as a probabilistic setup so that we

1491
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,359
can reason about

1492
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,200
what is optimal strategy in a

1493
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,160
probabilistic way

1494
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,000
thank you tiffany there's also one more

1495
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,880
question

1496
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,440
is there some way to combine fuzzing

1497
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,280
with vulnerability discovery

1498
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,319
by prioritized path exploration to

1499
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,119
identify

1500
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,599
if an access violation found by fuzzing

1501
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,359
can actually result in a complete

1502
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:15,520
exploit

1503
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,440
that's a good question it's a very

1504
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,200
technical question i like it

1505
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,000
uh for me i also published some papers

1506
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,040
about fuzzing

1507
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,480
so i would say that uh i

1508
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,359
if you know about fuzzing or no more

1509
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:30,000
specific

1510
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,960
afl usually you have a seed you generate

1511
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,000
more input

1512
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,720
and then you want to select those input

1513
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,920
you think it's more

1514
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,640
more valuable and then keep mutate based

1515
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,079
on those input and that process is

1516
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,160
called input prioritization

1517
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,760
um so input prioritization essentially

1518
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,040
is a way for you to pre

1519
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,720
our test per our time sorry per our

1520
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,440
damn it prioritize your path right

1521
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,559
because

1522
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:59,680
inputs lead to execution path

1523
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,280
especially for afl because they are a um

1524
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,400
prioritized uh uh fuzzer

1525
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,680
uh they cover they try to cover as

1526
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,079
many edges as many like you know if

1527
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:13,680
you're looking at the cfd as

1528
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,920
many addresses as possible so that is a

1529
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,520
way for you to prioritize

1530
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,720
and then back to your question um yes

1531
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,040
so fuzzing is a way that you can

1532
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,799
prioritize your past

1533
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:27,520
and that there are existing research

1534
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,880
that talks about

1535
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,319
how to prioritize input so that you can

1536
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:33,440
prioritize path

1537
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,040
in different way and my opinion is that

1538
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,160
there is not there there won't be

1539
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,559
um you know a good answer or say the

1540
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,599
good answer

1541
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,839
there will always be just like maybe

1542
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,680
depending on the program depending on

1543
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,599
some properties of the program

1544
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,200
what is the best way for you to

1545
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,680
prioritize those inputs

1546
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,559
there won't be a unified way that will

1547
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:57,200
work for

1548
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,720
all the programs in terms of input

1549
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,119
prioritization you really have to see

1550
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:02,960
for example what types of vulnerability

1551
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,480
that you look into do you

1552
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,599
look into more like memory corruption or

1553
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,520
do you look into more specific

1554
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,200
types of vulnerability like not only

1555
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,440
just memory corruption but more specific

1556
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,319
and also it depends on your program's

1557
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:16,880
type

1558
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,640
for example if your program has

1559
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,280
something that is heavily related to

1560
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,160
uh say like coding encoding or crypto

1561
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,160
then you want to prioritize

1562
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,160
probably those types of input that help

1563
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,319
you cover most the path that

1564
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:32,319
within the crypto or without the crypto

1565
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,160
you may have

1566
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,799
you need you need to decide which part

1567
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,720
of the program that you want to focus

1568
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,240
on you want to con that you want to

1569
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,160
prioritize in order to

1570
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,480
get the correct inputs that will go to

1571
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,720
that specific part of the program

1572
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,040
yep that's my two cents hopefully

1573
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,160
they'll help

1574
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,559
awesome uh we have another question that

1575
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,319
came offline um

1576
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,319
would be interesting to know how to

1577
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:57,440
build bots

1578
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,680
that attack each other like inside a

1579
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,000
grand challenge

1580
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,359
sure so um i am not involved in a cyber

1581
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,960
grant challenge but i

1582
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,240
am very familiar with the two teams

1583
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,280
uh one is the champion team

1584
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,880
mayhem because that is my advisor's

1585
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,520
uh startups team and i'm also familiar

1586
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,119
with shellfish

1587
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,400
so um that is a huge question

1588
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,040
how to build a bot to do that it can

1589
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,000
start with

1590
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,640
how to find a vulnerability and then how

1591
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,520
to convert

1592
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,680
from a discover developer maybe an input

1593
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,799
or pov

1594
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,599
uh or say like a crash how to turn that

1595
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,799
from a crash

1596
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:42,160
to an actual working exploit uh so

1597
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,559
in cdc you don't have to really have a

1598
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,000
working axle in the sense that

1599
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,319
you can get the road get the shell but

1600
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,520
you need to at least just

1601
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,400
know that for example like rp is tinted

1602
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,359
rfp is controllable something like that

1603
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:58,000
so then i would say there are

1604
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
research-wise they're all open research

1605
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,640
how to find about but how to turn from a

1606
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,359
crash to

1607
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:06,079
a pov and those are also interesting

1608
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:07,359
research questions that

1609
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,559
i'm personally interested into um

1610
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,799
my lab is interested in it and we hope

1611
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:14,240
that if you're interesting feel free to

1612
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,040
contact me

1613
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,280
but like i'll go back to this how to

1614
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,240
build a bot

1615
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,040
i think you need to find a bug have a

1616
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,640
way to convert that

1617
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,880
and then also if you want to have about

1618
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,119
that really lunch and actual actual such

1619
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:27,680
as

1620
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,599
have a shell then you want to have a

1621
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,040
right payload so that it can be

1622
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,640
assembled

1623
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,520
with the crash or the peel that you have

1624
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,480
created

1625
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,680
so that's a very simple

1626
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,680
three steps in order to have attacking

1627
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,119
bots uh

1628
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,599
hopefully this helps but also like when

1629
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:46,160
i say this

1630
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,599
three steps i definitely ender claim it

1631
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:50,960
it's gonna be

1632
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,799
more difficult than what i just speak

1633
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:57,920
all right yes yeah yeah thank you uh

1634
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,400
so much for your talk and you know for

1635
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,520
explaining about

1636
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,760
you know giving an overview of cts

1637
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,599
actually as part of shaktikan we have

1638
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:06,319
organized

1639
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:09,040
women unleashed ctf called shakti ctf

1640
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,760
and it has received a lot of attention

1641
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,440
from women all across the globe and also

1642
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,839
the organizer of this conference amrita

1643
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,119
university

1644
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,880
we have our own ctf team called nctf

1645
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,960
and which is actually the number one ctf

1646
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,079
team in india

1647
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,440
in 2020 and was also ranked 35th

1648
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,400
worldwide

1649
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,839
so i i see that this as an opportunity

1650
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,240
you know maybe we could collaborate and

1651
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,280
you know

1652
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,000
launched ctfs for more uh women in the

1653
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,760
world and to reach

1654
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,599
more students and get them into security

1655
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,839
yep sounds good i would like to see

1656
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,920
further collaborations with you guys

1657
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,559
i'm very excited about that thank you so

1658
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,160
much tiffany i don't uh

1659
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,599
see any more questions uh okay let me

1660
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:58,799
stop sharing

1661
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,880
yeah there's one more question what

1662
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,880
tools do you use for building game

1663
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,839
theoretic models

1664
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:07,839
like

1665
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,920
what simulation tools do you use for

1666
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,720
building game theoretic models

1667
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,359
uh i don't really use simulation tools

1668
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:18,960
we do simulate

1669
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,359
uh cybergrain challenge but we just

1670
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:22,960
write the script that's

1671
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,119
simulated there's no certain simulation

1672
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:26,720
tool and then when

1673
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,079
we build the game theoretical model

1674
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,359
we just it's it's i mean

1675
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:36,480
we use an existing model

1676
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,400
it's we call it partial observable

1677
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,680
stochastic game

1678
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,680
and we apply that model to the cdc or to

1679
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,839
the uh cyber game

1680
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:50,000
setup and we ended up

1681
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,200
by adding more related parameters um in

1682
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:53,520
like

1683
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,480
detection like those kind of detections

1684
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,720
uh those kind of cyber security related

1685
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,359
parameters

1686
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:03,039
into the game and then we try to use

1687
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:06,880
um existing but with a better

1688
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,920
uh like we trim the algorithm and we

1689
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,119
change the algorithm

1690
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,039
existing algorithm so that it can fit

1691
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,640
with our setup

1692
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,280
also satisfy the stability requirement

1693
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,240
in order

1694
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:22,160
to make uh the game model solvable

1695
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,440
um so we don't really use a specific

1696
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,200
tools but we mostly just do that by

1697
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,680
ourselves

1698
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,599
thank you so much tiffany you know for

1699
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,960
taking your time uh

1700
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,400
to talk about ctfs and about your

1701
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,280
research

1702
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,599
it's very interesting and i know it's

1703
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:40,559
late evening

1704
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,559
but we have in a more interesting

1705
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:44,720
sessions coming up so it'd be nice if

1706
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,839
you can stay and

1707
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:49,280
listen to it and have a nice evening and

1708
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,960
thanks again for joining

1709
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,520
thank you yeah and thank you for hosting

1710
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,920
the conference i really enjoy it

1711
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,720
thank you thanks a lot
