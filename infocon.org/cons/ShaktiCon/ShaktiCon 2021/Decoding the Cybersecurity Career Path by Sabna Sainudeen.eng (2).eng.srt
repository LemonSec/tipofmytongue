questions right what

76
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,040
what so what is cyber security

77
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,360
anyway i'm not going to cover this today

78
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,800
because we all know

79
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,840
what is cyber security all that

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,040
all attendees who are present today

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,800
either will be a cyber security

82
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,080
professional

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,360
or a cyber security graduate or

84
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,480
who is uh willing to take a

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,159
entry level or uh trying to get into the

86
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,080
cyber security so we all know what is

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,920
cyber security

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,959
what i'm going to have a discussion here

89
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,920
today is

90
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,599
why why us is why you should

91
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,840
consider cyber security as a career

92
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,599
option

93
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,200
so because if you see 25 years back

94
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,239
when everything i mean we all

95
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,879
were doing like okay logging into the

96
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,200
system with the password protection

97
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,080
uh working around with the file saving

98
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,959
the files in some storage devices

99
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,239
and then keeping it up and where we were

100
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,040
uh hardly connecting to the internet

101
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,080
right so

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,640
that time cyber security was not in

103
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,760
spotlight

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,480
okay because this even though the

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,840
security was there

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,320
these all things were taken care by the

107
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,880
i.t

108
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,160
administrators and who were

109
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,759
parallelly working on system

110
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,000
administration network administration

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,440
and cyber security

112
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,360
and taking care of the security of

113
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,880
assets was

114
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,320
an additional task or duty

115
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,759
but us and when it when

116
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,080
when we came along and when the

117
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,960
organization

118
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,560
started connecting to internet more

119
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,440
and now everything in this world is

120
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
connected to internet right we are in a

121
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,880
connected world

122
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,040
and when we started connecting more and

123
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,479
more devices

124
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,919
and um computer and every assets in this

125
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,520
um organization to internet the security

126
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,479
issues

127
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,199
and uh the threat landscape has

128
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,800
increased a lot

129
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
and that that's why organization

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,120
is in need of a lot of cyber security

131
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,000
skill set

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,400
and professionals to address these

133
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,160
things

134
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,199
so uh with the past pandemic that

135
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,680
is also evident right most of the

136
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,560
organization

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,919
were to go into a more digital way

138
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,960
not only organizations like governments

139
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,240
non-government sectors

140
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,560
including the educational and the

141
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,199
hospital firms everybody had to

142
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,320
move to the digital platform right

143
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,919
and everything was getting connected and

144
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,520
with the pandemic most of the

145
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
organization was forced

146
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,680
to go for an accelerated digital

147
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,960
transformation

148
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
what i mean by accelerated digital

149
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,479
transformation is

150
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,680
they were tend to bring in a lot more

151
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,639
working uh from home culture where uh

152
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,639
most of the laptops and the

153
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,840
end user devices started connecting

154
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,080
remotely

155
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,720
outside of the organization network

156
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,160
these things have brought in

157
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,600
a lot a lot of security issues

158
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
and the security threat landscape has

159
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,160
increased tremendously

160
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,199
and with this what happened is the

161
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,440
industry is in need of

162
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,800
a lot of talents and there is a huge

163
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,360
skill

164
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,560
gap that exists in this industry

165
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,919
right so this according to study it has

166
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,720
proven that

167
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,080
the cybersecurity talent

168
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,160
need has skyrocketed and it is going to

169
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,560
be

170
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,720
uh we are going to witness a lot of

171
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,600
increase

172
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,120
in the skill demand which is like

173
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,160
which has increased from 2016 and to be

174
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,199
increased

175
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,520
for about 28 percent when it comes to

176
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,120
26.

177
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,400
and there are more than 3.5 million

178
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,280
unfilled cyber security jobs that exist

179
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,039
globally today

180
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,840
so that is a point where we are so that

181
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,120
is the reason

182
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,000
that we need to take and we need why we

183
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,639
need to

184
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,800
consider cyber security as a career

185
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,680

more detailing into this

188
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,840
why we have to choose a cyber security

and in addition to that recent studies

216
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,440
has proven that

217
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,360
cyber security is one of the most

218

satisfying carrier

219
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,560
which stated globally so more than 76

uh the salary right so

226
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,399
yes definitely cyber security career

227
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,839
is a very promising career

228
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,720
but on the other hand what we are seeing

229
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,920
today is

230
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,480
okay we all know that cyber security is

231
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,959
a very exciting career and we have a lot

232
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,240
of graduates

233
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,160
not only graduates we have a lot of

234
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,240
lateral entries right

235
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,040
who who are wishing to uh who are

236
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,399
willing to come into this

237
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,680
industry and um be part of this

238
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,000
uh cyber security and want to pursue

239
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,279
their career

240
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,959
but on the other hand we have a lot of

241
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,720
skills skill

242
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,760
gap and the fact is that

243
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,040
the uh i mean recruiters are finding it

244
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,600
really

245
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,120
really hard to recruit the right talent

246
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,839
for their open cyber security position

247
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:36,880
so this is

248
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,959
completely contradicting we have a bunch

249
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,560
of people who want to

250
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,279
get into this industry who is willing to

251
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,640
get into the industry and

252
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,440
on the other hand industry is facing a

253
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,000
lot of

254
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,040
lot of carrier i mean skill gap and they

255
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,160
are trying it

256
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,480
finding it very difficult to recruit

257
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,000
people

258
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,760
so it all comes back

259
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,959
to the fact that

260
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,800
uh scarier aspirants are not aware of

261
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,839
how to start a career in cyber security

262
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,160
how to pursue their career in cyber

263
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,240
security and how to be successful in

264
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
careers

265
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,360
in cyber security so

266
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,880
uh i get a lot of questions every

267
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,160
every day and in my linkedin and uh

268
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,440
whenever in every most of the time in my

269
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,560
career somebody comes to me um maybe a

270
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,360
fresher

271
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,800
or a a lateral entry who would like to

272
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,640
get into this industry

273
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,120
comes to me and ask okay how can i get

274
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,959
into cyber security

275
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,440
how should i start my career what should

276
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,079
i

277
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,560
do so uh it all comes back to the

278
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,240
concept right you need to decide

279
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,720
uh what role that you need to take in

280
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,519
career

281
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,680
in cyber security because as i said

282
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,959
cyber security

283
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,640
unlike other uh carrier it is very

284
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,160
vivacious right

285
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,320
so um uh the i mean you have a lot of

286
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,800
lot of technologies that you can work

287
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,040
you can work as a forensic analyst you

288
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,839
can work

289
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,680
work as a penetration testing and a lot

290
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,720
a lot of options are there so you can't

291
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,360
have

292
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,640
a hands on everything right go

293
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
i mean learn something on the ethical

294
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,720
hacking okay you leave it there and then

295
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,839
you move to

296
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,000
uh something into the forensics and you

297
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,959
leave it there no

298
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,200
that's not the right approach you need

299
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,480
to understand

300
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,920
what you are passionate about and

301
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,800
analyze your uh inner potential and

302
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,320
analytical skill

303
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,440
and then you decide take a call

304
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,240
right so before that you need to

305
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,959
understand

306
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,360
what are the entry-level jobs that is

307
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,040
there in cyber security as of today

308
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,160
so uh some of the entry level so i'm i

309
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,560
mean

310
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,200
if i talk start talking about the entry

311
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,760
level

312
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,120
um jobs here uh

313
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,440
it will take a lot of time because there

314
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,519
are more than 25 to

315
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,360
uh 30 entry level roles in cyber

316
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,320
security so i'm

317
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,440
today i'm going to specify on uh some of

318
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,839
them

319
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,320
and uh so let's see what are those

320
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,680
so the risk and complaints auditors this

321
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,160
is

322
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,240
some of the entry level job that you can

323
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,000
always consider so

324
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,279
this is all about um

325
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,600
uh getting into the uh risk and

326
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,040
compliance side

327
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,720
and making sure that we have everything

328
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,360
every security standards in place and

329
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,600
the company is following a security

330
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,560
policies

331
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,959
doing a risk assessment to understand

332
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,160
the cyber threats

333
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,880
and risk and uh analyzing the risk

334
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,920
appetite for an

335
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,200
organization right another option

336
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,680
as a side of getting into cyber foreign

337
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,279
six so cyber foreign six

338
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,120
is all about uh it is all about

339
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,320
um getting into a job where

340
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,760
you would like to understand

341
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,200
uh when a cyber threat happened

342
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
happens on a cyber incident happen you

343
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,360
will be investigating

344
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,560
in and out what went wrong where it went

345
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,040
wrong

346
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,000
so you will be uh doing a root cause

347
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,120
analysis

348
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,160
collecting the evidences right and uh

349
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,360
writing a technical document on the

350
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,600
and their investigation so you are if

351
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
you are kind of a sherlock holmes

352
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,880
right you you are love to

353
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,000
be a detective this is something

354
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,440
some career you can always think about

355
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
and there is something called incident

356
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,959
uh analyst

357
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,279
so we have a lot of um

358
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,440
career opportunities in incident

359
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
analysts

360
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,240
when it comes to cyber threat monitoring

361
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,480
and

362
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,360
insurance handling so we will be uh

363
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,320
checking

364
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,760
um i mean on time on we will be

365
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,519
actively uh alert and will be monitoring

366
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:17,839
the

367
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,839
ender organization network for a

368
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,480
attack and then we will be responding

369
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,680
accordingly so this

370
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,040
all comes to security operation center

371
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,000
analyst and there is something called

372
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,600
penetration testing

373
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,680
that you all might be knowing because

374
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,000
that's how where ethical hacking and

375
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,839
penetration testing come hands in hand

376
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,360
both are the same

377
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,079
where you love to hack into the system

378
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,160
understand the vulnerabilities

379
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,519
and then steal the data and

380
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,360
uh not the term steel but you

381
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,800
create a poc and say that hey the system

382
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,199
is not

383
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,720
secure enough and these are the

384
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,240
vulnerabilities and

385
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,920
these are the things that it can be

386
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,160
hacked so if you really love

387
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,560
ethical hacking this is a job

388
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,480
opportunity

389
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,720
and vulnerability assessment so we do

390
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,639
have a lot of fun reassessment

391
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,360
uh tools in market right we have nesters

392
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,399
we have a lot of

393
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,839
other uh tools provided by ibm

394
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,320
and uh hp for hp and all those

395
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,440
companies so what we do is we understand

396
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
and analyze the vulnerability of

397
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,639
entire system or network and

398
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,440
generate the report and analyze it in

399
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,360
order to mitigate the high

400
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,800
and medium risk there is some other

401
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,079
uh this this is one another uh um

402
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,680
carrier option that you can always

403
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,920
consider in cyber security is the source

404
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,959
code review if you are very good at

405
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,360
coding and you know that how code works

406
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,560
in and out

407
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,199
and if you put some more efforts on

408
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,279
understanding the security of the code

409
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,399
it is very much

410
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,800
very much needed in the organization

411
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,040
because that's where we start right

412
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,959
uh having a a good and secure code

413
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,680
in order to have one level of defense

414
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,800
when it comes when

415
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,120
when it comes to um developing a product

416
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,160
so and uh this is one system

417
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,040
administrator

418
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,160
is one of the option that you can always

419
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,120
thinking if you

420
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,920
don't get a chance to get into the cyber

421
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,199
security specific

422
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,800
roles right because sister administrator

423
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,160
is something we we always work in

424
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,079
with the patching the systems and

425
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,360
understanding this

426
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,279
whether the system is in compliance with

427
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,519
the organization policy

428
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,920
where security policies will also come

429
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,360
in the picture like

430
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,120
um keeping in the right privileges for

431
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,000
the users

432
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,240
and maintaining the ad group and when it

433
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
comes to network administrating

434
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,880
administration uh configuring the

435
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,360
network properly and securely

436
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,839
so if you start a career as a system

437
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,919
administrator it will be very easy for

438
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,079
you to navigate to the other roles in

439
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,640
cyber security

440
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,679
so how to get started right so

441
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,520
the secret of getting ahead is always

442
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,000
getting started and as early as possible

443
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,679
as i mentioned

444
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,640
cyber security career is all about

445
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,000
having a hands-on

446
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,240
experience so theoretical knowledge

447
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,000
definitely will help you

448
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,320
but it is different from other careers

449
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,039
because we have to face with the real

450
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,880
time scenario

451
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,600
right understanding the uh threats which

452
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
is there out there it's already there

453
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,520
because attackers are working

454
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,440
uh more than us uh 24x7 getting into

455
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,080
a different systems and selling data so

456
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,640
we are

457
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,039
inca we are there to encounter with the

458
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,280
real-time scenario so we don't have

459
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,400
um it's i mean the theoretical knowledge

460
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,840
is not enough so

461
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,960
get your hands on as early as possible

462
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,480
so if i mean i would like to have a

463
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,760
discussion

464
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,919
on how a student or as you

465
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,640
graduate your 12th standard and how you

466
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,520
can if you

467
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,440
are willing to start a career in cyber

468
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,160
security how you can get started

469
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,240
so get a bachelor's degree in cyber

470
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,080
security because right now we have a lot

471
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
of colleges out there

472
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,160
who is giving dedicated bachelor's

473
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,000
degree on cyber security

474
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,480
or else start with the uh computer

475
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
science basic degree

476
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,080
in um engineering right and then

477
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,799
go for a master's in cyber security pick

478
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,400
up these specialized uh

479
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,960
areas where you want to master for

480
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,840
example you can go for a cryptography

481
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,400
or a foreign sex and lord and lord of

482
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,919
courses are there so

483
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,400
as i said you have to decide what is

484
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,520
interesting for you

485
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,559
and then you have to pick the right uh

486
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,760
course for you

487
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,880
and once you complete your degree right

488
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,679
go for advanced courses because there

489
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,400
are

490
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,240
as you say cyber security is ever

491
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,160
evolving so you need to

492
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,080
be updated with the industry so

493
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,400
sometimes this degree is not sufficient

494
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,120
enough

495
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,760
so there are a lot of online as well as

496
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,000
classroom advanced courses on various

497
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,280
technologies

498
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,000
and various cyber security aspects so

499
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,480
take an

500
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,880
advanced course and certification

501
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,480
definitely if you don't have an

502
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,799
experience in do cyber security this is

503
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,559
one of the must have

504
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,360
so analyze your potential area which

505
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,320
entry level

506
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,480
or which role you want to take for

507
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,720
example when i said you want to be

508
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,320
if you want to be a security audit and

509
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,880
compliance you want to get into some

510
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,679
roles within the governance

511
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,799
some certifications uh provided by

512
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,840
isaka like sisa certified information

513
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,480
security auditor a lot of certifications

514
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,440
are there so

515
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
find out the right certification which

516

depth in uh all the technology you

577
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,640

organizations

585
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,880
and having third party risk management

586
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,080
so um this is one of the main focus area

587
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,200
most of the organization deal with

588
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,080
so how we can mitigate the risk and

589
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,520
handle the risk

590
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,039
and definitely when we are creating a

591
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,039
security product we need a project

592
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,200
management so you can always consider

593
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,159
this

594
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,440
as one of the other career path

595
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,840
then comes the leadership so uh you

596
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,559
might be

597
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,039
confused what is uh management and what

598
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,120

599
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,000
which is like

600
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,840
which is very critical for the success

601
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,360
of the business so

602
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,840
you might have uh heard the term cesare

603
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,919

604
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,039
he is the leader of the organization

605
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,159
and make sure that the company has
