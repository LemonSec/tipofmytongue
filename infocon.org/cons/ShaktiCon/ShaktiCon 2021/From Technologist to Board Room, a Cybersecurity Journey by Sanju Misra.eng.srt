praxair and linden the skills she gained

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,239
as a technologist

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,079
are in the same skills required to

38
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,759
thank you for joining today's session

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,200
today i'm going to talk about

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,240
my career journey to become a cso

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,600
in a financial field industrial gas

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,759
and now currently in the biotech

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,720
industry at

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,960
al milam so if i look back

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,759
at my college days i wasn't interested

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,520
or knew anything about

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,079
cyber security or i.t i was actually

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,240
focused on biology

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,720
it wasn't until i took a part-time job

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,280
in a computer lab that got me interested

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
in computers and helping students with

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,640
their computer problems

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,920
as well as learning about i.t myself

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,240
so when i left college i really wanted

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,000
to focus more on the i.t

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,360
side and i took a role at yale

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,199
university medical labs

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,319
helping to automate their

59
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,480
database of test questions for medical

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,520
students

61
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,560
and then moved over to end user support

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,400
and network support

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,200
and general i.t consulting over the 10

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,400
years

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,840
my first role into security was

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
at aetna health insurance i came in as a

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,360
security analyst or engineer

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,879
helping to build out a secure website

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,319
for consumers to have more functionality

70
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,400
and i was promoted to internet security

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,680
manager

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,640
pretty quickly while i was at aetna from

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,360
there

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,319
i moved over to general electric

75
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,200
treasury

76
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,239
they had a cso role uh open

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,720
and i also became the cso for praxair

78
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,159
which merged with linda about two years

79
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,120
ago

80
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,000
and then most recently as of last week

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,280
pretty new

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,200
i took on vp of information security at

83
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,720
al milam i'm heavily involved in

84
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,519
stem programs so science technology

85
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,840
engineering and math programs to

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,680
help build the pipeline for a future

87
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,440
cyber security professionals like

88
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,000
yourself and i always say

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,720
don't fear change embrace it and love

90
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,000
what you do and that's

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,560
how you're open to new opportunities and

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,680
that's where they come from

93
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,040
so often people ask what i look for in a

94
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,599
career

95
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,879
and i put it down into three things one

96
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,680
is great people uh you want to be

97
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,920
engaged and excited about coming to work

98
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,959
every day

99
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,640
and i always say that people don't leave

100
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,319
companies people leave people

101
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,239
you leave the organization you leave

102
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,080
your management

103
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,760
but not necessarily the type of work

104
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,120
that you do

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,040
speaking of work it's got to be

106
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,879
challenging work you got to contribute

107
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,280
make a difference and be interested and

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
love what you're doing you're spending a

109
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,959
lot of time at work

110
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,879
and lastly you want to be compensated

111
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,000
fairly so

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,840
that you're able to take care of

113
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,279
yourself and for

114
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,199
others in your family or in your

115
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,399
community

116
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,560
so i always say you need to know what

117
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,040
really drives you what motivates you

118
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,360
when you're looking for that new role or

119
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,720
your first role out of college

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,000
so if i look back about let's say 5-10

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
years

122
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
we think about all the i.t changes that

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,919
have happened whether it's wearables or

124
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,880
technology changes really there's a lot

125
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,000
of things that are

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,040
coming through or will be coming through

127
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,560
that require cyber security

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,759
and a secure mind frame

129
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,080
so if you think about it like by 2023

130
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,000
a lot of people already have a smart

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,720
watch or will be wearing one

132
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,360
we'll see disruption from uber or lyft

133
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,759
or other ride sharing services

134
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,080
we may have a package delivered by drone

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,759
in the next few years

136
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,479
or we may stay in a robotized hotel as

137
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,360
well

138
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,919
so all this great technology and

139
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:18,560
progress

140
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,680
also requires individuals like yourself

141
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,600
to help secure it and keep risk down

142
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,199
so if we look at some of the other

143
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,440
things we could be working aside

144
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,560
alongside of a robot or could we

145
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,680
buy a bionic ear or use bitcoin or

146
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,800
cryptocurrency for payments more

147
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,600
readily so a lot of provocative things

148
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,000
happening

149
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,160
which comes back to the need for more

150
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
cyber security professionals

151
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,479
if we look at things like domestic

152
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,720
robots and how they could be hacked or

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,880
citizenship or cars being automated

154
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,280
all these things can be looked at to

155
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,960
function properly

156
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,039
or as hackers like to look at it how do

157
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,400
we break it how do we

158
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,440
get it to do what we want to do so

159
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,560
that's why

160
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,520
we need a good set of skills and

161
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,440
intellectual curiosity

162
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,039
first and cyber security

163
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,560
if i look at the current threat

164
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,319
landscape you'll see

165
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,240
this is not news to you you know the

166
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,120
attacks are a growing industry

167
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,360
most of the attacks are from outsiders

168
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,840
and the motivations around the attacks

169
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,960
are are listed here i do think globally

170
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,800
we're going to see more and more attacks

171
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,080
on the supply chain

172
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,880
similar to what we saw with solar winds

173
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,319
in 2020

174
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,639
and if we look at the tactics the

175
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,360
malware

176
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,000
is still the key delivery mechanism

177
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,360
we've been saying this for

178
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,280
five plus years now and the foundational

179
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,360
things like weak passwords stolen

180
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,720
passwords

181
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,479
um using uh privilege access

182
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,520
inappropriately are all key things and

183
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,000
the ways that hackers come in

184
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,680
so what does that mean what does that

185
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,599
imply for all of us

186
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,080
it means that phishing remains the

187
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,919
prevalent way that hackers attack

188
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,759
so we need to make sure that our

189
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,039
employees

190
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,360
are aware and we have technology in

191
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,160
place

192
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,120
there's more and more social engineering

193
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,199
so people calling up for

194
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,560
ids and passwords on the phone and

195
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,599
employees and people at home giving them

196
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,479
out

197
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,960
having physical access to a system where

198
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,440
you have a ton of time to

199
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,639
damage the system and you need to make

200
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,720
cyber security awareness

201
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,840
part of the culture whether it's in your

202
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,199
home or it's at work

203
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,520
it needs to be considered a data safety

204
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,639
culture

205
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,400
and then lastly how do we protect those

206
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,680
cloud assets

207
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,199
we're hearing more and more things are

208
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,280
going to the cloud but that doesn't

209
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,000
negate

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,319
our need to be able to secure access to

211
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,800
them and how they're

212
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,520
how they're presented in the cloud and

213
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,960
data loss prevention

214
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,199
techniques around that so when you think

215
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,120
about all those things

216
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,479
how will you help to help sorry how will

217
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,840
you help to

218
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,520
secure the the future

219
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,479
you know we're all women here in this

220
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,680
room um

221
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,560
talking about cyber security and if you

222
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,000
look at some of these

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
statistics you'll say well we have

224
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,000
gotten better

225
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
if you look at cyber security field and

226
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,039
number of women we were at a paltry 11

227
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,799
in 2015 2013 and now we're up to 20

228
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,799
percent in 2019.

229
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,560
so while it's better it's still not

230
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,880
representative of the cultures that we

231
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,080
live in

232
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,320
if we look at the representation of

233
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,680
women's csos

234
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,720
in the fortune 500 companies there were

235
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,760
13

236
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,640
females in 2017 and now there's 20

237
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,519
percent

238
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,080
a few years later and this last

239
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,800
statistic

240
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,160
is specific to the united states but

241
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,480
in 2014 there was a million cyber

242
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,920
security jobs that were

243
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,120
left unfilled and now

244
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,560
in 2021 we're estimating 3.5 million

245
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,080
jobs unfilled

246
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
so there's a lot of opportunity for

247
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,920
everyone here in this room

248
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,519
in the cyber security space

249
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,320
i'm often asked what would i tell myself

250
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,600
20 years ago or 15 years ago

251
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,320
what would i do differently and i put

252
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,959
these

253
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,959
on this page because it really got me

254
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,000
thinking

255
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,720
it's really okay to take risks and

256
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,760
sometimes we

257
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,080
get too comfortable and we don't take

258
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
those risks but you really need to take

259
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,600
the risk in order to

260
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,640
advance or to think differently to think

261
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,959
like a hacker

262
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,880
i say that we should use the

263
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,040
organization's culture

264
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,079
as a strength or your friend

265
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,760
get comfortable with how the

266
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,360
organization functions

267
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,839
how do you affect change in cyber

268
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,640
security

269
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,240
within the culture and this is a good

270
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,560
one

271
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,720
it's not always a technical issue

272
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,000
there's often times

273
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,680
that as technical people with strengths

274
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,600
we don't look at the process or the

275
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,920
people side of things and a lot of times

276
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,279
that's where we need to make the

277
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,200
improvements

278
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,120
this one here cyber security is

279
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,399
enterprise risk

280
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,120
absolutely critical it takes cyber

281
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,720
security out of i.t

282
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,040
and puts it in the business risk

283
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,240
framework

284
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,360
meaning cyber security is seen as a real

285
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,320
business risk

286
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,360
there's a dollar amount brand

287
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,600
damage that could be caused if you have

288
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
a cyber security incident

289
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
i can say in my practice orlinda world

290
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,760
if we had a cyber security incident in

291
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,000
our operations side there's a potential

292
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,160
it could be a safety issue if people are

293
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,320
hurt or there's an explosion

294
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,600
so you need to frame cyber security from

295
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
a business perspective and not just an

296
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,720
i.t

297
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,000
side this one is always

298
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,959
a a very important one that i love to

299
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:17,680
tell

300
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,880
students continuing education is part of

301
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,079
your job

302
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,640
so once you leave university the

303
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,920
learning doesn't stop

304
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,720
really it just starts and i say that

305
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,279
because

306
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,600
the hackers change modalities and

307
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,360
methods

308
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,279
there's new technology that comes

309
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,120
through so we need to stay

310
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,360
current in all that so continuing

311
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,560
education

312
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,720
is one way that we can do that

313
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,880
this one i can't say enough business

314
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,640
knowledge is essential

315
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,680
i think sometimes we get stuck in what's

316
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,320
comfortable

317
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,200
for us in our i.t space but you need to

318
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,079
understand

319
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,440
what does the company or government do

320
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,360
what are its principles how does it

321
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,279
operate

322
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,000
so when you go for interviews and

323
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,360
speaking to

324
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,560
other companies i say make sure you do

325
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,440
your research

326
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,320
in today's internet there's no reason

327
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,240
that you can't find out about

328
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,040
a company its products its culture its

329
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,399
values

330
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,600
um how its in the news before you

331
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,120
get to the interview have others

332
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,480
advocate for you

333
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,680
and what i mean here is in

334
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,680
roles that i post in my company

335
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,920
we often get you know hundreds of

336
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,000
thousands of resumes

337
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,440
and what speaks to me is

338
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
a colleague may come to me and say i

339
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,200
have a great person that would be

340
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,920
perfect for this role and they bring

341
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,680
that resume forward

342
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,240
that to me says so much to someone would

343
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,839
vouch for you

344
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,000
and that they're willing to stick their

345
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,440
neck out and say

346
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,800
give this person a chance so i would say

347
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,120
make sure you have a good

348
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,000
personal board of directors or advocates

349
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,360
on your side

350
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,240
tell people your professors your

351
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,600
colleagues

352
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,639
relatives when you're looking for a role

353
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,839
and what you're looking for

354
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,079
so if they hear something they can

355
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,320
advocate for you

356
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,079
and definitely reach out to people who

357
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,000
work in that company in the industry

358
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,720
get a good sense of what the culture is

359
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,200
like

360
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,360
and potentially what kind of roles are

361
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,240
coming up

362
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,680
to be filled and being new to your

363
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,079
careers i think sometimes we forget that

364
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,079
we have a lot of valuable skills

365
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,519
and a lot of them are very transferable

366
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,639
so i say that if you have really good

367
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,279
analytical skills problem solving skills

368
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,120
intellectual curiosity

369
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,440
those all transfer really well into a

370
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,040
cyber security role

371
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,160
or into a stem type role so

372
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,079
focus on those strengths rather than

373
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,079
saying i don't have 10 years of

374
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,000
experience or i didn't take that

375
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,839
programming class

376
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,399
there are tons of skills that transfer

377
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,399
very well

378
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,440
know your value so here i mean when

379
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,360
you're going into a company

380
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,079
and they come up with a problem let's

381
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,680
say

382
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,959
they don't have a very security aware

383
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,880
population their employees are

384
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,079
constantly bringing in

385
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,760
usb drives and causing malware on their

386
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,440
computers

387
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,279
talk about how you could solve the

388
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,360
company's problem what would you do

389
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,680
just gently put it out there and then

390
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,040
they'll start seeing you

391
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,160
in the role doing those things and then

392
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,199
lastly

393
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,240
be prepared for the interview you really

394
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,800
should be able to answer why are you the

395
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,600
right person

396
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,079
for this role if you're able to do that

397
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,519
early on in the interview

398
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,680
then the rest of the interview can focus

399
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,760
on your qualifications rather than

400
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,959
discovering

401
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,199
more about you and that makes for a much

402
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,120
more effective

403
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,839
interview and i think you'll be looked

404
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,959
at highly

405
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,160
in the interview process so keep selling

406
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,040
your skills

407
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,000
to be the top contender and sometimes

408
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,920
when we talk about selling your skills

409
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,399
i hear from people new to their career

410
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,240
that they shouldn't have to sell their

411
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,880
skills

412
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,279
their resume has the best schools the

413
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,639
best grades

414
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,760
the um the the best

415
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,920
of everything out there the best

416
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,199
internship

417
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,480
why isn't that enough and the reality is

418
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,320
you have to be able to take your

419
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,079
accomplishments and

420
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,320
also the way that you think and approach

421
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,440
problems

422
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,639
and sell that so that the employer says

423
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,959
yeah i can see this person working here

424
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,320
that's what you're looking to do

425
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,480
to be the top contender in these roles

426
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,480
so i thought this was an interesting uh

427
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,720
graph to bring up because when we talk

428
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,560
about career success

429
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,399
and what are cyber security employees

430
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,160
looking for you'll see

431
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,720
that the men are represented in green

432
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,880
and the women in this lighter green

433
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,800
their percentages aren't that different

434
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,000
across the four

435
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,720
areas that were surveyed so people want

436
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,759
to be a go-to

437
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,199
specialist they want to be the

438
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,639
source of information for their

439
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,480
colleagues they want to build a strong

440
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,079
professional network

441
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,759
and they'd like to be assigned a

442
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,519
leadership position or a team lead

443
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,199
position pretty early on in their

444
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,320
careers

445
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,959
so they're pretty similar men and women

446
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,399
for what they look for

447
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,720
in their um in their roles

448
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,959
so i'm going to leave you for the last

449
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,800
couple slides on some

450
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,519
the rules i call them so when we talk

451
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,240
about the

452
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,519
first law of holes that's the

453
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,360
we've always done it this way we got to

454
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,959
think inside the box

455
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,040
well i challenge you to think outside

456
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,079
that box

457
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,560
because no innovation comes from

458
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,320
thinking inside the box

459
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,480
good problem solving and keeping on top

460
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,759
of the hackers

461
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,799
is from being outside that box and then

462
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,160
rule zero

463
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
all of us here need to be professional

464
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,640
skeptics that's actually part of being a

465
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
cyber security professional

466
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,839
think about the what if scenarios how

467
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,520
could i break this

468
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,839
not necessarily just functionally how

469
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,039
things should work

470
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,039
but how can i break the working things

471
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,160
follow success work is something that

472
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,640
you do

473
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,320
and not a place that you go i think

474
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,240
that's become much more relevant

475
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,799
in the pandemic where people can be

476
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,799
successful

477
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,320
um online or in an office that shows and

478
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,240
comes through

479
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,720
do the simple things well if there's

480
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,559
five steps to take

481
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,520
to do a two-step process let's not over

482
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,799
complicate the simple

483
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,799
let's do it do it well do it quickly

484
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,679
and then sometimes this is a an unusual

485
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,640
one for people

486
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,120
have the conversation and i bring this

487
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,080
up because

488
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,440
if you agree early on with your

489
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,160
colleague

490
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,679
or the business lead so lastly i put

491
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,000
together a few reminders and really

492
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,240
it was really to make sure that if

493
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,320
you're if you're down and thinking about

494
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,960
you know i

495
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
failed in this project or i didn't do

496
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,720
this right it's okay

497
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,120
it's okay to fail you learn more from

498
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,000
failure

499
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,280
than you do when something goes

500
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,039
successfully and i always say

501
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,320
work smart right a lot of people work

502
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,080
really hard but are they working on the

503
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,280
right things

504
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,200
so if you have to pivot and make some

505
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,559
changes to

506
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,880
get where you need to go it's okay that

507
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,039
path is all right

508
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,480
and substance is important i say that uh

509
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,520
snow melts right you can have things in

510
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,720
different phases

511
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,919
