1

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,040
their mind on and this

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,279
is indeed the underlying theme of

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,360
my

48
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,439
sincere appreciation to all those who

49
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,479
have worked uh

50
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,560
tirelessly i know to bring this event

51
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,600
together

52
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,759
and more specifically to amrita

53
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,680
university for the invitation

54
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,799
to share unesco's vision on women in

55
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,520
science

56
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,720
and to introduce some issues related to

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,600
cyber security 2020 i think it's fair to

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,040
say was

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,520
a unique year where science and

60
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,799
technology were very much

61
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,319
of global uh discussion

62
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,319
sciences mitigating the kovit-19

63
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,360
pandemic

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,959
was uh undoubtedly uh reinforced but

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,959
at the same time while bringing to the

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,280
forefront to the importance of a dynamic

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,560
scientific

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,680
ecosystem the pandemic has also worsened

69
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,080
long-standing inequalities in science

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,319
and in particular issues related to

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,280
gender

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,959
and science including cyber security

73
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,080
women in the field of science i think we

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,720
can say

75
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,239
uh now face a dual contagion

76
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,319
first with the spread of the virus

77
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,000
obviously but also

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,560
with the spread of harmful gender

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,400
inequalities such as

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,760
gender-based stereotypes with the impact

81
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,680
felt particularly gravely by women

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
scientists some even fear that the

83
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,840
hard-won progress

84
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,640
with respect to women in science may be

85
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,120
one

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,440
of those collateral damages of the

87
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
pandemic which

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,920
could unfortunately stay with us going

89
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,519
forward moreover the covet crisis has

90
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,319
particularly exacerbated concerns about

91
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,120
security

92
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,319
in digital spaces and has put the

93
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,000
spotlight on the risks

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,640
associated with data integrity data

95
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,319
confidentiality and data

96
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,360
accessibility our increased presence

97
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,159
online

98
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,040
has led to growing vulnerabilities to

99
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,799
the unethical use of the

100
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,920
internet in that sense i think it's good

101
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,440
to say that the conference uh this

102
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,720
conference comes at a

103
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,040
an opportune time because it will allow

104
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,879
us to take stock of the current

105
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,760
situation

106
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,560
and hopefully help to plan the way

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
forward

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,360
india's rich history of women scientists

109
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,239
and

110
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,400
mathematicians but also the fact that

111
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,920
2020

112
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,480
was actually a bit of a better year for

113
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,000
women in science with

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
two women who became nobel laureates in

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,040
chemistry

116
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,480
and one in physics instill as a a sense

117
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,720
of optimism amidst the pandemic

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,918
to keep our work going and encourage

119
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,959
more women in science um

120
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,320
it was especially heartwarming for

121
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,000
many to see for instance nasa's indian

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,400
american scientist swetie mohan trending

123
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,240
on social media with her

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,880
bindi as nasa's perseverance rover made

125
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,280
a successful landing on mars i don't

126
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,919
know if

127
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,080
uh you all saw these images but i invite

128
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,000
you to to look at them

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,040
if you haven't because they're

130
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,120
particularly inspiring

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,320
personally also recall the viral images

132
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,080
of women scientists at the

133
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,680
indian space research organization clad

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,400
in colorful series celebrating the

135
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
placement of india's satellite into the

136
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,280
orbit around

137
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,320
mars in these instances all these

138
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,039
instances

139
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,600
are reminiscent of the extraordinary

140
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,479
scientific

141
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,520
competence and capability of women

142
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,080
scientists

143
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,719
in advancing science to new heights

144
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,560
despite great opportunities in stem stem

145
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,320
sciences technology engineering and

146
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,039
mathematics it has been observed that

147
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,320
women especially in india are not

148
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,000
pursuing science and technologically

149
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,520
technology academically or

150
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,320
professionally as much as one could hope

151
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,680
studies have shown that science

152
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,000
is still considered a male dominated

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,840
occupation and field of uh

154
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,680
study women are underrepresented

155
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,560
underpaid and often unrecognized for

156
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,840
their scientific

157
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,120
achievements emerging challenges also

158
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,919
include

159
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,639
the potential exposure to harm that is

160
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,440
inherent

161
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,400
to technological development such as the

162
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,680
internet of things

163
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,440
algorithmic decision making and

164
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,199
artificial intelligence

165
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,680
which has led to increased risks of

166
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,479
online

167
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,199
surveillance profiling and data privacy

168
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,639
sadly reports show that women continue

169
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,280
to

170
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,280
endure increased targeted cyber bullying

171
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,479
threats and attacks online there is a

172
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,080
need therefore to uh

173
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,440
address these cyber security issues

174
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,080
holistically to ensure optimal online

175
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,800
safety

176
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,720
for all this may not come as a surprise

177
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,400
when we know that women are not

178
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,919
represented enough

179
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,560
in the field of science again as i was

180
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,919
just mentioning

181
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,080
and maybe we can just look briefly at uh

182
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
data and in this field unesco

183
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,319
has its own unesco institute for

184
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,280
statistics

185
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,319
which shows that less than 30 percent

186
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,039
of the world's scientific researchers

187
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:57,520
are

188
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,800
women and if we look at india it's even

189
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,280
lower it is merely 14

190
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,160
which is a bit ironic because india has

191
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,599
the highest number of

192
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,880
female graduates in stem disciplines 40

193
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,479
stem graduates are women however 14

194
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,720
of the research jobs are occupied by

195
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,840
women

196
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,680
this is an issue that i think we need to

197
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,199
look at very closely

198
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,240
um women in india earned over half of

199
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,840
undergraduate studies in both

200
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
information technology and computer

201
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,639
just about half 50.7 percent and also

202
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,800
science with 54 percent

203
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,840
uh but remained underrepresented

204
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,479
in uh engineering and technology

205
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,800
undergraduates uh degrees overall

206
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,560
only 31 we see also still looking at

207
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,319
statistics that according to the

208
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,599
2021 global gender gap index

209
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,759
india fares rather poorly and ranked

210
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,280
140th among 156 countries

211
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,759
these numbers are a bit disheartening

212
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,720
because women

213
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,520
in stem-based professions can really

214
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,000
make

215
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,199
a mark but we see that gender-based

216
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,000
stereotypes

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the gender pay gap career stagnation

218
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,479
and the double burden of work with women

219
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,280
who have

220
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,319
housework and family care and career

221
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,800
often make it difficult for women to

222
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,759
flourish

223
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,120
in this sector in fact according to a

224
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,080
recently published

225
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,199
article we we saw here the indian i.t

226
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,719
industry uh attracts more women than men

227
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,919
initially but most leave due to

228
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,880
social cultural and organizational

229
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,240
constraints

230
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,320
and we see going back to the kobit

231
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,000
pandemic that it has

232
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,240
amplified these pre-existing gender gaps

233
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
even as women have been at the front

234
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,279
lines of

235
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,320
managing the crisis as essential workers

236
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,360
the hardest hit sectors by lockdown

237
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,240
and rapid digitalization are those where

238
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,800
in fact

239
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,000
women are more frequently employed

240
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,040
so looking at the overall situation i

241
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,360
think we it's fair to remark also that

242
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,880
we are in the midst of

243
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,680
a digital revolution with uh technology

244
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,519
rapidly changing the way

245
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,720
we live but it will not be possible to

246
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,000
thrive as a digital uh nation

247
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,640
global nation if you want with half of

248
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,760
the population

249
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,440
excluded from the tech industry

250
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,080
in order to protect and advance the

251
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,959
progress of

252
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,240
civilization in cyberspace unesco

253
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,640
itself promotes uh basic values and

254
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,000
principles that

255
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,320
we believe need to be enshrined in

256
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,760
knowledge societies

257
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,240
such as peace and democracy the free

258
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,880
flow

259
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,120
of information in the public domain

260
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,000
principles of

261
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,399
tolerance cultural and linguistic

262
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,600
diversity

263
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
and solidarity unesco has also been

264
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,880
mandated by its member states to develop

265
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,640
and perhaps that's of of great interest

266
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,560
to many of you listening to develop an

267
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,360
international

268
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,240
standard setting instrument in the form

269
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,600
of a recommendation

270
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,880
on the ethical principles of artificial

271
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,920
intelligence

272
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,560
which is expected to be adopted by the

273
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,640
unesco general conference in paris

274
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,760
in november 2021 this

275
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,320
uh instrument will include guidance on

276
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,440
how to address

277
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,120
issues related to ai and gender equality

278
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,959
and will also propose possible

279
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,279
approaches for

280
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,200
operationalizing ai and gender equality

281
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,839
ethical principles

282
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,560
optimistically speaking we have seen a

283
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,839
an increase in awareness

284
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,160
amongst various stakeholders to address

285
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,839
all the gaps that i'm

286
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,320
mentioning we have to recognize that

287
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,120
certainly

288
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,760
the government of india academia civil

289
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,200
society as a whole

290
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,880
and also the private sector have become

291
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
more sensitive towards realizing the

292
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,279
potential of women in the stem workforce

293
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,600
and promoting their participation in

294
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,560
science

295
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,440
here i want to mention that the work of

296
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,959
technology giants such as

297
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,880
cannons qualcomm and intel who have

298
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,000
their own

299
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,160
platform for empowering tech women in

300
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,040
india

301
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,880
i want to mention also recently the

302
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,320
royal bank of scotland which

303
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,800
launched a forum called women in tech to

304
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,320
address the issues at

305
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,200
various levels and perhaps i can also

306
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,000
mention

307
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,200
hcl's she inspires initiative

308
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,959
which aims to motivate the next

309
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,320
generation of women

310
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,880
in science and uh technology these are a

311
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,399
lot of very positive

312
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,920
initiatives that's why you know i'm

313
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,519
mentioning some of the

314
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,920
challenges but also some of the

315
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
initiatives that many are launching and

316
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,720
here i also want to mention unesco's own

317
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,040
efforts again we had a publication for

318
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,160
instance called

319
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,839
i'd blush if i could uh

320
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,959
title comes from the the fact that uh a

321
00:11:58,959 --> 00:11:59,600
female

322
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,160
gendered voice assistant is used by

323
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,560
hundreds of millions of people such as a

324
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,839
alexa syrian and others

325
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,639
and this is a publication which raises a

326
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,440
awareness

327
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,959
in the servility expressed by so many

328
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,120
digital assistants projected as young

329
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,240
women

330
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,480
it provides an illustration of gender

331
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
biases that are coded

332
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,959
in technology products pervasive in the

333
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,480
technology sector and

334
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,639
apparent also in digital skills uh

335
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,000
education i really

336
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,160
invite you to discover this publication

337
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,600
again it's called i'd blush

338
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,720
if i could which shares strategies to

339
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,360
close

340
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,240
gender divides in digital skills through

341
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,680
education

342
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,480
at unesco of course i want to mention

343
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,240
that we have a long-standing association

344
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,600
with l'oreal to

345
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,720
encourage women in science

346
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,519
the global women in science program that

347
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,200
we have has been exceptional

348
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,320
in bringing gender equality in science

349
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,120
at uh the forefront this year's call for

350
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,200
nominations by the way for the

351
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,839
awards uh the unesco l'oreal awards is

352
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,519
uh is open we haven't had an indian

353
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,320
woman

354
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,959
for uh i think close to 20 years which

355
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,519
is

356
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,440
a very surprising given again the

357
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,200
strength that we also see

358
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,360
in this field in india no matter what

359
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,959
and as i reach my conclusion i want to

360
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,040
say that gender equality in science and

361
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,079
technology is a

362
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,959
is a key priority for unesco and we aim

363
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:27,519
to

364
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,200
create awareness and build capacities

365
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,760
for women in science and technology this

366
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,839
is a responsibility for

367
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,880
all of us and involves women and men our

368
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,760
vision and

369
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,079
mission to work towards bridging gender

370
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,360
gaps in stem

371
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,519
is certainly reinforced by working with

372
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,839
like-minded individuals and institutions

373
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,760
and i thank you again for the invitation

374
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,120
that you extended

375
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,320
to me on behalf of unesco there's

376
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,360
no doubt that having more women in

377
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,519
science is an

378
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,920
indispensable need it is really time for

379
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,160
us to create all the platforms for their

380
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,880
promotion

381
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,680
participation and retention in science

382
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,320
to bring

383
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,880
forth life stories of women leaders in

384
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,760
stem

385
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,240
fields to encourage the new generation

386
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,000
of women scientists in

387
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,120
in in general and in all fields humanity

388
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,160
needs science and science needs

389
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,040
women i uh congratulate amrita

390
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,120
university and the team at

391
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,079
khan for organizing this initiative to

392
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,360
to promote

393
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,279
and celebrate women in science focusing

394
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,959
more specifically of course in this case

395
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,680
on

396
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,120
cyber security which is a very specific

397
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,560
niche area that i

398
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,760
uh clearly covered only in passing

399
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
these dialogues are critical to

400
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,720
realizing gender equality in stem and i

401
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,040
certainly look forward to listening to

402
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,240
the set of

403
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,639
women speakers and other experts who

404
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,680
will be sharing

405
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,120
their perspectives thank you

406
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,839
thank you mr eric fall for sharing

407
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,320
unesco's vision for women in science and

408
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,839
cyber security

409
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,240
you have indeed given a wonderful

410
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,440
overview on women in

411
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,079
india and what they are capable of yet

412
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,920
being the minority and thus being

413
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,600
underrepresented in stem

414
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,639
for the moment indeed we have to build

415
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,399
this gender gap and we believe

416
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,480
shakti khan is one step forward in

417
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,160
achieving this goal

418
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,320
fortunately unfortunately kovit indeed

419
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,000
has highlighted the urgent need to

420
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,839
address cyber security in many

421
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,199
industries

422
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,199
very interesting facts to ponder upon

423
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,439
thank you very very much again
