what could i share with all of you that

56
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,280

57
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,520
and um you know i've done so many

58
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,200
presentations and i was thinking first

59
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,799
maybe i'll do something about cyber

60
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,840
security

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,680
um and the industry and how it's

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,320
changing but when i think back to

63
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,719
um my career and what's some of the most

64
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,360
impactful and inspirational speakers

65
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,800
that i've heard it's always i learn from

66
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,120
the lessons that others have learned and

67
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
so i thought i'd focus

68
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,680
my time talking about my journey some of

69
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,840
the things that i've learned

70
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,879
and share that with all of you so

71
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,959
i wanted to start from the beginning um

72
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,480
i grew up here

73
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,319
in cupertino california in the bay area

74
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,120
i was born and raised here my parents

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,400
both my mom and dad

76
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,200
are from india they moved here and they

77
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,040
actually met in the us

78
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,080
but both were born and raised in india

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,840
and my dad actually had grown up

80
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,959
incredibly poor in india

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,879
and when it came time he was a very good

82
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,640
student when it came time for him to go

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,760
to college

84
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,640
he didn't have the means to do that um

85
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,080
he didn't have the money he didn't have

86
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,720
the

87
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,560
the you know any of the facilities

88
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,400
needed to go to college

89
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,720
and so he actually ended up writing a

90
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,319
letter to india gandhi the prime

91
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,159
minister of india at the time

92
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,360
and got uh who's sent him uh uh

93
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
sent her all his report cards uh showed

94
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,080
his grades um and said you know i'm a

95
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,440
very good student i don't have the means

96
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,720
to go to college

97
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,840
and indira gandhi had given him a full

98
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,920
scholarship to go to college and

99
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,680
anything he wanted to do for graduate

100
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,519
studies and beyond

101
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,440
i shared this story about my father

102
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,120
because it explains a lot about my

103
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,159
upbringing which was

104
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,720
education was such an important part of

105
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,560
my family and so just

106
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,480
because my dad didn't have the education

107
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,480
that he you know he wouldn't have had it

108
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
without the self he wanted to make sure

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,560
that

110
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,120
my sister my brother and i had the all

111
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,879
the resources to go get the education

112
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,680
that we wanted

113
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,680
so we grew up with all this amazing edu

114
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,120
you know all the resources i had a

115
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,080
computer and i had

116
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,840
encyclopedia set and everything you'd

117
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,200
need to be uh

118
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,519
have a good education in the bay area

119
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,360
and so i'm very proud of that

120
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,439
one of the things that we didn't have

121
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,799
was uh you know what

122
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,560
one of the things because they were very

123
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,159
traditional and we didn't see

124
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,640
a lot of like you know we didn't see our

125
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,360
parents hug

126
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,439
they didn't really hug us very often but

127
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,439
it was kind of what we were used to as

128
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,720
kids and what we were

129
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,600
what we used to see again i share this

130
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,079
because

131
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,600
um i want to share kind of my career

132
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,960
journey but there were some really

133
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,560
meaningful things that happened

134
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,400
throughout my journey that still sit

135
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,000

136
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,560
who i am and have taught me life lessons

137
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,919

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,919
protection was but i was excited that

172
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,639
you i was getting an interview um from

173
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,000
there the rest was history i interviewed

174
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,360
for the role i ended up getting it and

175
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,000
that was my entrance into cyber security

176
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,520
um i was working at pg e probably about

177
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,320
three months

178
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,960
into the role i got a call from my

179
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,440
father

180
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,639
while i was working at pgme um and

181
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,479
it was weird to get a call from him

182
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,000
during the daytime because he would

183
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,720
usually

184
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,160
not call me or bother me because they

185
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,919
wanted me to work very hard and do well

186
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:02,639
at work

187
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,000
so it was weird when i got the phone

188
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,680
call and he just said

189
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,400
rinky you have to come home right now

190
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,960
and i

191
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,400
said right now like in the middle of the

192
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,080
day and i worked about an hour away from

193
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,440
where my parents lived and

194
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,039
he said yes you need to come home right

195
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,720
now and so

196
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,840
i rushed out i left work and i went home

197
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,360
and i drove home and i took the public

198
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
transportation and then

199
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,000
drove my car home from there i arrive at

200
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,039
my street

201
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,240
and i see probably about 20 police cars

202
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,960
and ambulance fire trucks all parked in

203
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,080
front of my house

204
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,639
and i see my mom in front of the house

205
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,919
and she's literally

206
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,680
crying and screaming and she's pointing

207
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,759
at her arm and saying take the device

208
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,960
out of my arm who planted it there and

209
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,520
that was kind of when my world shifted

210
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,160
completely

211
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,720
around it was one of the most

212
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,319
heartbreaking things at the time we

213
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,840
didn't understand it completely as to

214
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,120
what was happening

215
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
we found out that you know that there

216
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,440
was mental illness that ran in my family

217
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,599
my mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia

218
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,800
and a few other

219
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,520
mental illnesses and it was a lot to

220
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,440
comprehend at the time for me

221
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,720
for my family um and you know you have a

222
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,240
lot of questions that come up in your

223
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,680
mind like what am i going to tell other

224
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,639
people

225
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,639
how is anybody going to understand am i

226
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,160
going to suffer from this

227
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,720
and each of us my me my sister my

228
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,759
brother my father

229
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,960
everybody was going through their

230
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,680
emotional journey and

231
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,440
you hear time and time again that mental

232
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,520
illness can rip families apart

233
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,840
it can leave people alone folks don't

234
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
understand it

235
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,919
this was such a critical time for me and

236
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:36,880
my family

237
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,160
when we saw this happen and i saw my dad

238
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,800
shift

239
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,240
from being a just like i said he wasn't

240
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,160
like the huggy touchy feely kind but i

241
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,560
saw him completely shift and change

242
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,759
and i watched him bring family members

243
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,240
together

244
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,639
friends together to make sure that my

245
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,319
mom could live a normal life

246
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,160
and my mom could be well and that she

247
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
could overcome uh

248
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,319
the mental illness and live as normally

249
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,000
and as peacefully as possible

250
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,639
and she did and she even took care of my

251
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,000
daughter when she was a year old and

252
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,199
lived normally

253
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,080
but what i learned in that moment was

254
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,400
everything about teamwork it changed my

255
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,160
perspective in life it changed my

256
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
perspective in my career

257
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,639
i saw how the power of people and people

258
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,000
being around you who you surround

259
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,879
yourself

260
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,199
with compliment yourself with people

261
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,120
with various strengths

262
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,280
ask for help make sure that there's a

263
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,639
whole community of people that are

264
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,799
moving you forward and helping you

265
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,640
and this is a lesson that sticks with me

266
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,719
today i'm very passionate you

267
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,880
hear me talking outside of here about

268
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,399
mental health as well it's a really

269
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,080
important topic to me but one of the

270
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,839
things that i've seen is when you have

271
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,000
when you know even today even today with

272
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,440
covid and all of these things

273
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,040
people suffer from mental health and i

274
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,640
think it's others around

275
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,560
them that carry them forward and help

276
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
you kind of come out of uh

277
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,800
out of those situations and so i think

278
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,640
teamwork was such an important lesson

279
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,560
for me and i carried forward

280
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,440
um in every job that i had so i was at

281
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:03,920

282
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,720
you know i was at pg e suffered this

283
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,120
thing

we got through it and then um i was at

closer to home

305
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,279
and find something that aligns with my

306
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,800
passion which was

307
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
driving security culture change within

308
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,320
companies i found that

309
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,200
being a developer at heart um but having

310
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,880
now experience in the cyber security

311
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,920
industry

312
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,720
what i was very passionate about was how

313
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,800
do you build security into the dna of a

314
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,000
company how do you change

315
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,240
and win the hearts and minds of

316
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,360
employees

317
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,200
in a company such that security becomes

318
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,040
something that they're thinking about

319
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,680
uh you know in every part of their job

320
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
and so i found this perfect role for me

321
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
at ebay which was a security culture

322
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,959

323
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,399
i took that on my career grew at

324
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,399
ebay um and my boss ended up taking

325
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,040
a different role and that position got

326
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,839
open and

327
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,160
i it was a chief of staff position for

328
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,480

and it was the first time in my career

332
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,839
that i felt you know what i think i'm

333

and i asked him at the time that hey i

339
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,320
would love to take this chief of staff

340
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,560
role for the security organization

341
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,079
um you know here are all the things i've

342
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,839
done here's what i can do for the

343
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,680
organization

344
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,279
and he came back and said no

345
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,360
rinky you're not ready you're not ready

346
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,640
for the role

347
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,279
and i literally wanted to go and hide

348
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,880
under a rock i didn't want to come back

349
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,040
to work i was mortified i was so

350
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,720
embarrassed that i had even asked the

351
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,519
question

352
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,760
i was thinking how do i even look him in

353
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,640
the eyes again

354
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,120
tomorrow at work um and i think i need

355
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
to go find a new job

356
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,959
and so that thought process continued in

357
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,079
my head for about

358
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,640
maybe a week or two and then i came back

359
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,200
and i

360
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,440
was like you know what he doesn't know

361
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,399
like

362
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,320
i'm gonna get that job and i came back

363
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,680
and i worked my butt off

364
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,040
and i showed that yes not only can i do

365
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,800
that role but i can do a lot more than

366
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,440
that

367
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,240
um and about three three to six months i

368
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,880
think it was about six months after

369
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,360
my boss said rinky what do i have to do

370
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,959
to keep you like i can't lose you and i

371
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,440
said

372
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,279
i want that chief of staff role and he

373
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,959
said you got it

374
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,600
and what else do you want um the reason

375
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
i share this story

376
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,639
is time and time again it's proven that

377
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,959
we like as we as women we don't take

378
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:07,680
risks

379
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,800
um and it's that's a proven data point

380
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,399
and i think risk taking

381
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,040
is so important it's so important to our

382
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,000
careers

383
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,200
every time i've taken a risk

384
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,360
it's been something that's been so

385
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,279
positive and i learned something from it

386
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,440
every single time and a lot of risks you

387
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,600
take as long as they're calculated

388
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,959
they're going to be there's going to be

389
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,279
calculated risks you take where

390
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,279
you may not actually it may not pan out

391
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,279
well but i can tell you those moments

392
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,320
are the ones that you're going to learn

393
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,120
the most

394
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
and it makes the next risk you take

395
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,480
easier and easier

396
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,600
and easier and that feeling that i

397
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,040
shared about me wanting to

398
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,600
go hide under a rock and not ever come

399
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,760
and make eye contact with anyone

400
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,320
now it's it doesn't last two weeks it

401
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,880
lasts

402
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,360
five seconds i can brush it off and walk

403
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,160
in and be

404
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,720
again right back up again on i'm taking

405
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,079
my next risk

406
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,079
um and so i think that's my second

407
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,360
lesson that i wanted to share

408
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,320
is that risk taking making mistakes

409
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,839
feeling really confident

410
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,680
about taking on something that you might

411
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,440
not quite be ready for

412
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,120
is the way that you're going to feel

413
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,720
that challenge and that

414
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,839
just fire in your belly and so

415
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,399
i wanted to share that story um and that

416
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,440
was kind of

417
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,600
where i landed at ebay so i got that

418
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,760
chief of staff role i did that for a few

419
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,560
years

420
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,519
i took on more functions at ebay and i

421
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,320
got to a

422
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
point then um where i had my second

423
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
child and i went on maternity leave and

424
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
i felt that

425
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,360
hey i kind of need a new change and

426
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,519
i was managing a really large global

427
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,040
team and i came

428
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,880
out and i said you know i think i need

429
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,079
to go back to being an individual

430
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,320
contributor being a parent of two kids

431
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
plus managing a big team it was just

432
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,440
burning me out

433
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,880
so i went and took on an individual

434
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,639
contributor role at intuit i

435
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,720
was the information security officer for

436
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,880
a few of their business units

437
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,720
um did that for about three months when

438
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,079
they said rinky

439
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,519
we're transforming we're going from

440
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,360
package software into it

441
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,880
to public cloud we're going to move

442
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,120
turbo tax into aws

443
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,920
that was a game-changing decision in the

444
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,279
industry at the time to move

445
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,320
such sensitive data into public cloud

446
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,240
and it changed the industry in ways that

447
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,560
we now see it manifesting in terms of

448
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,240
what you can do in cloud

449
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,519
and so this was um for me i thought

450
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,680
man i have never led product security

451
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,440
before and to take that on

452
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,240
and help them transform into the cloud

453
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
that i don't know if i can do it or not

454
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,959
but i was

455
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,800
very excited about it i had that fire in

456
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,880
my belly i took on the role

457
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,800
led product security built out a global

458
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,120
organization with offices in india and

459
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,440
israel and in the u.s

460
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,600
did that for a few years that led me to

461
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,639
palo alto networks

462
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,959
um and that was another career chef i

463
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,040
within cyber security i then took on a

464
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,959
security operations role

465
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,440
um i built the sock for palo alto

466
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,040
networks when you think about that

467
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,279
peloton networks is a company that is

468
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,120
the leader leading cyber security

469
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,320
product company

470
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,040
and i got to build these security

471
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,320
operations center

472
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,720
for palo alto networks which is what

473
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,600
other companies

474
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,279
modeled their security operations

475
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,440
centers after um and

476
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
it was interesting because you don't see

477
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,279
very many women leading security

478
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,720
operations role

479
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,120
and there was um a user conference that

480
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,639
palo alto networks had and we had the

481
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,320
head the director of

482
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,440
csi cyber the tv show there and

483
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,759
there's a famous actress in that show um

484
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,720
that he has

485
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,040
and she patricia arquette and she's the

486
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,560
woman that's leading all security

487
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,199
incidents

488
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,199
and he made a comment of oh i'm really

489
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,240
sorry for

490
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,800
glamorizing the leader of incident

491
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,160
response rules

492
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,839
and everybody all my colleagues looked

493
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,759
back at me and i was like no no

494
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,360
don't be sorry for glamorizing it

495
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,959
because i'm the woman in high heels that

496
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,800
runs around in his leading incidents for

497
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,079
palo alto networks

498
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,240
um so very different role than i had

499
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,199
before

500
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,519
um i went from there to lead enterprise

501
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,199
security at ibm

502
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,480
for about a year and then from ibm

503
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,560
i went to rubrik to take on my first

504
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,199
chief information security officer role

505
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,759
i joined rubrik after um rubrik had a

506
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,880
breach to lead

507
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,440
to build out their security program um i

508
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:15,920
was

509
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,480
at rubrik for a little about almost two

510
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,320
years to lead their security program

511
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,639
without a global function there

512
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,800
really build robust security for cloud

513
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,839
and for what they were doing in the

514
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,000
backup recovery space

515
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,440
and then covet hit um and

516
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,399
i i was so excited to take rubrik public

517
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,240
and build a security program

518
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,920
and no one could have thought uh

519
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,600
anticipated the things that happened

520
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,800
with us all going

521
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,240
shelter in place and so shelter in place

522
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,880
happen and

523
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
i'll be honest with you it gave me a lot

524
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,360
more time at home i was traveling before

525
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,320
i was doing all this um you know like

526
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,079
work meetings in the office

527
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,600
and all that came a little bit to a

528
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,000
standstill and it gave me a lot more

529
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,959
time and so

530
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,839
i'm i was in that extra time i was

531
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,920
working out for three hours every day i

532
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,000
was cooking extravagant meals like you

533
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,919
wouldn't believe for my family

534
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,319
um and i did that for almost gosh it was

535
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,760
like two months three months

536
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,880
into covid and it got really tiring for

537
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,919
me really fast

538
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,839
and i sat back and i got a little bit i

539
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,280
went through a little bit of an identity

540
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,400
crisis that

541
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,559
what what am i doing i don't feel like

542
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,400
i'm making impact in the world i don't

543
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,919
feel like i'm driving change i don't

544
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,959
feel like

545
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,280
i there's something wrong and it took me

546
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,360
a while to realize that

547
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
i had lost my passion along the way

548
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,039
somewhere when covet hit

549
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,280
and that i didn't that fire wasn't there

550
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,880
and it took me down a little bit of a

551
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,600
spiral

552
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,039
and it made it made me realize that

553
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,559
i need to find something where i'm

554
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,400
driving change i'm making impact

555
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,840
i need to work for a place where i feel

556
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,400
real passion around what i'm doing

557
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,640
and so i started interviewing um and i

558
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,480
started looking for other roles

559
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,640
and uh twitter came along and said hey

560
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,080
rinky we'd love to talk to you about the

561
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,039
cso rule at twitter and

562
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,720
when i thought about the changes that

563
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,400
they were making how they were impacting

564
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:04,960
the world

565
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,039
at that time some of the values that

566
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,559
they really stood behind

567
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,640
decisions they had to make that were so

568
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,600
difficult

569
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,160
um i said i had to do it and then as i

570
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,039
was interviewing

571
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,200
they faced a massive breach and they

572
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,559
asked me rinky do you

573
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,679
still want to come in and i said 100

574
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,320
um and again i shared this story

575
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,600
specifically

576
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,960
because i think we've all gone through

577
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,480
hard times with the shelter in place

578
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,160
we've seen our families and friends go

579
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,400
through hard times as well

580
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,480
through the hard times the great times

581
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,559
you have to make sure that you're doing

582
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,799
what you're super passionate about

583
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,120
um and i think that's the one of the

584
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,480
most important things because it makes

585
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,320
the tough times a little less tough it

586
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,160
makes the great times even better when

587
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,520
you find your passion

588
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,440
and i know in cyber security when i

589
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,640
started

590
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,120
i did not like my first role i did not

591
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,240
like what i was doing

592
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,720
and i found my passion and i again i

593
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,240
lost my passion along the way

594
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,080
i went back and i found that passion and

595
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
i think that's the most important thing

596
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,200
in what you do

597
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,799
is to make sure that you're super

598
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,320
passionate about it

599
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,440
um and so those are my stories

600
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,760
um you know if i could leave everybody

601
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,679
with three lessons here

602
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,720
it was one teamwork is everything

603
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,200

605
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,320
farther together

606
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,559
um risk take risks take really big risks

607
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,280
make mistakes embrace them learn from

608

experiences i'll i'll let the

618
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,520
participants ask

619
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,919
questions if any of you have questions

620
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,280
please type them on the chat

621
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,159
we have a question what's the best way

622
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,360
to manage your time

623
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,600
gosh that's a good one um you know for

624
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,559
me i

625
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,679
um i prioritize ruthlessly so to

626
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,919
you know i have two kids at home and

627
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,600
people always ask me ricky

628
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,200
how do you manage it how do you manage

629
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,880
it and i feel like

630
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,799
every day you have limited amount of

631
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,480
time and you have to make

632
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,159
decisions around that time and you're

633
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,000
going to prioritize certain things and

634
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,600
say these are the most important things

635
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,840
i need to do today

636
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,480
and then you have to feel really good

637
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,000
about what you got done

638
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,480
um and i think to me managing your time

639
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,679
is all about

640
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,200
where you want to put your time feeling

641
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,880
really good about where you're deciding

642
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,080
to put your time

643
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,880
um you know i share this a lot about

644
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
moms feel really guilty like i know i

645
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,000
did earlier

646
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,240
um and they feel like oh if i go and

647
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,000
travel for work

648
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,320
i'm not gonna be there for my kids or if

649
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,080
i'm there for my kids i'm missing out on

650
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,440
that work trip

651
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,760
um i've done both i've missed out on my

652
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,440
daughter's dance recitals or school

653
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,640
performances

654
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,480
because i chose to travel and i'm very

655
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,000
proud of that decision and where it

656
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
landed me and on other hands i've been

657
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,640
at the

658
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,200
dance performance or that school speech

659
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,039
and i feel very good about being there

660
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:15,520
for my

661
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,240
daughter so um i don't carry any guilt i

662
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,120
think there's enough people that are

663
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,480
gonna try to make you feel guilty about

664
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,840
how you use your time

665
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,120
just feel really good about how you're

666
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,320
using your time and make sure you

667
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,679
prioritizing you're

668
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,520
actually taking the time to plan out

669
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,000
what that means

670
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,760
yeah well said ricky i mean especially

671
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,280
the part about feeling guilty

672
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,799
uh yeah i agree

673
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,480
second question what are the biggest

674
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,640
security incidents you've handled as a

675
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,039
system

676
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,799
gosh um there's been so many uh there's

677
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,400
you know the most interesting ones to me

678
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,640
are like always the insider threat

679
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,600
cases um but i've i've dealt with some

680
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,880
of the biggest ones have been nation

681
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,480
state attacks that

682
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,559
were really crafty done over many many

683
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,000
years um

684
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,919
but some of the most interesting ones

685
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,000
were insider threat cases where somebody

686
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
was actually doing something really bad

687
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,480
and

688
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,320
you catch them through a nuance right

689
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,520
someone um

690
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,200
there was an incident that to deal with

691
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,520
where somebody took terabytes of data

692
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,280
over a two three week period and

693
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,799
transferred it into their personal

694
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,679
account

695
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,919
um and that landed us in starting an

696
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,679
investigation under that against that

697
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,720
individual

698
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,039
that then blew up to it was one thing

699
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,480
after another after another that

700
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,159
individuals in a country

701
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,720
um where it was hard to take away their

702
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,080
laptop and their

703
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,840
devices and their other desktop

704
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,360
computers they had because

705
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,520
uh that wasn't the culture and so lots

706
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,200
of nuances and we found out that the

707
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,000
incident was much

708
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,760
larger and the insider threat case was

709
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
much bigger than we had originally even

710
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,039
anticipated

711
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,880
um and i actually had to fly out of the

712
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,480
country to deal with that one

713
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,919
and we were also worried that in that

714
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,679
country employees are allowed to bring

715
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,360
guns to the office and so

716
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,720
that was another thing we had to think

717
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,240
about okay how do we do this what if

718
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,240
that individual has a gun in the office

719
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,840
how are we going to deal with the inside

720
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,760
entire case um so

721
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,159
super interesting insider threat cases

722
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,440
but yeah

723
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,120
that was uh that was one of the more

724
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,640
interesting ones not the biggest one the

725
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,320
biggest one was that nation state attack

726
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,120
we had to deal with

727
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,360
thank you the next question what's the

728
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,080
best mindset to have as a woman in tech

729
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,440
feel that when we have so many

730
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,400
challenges coming our way

731
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,960
um i like this question because we do

732
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,520
have

733
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400
challenges right um and i think what

734
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,440
i've learned

735
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,159
along the way is that you know we're

736
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,360
surrounded um

737
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,760
we're we are the minority when it comes

738
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,919
to tech and specifically cyber

739
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,080
but one thing that i've learned is that

740
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,159
people usually have good intent

741
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,679
even you know if someone whether it's

742
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,440
someone speaking over you

743
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,200
or it's somebody who doesn't understand

744
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,880
your situation you might be a new mom

745
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,480
you need to take some time off

746
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,799
and you're not able to convey that what

747
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,520
i've learned is

748
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,039
when you can educate those around you

749
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,880
that's the power that we bring to the

750
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,640
table only we know what we're going

751
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,200
through

752
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,279
and a lot of times education goes a long

753
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,520
way when someone does speak over you to

754
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,559
say that hey

755
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,640
i have a point to make and i've been

756
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,159
interrupted and i'd like to get my point

757
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:10,720
across

758
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,360
or to even go back after a meeting and

759
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,880
share with someone that i wasn't able to

760
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,320
get my

761
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,919
my thoughts across in that meeting

762
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,440
because there were too many people

763
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,400
talking and i'd love for

764
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,480
you to be an advocate for me and for

765
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,679
other women

766
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,279
to convey our thoughts or whatever it

767
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,679
might be and so i find myself that it's

768
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,919
constant education process around you

769
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,120
assume good intent

770
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,360
and you know teach people when they

771
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,320
might not know

772
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,559
what they're doing might be causing

773
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,158
roadblocks that shouldn't be there

774
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,080
thank you the next question what's your

775
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,799
answer to

776
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,120
where should an organization start if it

777
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,480
does not have any i.t

778
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,760
sock if it doesn't have what

779
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,120
an i.t sock oh um

780
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,480
i think the best place to start

781
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,720
is you start with visibility right so if

782
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,760
you don't have a sock

783
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,200
you one of the things you want to start

784
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,600
doing is start collecting visibility

785
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,000
um and seeing what's in your environment

786
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,760
and once you start doing that then you

787
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,360
can start building okay what do we need

788
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,000
to monitor

789
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,600
for because now you start understanding

790
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,000
your environment uh better and so that i

791
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,279
think is the best thing

792
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,080
that one can do and that will start the

793
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,679
that will create the use case

794
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,200
of why you might need a security

795
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,640
operations center because as you get

796
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,159
visibility and as you start writing

797
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:28,960
rules

798
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,919
and that starts uh you know firing off

799
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:32,559
alerts

800
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,480
you'll finally be able to go back and

801
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,799
see that hey this is where we need to go

802
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,320
and actually invest in a security

803
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,200
operations center

804
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,000
thank you um any more questions

805
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
how do you stay productive while also

806
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,799
preventing burnout

807
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,039
um i say this to my friends and family

808
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,640
members all the time but you know

809
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,080
i would go absolutely insane if i didn't

810
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,880
exercise

811
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,640
i carve out lots of time in my day to

812
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,400
exercise i spend my morning i

813
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,559
start my morning off by having a like

814
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,480
one and a half hour exercise and then

815
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,400
anytime i have a 15 minute break i go

816
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,000
out and get some fresh air i go for a

817
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,919
walk i do whatever i can

818
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,360
um and so my your mental health and

819
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,679
your physical health nobody's gonna care

820
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,279
about it except you

821
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,720
you and when you're mentally and

822
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,320
physically healthy you can be there for

823
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,400
everybody else and so i think the only

824
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,000
way you can be productive

825
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,559
is if you make time for yourself and

826
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,480
that's how you avoid burnout you have to

827
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,120
take

828
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,200
the time off you have to be mentally

829
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
healthy you have to be physically

830
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,279
healthy and

831
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,200
take care of yourself and make sure that

832
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
if mental health means that you need to

833
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,039
go and take a vacation for a few days

834
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,480
you need to make that decision for

835
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,400
yourself rather than burning yourself

836
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,320
out the next question

837
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,559
as a fresher i want to enter the cyber

838
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,600
security field

839
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,679
so what are the things that i should be

840
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,520
looking for when i'm trying to land my

841
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,158
first job

842
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,679
um this is what i shared i think

843
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,200
what i've learned in my career is a lot

844
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,360
of people go after the

845
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,960
big company or they look at salary

846
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
and they look at you know money and all

847
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,640
these things are important yes it's nice

848
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,320
to work at a big company and it's nice

849
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,000
to get paid really well we all want

850
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,480
that but i think the most important

851
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,440
thing

852
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,039
who you're working for who you're going

853
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,039
to be working with i mentioned

854
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,360
earlier that when i was at walmart one

855
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,960
of my peers

856
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,720
he took me under his wings and he taught

857
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,559
me everything and i still think like why

858
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,480
did he invest in me in that way but he

859
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:36,799
did

860
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,720
and he showed me everything and it

861
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,320
taught me so much at the time that i

862
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,760
couldn't have learned in books and i

863
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,360
could not have learned in classes

864
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,840
and it doesn't matter what i was paid or

865
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,360
anything else it was

866
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,039
that was the most valuable thing where

867
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,640
the people and it started teaching me

868
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,919
that people's everything

869
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,159
your team has everything and so i think

870
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,159
the most important thing to look at is

871
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,960
not not the money not the company name

872
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,399
not necessarily the title

873
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,080
but do you really like the people that

874
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,520
you're going to be working with and i

875
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:03,840
think

876
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,240
everything else will come into place

877
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
whether it's in that role or in a future

878
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,480
role

879
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,080
thank you so thank you so much for

880
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,840
sharing your personal and professional

881
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,200
experiences with us

882
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,240
today you mentioned a very few a lot of

883
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,919
key things actually during your talk

884
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,520
like education mental illness physical

885
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,559
health actually

886
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,440
family importance of being confident and

887
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,000
passionate

888
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,279
about what you do also um taking risks

889
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,159
is what got you here um and also a few

890
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:36,960
of your oh

891
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,120
moments like the ones about the chief of

892
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,559
staff where you mentioned that you

893
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,159
wanted to do something and

894
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,760
someone said you're not ready and then

895
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,279
you came back with a bang you know

896
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,679
so those experiences are really um

897
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,600
inspiring for all of us to hear

898
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
so thank you so much for sharing them

899
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,880
with us today

900
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,440
um i think there is also another

901
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,559
question that is coming

902
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,600
um after a data breach occurs

903
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,679
how should a company handle it like what

904
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,760
are the steps

905
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,080
yeah i think um when a data breach

906
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,440
happens

907
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,000
it's first you understand i think one of

908
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,120
the things you want to do is quickly

909
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,080
understand

910
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,200
that what kind of breaches is it

911
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,640
what kind of data might have been

912
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,559
exposed you want to get all the facts

913
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,919
so i know that you don't want to make

914
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,919
any decision until you have most of the

915
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:22,559
facts

916
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,399
the next step is you want to communicate

917
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,000
internally to have the right

918
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,320
stakeholders right be make them aware

919
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,000
that this is what's going on that here's

920
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
the data that we have around the breach

921
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,760
here's what's happened here's our

922
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
understanding and here's the impact

923
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,120
and then you should have so you should

924
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,960
have playbooks already

925
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,799
set in stone that say if there's a

926
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,799
breach here's kind of how we're gonna go

927
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:43,600
and execute

928
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,039
beyond that so that you can be

929
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,720
transparent then to your customers or

930
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,600
users

931
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,080
uh and let them know that hey here's

932
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,880
what happened

933
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,559
here's how we're dealing with it here's

934
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,240
our containing it

935
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,399
and have the right kind of public

936
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,840
communications that are needed

937
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,919
around the breach so i think first it's

938
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,120
make sure you have all the data

939
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
work on containing it communicate

940
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,799
internally and quickly

941
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,720
execute on a playbook so that you can

942
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,399
externally talk about it in the right

943
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,919
way and make sure that you

944
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,000
don't lose your users or you don't lose

945
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,520
customers because of

946
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,679
poorly managed communications beyond

947
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,159
behind the breach

948
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,720
thank you the next question uh what is

949
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,159
your thought process about

950
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,240
making decisions during tough situations

951
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,760
like how do you go about it

952
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,640
um you know i always when there's a

953
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,559
tough situation i try to dissect it

954
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,919
right so it's always

955
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,200
a tough situation is going to make you

956
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,120
feel a certain way whether it's angry or

957
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,000
upset or

958
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,640
it's difficult to solve or whatever that

959
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,520
might be

960
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,279
um and to me i always think a tough

961
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,640
situation

962
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,720
there's very few tough situations where

963
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,480
you have to solve it in the moment a lot

964
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,919
of times you can kind of walk away from

965
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:50,880
it and say you know what

966
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,720
i'm going to come back and solve this i

967
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,000
think the most important thing is

968
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,640
understand

969
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,480
being able to dissect what are the

970
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,559
things that make this situation tough

971
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,080
and how can you

972
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,080
tackle each one of those things to

973
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,279
simplify it

974
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,200
and then go and tackle each one of those

975
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,279
and pull who you need to help you solve

976
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:07,760
those

977
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,440
tough situations as well you don't have

978
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,960
to always do it on your own

979
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,080
yeah so um you know the

980
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,760
social media companies like twitter

981
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,120
facebook etc so

982
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,440
they deal with a lot of data of users

983
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,159
you know and

984
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,399
there are leaks that happen quite a lot

985
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,960
like how do you think or what what

986
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,640
is what do you think are the

987
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,960
consequences or the damage like how do

988
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,279
you

989
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,440
damage control it later and you know how

990
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,519
do you go about it

991
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,799
yeah you know

992
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,120
when breaches happen it can be too hard

993
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,600
and you know the companies will

994
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,360
face financial consequences there's no

995
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,960
question about it i think the

996
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,640
bigger thing is what can a company

997
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,080
rebound from a breach

998
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,399
and we've seen that companies disappear

999
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,080
sometimes because of breaches

1000
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,080
and sometimes they rebound and they can

1001
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,720
be even stronger after a breach

1002
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,039
and so it all depends on how they handle

1003
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,000
it i think right

1004
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,519
and again it also depends on the

1005
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,279
financial consequences so i don't think

1006
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,640
there's a

1007
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,880
right or wrong answer for this um but

1008
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,919
we've seen that when

1009
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,679
companies do come back and they do make

1010
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,200
the proper investments and they come

1011
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,399
back and they communicate and they're

1012
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,679
transparent to their

1013
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,000
customers and they try to really fix the

1014
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,799
issues

1015
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,399
you'll see them come back and come back

1016
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,000
strong and in some cases it can just

1017
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,679
completely wipe out a company

1018
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,360
and this is why i think it's so

1019
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,120
important for companies to think about

1020
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,159
security

1021
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,480
at the design phase very early in

1022
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,519
development and

1023
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,000
you know the earlier a new company is

1024
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,720
starting

1025
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,640
that they bring in security expertise

1026
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,159
the better off that they're gonna be

1027
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,600
right and so they've got that thought

1028
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,519
process once you build a company and

1029
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,240
it's like

1030
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,640
big it's very hard at that point then to

1031
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,039
go back and fix a lot of the legacy tech

1032
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:47,519
issues

1033
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,360
and tech debt that you've accumulated

1034
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,799
over time so i think

1035
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,279
um just thinking about what the impact

1036
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,640
of a breach we've seen it

1037
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,039
all over the place i mean you as well as

1038
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,080
i know that

1039
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,399
the news is all over around this topic

1040
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,399
yeah uh i think we can take one last

1041
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,679
question which is

1042
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,519
um i know you mentioned about security

1043
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,600
incidents during your time as a ciso

1044
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,240
but what are the the main challenges

1045
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,000
that you face as a citizen or day-to-day

1046
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,919
life

1047
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,159
you know it's it's what i mentioned as

1048
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,200
also you know

1049
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,440
being a woman um you're you're i feel

1050
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,519
like secure being a cso in general is

1051
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,320
the same thing

1052
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,000
i feel like our job is to constantly

1053
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,519
educate others

1054
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,360
about whether it's educating um

1055
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,600
other your partners in the organization

1056
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,399
around

1057
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,039
translating risks to you know

1058
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,159
translating you know

1059
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,320
complex issues into business risks that

1060
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,519
they can understand

1061
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,279
and you're educating folks on hey here's

1062
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,960
a risk in your department that

1063
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
you're accepting here's what the impact

1064
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,799
of that might be and you're constantly

1065
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,919
teaching people

1066
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,120
you're teaching the board and you're

1067
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,480
teaching the executive team and you're

1068
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,679
teaching the company

1069
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,760
and that's a big part of the cso rule i

1070
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,440
would say that is a constant and when

1071
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,120
you talk to other csos you'll hear that

1072
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,600
too

1073
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,279
and some some people will say that you

1074
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,519
need csos need really good communication

1075
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,279
or csos need to be plugged in with the

1076
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,000
business

1077
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
and i think when i boil it all down it

1078
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,599
just comes to one of the things csos

1079
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,879
have to be very good at

1080
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,359
is constantly educating those around

1081
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,598
them

1082
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,800

uh women only cyber security conference

1095

at the scale for the first time and we

1096
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,320
were quite unsure of so many things

1097
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,280
um and rinky was very kind enough to

1098

ways and

1103
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,599
