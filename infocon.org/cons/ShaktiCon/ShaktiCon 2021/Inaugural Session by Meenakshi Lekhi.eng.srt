good morning everyone and i must thank

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,600
uh

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,560
shakthikhan and i must thank amma for

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,759
such a fantastic

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,960
initiative as the name suggests

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,320
shakti khan but

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,439
the fact is that shakti to deal with

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,000
ponds

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
is what we need and shakti is what women

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,200
usually have and indian women are no

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,000
strangers

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,280
but by listening to my

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,320
previous speaker from unesco

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,600
i realized that we as indians

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,520
suffer from historical and

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,320
cultural biases and historical and

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,200
cultural bias

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,439
one being an indian and on top of that

52
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,479
being women

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,680
we suffer from double whammy and double

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,360
jeopardy and double sense of

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,800
bias is what we are usually dealing with

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,840
and when we look at the data in detail

57
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,239
india is actually ahead of the world

58
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,959
when it comes to women in technology

59
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,760
india has the highest number of women

60
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,000
graduates in the stem field

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,280
although 44 of the entire

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,239
stem graduates are women this number

63
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,480
faces a sharp decline

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,760
as one goes up in the higher levels of

65
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,280
education and only six percent

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,120
opt for a phd in engineering and

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,160
technology

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,280
and women account for only 14

69
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,680
of the total scientists engineers

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,680
technologists in research and

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,959
developmental institutions the number of

72
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,000
women

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,040
working in ai is above the

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,560
global average which is 24

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,000
and according to 2019 report on gender

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,400
diversity in ai research india ranks 18

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,280
out of 34 countries in the share of

78
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,480
papers

79
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,400
with at least one female author and 16

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,519
in the unique female authors category

81
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,879
furthermore the average penetration

82
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,159
of ai skills in india in specific

83
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,480
sectors such as software i.t services

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,640
hardware and networking education

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,120
finance manufacturing etc is 2.6 times

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,400
higher than the global average when

87
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,239
we decipher the data across the

88
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,360
similar sets of occupations so

89
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
the point i'm trying to make is it is

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,360
imperative

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,720
to set young girls and youth involved in

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,680
ai

93
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,760
at the same time we must take pride in

94
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,120
ourselves

95
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,480
and the fact that government has started

96
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,640
with new education policy

97
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,279
and has stressed that school children

98
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,279
will have to be exposed to

99
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,960
tuition skills such as digital literacy

100
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,400
is imperative and i wish

101
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,680
and pray that the crucial skills in

102
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,800
not just in terms of digital literacy

103
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
but coding computational thinking format

104
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,160
and many teaching

105
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,880
contemporary subjects such as artificial

106
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,080
intelligence design

107
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,880
thinking etc 3d mechanism

108
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,600
big data analysis machine learning will

109
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,160
also

110
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,440
integrate our social setups where

111
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,479
more and more female children

112
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,759
get into the field and maybe outwit

113
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,919
the other streams and that is what the

114
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,280
true education

115
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,680
which is ready for the new industrial

116
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,479
revolution

117
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,960
will be ready professionals in coming

118
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,840
future

119
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,639
and that is why i normally insist that

120
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,120
there has to be a national strategy for

121
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,000
ai

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,840
and taking it further from where my

123
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,520
previous speaker

124
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,800
ended that in terms of

125
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,320
emerging technologies alexa and others

126
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,800
where they are showing women in more

127
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
subservient roles

128
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,680
there is a other kind of bias which

129
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
exists in the system

130
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,320
and there is a stereotype which is woven

131
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,440
in our communications and

132
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,479
that already existing social bias

133
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,600
is what we usually face

134
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,960
and watch even in ai world because ai

135
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,759
world

136
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,800
is reflective of how societies operate

137
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,560
a big technology firm like amazon

138
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,680
was making use of a secret ai

139
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,520
to filter applications and it was found

140
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,840
that it preferred male candidates over

141
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,280
female candidates

142
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,840
now this is the kind of applications

143
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,880
shifting

144
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,080
which is going on in various uh firms

145
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,120
now obviously this this these kind of uh

146
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,240
filtration

147
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,160
will cause less women to join the

148
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,720
workforce because there is a already

149
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,360
existing

150
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,720
bias in the system and this program

151
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,960
was eventually scrapped once it was

152
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,000
discovered

153
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,280
and in other instance google

154
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,400
translate changed she is a doctor too

155
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,520
he is a doctor and he's a babysitter too

156
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,199
she's a babysitter

157
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,080
they have also been cases where ai have

158
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,039
analyzed

159
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,320
women's faces hair calling it's pretty

160
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,840
[Music]

161
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,440
uh dark blonde

162
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,400
so on and so forth and in case of men

163
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,360
business

164
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,039
smart etc so all this is reflective of

165
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,680
the

166
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,479
historical and cultural bias which women

167
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,479
serve

168
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,120
suffer from and machine learning is

169
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,960
reflective of the mindset

170
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,360
of the people who are feeding data

171
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,720
collecting data

172
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,880
and if women are less i mean in the

173
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,240
field of engineering

174
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,280
manufacturing then that is not what it

175
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,720
is going to continue

176
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,120
things are changing and i always say

177
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,000
that ai

178
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,280
is not the future ai is the present

179
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,000
technology is not the future technology

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,039
is the present as

181
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,240
oberd has shown already that whether

182
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
it's interconnectivity or delivery

183
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,280
systems

184
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,960
or machinations we we need it all

185
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,599
and for better delivery systems we need

186
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,160
it all

187
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,360
and thus the question of cyber security

188
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,560
because if there is a social bias

189
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,160
existing against women and is reflected

190
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,599
by the machines

191
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,039
how do we expect women to remain secure

192
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,199
in the cyber world because they are

193
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,319
consumers

194
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,199
of the same technology they live in a

195
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,720
biased society

196
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,680
and they have to outgrow all these

197
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,639
challenges

198
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,240
in their real life so whether it's

199
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,479
mission mars to mission moon

200
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,000
india has shown many women in the

201
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,440
in the field of rocketry in the field of

202
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,958
missile i remember tessie thomas who was

203
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,880
our face as a is a

204
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,160
missile woman after apj kalam the second

205
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,240
phase i'm sure there have been many in

206
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,920
between but the first

207
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,600
phase was uh apj kalam for the simple

208
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,839
reason

209
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,080
there's a bias that muslims

210
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,519
coming from southern india cannot grow

211
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,200
to become in

212
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,600
in the field of science and rise to such

213
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,399
high

214
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,440
uh places as the former president apj

215
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,920
kalang

216
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,480
but india has shown the way how far

217
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,000
minorities can

218
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,040
go in a country like ours which is very

219
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,440
unlike many other countries of the west

220
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,760
which call themselves developed

221
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,959
similarly how a women's how women

222
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,800
scientists like kesley thomas

223
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,839
showed and she became

224
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,600
like a like a star that how women

225
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,320
dressed in sorry wearing flowers in

226
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,279
their hair

227
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,600
were top of the line scientists who

228
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,440
could work anywhere

229
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,480
like swati mohan today has become a

230
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,680
poster girl for

231
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,080
nasa and that doesn't mean that society

232
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,600
is free of

233
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,920
biases when it comes to women engineers

234
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,040
or scientists

235
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,240
in respective fields we've seen earlier

236
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,440
occasions kalpana chawla to very many

237
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,240
names where

238
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,640
indian scientists have done exceedingly

239
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,440
well

240
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,839
irrespective of whether they are men or

241
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,560
women

242
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,600
and does i say indians suffer

243
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,839
historical bias by virtue of being

244
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:16,720
indians

245
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,519
and women suffer double bias by virtue

246
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,000
of being

247
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,399
indian and women because the way we

248
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,560
dress the way we eat the way our value

249
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,200
systems

250
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,560
operate we come across as if we are from

251
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,839
a different planet

252
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,519
and not from while we may be handling

253
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,560
mission mars but people think we we

254
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,519
belong to mars

255
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,519
also when it comes to

256
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,120
cyber security i maintain that

257
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,320
in the field of security

258
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,240
in real life or cyber security itself

259
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,040
we have to be both

260
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,800
uh a consumer and the leader

261
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,079
and does uh when we are the consumers

262
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,200
uh and the leaders we need to

263
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,600
handle uh biases um in in

264
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,800
every field when it comes to

265
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,000
the machinations in the sense that what

266
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,279
has government done

267
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,600
how government is working so i think

268
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,880
first way to start

269
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,000
is that women in india are

270
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,480
confident and they are doing well and

271
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,680
that doesn't mean

272
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,560
we have crossed the glass ceiling there

273
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
is no more work to do there is a lot of

274
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,560
work which still needs to be done

275
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,000
and which has to be done but cyber

276
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
crime prevention against society per se

277
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
or and women in particular or children

278
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,360
there is a scheme which is ccp

279
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,240
wc which means cyber crime prevention

280
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,399
against women and children

281
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,040
it's a scheme which gives effective

282
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,399
mechanism to handle

283
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,040
cyber crimes why i'm stating this that

284
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,760
those who are

285
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,399
watching this program familiarize

286
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,079
themselves with the kind of schemes

287
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,760
which government is running

288
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,200
and in case any such offense

289
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,680
happens you know where to report and how

290
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,959
to get across

291
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,519
and how to save and secure women and

292
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,120
children in the country

293
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,160
and there the police and other public

294
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,519
authorities

295
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,279
will come together because usually

296
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,200
the police and public safety and

297
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,360
security are state subjects

298
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,720
and state is primarily responsible

299
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,360
for such prevention detection and

300
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,200
investigation of crimes

301
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,360
and law enforcement agencies need to

302
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
take action in terms of the

303
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,560
information technology act against

304
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,600
uh fraud offenders of

305
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,680
sexual offenses sexual harassment and

306
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,600
workplace sexual harassment

307
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,560
online bullying etc and the first

308
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,760
mechanism to that

309
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,240
is that there has to be a reporting of

310
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,279
that crime

311
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,440
and post reporting the cyber forensic

312
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,480
lab will get into the detail and

313
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,720
that doesn't and this kind of capacity

314
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,160
building is a constant

315
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,880
effort in this field because uh

316
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,560
criminals get smarter

317
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,399
whoever has a better computer and

318
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,680
technology

319
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,800
tends to become still smarter does the

320
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,279
there has to be a constant investment

321
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,399
both in terms of

322
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,519
time and technology for

323
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,440
upgradation to prevent the online crimes

324
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,120
the online platforms which is which is

325
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,440
like a central portal because

326
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,680
the capacity building of various states

327
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,360
is

328
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,839
lacking and weaving a quasi

329
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,480
federal structure the center is playing

330
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,120
its role

331
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,440
and i urge upon various state

332
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,560
governments to keep

333
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,120
improvising their system uh in terms of

334
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,079
cctns which is

335
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
crime and criminal tracking network

336
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,680
systems

337
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,959
to to undertake the project of women's

338
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,560
safety and security

339
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,839
and under this portal cyber crime victim

340
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,279
can file a complaint

341
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,920
and the portal will then provide a

342
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,360
central repository to

343
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,480
identify the cyber crime which is

344
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,240
as of now a very very important aspect

345
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,680
and the complaint then will be used

346
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,720
and published in the in their

347
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,240
annual analytic report their trends

348
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,519
etc will be will be

349
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,079
analyzed and remedial measures also will

350
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:46,880
be

351
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,480
taken up the portal includes repository

352
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
references enforcement regulatory

353
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,760
agencies

354
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,480
at national level state and local level

355
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:56,959
so this

356
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,839
is to basically help various state

357
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,639
governments

358
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,600
and uh come together with a with a

359
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,800
single format which is applicable to

360
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,800
the country in terms of cyber related

361
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,560
crime information and ccpw's uh

362
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,000
forensic lab basically uh properly

363
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,199
collects preserves

364
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,000
evidence etc because whenever we are

365
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,760
dealing with crimes we must

366
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,800
understand that

367
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,199
these offenses nfir will be registered

368
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,079
and post the fire we need to carry out

369
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,560
investigation post the investigation

370
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,199
the evidence has to be led in the court

371
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,160
and only then can a criminal be punished

372
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,279
the very nature of cyber crime is such

373
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,000
that it it has a global network and in

374
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
interconnectivity of the internet itself

375
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,279
sometimes makes it difficult to bring

376
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,720
the criminal to

377
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,839
the books because the while the crime

378
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,600
may have happened in one country the

379
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,240
criminal could actually be stationed in

380
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,279
another country and that's where i feel

381
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,000
agencies like u.n and known can come

382
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,959
together

383
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,759
and make certain offenses as

384
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,600
extraditable offenses

385
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,320
so there is when there is a need to set

386
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,040
up protocols i think we are missing a

387
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,720
point that the

388
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,839
crime which is happening online and not

389
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,600
necessarily just

390
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,000
sexual crime it could be monetary client

391
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,680
crime it could be

392
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,199
sexual crime it could be fraudulent uh

393
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,639
crime any such crime needs to be made

394
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,440
extraditable offense and only then we

395
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:43,759
will

396
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,480
serve the real meaning of justice

397
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:46,959
because

398
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,480
many a times these people go

399
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,079
unchallenged and not being brought to

400
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,279
books

401
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,800
in the countries where they have

402
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,320
committed

403
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,480
such cyber crimes and in terms of cyber

404
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,319
security professionals

405
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,919
i definitely feel that

406
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,079
law enforcement agencies need to assist

407
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,199
women and electronic forensic studies

408
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,359
need to be introduced as a subject

409
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,880
across the country

410
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,400
the labs capacity needs to be constantly

411
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,280
upgraded

412
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,240
and increased we also have

413
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,120
an institution called nepa which is

414
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,520
north

415
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,640
eastern police academy which has

416
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,559
which usually conducts a five-day

417
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,960
program on cyber crime investigation and

418
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,160
recently 23 police officers

419
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,280
from meghalaya police force

420
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,880
had engaged with nepa

421
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,400
to get trained at detecting

422
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,520
investigating and

423
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,480
bringing the culprits to the books in

424
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,120
cyber

425
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,480
crime related offenses and

426
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,000
around 13.2 million dollars

427
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,720
which has been issued to the country

428
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,600
states

429
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,840
and union territories for capacity

430
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,039
building by the

431
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,240
central agency for training and

432
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,200
upgradation

433
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,480
of already existing cyber

434
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,400
labs these schemes facilitate

435
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,440
to create awareness activities r d

436
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,080
and center of excellence for r d cyber

437
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,880
crime

438
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,000
so i feel that awareness creation

439
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,400
is as important as do's and don'ts

440
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,760
do a proactive mitigation initiative

441
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,039
why i'm stating all this is by virtue

442
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,240
of this particular conference i'm also

443
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,160
trying to reach out to people who are

444
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,720
not aware of the existing systems

445
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,400
and once they are aware awareness itself

446
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,440
is the first step towards prevention

447
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,799
and thus we can carry out a greater

448
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,000
educational methodology

449
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,760
in terms of challenging the criminals

450
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,720
and also upgrading and facilitating

451
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,360
women

452
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,080
and children especially female child

453
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,600
online

454
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,640
by training them about do's and don'ts

455
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,919
online about protecting their uh

456
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,880
safety and security from online bullying

457
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,919
to stalking

458
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,200
to everything else that goes

459
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,919
online and who's unchallenged and even

460
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:38,640
even

461
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,840
so many blackmails which we see happen

462
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,039
because of um

463
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,280
identity theft to

464
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,320
morphing the pictures of young girl

465
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,280
child

466
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,120
and making them viral recently there was

467
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,440
a

468
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,240
there was one such case which was

469
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,840
decided by delhi high court

470
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,520
there is even on twitter and other

471
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,799
platforms where

472
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,960
there are handles like cyber ghost

473
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,200
radio campaigns broadcast across the

474
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,000
country

475
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,280
government is hoping to create awareness

476
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,200
against cyber crimes but i think uh

477
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,640
universities like um

478
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,640
universities and women folks women who

479
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,440
are

480
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,480
more experienced in life could be the

481
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:34,880
key

482
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,159
agents of change in creating awareness

483
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,520
amongst the younger women who joined the

484
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,840
workforce or who are likely to join the

485
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,200
workforce or

486
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,240
who are using internet

487
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,039
to keeping themselves upgraded on

488
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,159
various

489
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,080
subjects i think when it comes to

490
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,520
women and children they need to be

491
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,039
trained at

492
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,200
by the institutions and a better

493
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,720
planning

494
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,840
needs to happen and thus special

495
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,640
provisions

496
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,360
in law need to be brought in to protect

497
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,840
the

498
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,440
miners and especially women

499
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,720
recently we saw that how social networks

500
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,000
were selling data and there have been

501
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,440
data breaches by many agencies

502
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,039
now whatever we do online one thing we

503
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:31,520
must

504
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,320
know and learn that digital footprints

505
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,360
cannot be

506
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,400
altered and digital footprints cannot

507
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,520
truly be removed

508
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,840
they are always traceable and they

509
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,159
remain in the cyber network

510
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,440
so women must understand that no matter

511
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,280
how

512
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,760
people compel you to engage in certain

513
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,559
acts

514
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,919
please don't engage with

515
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,960
those actions because there is no way of

516
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,799
erasing your footprint

517
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,600
and some people may actually use all

518
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,320
those things

519
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,960
against you and that kind of awareness

520
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
must exist

521
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,080
in terms of software

522
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,159
and hardware many many

523
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,440
service companies have

524
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,480
a lot to do when it comes to

525
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,840
strengthening the women

526
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,200
workforce in information technology and

527
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,720
uh service industry which today stands

528
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,240
at 34

529
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,600
i would say this is not bad but

530
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,200
there is a lot of gap and it

531
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,720
so i look at it that it should be 50

532
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,159
in coming years so from 34 to 50

533
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,590
the workforce there is

534
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,919
[Music]

535
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,200
there is some target and women have to

536
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,840
also upgrade themselves and agencies

537
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,200
which are engaging

538
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,400
with society also need to change their

539
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,120
attitude

540
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,640
and inherent bias in the systems because

541
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,080
this systemic

542
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,200
discrimination is what is leading to a

543
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,760
tilted

544
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,240
existence of women in the in the

545
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,600
workforce

546
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,200
and uh microsoft data security council

547
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,240
of india

548
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,799
launched a program called cyber shiksha

549
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,960
it's a three-year program to create a

550
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,080
pool of skilled

551
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,559
cyber security women professionals in

552
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,960
the country i would suggest that

553
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,240
university looks into it and offers

554
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,159
some program on on this line

555
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,760
and when it comes to governments

556
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,159
taking steps to encourage women in stem

557
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,039
field

558
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,000
i must complement the government because

559
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
there is something for

560
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,640
big and prasar which is began jyoti and

561
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,760
engaged with science there is

562
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,200
knowledge involvement research

563
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,600
advancement through nurturing which is

564
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,840
called

565
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,080
kiran a feminine name again

566
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,440
curie we we all remember madame curie

567
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,480
which is consolidation of university

568
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,919
research

569
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,400
through innovation and excellence in

570
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,679
women universities

571
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,120
that is curie and dst

572
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,279
biotechnology career advancement and

573
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,440
reorientation program which is called

574
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,039
biocare

575
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,440
i was listening to a very very short

576
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,039
film on

577
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,840
amma which said that women possess

578
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,000
special qualities and i think

579
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,760
caring and nurturing because when you

580
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,240
talk of

581
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,679
mata and other forms of mata

582
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,640
you are definitely catering to the

583
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,640
nurturing quality of women

584
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,159
and that nurturing quality comes from

585
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,080
care and bio care is something which is

586
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,480
so important especially in the in the

587
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,080
field of pandemic

588
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,320
and recent past has shown that how

589
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,279
important

590
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,320
it is for uh women

591
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,440
who have been on the front line when it

592
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,880
comes to the

593
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,720
care industry and

594
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,679
government also offers uh national award

595
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,520
for women scientists

596
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,559
uh of ministry of earth sciences

597
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,240
women excellence award called scrb

598
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,520
which is uh an award to

599
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,799
encourage scientists women scientists

600
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,520
and

601
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,679
all these uh what should i say

602
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,799
encouraging steps are basically

603
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,120
meant to encourage more and more women

604
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,480
to join

605
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,159
science and technology as

606
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,919
meritorious girl students in the age of

607
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,080
9 to 12 are also able to pursue stem

608
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,760
from young ages to

609
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,600
higher secondary and further studies

610
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,039
so i see an unprecedented growth of

611
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:07,520
women

612
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,480
scientists in our country unprecedented

613
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,279
strength

614
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,640
which this country inherently offers to

615
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,279
women

616
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,559
where the world is not tolerance

617
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,120
the world is respect when it comes to

618
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,679
women

619
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,400
and people belonging to other

620
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,200
communities

621
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,440
we do not believe in tolerance we

622
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,600
believe in respecting each other

623
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,960
and does women will

624
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,080
strengthen the society as in when they

625
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,520
join uh fields of technology

626
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,480
i purposely i have used

627
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,919
this platform to spread awareness

628
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:48,960
because

629
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,840
i feel whether recent

630
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,679
changes which american society has taken

631
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,960
in terms of

632
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,080
cyber security merit badge or

633
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,799
other countries are taking towards

634
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,000
empowering their girl

635
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,120
child we have been doing it for some

636
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,600
time

637
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,960
and that effort needs to continue and

638
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,440
that effort will continue only when we

639
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,240
recognize

640
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,279
our strengths many times the

641
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,080
inherent bias which exists in the

642
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,440
society

643
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,039
amongst amongst the world

644
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,159
of the global population

645
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,640
continues to impact our own existence

646
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,159
within our own countries

647
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,120
also so the first step could be before

648
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,240
empowerment

649
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,559
we should know what our strengths are

650
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,720
and our strengths are huge

651
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,200
when it when we compare ourselves with

652
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,480
any other

653
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,520
country and therefore i feel whether

654
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,360
it's the field of

655
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,679
cyber security which has already shown

656
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,480
that

657
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,000
uh 52 percent of the women hold advanced

658
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,080
degrees in cyber security

659
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,840
compared to 44 of men

660
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,960
and uh still we say female

661
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,399
are best represented i think uh

662
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,520
we need a change of attitude also at

663
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,559
times

664
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,000
the biological cycles of

665
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,080
women's life when it is marriage

666
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,960
young children at home senior citizens

667
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,399
which need to be

668
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,440
looked after parents

669
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,720
laws those are also

670
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,480
sometimes the factors which

671
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,520
at times allow women to plan their

672
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,120
careers differently

673
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,399
and i feel um let's not

674
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,200
judge ourselves harshly because the

675
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,640
priorities at emotional levels

676
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,279
for women could be very different the

677
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,360
better methodology could be

678
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,520
that allow women their space and

679
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,679
whatever they are comfortable with

680
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,159
and at whatever stage they want to come

681
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:04,799
back

682
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,960
to the normal workforce that should be

683
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,919
allowed

684
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,240
flexi timing could be one way of

685
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,200
operating

686
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,279
because that's what gives women more

687
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,720
satisfaction

688
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,799
when they have to deal with various

689
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,840
or multiplicity of rules as people

690
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,039
as persons and i definitely

691
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,039
feel that whether it's ministry of

692
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,679
electronics information and technology

693
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,799

council of india microsoft

innovation labs um

697
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,240
and uh intel everyone is trying to do

698
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,360
their bit

699
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,720
to get more and more women as part of

700
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,440
the i.t

701
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,480
workforce simply because

702
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,559
they they have a unique opportunity to

703
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,600
work with women

704
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,520
and teams which are which have women

705
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,320
are better performers and there are data

706
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,919
to suggest that

707
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,960
the the only way to have a greater

708
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,159
workforce

709
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,000
will be to start various centers across

710
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,320
smaller cities across india because

711
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,720
traveling across distant

712
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,640
places could also be one impediment

713
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,760
for women who need to live

714
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,120
close to their homes for various social

715
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,159
reasons

716
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,559
so if you have a i.t industry

717
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,240
operating out of gurgaon a

718
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,840
woman scientist or an engineer

719
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,279
living in kerala who has elderly parents

720
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,320
or parent-in-laws will find it difficult

721
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:58,640
to

722
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,360
join and she will pick up a different

723
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,840
stream to

724
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,240
uh work from home

725
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,720
rather than continue in this challenging

726
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,000
field of i.t

727
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,279
so decentralizing

728
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,120
these spaces making flaxseed time

729
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,760
available to women so that the very

730
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,039
nature

731
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,120
we are not battling against the nature

732
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,960
of care and nurture

733
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,880
which is also inherent with women and

734
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,120
a better way to reach out women will be

735
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,880
training them

736
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,000
making them aware using their skills

737
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,320
and once they join the workforce giving

738
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,200
them

739
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,080
a fair atmosphere in which they can

740
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,600
express themselves

741
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,799
and thus

742
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,000
the module

743
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,120
for getting more women to work uh could

744
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,720
be slightly different

745
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,919
from the manner in which the it

746
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,320
industries used to

747
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,840
and thus women leaders will

748
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,840
come from the space of

749
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,279
technology only when this

750
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,360
human resource is uh nurtured and cared

751
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,240
for

752
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,760
and which will afford the

753
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,600
india to progress and get ahead in

754
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,960
in in the world and globally

755
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,760
we will have mainstreaming of events

756
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,720
because

757
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,640
different timings work for different

758
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,080
people and

759
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,200
uh let's have more women as keynote

760
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,320
speakers

761
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,480
in in conferences

762
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,399
on i.t emerging technology

763
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,600
ai so that we can showcase to the world

764
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,240
that this is what women are capable of

765
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,000
and indian women especially

766
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,720
i believe are capable of far more than

767
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,640
the world has ever witnessed with these

768
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,480
words thank you all

769
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,440
uh and all the very very best for a

770
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,960
secure future

771
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,840
uh let's all work together to get more

772
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
and more women

773
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,480
in the cyber security field and create

774
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,919
awareness amongst women and royal child

775
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,480
even when they are not in the cyber

776
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,600
security field

777
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,799
but they could be there as consumers

778
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,200
and we bring more and more people

779
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,000
together

780
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,240
and take a lot of pride in our own

781
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,200
existence

782
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,840
as women as indian women thank you very

783
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,399
much

784
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,799
jain

785
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,200
thank you very much srimati meenakshi

786
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,440
laki for your wise words

787
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
very interesting statistics which is

788
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,760
very motivating for many stem aspirants

789
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,480
here

790
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,559
it is definitely important as you have

791
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,399
mentioned that children should also be

792
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,519
introducing to

793
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,480
introduce to cutting-edge technologies

794
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,159
government initiatives on digital

795
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,080
literacy covering latest trends in

796
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,279
computer science

797
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,440
will certainly include more women down

798
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,399
the lane

799
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,799
thanks making your suggestion yes we

800
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,039
have several strong programs in cyber

801
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:07,919
security

802
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,800
as undergraduate in graduate level that

803
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,040
integrates hands-on skills ethics and

804
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,320
professionalism

805
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,079
hopefully the gender bias that is

806
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,918
present in the current day scenario will

807
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,199
change down the line

808
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,199
and more and many more women will become

809
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,760
more successful in this industry

810
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,599
thank you for bringing forth important

811
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,960
points with respect to

812
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,599
cyber crime it is indeed unfortunate

813
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,560
that some women

814
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,960
fall prey to cyber crime and hopefully

815
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,560
conferences like this raise more

816
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,320
awareness than women

817
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,760
the sky is our limit
