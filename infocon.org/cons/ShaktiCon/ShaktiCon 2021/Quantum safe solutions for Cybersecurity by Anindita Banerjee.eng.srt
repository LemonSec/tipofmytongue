today as a part of our conference talk

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,679
we would like to uh

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,480
we will be having this anindita banerjee

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,479
over hello everyone

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,920
um thank you for the kind introduction

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,040
so um i welcome you all um

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,840
particularly the bright beautiful and

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,240
bold

52
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,360
women leaders future leaders and

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,960
aspirants to this presentation

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,600
so today's cryptography is actually a

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,759
multi-disciplinary field

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,759
providing a lot of scope opportunities

57
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,959
and there is a requirement too i'm

58
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,720
working as a quantum research head in

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,080
cuny labs

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,520
cuny labs is india's first quantum

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,480
technology

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,000
based deep tech startup focusing on

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,360
quantum hardware like uh quantum key

64
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,720
distribution system

65
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,920
quantum random number generator and also

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,400
develop

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,040
solutions quantum safe solutions around

68
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,840
it

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,319
addressing the problems of present day

70
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,200
start of our

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,160
cryptography so we leverage on quantum

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,200
information to address these challenges

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,640
recently we have partnered with amrita

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,599
university's

75
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
center for cyber security systems and

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,360
networks

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,080
and we are very happy with that and you

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,319
know we believe that our collaboration

79
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,879
will enable innovation and it will

80
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,680
strengthen

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
and enhance research capabilities at

82
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,800
both our ends

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,640
i would like to thank the organizers for

84
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,720
this wonderful conference and also for

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,480
inviting me

86
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,840
so um i will start my presentation

87
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,760
um i will start my presentation by

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,720
acknowledging the 75 percent

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,599
women workforce in bletchley park during

90
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,239
world war

91
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,560
ii so uh prior to 1970s

92
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,920
uh the crypt analysis as you can see was

93
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,840
was more of a manual process

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,640
and much of it was performed by women

95
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,680
my next slide i wanted to touch upon

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,319
actually ancient cryptography and also

97
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,519
draw an association

98
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,640
of cryptography with women so this is

99
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,519
given by

100
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,720
lechika vikalpa which is a ancient art

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,480
of secret writing

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,920
written in a text in 4th century a.d

103
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,560
based

104
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,480
on a manuscript dating 4th century bc

105
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,680
the secret communication in indian great

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,400
indian

107
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,599
epic mahabharata and also in

108
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,799
other ancient kingdoms can be linked to

109
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,360
this text

110
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,880
so now we're talking about

111
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
present cryptography so in present

112
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,919
cryptography you have

113
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,240
the famous cryptographic couple alice

114
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,560
and bob where alice will try to send

115
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,680
a message to bob secretly so what will

116
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,560
alice need

117
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,440
is a plain text which is a message and

118
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,919
encryption algorithm

119
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,800
and an encryption key so when you feed

120
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,520
the key

121
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,320
and the text into the algorithm it gives

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,840
you a cryptogram

123
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,199
and it travels to bob

124
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,919
now there can be a hacker in between who

125
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,160
has to break through the encrypted

126
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,440
data another aspect

127
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,360
is the key distribution uh particularly

128
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,960
sending the encryption key and the

129
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,400
description key

130
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,720
so if there is a man in the middle who

131
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,440
is

132
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,520
who is you know in between that link it

133
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,280
can be a physical link or it can be a

134
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
trusted courier

135
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,880
if he gets hold of that key then the

136
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,199
entire cryptography fails

137
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,520
so this is the famous key distribution

138
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,560
problem

139
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,639
earlier it used to be when i'm saying

140
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,680
earlier

141
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
i mean ancient or medieval they were all

142
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
symmetric cryptography

143
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,880
where the encryption decryption keys

144
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,479
were where same

145
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,759
but the problem lies when um when

146
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,000
you have so we we talk about this when

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,919
we go when we discuss the modern

148
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,000
cryptography in modern cryptography

149
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,039
it is based on mathematical complexity

150
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,800
so in 1976 defi helman published

151
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,120
new directions in cryptography he

152
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,560
developed the idea of

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,080
dual key which gave the key distribution

154
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,440
problem a pragmatic approach each user

155
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,639
had two mutually

156
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,680
inverse keys encryption key is published

157
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,639
and the decryption

158
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,680
decryption key is kept secret and the

159
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,479
most widely used public key cryptography

160
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,280
is the rsa which is based on the

161
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,240
difficulty of

162
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,960
factoring a product of two large prime

163
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
numbers

164
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,680
now so i can say that the present day

165
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,479
cryptography is as old as computers

166
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,080
which should be something around 70 to

167
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,520
75 years

168
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,639
and when this cryptography was designed

169
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,039
the adversarial model was based on

170
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,800
computational security

171
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,000
and on a classical computer so whatever

172
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,680
mathematical algorithm

173
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,720
uh if it is uh if it is not solvable in

174
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,759
real time

175
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,000
or it doesn't the shelf life is not an

176
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,160
issue then it is considered secure

177
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,080
so that was a model we were working with

178
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,599
so we never thought about

179
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,199
quantum adversary and um also about the

180
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,759
information theoretic security which is

181
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,039
when the adversary

182
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,599
has a huge resource of time and space

183
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,400
and with computational gives is

184
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,479
computational power is actually an

185
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,440
exponential advantage to the present-day

186
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,039
classical computation

187
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,039
so that type of security was not

188
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,240
considered

189
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,479
so today when we are on the verge of a

190
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,680
new um

191
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,720
technology which is quantum computing so

192
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,280
we have to revise uh our cryptographic

193
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,080
primitives

194
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,759
and the cryptographic techniques and the

195
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,120
adversarial models

196
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
whether we have to make it secure from

197
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,319
the quantum

198
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,759
also or not and how do we do it

199
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,560
so the challenges uh the first challenge

200
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,520
is of course the

201
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,120
computational power the increasing

202
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
classical computational part

203
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,080
so the rsa250 having 829 bits

204
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,599
was factored in february 2020 indicating

205
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,400
that

206
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,280
any encrypted data with anything less

207
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,639
less than

208
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,000
one zero to four bits rsa

209
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,919
can be crashed now if we talk about

210
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,400
human engineering or we talk about

211
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
mathematical advances

212
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,759
then um then it has been a news that

213
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,039
a famous german mathematician had

214
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,879
cracked the rsa using less intractable

215
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,240
shortest vector problem now the issue is

216
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,000
not that whether or not the algorithm

217
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,720
is true and how the how much truth lies

218
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,800
in it or what is the capability

219
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,799
how much of a threat it is the issue is

220
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,440
that this situation is getting frequent

221
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,360
the issue is whether the cryptographic

222
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,599
entire cryptographic structure getting

223
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,399
challenged

224
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,399
again and again and the fear which it

225
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,760
brings along

226
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,040
so um these are practical issues and

227
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,360
as i mentioned earlier also that this is

228
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,880
becoming so frequent

229
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,440
so we should not take anything any step

230
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,519
in

231
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,760
you know we have to think we have to it

232
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,360
has to be well researched

233
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,440
so these are the challenges then of

234
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
course the quantum computing

235
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,680
peter show showed that quantum computers

236
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,200
could factor

237
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,399
a large product of primes in polynomial

238
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,080
time now this was never thought about

239
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,440
you know

240
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
in contrast to the best classical

241
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,839
algorithm in a classical computer which

242
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,880
takes a

243
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,600
sub exponential time so this was an

244
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,360
exponential speed up

245
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,560
and uh if such a crypto cracking quantum

246
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,200
machine

247
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,839
was to be developed then the entire

248
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,920
cryptographic structure

249
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,480
so this was a fear this was a challenge

250
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,519
and uh

251
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,440
and very interesting that's why a lot of

252
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,959
developments are taking place in this

253
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,720
direction

254
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,040
and you can see that there is a paper on

255
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,200
how to factor 2048-bit rsa integers

256
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
on a classical computer having 20

257
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
million noisy qubits it will take only

258
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,000
eight hours

259
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,560
so the entire algorithm had been broken

260
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,320
down into quantum circuits

261
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,800
and how much time these gates will take

262
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,959
all had to have been computed and

263
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,480
thereafter only this time has been

264
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,240
estimated so uh

265
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,120
it is becoming realistic right then we

266
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,279
look at fibre tapping

267
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,000
now ethernet and optical fiber tapping

268
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,399
is

269
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,640
nothing new and has been in public

270
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,440
knowledge

271
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,920
for a long time now the optical fibers

272
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,600
i don't know why but it is considered

273
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,959
that they are very secure

274
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,440
by certain organizations maybe because

275
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,959
of accessibility

276
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,000
but we study that you know um the

277
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,560
physics behind implementation of a fiber

278
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,640
tapping isn't very difficult

279
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,040
and when we are doing our quantum key

280
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,720
distribution which is based on

281
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,440
carrying information in light we are

282
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
actually trying to do this kind of an

283
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,680
attack on uh on the quantum channel or

284
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,959
the optical channel

285
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,320
and to see that how much of a

286
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,399
disturbance it creates or how much

287
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,480
information of course in quantum uh

288
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,720
regime it is not possible to do such an

289
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,680
attack

290
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,000
but we see the impact using different

291
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,959
parameters

292
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,720
and in classical it has been well

293
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,399
studied and

294
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,240
though there are precautions but still

295
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,680
no one has to be very careful

296
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,640
about it so then we are talking about

297
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,040
where is the threat it is actually from

298
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,360
the quantum computing capabilities

299
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,399
um where you can crack the defi hillman

300
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,959
um the discrete based discrete

301
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,720
algorithms and integer factoring can be

302
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,839
done

303
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,120
this includes algorithms like rsa

304
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,880
dsa dh elliptic curve cryptography

305
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,279
and the security protocols that derive

306
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,160
security

307
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,320
based on these algorithms is also a

308
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,200
challenge

309
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,519
is a big concern or any product or

310
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,519
security system that rely on these

311
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,120
algorithms

312
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,640
is also a challenge and why should we be

313
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,360
concerned

314
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,160
because they are almost everywhere

315
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,000
starting from secure software

316
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
distribution

317
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,320
uh to secure email vpn secure web

318
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,040
browsing

319
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,320
digital signatures um key agreement

320
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,360
protocols

321
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,560
so uh they are actually everywhere and

322
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:08,959
so

323
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,000
when it is not a quick transition

324
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,040
to quantum safe and it is a concern here

325
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,600
so now let's look at ideal security so

326
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,839
what does an ideal security look like

327
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,959
so according to a mathematical principle

328
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,600
uh you know the adversary can have the

329
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,440
entire cryptosystem

330
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,120
they can know about the encryption

331
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,959
algorithm um

332
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,279
they can have the cryptogram but what

333
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,880
they should not have

334
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,560
is the key encryption key so that

335
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,680
is the the challenge that the key should

336
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,160
not fall into the hands of adversary

337
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,560
rest everything can be known to them so

338
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,680
the security is

339
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,399
as good as the secret key now what

340
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,160
should be the properties of the key

341
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,600
key is a binary string of random numbers

342
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,079
the key should be random then of course

343
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,279
the question comes

344
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,120
how much random what is random but let

345
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,480
me not address these issues

346
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,320
let us understand that the keys should

347
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,839
not be reproducible

348
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,519
uh unpredictable and they should be

349
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,040
random in nature

350
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,120
the key should not be cloned it means

351
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,959
that today if i am able to

352
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,399
uh send a key in in

353
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,480
encoding it in optics then there is no

354
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,079
way i can find out whether it has been

355
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,120
cloned or not

356
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,360
or somebody has looked into or not or

357
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,880
monitored it or not

358
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,800
but in quantum mechanics since i'm

359
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,639
encoding the information on quantum

360
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,600
properties

361
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,839
uh it is protected by a law of physics

362
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,279
known as no clone

363
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,839
cloning theorem then the key tampering

364
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,880
should be detected

365
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,720
in quantum mechanics what happens is if

366
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,160
you are monitoring the state you are

367
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,040
disturbing the state and it collapses

368
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
according to the measurement so any

369
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,040
detection

370
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,279
you know tampering done on the quantum

371
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,120
state which is the key

372
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,000
is detectable it gets monitored so the

373
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,040
quantum mechanics is

374
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,160
ideal solution for doing a

375
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,600
key transfer so the advance so

376
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,360
the advantages which the quantum

377
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,279
information science brings is

378
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,720
um the the information so we say it's

379
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,480
quantum information science and it

380
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,000
it is bounded by the laws of quantum

381
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,880
mechanics um so we give the

382
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,720
adversary the power of physics so

383
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,040
anything which is possible uh

384
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,120
according to the laws of physics an

385
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,959
adversary can use it

386
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,680
as a tool to hack the system and when we

387
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,199
put security analysis

388
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,199
of such a cryptography we have to take

389
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,800
care of all the

390
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,639
information leakages which can happen

391
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,480
because of different quantum attack

392
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,120
models

393
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,839
and take that into the security

394
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:40,959
framework

395
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,160
so and the information is encoded on

396
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,480
a single particle of light which is so

397
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,040
these are photons these are microscopic

398
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,279
the rules of physics for microscopic is

399
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,240
quite different

400
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,680
so when we say microscopic it is

401
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,079
subatomic level kind of a size

402
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,959
and the photon is known as flying qubit

403
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,800
and photons are used for quantum

404
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,760
communication

405
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
whether it be quantum internet uh it is

406
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,040
used for quantum random number

407
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,639
generators also

408
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,839
uh or any kind of communication from

409
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,720
point a to point b photons behave

410
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,320
differently and follow different rules

411
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,720
in the quantum world

412
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,880
then no cloning theorem is a fundamental

413
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,560
theorem in quantum mechanics you cannot

414
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,920
copy the state

415
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,839
heisenberg's uncertainty tells you that

416
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,600
if you try to monitor the state it will

417
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,279
cause disturbance and it can be

418
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,560
monitored

419
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,199
superposition principles is the inherent

420
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,800
property of quantum mechanics

421
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,839
and it allows a state to be to be

422
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,839
there in two particular possibilities or

423
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,560
many particular possibilities

424
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,519
then you have belt inequality test then

425
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,040
and there are other resources also

426
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,399
counter factual

427
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,399
and then there are other principles

428
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,160
and based on different principles

429
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,560
different qrd protocols can be devised

430
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,040
now quantum key distribution enables

431
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,320
secure

432
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,800
symmetric keys this is very important

433
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,079
the keys generated by

434
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,839
quantum key distribution are symmetric

435
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,839
in nature and hence these are well

436
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,560
applicable

437
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,519
for algorithms encryption algorithms

438
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,880
like one-time pad

439
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,440
so just imagine a combination of of the

440
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,800
information theoretic

441
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,199
encryption algorithm like one-time pad

442
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,240
combined with

443
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
an information theoretic key

444
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,759
distribution scheme like a quantum key

445
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,800
distribution

446
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,839
can give you a very secure a very robust

447
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,880
cryptographic structure and qkd is

448
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,800
resilient to any adversary with

449
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,600
unlimited resources of space and time

450
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,759
basically it is resilient to any

451
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,040
algorithm you are not

452
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,240
algorithm dependent um so that and it

453
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,839
gives you a long term security

454
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,000
if i look at uncertainty principle um so

455
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,920
this is a thought experiment so alice

456
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,839
and bob alice is sending some electrons

457
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,120
and it is passing through

458
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,160
a metal wall with two small holes and

459
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,000
and these two particles will interfere

460
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,440
with each other

461
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,720
p1 and p2 so this is a classical

462
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,160
probability curve so when

463
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,640
s2 is closed i'm getting a bell curve

464
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,760
like p1 when

465
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,319
s1 is closed then i'm getting a bell

466
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,760
curve like p2

467
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
the addition of these two should be a

468
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,359
classical probability curve

469
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,880
but what i am observing is an

470
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,559
interference pattern which is a quantum

471
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,439
signature

472
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,480
so let it let me put it very simply if

473
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,039
nobody is observing the state

474
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,679
i can see a quantum signature or both

475
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,240
can see

476
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,200
a quantum signature but if somebody is

477
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,520
observing the state

478
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,080
it's trying to find out from which uh

479
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,640
hole

480
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,280
the the electron had gone then it is

481
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,200
destroying the interference pattern

482
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,080
and i am seeing a classical probability

483
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,440
curve a bell curve

484
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,400
so then bob knows that somebody had

485
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,160
perturbed the state or somebody is

486
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
looking into the state

487
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,360
so you see the the laws are very simple

488
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,640
the law says if nobody is eavesdropping

489
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,240
there is no perturbation or no

490
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,679
measurement then

491
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,600
uh it is secure if somebody is trying to

492
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,440
hack it tap it or put a probe

493
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,080
to it do some kind of a weak measurement

494
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,640
it

495
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,840
cannot escape you know it it will

496
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,679
disturb the state and that can be

497
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,240
monitored so now how much disturbance

498
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,760
how much it can be monitored

499
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,440
what are the parameters we have to look

500
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
into so that we can understand this kind

501
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,640
of a disturbance

502
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,679
is um looked upon in uh

503
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,120
and well studied in quantum key

504
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,520
distribution

505
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,600
so i will not go into the maps but let

506
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,960
me just simply tell you

507
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,919
the linearity of quantum mechanics

508
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,160
actually that is the main reason

509
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,000
because of which you will not be able to

510
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,200
clone a state

511
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,960
or you will be able to copy a state it

512
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,559
will never give you

513
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,200
um for example if it is a state like ket

514
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,919
zero

515
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,600
in quantum mechanics we write the state

516
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,520
in for indirect notation

517
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,320
which is used in linear algebra so this

518
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,080
is a ket 0 and get 0

519
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,720
let this be an empty paper and this is a

520
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,919
state you want to copy into the paper

521
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,320
quantum mechanics will not allow it to

522
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,440
be reproduced

523
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,360
if the state is an arbitrary quantum

524
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,840
state an already quantum state

525
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,919
is a state which will have a certain

526
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,120
probability to

527
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,320
exist in all its possible states

528
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,200
for example here you have a get zero

529
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,760
plus b

530
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,000
get one so it has alpha's a square

531
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,200
probability to be in

532
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,120
zero state b square probability to be in

533
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,360
one state so it'll it exists in

534
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,039
superposition so basically when you are

535
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,080
looking at a state

536
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,240
you are collapsing the the state into

537
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,760
one of its possible states

538
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,840
and it is not possible to reproduce the

539
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,480
arbitrary quantum state

540
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,960
so now what kind of a solution does

541
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,600
quantum

542
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,840
safe solution or quantum cryptography

543
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,919
mean so there are two solutions one is a

544
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,039
hardware approach

545
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,480
and the other is a software approach

546
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,600
um can anybody confirm that uh i'm

547
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,400
audible or

548
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
um because the silence is somewhere i

549
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,919
feel i start getting lost

550
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,840
so there are two solutions one is the uh

551
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,880
hardware approach

552
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,400
which is um which comprises of two

553
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,600
boxes one is a sender box other is a

554
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,720
receiver box

555
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,120
both will have optical units electronic

556
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,240
units processing

557
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,400
units a lot of cryptographic primitives

558
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,840
like hashing

559
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,600
um the error correction codes will be

560
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,840
there so this is a hardware structure

561
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,000
so this provides you long-term security

562
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,760
and you are no longer dependent on

563
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,320
algorithms and even if your adversary

564
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,080
has a quantum computer

565
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,559
still the coding which you have done

566
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,280
with

567
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,679
with key distribution facilitated by

568
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,880
quantum mechanics

569
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
can be considered information theoretic

570
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,919
secure

571
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,600
provided the implementation is secure

572
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,840
the implementation is scientifically

573
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,640
correct

574
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,760
okay so now the second is software

575
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,480
approach

576
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,159
in software approach there are certain

577
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,919
algorithms which

578
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,280
which cannot be tracked by a quantum

579
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,240
computer so

580
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,039
we say then quantum resistant classical

581
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,000
algorithms

582
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,919
these are called post quantum

583
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,039
cryptography

584
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,200
so there is a software approach but it

585
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,720
is not very easy to

586
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,480
uh to replace all the existing

587
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,120
software algorithms with the pqc

588
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,919
algorithms

589
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,240
it will have many factors like you have

590
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,919
to look into the security

591
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,679
from classical point of view from

592
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,440
quantum point of view or quantum random

593
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,120
oracles you will have to study

594
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,559
then you'll have to study the

595
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,159
implementation cost

596
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,720
um and how are you going to implement

597
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,480
this basically in

598
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,720
network and how the network is going to

599
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,960
uh what is the design of the network

600
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,440
so a lot many things uh are there it is

601
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,159
not a simple

602
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,240
implementation and will take some some

603
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,679
seven to eight years i think

604
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,640
for to transit from present cryptography

605
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,120
to

606
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,320
resistant cryptography

607
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,080
uh so at cuny labs we

608
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,480
have worked we started our company you

609
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,000
know we started with quantum key

610
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,440
distribution experiment

611
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,240
so this has been a journey from from

612
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,120
theory to

613
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,480
an experimental uh bench and then

614
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,679
converging that to a product and each of

615
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,159
them

616
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,799
had come with its own challenges uh when

617
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,640
you're working in a in an industry

618
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,799
so so the approach is different

619
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,840
uh so you have to come up with a with

620
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,080
protocols which gives you which will

621
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,919
give a commercial advantage so it should

622
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,440
have a higher throughput

623
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,760
it should be able to cover long

624
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,039
distances

625
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,720
so you will have to study which kind of

626
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,000
protocol will be suiting the requirement

627
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
for that you have to understand what is

628
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,760
the right source you will be taking

629
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,000
whether it is the weak current source

630
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,200
today commercially

631
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,280
weak coherent sources are used for

632
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
quantum p distribution

633
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,520
uh or it is a single photon source or it

634
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,720
is an entangled source

635
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,400
the security principles i mentioned

636
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,919
earlier are also different

637
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,320
uh based upon the type of protocol

638
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,720
security principles are applied

639
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,080
encoding there are different methods of

640
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,240
doing encoding what is the best for the

641
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,280
implementation

642
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,760
where you will be getting a lesser cuber

643
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,480
many things

644
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,280
needs to be studied to actually decide

645
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,600
on what type of encoding can be done

646
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,799
there are two different products for

647
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,280
example eb-84 protocol in dbit for

648
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,000
protocol

649
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
you can encode the quantum state both

650
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,919
using polarization and phase

651
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,200
so a lot of study has to be done uh to

652
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,919
understand

653
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,480
to select the right encoding then based

654
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,240
on the detection

655
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,159
what type of detection you want to use

656
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,400
whether it is a single photon detector

657
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,039
or it is a homodyne detection then of

658
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,480
course range

659
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,240
you want to do a ground to ground or you

660
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,840
want to do a satellite to satellite or

661
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,279
ground to satellite

662
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,840
so a lot many things needs to be

663
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,679
understood to finally come up with a

664
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,880
right protocol so what does a

665
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,559
quantum key distribution configuration

666
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,159
looks like so you have

667
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,559
alice and bob system separated by two

668
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,760
channels

669
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,440
one is a quantum channel which will be

670
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,760
carrying your quantum states or photons

671
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
and the other is a classical channel it

672
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,919
can be optical fiber it can be an

673
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,279
ethernet link

674
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,200
and of course you can also combine these

675
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,440
two channels what we do in the classical

676
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,039
channel is actually sending the clock

677
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:21,919
information

678
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,840
because you see even though the alice

679
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,000
and bob can be kilometers apart

680
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,360
there has to be a picosecond

681
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
synchronization between them

682
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,799
there has to be a very good error

683
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,960
correction code running in these

684
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,760
modules so a lot many post processing

685
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,120
things

686
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,799
like privacy amplification error

687
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,799
correction authentication

688
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,559
all these algorithms are run on the

689
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,559
classical channel and on the quantum

690
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,559
channel only photons or quantum states

691
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,720
are same qkt algorithm

692
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,320
so as i mentioned you select the right

693
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,640
algorithm then you have a quantum

694
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,080
transmission stage

695
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,840
depending upon the algorithm or the

696
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,240
protocol you have a sifting stage

697
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,559
then you correct the errors you analyze

698
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,640
the security the source parameters what

699
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,080
is the leakage then you come up with a

700
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,440
compression factor

701
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,279
and then you apply hashing to it to

702
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,600
secure it or to make it uniform

703
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,440
and then with a particular negligible uh

704
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,200
probability which is known as security

705
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,960
parameter you generate the final

706
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,279
securities

707
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,120
what we do at q new is a different

708
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,440
distributed phase reference qkd protocol

709
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,840
where you have the the source and the

710
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,760
attenuator you can consider it as a

711
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,960
quantum source

712
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,440
then i'm modulating the photon a single

713
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,240
photons

714
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,640
using uh based on the random numbers

715
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,840
which are generated

716
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,559
so this rng can be a trng or it can be a

717
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,520
qrng

718
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,000
so i'm encoding the photons uh using

719
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,760
this random number generator

720
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,000
encoding can be again on frequency time

721
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
polarization of phase

722
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,279
then i'm sending them to the quantum

723
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,440
channel and then

724
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,320
it is decoded so i i can say it's a

725
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,520
source generator

726
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,120
a source generator encoding transmission

727
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,000
decoding and detection so this is the

728
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,200
optical layer

729
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,679
and apart from that whatever happens is

730
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,360
actually classical cryptography

731
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,440
so after you have detected the states

732
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,120
you have to do uh

733
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,440
you have to do so this is the alice and

734
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,480
bob

735
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,240
uh i should mention that quantum key

736
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,919
distribution only solves your key

737
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,039
distribution problem

738
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,440
it doesn't solve authentication so the

739
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,480
alice and bob

740
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,640
has to be prior authenticated using

741
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,760
state-of-the-art

742
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,760
algorithms right and thereafter you know

743
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,400
the key transmission is done then after

744
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,640
the detection you do error con

745
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,240
error correction privacy amplification

746
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,480
reconciliation and finally you will be

747
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,600
generating

748
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,799
secure symmetric keys at both the ends

749
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,640
if the error rate is high then somebody

750
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,039
is easily aborted

751
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,039
in that case keys are not generated now

752
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,400
these are encrypters

753
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,640
so if you want to have a cryptographic

754
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,159
message between them

755
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,159
then there is a technique of how the

756
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,320
keys are not the keys are never sent

757
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,960
to the channel they are generated at

758
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,159
alice and bob

759
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,640
and they use this key to do the

760
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,200
encryption and decryption

761
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,720
so this is one of the communication

762
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,320
which we had performed

763
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,960
in our lab um so these are the two

764
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,799
systems alice and bob

765
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,320
they are connected by a clock channel

766
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,159
which is a classical channel and the

767
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,600
post processing is done through an

768
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,480
ethernet link

769
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,559
and then there is a quantum channel for

770
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,000
quantum transmission

771
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,039
once the keys are generated the router

772
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,600
requests requests the key from the alice

773
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,720
if alice has to send a message to bob it

774
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,640
will encrypt the analysis message

775
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,080
with the key and the send the cryptogram

776
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,520
to the panel and also a reference id

777
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,200
at bob the reference id is used by bob

778
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,520
to find out the corresponding

779
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,840
secure keys it will take the key from

780
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,960
here

781
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,840
apply the decryption algorithm and then

782
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,640
obtain the

783
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,520
final message so we have performed this

784
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,640
activity

785
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,880
in our lab and also in other labs

786
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,360
and in critical infrastructures we have

787
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,720
demonstrated them

788
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,640
and we'll be happy to give you a demo

789
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,760
some time

790
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,000
and after the keys are generated one

791
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,360
more thing is the keys

792
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,200
which will be used for encryption has to

793
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,120
satisfy the randomness property

794
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,399
so we test the keys in nist test suit uh

795
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,320
in die hard in ent in in to1

796
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,640
and to finally say that the keys are

797
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,320
good enough to be used for cryptographic

798
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,480
purposes

799
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,440
uh some of these works are published in

800
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,399
these papers

801
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,760
if you're interested you can go through

802
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,720
them and finally this is a demonstration

803
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,080
we have performed for

804
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,480
for some critical customers and where we

805
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,000
have taken the keys and we have done

806
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,159
video conferencing

807
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,200
and also encoded voice messages and sent

808
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,640
it to from one node to the other node

809
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,320
now qkd is does not uh we say that you

810
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,159
know it is bounded by some distance you

811
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,919
cannot make it thousands of kilometers

812
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,919
of course not because

813
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,000
alice and bob uh if you're doing

814
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,840
fiber-based qkd uh

815
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,960
you are limited to about 150 kilometers

816
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,440
um if you want to if you use some other

817
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,640
technology like us

818
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,720
uh like a superior uh single photon

819
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,039
detector or ultra rollers fiber you can

820
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,000
still go to

821
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,559
400 kilometer but not beyond for higher

822
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,000
distances you have to use satellite

823
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,080
qkd and and this qkd is always between

824
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,039
two nodes alice and bob so there is a

825
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,640
particular

826
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,880
way in which you can extend it to

827
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,480
multiple uh

828
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,880
nodes this is what china has done in the

829
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,720
withdrawal satellite we call them as

830
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,120
trusted uh

831
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,600
trusted nodes and the keys are generated

832
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,360
between alice and bob and then it

833
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,320
travels to c

834
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,640
using a one-time plan so if you're

835
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,679
interested again

836
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,919
i can explain that in person or write us

837
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,760
send a small note for you to understand

838
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,520
how this really works uh i will not

839
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,360
go into much detail random numbers of

840
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,720
course we know it has to be

841
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,000
unpredictable

842
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,559
and uniform so classically there is no

843
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,480
way you can generate an unpredictable

844
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:10,960
numbers

845
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,360
if you toss a coin today uh earlier it

846
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,039
was considered random but today we know

847
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:15,760
that it can be

848
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,159
simulated right similarly the chaotic

849
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,200
lasers or

850
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,320
trngs there are all our complicated

851
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,880
environments and once you can solve them

852
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,960
you can easily predict the occurrences

853
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
but quantum mechanics is inherently

854
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,880
random you will never be able to predict

855
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,600
the outcome

856
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
so that is why it guarantees the

857
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,720
predictability

858
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,640
and of course if the algorithm or if the

859
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,399
random number generator is such that it

860
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,039
will generate

861
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,080
uniform distribution of bits then you

862
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,399
have

863
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,480
a very good case uh the random number

864
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,240
generators which are used by

865
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,320
which are used today for cryptographic

866
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,679
activities are basically

867
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,880
prngs which is algorithm-based

868
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,880
and they suffer from various drawbacks

869
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,279
for example existence of back drawer

870
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,399
and weak entropy predictability of seed

871
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,840
and two

872
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,720
classical physics it is known as the

873
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,279
trng if it depends upon quantum physics

874
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,880
we call it qrng

875
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,039
at qnu we have generated we have

876
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,080
developed

877
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,080
a q optical qrng we have progressed from

878
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
generating 1 mbps to

879
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,799
today we are generating 100 mbps we have

880
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,480
also

881
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,480
come out with hence the

882
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,559
rpg where you can actually you take the

883
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,159
entropy from a quantum source and then

884
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,279
you expand it

885
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,760
and generate higher throughput

886
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,880
so uh i will not uh

887
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,840
i'm running out of time can i take five

888
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,360
minutes more or

889
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,600
do you want me to close in a minute

890
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,760
all right i'll just go fast

891
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,440
if you look at a quantum random number

892
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,600
generator it basically has

893
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,840
three units one is the state preparation

894
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,000
second is the data acquisition and third

895
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,600
is the conditioning

896
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,799
so the idea behind the slide is that

897
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,720
now the international bodies are

898
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,000
actually working on

899
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,039
standardization of these kind of uh

900
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,279
quantum random number generators and qkd

901
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,320
and there exists

902
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,080
several standardization uh white cop

903
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,240
white papers and uh and um they have

904
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,519
come out with different uh

905
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,159
rules you know how to evaluate a quantum

906
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,600
technology product

907
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,840
so this is a scheme uh we work on and i

908
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
think i have already mentioned that we

909
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,279
have this

910
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,279
okay i can send the paper on this work

911
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,960
of how we are generating using time of

912
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,519
arrival

913
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,600
qrng the result the random numbers

914
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,919
generated from the optical qrng we have

915
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,919
evaluated using nist and other testing

916
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,760
platforms and they have passed almost

917
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,320
all

918
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,039
and and this is the last slide the last

919
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,559
slide we wanted to convey that the

920
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,720
vision of our company is to provide

921
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,960
a quantum layer of security to the

922
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,159
existing classical

923
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,039
uh primitives or classical cryptography

924
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,279
so this is uh what we are

925
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,200
working up and you know trying to come

926
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,399
out with different

927
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,919
solutions using the products we have

928
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,840
so any questions any quick questions i

929
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,200
can take

930
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,840
i'm sorry for exceeding my time

931
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
hello

932
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:53,840
i'm not able to hear anybody

933
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,039
hello

934
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,679
thank you anandita that was an excellent

935
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,120
talk

936
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,918
uh waiting on um srividya to come on

937
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,918
we do have several questions yeah i'll

938
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,520
be happy to take them if you can send me

939
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,960
by mail or

940
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,359
i get your you know any help with the

941
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,560
questions i'll be

942
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,440
you know more than willing i can see

943
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,800
some questions in the chat do you want

944
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,159
me if you can just address them that

945
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,800
would be great

946
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,839
uh should i read them out to you mom

947
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,159
yeah i mean either way i can always uh

948
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,760
type it here if

949
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,239
yeah i can i can quickly tell it out so

950
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,320
maybe you can speak maybe that's faster

951
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,159
so the first question what are the

952
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,359
challenges faced by qkd

953
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,399
um distance of course and

954
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,200
the throughput the key rate it's these

955
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,079
are the basic

956
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,119
challenges because the the the signal is

957
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,160
so weak

958
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,960
um that it is very difficult to increa

959
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,280
to

960
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,040
get a good rate at long distances

961
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,200
so distance is a challenge

962
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,119
uh second question how can one begin a

963
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,800
career in quantum computing and

964
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,000
specialize in quantum cryptography

965
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,440
um okay these are different areas

966
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,920
quantum cryptography is where you have

967
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,400
to understand or study you know

968
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
quantum optics quantum information

969
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,000
science quantum

970
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,760
security models secure communication

971
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,200
protocols are different

972
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,359
and when you uh delve into these

973
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,960
protocols you'll have to understand the

974
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,240
security framework

975
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,560
so this is a different uh study though

976
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,240
both the subjects are based on quantum

977
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,200
information

978
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,400
but uh it is difficult

979
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,680
from one to the other

980
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,640
um thank you there are some questions

981
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,839
so from the question

982
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,079
some people have some questions so the

983
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,200
first would be

984
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
uh how effective would it be if we

985
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,000
implement quantum security protocols

986
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,599
and existing cloud machines

987
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,880
um so we are working on that how to uh

988
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,160
make the cloud machines secure quantum

989
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,720
secure

990
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
so uh there is something called quantum

991
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,560
security hardware module

992
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,119
uh by so this is when you say cloud it

993
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,240
is data at rest

994
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,839
so what we are addressing is data in

995
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,280
motion uh

996
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,640
so to address the data at rest uh making

997
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,599
it quantum safe

998
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,720
would require uh encoding of the data

999
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,640
which is there in the station

1000
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,920
using quantum random numbers or

1001
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,520
when you're transferring the information

1002
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,040
from one station to the other station

1003
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,640
then you'll have to use a qkd so that

1004
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,240
you don't have to carry the keys or the

1005
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,599
or the data from one station to the

1006
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,400
other station

1007
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,480
so there are there are certain thought

1008
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,640
process going on in this direction

1009
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,760
and we have started thinking on

1010
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,320
on quantum security hardware module as a

1011
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,800
solution to this

1012
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,040
thank you and another question is that

1013
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,599
is there any way to use entangled qubits

1014
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,240
for each cloud

1015
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,280
um so entangled qubits um

1016
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,880
when you say it is

1017
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,160
we are we are doing a quantum

1018
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,240
communication so in entangled qubits

1019
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,680
means they are photons which has to

1020
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,480
travel

1021
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,400
from one station to the other so

1022
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,680
wherever there is a quantum

1023
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,640
key distribution the source can be a

1024
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,240
single photon source or it can be a

1025
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,960
quantum

1026
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,960
entangled source also and if you're

1027
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,880
talking about some computation

1028
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,599
um which is done on the cloud using

1029
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,040
entangled qubits

1030
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,440
then of course it is uh there is a way

1031
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,400
and it has more advantages

1032
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,320
and another question is that is there

1033
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,240
any opportunities for the study of

1034
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,320
energy dissipation levels in quantum

1035
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,119
security products

1036
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,240
um is it an opportunity for the study of

1037
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,640
energy dissipation levels side channel

1038
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,599
do you uh do you

1039
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,640
indicate side channel attacks energy

1040
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,800
dissipation levels in quantum security

1041
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,680
products

1042
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,040
okay so uh when we talk about quantum

1043
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,280
products uh particularly if you say

1044
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,880
quantum key distribution

1045
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,680
and quantum random generators then the

1046
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,280
standardization bodies talks about

1047
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,160
different uh

1048
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,320
dissipations which are possible or the

1049
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,640
system system has to be

1050
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,839
made resistant to the different side

1051
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,200
channels

1052
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,960
differential power analysis attacks and

1053
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,800
so many other attacks are there

1054
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,720
and they are more of classical in nature

1055
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,480
when you're talking about energy levels

1056
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,920
optical energy level

1057
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,960
so it's very weak it is

1058
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,240
not possible and if i'm saying it is

1059
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,760
so yeah i mean if i'm trying to hack

1060
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,680
an optical channel then i will be using

1061
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,119
a dissipation method which is called

1062
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,800
beam splitter attack but that is a

1063
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,920
different uh

1064
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,400
thinking altogether and i think here you

1065
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,640
mean to uh say this side channel attacks

1066
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,359
so of course

1067
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,800
whatever is implied in classical

1068
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,119
cryptography applies here also

1069
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,280
a lot of processing is happening inside

1070
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,640
the system

1071
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,200
and our last question is does quantum

1072
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,160
pair have fixed number of entitled

1073
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,560
uh can you please come again our last

1074
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,640
question is does quantum note pair have

1075
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,640
fixed number of entangled qubits

1076
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,920
um so now you're trying to think this in

1077
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,839
terms of quantum computing where you

1078
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,680
have fixed number of qubits right

1079
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,599
but here what happens in quantum key

1080
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,880
distribution is

1081
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,160
uh or in quantum nodes is you have okay

1082
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,920
now just think that there is a laser

1083
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
in one of the nodes the laser emits

1084
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,079
millions of photons in one particular

1085
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,480
pulse there is an optical pulse with 50

1086
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,359
duty cycle

1087
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,480
say the on time is around 500 picosecond

1088
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,880
so i'm running the the laser at one gig

1089
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,680
rate

1090
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,640
one optical pulse 50 duty cycle you have

1091
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,119
a

1092
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,839
500 nanosecond pulse there and it has 50

1093
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,560
it has some 20 million photons inside it

1094
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,280
i will be reducing it to um to an

1095
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
average photon number of 0.1

1096
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,119
so that is a level it is in pico watts

1097
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,560
level i'm talking about

1098
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,680
and um it is not possible to think that

1099
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,800
you know it can be quantified that these

1100
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,880
many photons will be there or not it is

1101
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,079
not possible

1102
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,200
but but uh you can think uh

1103
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,240
if you're talking about quantum

1104
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
computing or a quantum computer then of

1105
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,880
course this question is valid

1106
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,640
thank you ananda for giving such an

1107
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,920
informative and

1108
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,119
uh enjoyable session uh on quantum

1109
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,560
security communication and qkb protocols

1110
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,400
thank you thank you
