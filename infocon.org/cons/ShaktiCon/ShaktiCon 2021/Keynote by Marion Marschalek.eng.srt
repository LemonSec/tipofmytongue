um one of the starting points in her

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,439
journey is when she won the female

reverse engineering challenge

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,759
i i think in 2013 which was organized by

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,200
howard flake

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,799

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,920
that in today's talk

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,439
and later she founded black hoodie for

47
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,200
encouraging more women in the field of

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,880

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,119
every single event i attend it's a very

54

security is

129
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,479
amazing there is never ending challenges

130
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:40,960
the

131
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
technologies that we're working on are

132
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,479
so diverse

133
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,240
we get to work on

134
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,440
heartbeat monitors we get to work on

135
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
mainframe computers we get to work on

136
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,280
the cloud we get to work on

137
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,960
micro architecture security we get to

138
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,440
work on all these different fields that

139
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
offer so many challenges and with the

140
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,360
challenges come amazing jobs

141
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,479
that uh first of all there's plentiful

142
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,520
second there through through the bank

143
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,000

they offer benefits

146
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,720
they help um the engineers

147
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,919
who who work in those jobs to

148
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,039
support their families to

149
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,600
be happy humans and um

150
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,639
the the situation we're looking at in

151
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,280
the technology field is that most of

152
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,680
those

153
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,720
amazing jobs are currently held by

154
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,080
by men that in itself

155
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,039
is is occasionally intimidating so like

156
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:47,440
for

157
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,320
for lots of us women in cyber security

158
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,160
especially getting started

159
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,280
is difficult the field

160
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
is intimidating the the challenges i'm

161
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,400
talking about

162
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,199
they're not easy we're not we're not

163
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:01,759
raised

164
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,600
to think about logic and mathematics and

165
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,440
computers is something that's easy to

166
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,960
approach

167
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,080
and hence lots of us especially women

168
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,000
look at this field

169
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,280
where there's all the boys and all the

170
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,720
difficult subjects

171
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,240
and think that this is not something

172
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,240
that we should pursue

173
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,759
and i think that is bogus again

174
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,560
the the field has so much to offer and

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,120
um

176
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,240
shaktikan is an event that tries to

177
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,680
explain this to

178
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,280
young women who tried to enter that

179
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,039
field that

180
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,840
there is a lot of fun to be had this in

181
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,080
this fear of cyber security

182
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,440
and there's a lot of success that we had

183
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,360
um why am i here today so i guess

184
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,199
i was invited to get this keynote

185
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,960
because

186
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,400
let me count six seven years ago i came

187
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,160
up with a very similar

188
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,599
concept on

189
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,880
i forgot a year now but in

190
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,400
the middle of the 2010s 2015 i'd say

191
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,120
i was at a conference and two women

192
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,080
snuck up on me

193
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,360
like didn't come

194
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,960
crashing into my my field of view but

195
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,280
snuck up on me and told me like hey what

196
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,400
you do there

197
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
like you do reverse engineering right

198
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,919
and that's super cool

199
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,720
i i thought that's very interesting

200
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,000
could you maybe

201
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,639
tell us how to how to get there how to

202
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,440
learn that

203
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,520
like how did you get started and how can

204
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,280
we learn that too

205
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,960
uh like oh that's amazing like a tech

206
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,000
conference and there's

207
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,879
two other women and they're they're

208
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,960
interested in what i do so

209
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,319
i told them let's let's sit down

210
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,160
together and

211
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,919
let's talk about reverse engineering i

212
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,599
show you how to do that

213
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,840
and that idea eventually became a

214
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,720
workshop

215
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,680
so i invited others as well and ended up

216
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
with 15 attendees

217
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,199
that spent the weekend with me looking

218
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,840
at binaries

219
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,319
at the time i didn't know there were

220
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,000
other women in this field who were

221
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,160
interested in learning this so i was

222
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,479
like

223
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,879
super happy uh we spent the weekend

224
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,520
together

225
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,479
and a lot of those ladies who attended

226
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,360
the very first

227
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,560
edition of black hoodie um

228
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,560
i'm still friends with we we found this

229
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
one difficult subject that we all looked

230
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,680
at together

231
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,200
and we we enjoyed

232
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,039
ourselves doing so and this experience

233
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,200
brought us all a lot closer together

234
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,880
so originally black cody was not

235
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,399
supposed to be

236
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,519
a series or a global undertaking or a

237
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,200
conquer the world approach

238
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,519
it was me sitting together with a couple

239
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,360
of friends looking at binaries

240
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,399
and from there

241
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,839
i don't know how that happened but the

242
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,760
year after

243
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,880
i did the same thing again as the first

244
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,800
time i put out a blog post and

245
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,640
tweeted about me giving a reverse

246
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,880
engineering class and

247
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,000
on the second edition about 30 ladies

248
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,640
showed up

249
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
i was like yes we're curious we heard

250
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,240
about this class of yours

251
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,320
and we would like to learn more and i

252
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,000
was again super excited

253
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
the year after year number three i did

254
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,279
the same thing again

255
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,680
and ended up with 67 attendees

256
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,600
now those weren't all new at any some of

257
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
them had been there the years before and

258
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,839
were just

259
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,440
coming back because they enjoyed

260
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
spending time with us

261
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,200
and others had heard from their friends

262
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,720
that this is a fun event that they

263
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,000
should attend as well and all of a

264
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,160
sudden we have a room full of 67 people

265
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,839
i was shocked from there

266
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,120
it all kind of started exploding i say

267
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
exploding because

268
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,000
um i mentioned there was never a plan so

269
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,600
there was never any

270
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,519
um any idea of how big we wanted to go

271
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,480
or or how our future was supposed to

272
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,440
look like

273
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,839
so eventually i sat together with

274
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,279
with some of the early attendees and

275
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,200
said we can't keep growing like that

276
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,680
like

277
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
67 people in one room is just not gonna

278
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,880
scale

279
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
and we came up with the idea of having

280
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,360
different tracks so

281
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,760
people who had attended before would be

282
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,480
coming back

283
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,040
and all became trainers themselves

284
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,240
because

285
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,160
so we all looked at reverse engineering

286
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,200
but not everybody

287
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,000
worked in that field but everybody who

288
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,160
attended the class had their own

289
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,760
um field of interest like

290
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,079
we had a woman who was a cryptographer

291
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,000
we had a woman who was into

292
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,240
windows kernel we had one who was into

293
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,279
compliance and from there it moved along

294
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,640
so that

295
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,360
eventually we had a list of trainers who

296
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,320
were willing to give

297
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,360
workshops at black league then so it

298
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,760
happened that in year four and year five

299
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,000
things literally blew up all of a sudden

300
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,040
we had

301
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,480
i think three tracks with five or six

302
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,200
different workshops and

303
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,760
[Music]

304
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,320
at some point what was that the the

305
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,880
event

306
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,240
that we had in berlin a few years ago we

307
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,640
had

308
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,560
300 registrations 300

309
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,959
i literally lost my mind the day i saw

310
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,959
that and

311
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,600
again we can't actually put 300 people

312
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,640
in

313
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,320
in the classroom or or into one event

314
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,640
altogether um because scaling

315
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,760
is just not what we wanted to

316
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,560
do from the start the idea of black

317
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,120
hoodie

318
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,440
is to stay small in some sense to be an

319
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,399
intimate class

320
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,360
where 20 to 30 students can get together

321
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,279
everybody gets to talk to everybody else

322
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,800
and everybody gets to be friends with

323
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,839
everybody else

324
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,279
the more people you have in the class i

325
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,440
think the less personal the experience

326
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,839
becomes

327
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,040
so from there the next

328
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,760
best option to to scale was not to make

329
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,600
the classrooms bigger or make the events

330
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,120
bigger

331
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,320
but to have more events

332
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,160
so then around 2017 2018 i

333
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,800
think blackley started to spread out

334
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,920
originally we were one one event per

335
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,240
year

336
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,079
and then all of a sudden there were

337
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,240
other black ladies popping up

338
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,880
alexa had showed up for for a class like

339
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,720
yes i want to take this to my hometown i

340
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,920
want to

341
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,120
i don't know run this in a different

342
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,160
country and initially i was a little

343
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,720
worried

344
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,440
i i didn't think that like hoodie was

345
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,399
going to be that

346
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,040
big and i didn't want it to be something

347
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,320
big it was like my

348
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,279
my little baby project um

349
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,519
but yeah eventually i was convinced that

350
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,079
spreading out wasn't wasn't a bad idea

351
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,040
and like

352
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,680
the the events that i could run myself

353
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,279
were still gonna be my babies

354
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,680
and the events that other people were

355
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,560
starting to

356
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,040
to run were then gonna be their babies

357
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,560
and it turned out magnificent

358
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,600
so the year after in 2019 i eventually

359
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,440
stopped counting but we had around like

360
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,360
10 between 10 and 15

361
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,240
likely events in different cities and

362
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,680
different countries

363
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,480
run by different people and eventually

364
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,920
the whole organization would start

365
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,839
running itself

366
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,519
today all i do quite literally

367
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,920
is occasionally post on our discord

368
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,800
channel

369
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,000
and every now and then i give keynotes

370
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
and tell people about the history of

371
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,440
black hoodie

372
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,240
and this is how we got here again i'm

373
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,160
super happy to be keynoting shaktikan

374
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,120
today

375
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,839
because shaktikan um they picked up this

376
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,079
idea the organizers loved how black

377
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,519
hoodie was running and

378
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,040
as priya in the beginning introduced um

379
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,680
wanted to have the same the same concept

380
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,120
like the same kind of event

381
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,480
in in india and

382
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,320
they did it they came up with a plan

383
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,240
they have their their web platform

384
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,680
running they have all the communication

385
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,720
channels running

386
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,360
they organized the trainers the speakers

387
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:25,760
they

388
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,720
organized the ctf and they made it

389
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,480
bigger and better than like cody could

390
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,160
have ever done

391
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,000
um it makes me super happy that means

392
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,440
that i in the future have less to do

393
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,199
more events to attend and

394
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,760
yeah eventually these events take from

395
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,240
my perspective to go around themselves

396
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,600
um just kidding

397
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,279
why why do we need these events so

398
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,199
desperately

399
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,959
um shaktikan is organized by women

400
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,399
for women black hoodie historically

401
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,880
was always a woman-only event um

402
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,360
the idea there is first of all to

403
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,279
attract women to attend in the first

404
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,040
place

405
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,240
i noticed that a lot of the

406
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
events even if they're they're free like

407
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,839
the ctfs are being run

408
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,920
or free trainings that are being given

409
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,839
for me in the past they were never quite

410
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,279
as attractive

411
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,320
because i never felt like i fit in

412
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,399
like imagine you walk into a classroom

413
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,800
and everybody looks different

414
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,839
and as soon as you walk in all these

415
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,600
people look up and stare at you because

416
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,199
you look different too

417
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,480
and you sneak in and you get your seat

418
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,759
in the back of the room and you sit

419
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,720
there and

420
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,639
you feel slightly uncomfortable most of

421
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,839
the time

422
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,079
during that event and i thought

423
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,560
if we turn this around if we create a

424
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,199
space

425
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,880
where we can all feel like we belong

426
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,079
then we can't excuse ourselves from that

427
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,279
space anymore

428
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,959
now that makes sense so

429
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,000
by creating such spaces by the way

430
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,240
with with spaces i mean

431
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,759
the space and time for a minority to get

432
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,079
together and feel comfortable

433
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,560
in an environment that otherwise

434
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,040
wouldn't be that comfortable

435
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,600
that was true for any minority it's just

436
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,440
that i personally know best how

437
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,040
how women feel and an attack environment

438
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
but again it can be generalized to

439
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,360
anyone already

440
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,720
why are these safe spaces so nice

441
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,320
i call it safe space it's not like

442
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,720
in the in in the mixed gender

443
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,320
environment

444
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,079
we're constantly threatened but in a

445
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,560
safe space

446
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,600
it feels like we've been long it feels

447
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,399
like

448
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,399
these events like these trainings and

449
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,440
the ctf

450
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,480
they're organized for us and

451
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
if something like that is organized for

452
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,839
us that means

453
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,959
we can't not dive into this

454
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,959
if there's any errors or slight interest

455
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,720
in cyber security then

456
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,640
if there is an event in cyber security

457
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,160
that's dedicated

458
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,280
to the specific minority

459
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,199
in shaktikan's case to women

460
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,000
then we can't put our hands our heads

461
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,640
into the sand and turn around and say

462
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,480
not my business

463
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,320
that's what i think makes these events

464
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,840
so attractive and that's why they're so

465
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,799
successful

466
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,880
in attracting more and more women to the

467
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,200
space

468
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,039
why is it important that we have more

469
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,039
women in cyber security

470
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,559
so first of all there's a lot of jobs

471
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,400
that need to be filled i personally know

472
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,200
that because

473
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,840
my team is hiring themselves and it is

474
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,679
really hard to find good cyber security

475
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,240
professionals

476
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,080
then women make up

477
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,200
i don't know 20 or less of

478
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,760
of this workforce but they're 50 of the

479
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,520
population so there definitely

480
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,960
is underutilized talent uh in this space

481
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,799
then in the beginning i talked about the

482
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,760
jobs and how nice they are

483
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,280
why is important that women have nice

484
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,600
jobs i personally think that

485
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,799
every woman out there

486
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,840
should be able to support herself

487
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
one or another way it's all about

488
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,199
personal choices as well but

489
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,880
the the job security and and the cyber

490
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,760
space all together

491
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,039
makes us independent the the nice

492
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,760
salaries

493
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,160
help us support ourselves and support

494
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,320
our families

495
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,360
they help us find secure

496
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,080
places to live they help us live

497
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,600
a nice measured life that in return

498
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,880
helps the society we live in

499
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,520
in the feedback loop so

500
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,720
the yeah i don't know how to

501
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,840
how to put that any better i

502
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,799
love that i have a secure job i love

503
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,240
that i have secure income

504
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,039
i love that i can afford my my own car

505
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,160
and

506
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,320
my own apartment and i do not have to

507
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,240
think

508
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,679
where what am i gonna do next month

509
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,600
so that is something that i wish for for

510
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,760
every woman on this planet for real

511
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,559
not only because i'm such a supporter of

512
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,720
women but because i believe that this

513
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,160
helps our society as a whole to to shine

514
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,799
and be happy

515
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,760
yes then the the future of these events

516
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,880
right now black hoodie is

517
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,480
taking a bit of a break you might

518
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,320
imagine because of covet

519
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,280
but i hope that our events will be back

520
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,320
by fall

521
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,880
blackody generally is very small events

522
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,799
nowadays we have like

523
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,240
30 to 50 attendees maximum which is a

524
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,520
very constant number

525
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,120
and i'm very much looking forward to get

526
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,760
back to to in-person events

527
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,520
then something that i wanted to talk

528
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,720
about today

529
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,640
um that these cyber security events

530
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,880
provide not only shaktikal and black

531
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
hoodie but really all cyber security

532
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,000
events is opportunities

533
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,840
what do i mean by opportunities and why

534
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,400
are opportunities so important

535
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,280
so being successful in the field in any

536
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,320
field really

537
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,000
requires dedication talent

538
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,320
and opportunity a lot of women i meet in

539
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,640
our field are very dedicated

540
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,000
they they came to stay like i yet have

541
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,320
to

542
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,480
to find a woman in cyber security you

543
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,039
who landed in this field by accident

544
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,159
almost all of us look for it we hear

545
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:08,559
guys

546
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,840
at school or we hear about it from

547
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,600
friends or partners and be like

548
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,559
okay this is what i want to do awesome

549
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,600
so here we are very

550
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,320
dedicated all of us also have certain

551
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,280
talents

552
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,640
so this is like two out of the three

553
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,559
points that i just mentioned we need for

554
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,960
success

555
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,760
it's not everybody's thing to go into

556
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,600
cyber security but again there's so many

557
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,880
opportunities and

558
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,080
to go into different directions but

559
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,440
it's difficult not to find a a job or a

560
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:39,919
task

561
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,400
a direction that's that fits somebody's

562
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,840
talent

563
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,120
finally opportunities

564
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,799
what is an opportunity and why are

565
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,679
opportunities so important

566
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,880
an opportunity is

567
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,240
being invited to join a project with

568
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,159
experienced engineers and

569
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,559
being able to to contribute and to shine

570
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,679
on a project

571
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,720
an opportunity is being invited to speak

572
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,760
at a conference

573
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
like i'm here today this is a great

574
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,200
opportunity to

575
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,880
to talk to all of you an opportunity is

576
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,520
being invited for a job interview being

577
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,120
invited for a job interview does

578
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,360
not mean that the job is actually

579
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,159
acquired that

580
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,000
the person is actually hired but it is

581
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,360
an opportunity

582
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,480
it is an opportunity that lots of us for

583
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,200
a long time

584
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,320
didn't get because

585
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,799
we didn't make it through the screening

586
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,760
process

587
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,840
or because we didn't have the right

588
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,200
education to

589
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,400
approach a certain job or because

590
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,000
we simply thought that we shouldn't

591
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,600
actually apply for a given job

592
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,520
these opportunities that i'm talking

593
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,760
about they are crucial

594
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,559
i recently learned that mentoring

595
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,679
someone

596
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,480
doesn't mean to teach them mentoring

597
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
someone doesn't mean to guide them

598
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,400
and it doesn't mean to do things for

599
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,840
them

600
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,520
the best mentorship i've perceived in my

601
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,840
life was having a mentor

602
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,880
who pointed me towards opportunities

603
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,400
who told me which project was

604
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,159
interesting to work on next

605
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,000
who told me which conference i should

606
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,200
attend and which conference i should

607
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,039
submit to

608
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,640
who introduced me to other people who

609
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,600
could help me solve problems

610
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,039
who randomly placed opportunities on my

611
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,240
table

612
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,039
literally one after another um getting

613
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,559
an opportunity

614
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,080
shouldn't be so much pressure that you

615
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,640
have to pick up every opportunity and

616
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,919
write it out to the fullest but

617
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,120
eventually there will be this one

618
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,039
opportunity that just sticks out

619
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,960
and you go like okay this is what i have

620
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,080
to do

621
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,600
then you do it and you succeed and that

622
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,360
success takes you further in life

623
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,520
for me it so happens that

624
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,799
in 2013 i had this amazing opportunity

625
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,520
that landed on my table a co-worker

626
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,559
entered my room

627
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,600
at at work and said look

628
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,760
there is a cyber security competition

629
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,960
for women

630
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,520
you should have a look and sign up and i

631
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,640
was like yes how

632
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,360
stupid of course i had a look at it and

633
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,279
it was a reverse engineering competition

634
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,200
for women

635
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,039
at the time i was working as an analyst

636
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,640
at an antivirus company

637
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,559
and reverse engineering was what i

638
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,480
thought i was supposed to do

639
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,600
i wasn't doing it at the time because i

640
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,799
didn't know how but

641
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,360
that's what i wanted to do so i looked

642
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,039
at this competition was like yes

643
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,520
whatever it's for women so if other

644
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,400
women

645
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,760
do this then i should probably try to

646
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,840
and that was literally a thought process

647
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,000
that's how the original idea from

648
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,640
of black cody came up why like cody is

649
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,480
woman only because

650
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,159
that day when i saw the challenge i was

651
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,120
like this is for me

652
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,039
this is my challenge okay so i started

653
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,000
the challenge

654
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,320
i spent two and a half months on trying

655
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,919
to figure out how to reverse engineer a

656
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:06,559
binary

657
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,799
i wrote a report and i ended up winning

658
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,640
that was not coincidence i put all the

659
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,480
life energy ahead into that contest

660
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,480
after i won that challenge i was invited

661
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,960
to attend a conference in singapore

662
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,720
i was going to meet the organizer of the

663
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,080
challenge and

664
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,320
other senior leaders of our industry

665
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,640
and i was invited to give a lightning

666
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,279
talk about my challenge

667
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,520
this had such a big impact on my career

668
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,760
it it literally got me started on a

669
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,279
field that i was always interested in

670
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,960
it introduced me to people who could

671
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,039
help me advance my career

672
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,080
and it would show me how

673
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,000
what what the rest of the industry was

674
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,600
was working on basically like what cyber

675
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,879
security at the conference looks like

676
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,760
now the reason why i'm so obsessed with

677
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,640
opportunities

678
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,760
is because if that opportunity wouldn't

679
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,400
have landed

680
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,520
on my table that day my life would have

681
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,640
taken

682
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,240
potentially a very different direction

683
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,159
and ever since um ever since we started

684
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,400
black hoodie i've been trying to

685
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,720
fetch opportunities as i see them coming

686
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,000
along and hand them off

687
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,200
to to other people that's basically how

688
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,679
i think

689
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,799
we can help each other best blackly is

690
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,240
supposed to be an opportunity

691
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,679
for women who are interested in cyber

692
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,279
security so they have a

693
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,440
space and time where you can attend and

694
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,960
learn the skills that they want to learn

695
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,720
build the the network that they need

696
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,039
to further their career and eventually

697
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,279
find more opportunities

698
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,880
and find find friends and feel

699
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,559
comfortable in the field that we're in

700
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,919
and yeah as i mentioned in the beginning

701
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,000
i'm so super happy that events like

702
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,279
shaktikan

703
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,120
take on this this mission and

704
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,600
further this um distribution of

705
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
opportunities

706
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,159
if i can call it like that

707
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,720
for attendees who are listening in today

708
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,360
and

709
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,559
want to enter the cyber security field

710
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,918
watch out for opportunities

711
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,919
watch out for things where you can

712
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,200
contribute

713
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,520
watch out for other people who might

714
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,440
need your help

715
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,279
pick up every opportunity that comes

716
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,640
along on your way

717
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,320
and i see that carefully like of course

718
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,840
you can do everything that's out there

719
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,039
but

720
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,120
the first few years of my my career i

721
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,480
was very busy just

722
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,320
running after every opportunity

723
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,080
eventually today i'm i'm a super happy

724
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,240
security engineer at a large tech

725
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,279
company and

726
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,360
my life is amazing and i wish the same

727
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,360
thing for everybody else out there

728
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,039
my time is almost up this was actually

729
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,240
all of my keynote

730
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,360
i thank you all very much for for

731
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,320
attending and

732
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,679
i hope you have a great rest of the

733
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,080
conference

734
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,600
yeah thank you marion for sharing your

735
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,360
thoughts i guess we have some time to

736
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,799
take some questions

737
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,159
right now if any of the attendees have

738
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,360
uh questions please do write them in the

739
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,880
chat

740
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,840
um and yeah we will take that up and

741
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
um

742
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,320
okay um so we have a question what

743
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,760
online course

744
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,080
do you recommend to get started with uh

745
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,960
reverse engineering

746
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,480
that is a good question there is a whole

747
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,600
number of

748
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,159
reverse engineering courses out there

749
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,120
but actually

750
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,240
what what helped me most getting started

751
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,440
in the beginning was book

752
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,960
there's a book called secrets of reverse

753
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,360
engineering

754
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,960
that is floating around as a pdf

755
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,480
somewhere on the internet

756
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,559
um yeah and there is a lot of listings

757
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,240
in there

758
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,399
so what helped me a lot in the beginning

759
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,799
was a getting the

760
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,799
uh the basics of operating systems and

761
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,840
binary formats and binary execution

762
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,080
then what the book nicely explained was

763
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,320
all these topics plus

764
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,799
um it had paper listings of assembly

765
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,799
as i tell you this it sounds super

766
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,360
boring looking at assembly on paper

767
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,559
but it helped me just

768
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,360
sit there with the with a pencil

769
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,159
actually

770
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,440
and take my nuts like in

771
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,399
in in the book

772
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,240
and yeah that's what i what i recommend

773
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,600
all of my students

774
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,320
and then online classes there are

775
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,000
different diverse engineering classes

776
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,120
there is one by

777
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,159
malware unicorn that is focusing on on

778
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:30,720
malware

779
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,240
multiverse engineering then

780
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,440
there is not class posted by fear

781
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,360
harpass

782
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,760
i don't know what the name of that was

783
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,720
but yeah if you

784
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,559
if you go to google and look for reverse

785
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,080
engineering tutorial

786
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,840
you should spit out the the most

787
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,520
important ones right on top oh and then

788
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,080
i was one

789
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
i'm not sure that's still online that

790
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,240
was hosted by octopus labs

791
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,480
that was a very good reverse engineering

792
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,840
tutorial as well

793
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,519
okay the next question is who inspired

794
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,240
you to do

795
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,919
reverse engineering for the first time

796
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,960
oh the challenge i i talked about um

797
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,919
i was working at an antivirus company

798
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,320
and

799
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,799
the other analysts there knew how to

800
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,000
reverse engineer

801
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,200
and i didn't and at the time

802
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,799
i mean we're all super busy nobody

803
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,720
really had the time to sit down with me

804
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,840
and teach me

805
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,480
but i was like i want to learn this so

806
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,159
when that challenge came in that that

807
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,039
was my

808
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,440
my time to shine it was when i actually

809
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,279
got really motivated to do this

810
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,120
so i wasn't it wasn't the person was

811
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,960
this this challenge that

812
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,679
got me started

813
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,360
all right any other questions we

814
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,120
do have a few more minutes

815
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,279
uh programming language is required to

816
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,840
learn in reverse engineering

817
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,399
um i don't

818
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,799
think that is a necessary requirement

819
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,000
so i knew how to write c

820
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,200
before i started reverse engineering

821
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,279
i don't think any specific programming

822
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,279
language needs to be known but

823
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,760
what uh what the student needs to

824
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,320
understand

825
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,279
is how programs work i think without

826
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,000
having written

827
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,320
some code it is difficult to understand

828
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
how the logic of the program

829
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,640
works so imagine for reverse engineering

830
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,480
you want to reconstruct what the code

831
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,159
originally did

832
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,240
so if you don't know how the code like

833
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,279
the code

834
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,399
works then it might be difficult to do

835
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,519
to make that stop from like you read the

836
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,720
assembly over here

837
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,640
and you want to figure out what the code

838
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,799
intends to do

839
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,080
therefore understanding code is very

840
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,000
important see is a very good

841
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,039
story that we say but really i think any

842
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,158
programming language should do

843
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,200
okay yeah i

844
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,120
guess we don't have any more questions

845
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,360
well yeah okay this will be the last one

846
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,640
what kind of mental

847
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,279
attitude do you have to keep learning

848
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,640
all the time

849
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,519
how can we get past feeling like i can't

850
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,159
learn this

851
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,440
i will never understand it

852
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,519
um

853
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,840
mental attitude

854
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,120
guess i'm a very hard-headed

855
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,760
individual

856
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,080
for me it was curiosity that

857
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,440
took me further and further so for me

858
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,760
understanding what i was looking at was

859
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,560
always important

860
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,800
you can show me any piece of code like

861
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
the b assembly or

862
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,040
oh my god show me a puzzle i i will want

863
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,480
to figure it out

864
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,719
um this curiosity i think is what

865
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,119
yeah what inspired me

866
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,399
yeah i can imagine that's a tough

867
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,599
question to

868
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,639
say in a very short moment um

869
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,000
yeah all right um we yeah

870
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,079
just to say we also have a lot of men

871
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,040
attending this

872
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,879
final summit um and i i'm sure that

873
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,719
there was definitely a lot of takeaways

874
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,320
um it's not just a topic

875
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,520
but only limited to women

876
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,040
uh because uh men play a great role

877
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
in enabling women to come up in this

878
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,560
field and

879
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,720
yeah for the next conference when you

880
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,400
see uh lone women

881
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,800
standing on the corner of the room maybe

882
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,880
yeah men should put more efforts to

883
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,640
um yeah get them integrated into the

884
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,680
system

885
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,560
um and i'm also thankful to all the

886
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,280
amazing

887
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,880
men out there who helped me grow

888
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,160
in this field yes yeah and

889
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,040
um you also mentioned about dedication

890
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,480
talent and opportunity

891
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
um and this is applicable to a lot of

892
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,720
newcomers and i guess we do have a lot

893
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,440
of

894
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,520
students attending this uh and you

895
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,200
stressed on the importance of all the

896
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,680
facts

897
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,480
and actually this reminded me of uh a

898
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,599
teaching from

899
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,440
our chancellor amma she always talk

900
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,320
about kalam prayagnam and kripa

901
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,839
this is time effort and grace all

902
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,760
these three should come together for any

903
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,280
action to be successful

904
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,440
and this is actually very relatable to

905
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,359
what you said as well dedication talent

906
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,079
and opportunity

907
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,200
opportunities like grace uh um

908
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,520
yeah it's not in our control and you

909
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,119
should always put your effort and

910
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,800
