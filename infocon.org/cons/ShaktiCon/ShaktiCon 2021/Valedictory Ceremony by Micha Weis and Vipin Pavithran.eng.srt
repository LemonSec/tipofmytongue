by team shakti with the focus on

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,920
bringing up more women into the field of

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,200
cyber security

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,280
we aim to achieve that by actively

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
increasing women into the workforce

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,160
by conducting beginner level trainings

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,399
and

18
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,600
ctfs to give them foundation skills and

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,559
confidence

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,760
to go forward on this path shaktikan is

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,079
the brainchild of mr vivian

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,640
pavitram who is also the founder of

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,680
sheen shakti

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,640
and all the bios the ctf teams of ahmada

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,240
vishwa vidyapeda

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,960
shaktikan was done in phases to build a

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,479
community that will have a

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,000
long effect on women in cyber security

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
so hence shakthi khan can be said as a

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,240
birth of community that promotes and

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,799
trains women in this field

32
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,240
now i would like to invite meenakshi

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,560

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,600

[Music]

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,599

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,239
what that is

49
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,760
but something is moving

50
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
right

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,480

i'm sorry for the delay so yeah so i'm

54
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,840
going to press in the statistics of

55
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,280
um so as you all

56
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,760
might know we conducted the shaktikun

57
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,640
conference in

58
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,519
three phases so the first one was the

59
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,560
shakti ctf

60
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,439
which is a completely beginner level ctf

61
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,599
it was conducted on december 4th

62
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,720
2020 and you say and after that

63
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,040
was the beginner level trainings given

64
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,320
by the team

65
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,639
and phase 2 was a challenge base powered

66
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,918
by dragoda

67
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,600
then came the intermediate level

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,440
trainings by our trainers

69
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,000
and phase 3 was the conference and the

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,199
financial

71
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,639
let's get into each of them in detail

72
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,520
so the first ctf uh was a beginner

73
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,840
friendly ctf organized exclusively for

74
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,639
women it was

75
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,280
completely limitedly suited and it was a

76
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,840
24 hour ctf conducted in december

77
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,680
and it served as a kickstarter for

78
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,880
shaktikan

79
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,400
so in that ctf we had 49 challenges from

80
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,759
six different categories

81
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,800
and over 1 300 participants

82
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,160
so we were we got an immense response

83
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,560
from

84
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
all the uh participants but uh they had

85
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,919
a problem that a lot of people were new

86
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,160
to cpfs and they didn't know what ctfs

87
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,720
were

88
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,440
so we had the idea of conducting a

89
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,039
beginner level trainings and

90
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,680
so we decided to make the whole event

91
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,639
huge and

92
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,919
organize it into a set of trainings so

93
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,000
that is what we did so the first was a

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,840
beginner level trainings and that was

95
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,360
conducted

96
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,720
during the months of january and

97
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,759
february by the team shakti members

98
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,600
so we had um trainings in basic topics

99
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,560
from

100
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,199
ctfs to photography the west engineering

101
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,639
binary exploitation

102
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,840
pep exploitation

103
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,520
[Music]

104
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,280
so the second was the challenge space

105
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,520
which was powered by drakoda labs

106
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,720
so draboda apps is a platform created by

107
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,759
amphos

108
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,600
our sister club and the participants

109
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,680
were given an opportunity to try out the

110
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,120
challenges hands-on

111
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,680
through the january february period on

112
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,919
dragon

113
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,000
so this is how this scoreboard looked

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,360
like and we had

115
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,000
given vouchers to the top participant at

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,160
the top by synonymous school board

117
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,560
so after that where the in intermediate

118
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,680
trainings

119
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
uh which was conducted by the cyber

120
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
security professionals working in the

121
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,400
industry

122
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,360
these trainings were given on real world

123
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,160
attacks

124
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,919
and uh it was given to women

125
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,360
participants so

126
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,840
these are some of our professional

127
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,280
trainers

128
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,800
so uh after that came the shakti ctf the

129
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,319
final ctf you

130
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,680
everyone saw and that was the 36-hour

131
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,720
ctf uh conducted which was open to all

132
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,280
uh and the ctf prices were there for top

133
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,039
women only teams and this

134
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,720
is a showdown before the final contest

135
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,280
so for that we had a 684 teams

136
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,000
registered

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,120
and uh 5765 total points were available

138
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,199
there were 37 challenges from six

139
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,639
different categories

140
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,319
so we had over 1500 registrations

141
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,960
from five different continents so this

142
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,520
is a graph of

143
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,479
the continent twice participation now

144
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,599
through the trainings

145
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,039
ctf streets etc we were within two

146
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,280
months we were able to reach over 5k

147
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,759
people

148
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,560
worldwide and that was kind of

149
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
overwhelming for us and we were really

150
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,759

focused on inspiring training and

154
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,319
upskilling women in cyber security

155
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,720
our goal is to create a comfortable

156
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,039

157

i just want to mention in the beginning

237
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,320
that

238
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,279
i do or i work as advisor at minister of

239
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,079
finance but

240
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,519
on this session i will present my

241
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,560
private opinion it's important to me

242
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,480
to say it but it's of course it's a

243
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,519
takeover from all over the place that i

244
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,480
uh

245
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,720
was the work for them so cyber security

246
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,959
what we can say about that nothing no

247
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:23,760
it's not

248
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,760
it's not important yes it is and i think

249
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,079
the ecosystem i i think

250
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,760
i will talk about the financial

251
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,680
ecosystem but it's um

252
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,720
it's i think it's right to uh all

253
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,079
of the entire world entire the business

254
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,000
world so the ecosystem i think it's on a

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,959
peak point

256
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,360
on this this month last month

257
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,399
because there is a big trade

258
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,160
but it's also a big opportunity

259
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,760
for us for the cyber guys and i think

260
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,720
it's one of the goals for the conference

261
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,279
to see

262
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,920
what is the opportunity on the market

263
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,600
and um

264
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,920
in the in the situation that uh between

265
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,800
defense

266
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,760
and uh offensive and defensive approach

267
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,399
there is

268
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,160
also and all time there is a asymmetric

269
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,320
situation because the attacker all time

270
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,360
10 step

271
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,720
before us before the defender

272
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,000
and they are faster easier

273
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,760
they have more budget they have no

274
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,680
regulation

275
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,880
they have just mentioned

276
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,000
you know just um need to uh

277
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,639
want to do it that's all attention they

278
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,839
like they

279
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,200
just need attention and

280
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,600
we we are in the on the defense world we

281
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,760
are like uh with and craft

282
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,120
we are ever regulation budget

283
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,279
problem etc etc so

284
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,480
we are not on the same place and and i

285
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,279
think on

286
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,880
this particular days i feel that

287
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,880
we are in um some kind of melting point

288
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,560
it's a it's a very important time to

289
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,720
understand because i think

290
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,000
i didn't i wasn't all on the um

291
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,720
conference time but i'm sure you talked

292
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,399
you talked about uh

293
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,399
solar wind and fire eye 12 time

294
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,560
even 100 but what i want to mention here

295
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,920
it's that's why we are uh on

296
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,160
a specific point that the attacker

297
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,160
um achieve a very um strong tools

298
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,480
for example it's from firewire just from

299
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,320
from a fly aisle

300
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,440
they hacked to their company they stole

301
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,959
like um very powerful and

302
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,240
zero day tools so they have the tools

303
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,839
then they got uh open doors

304
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,120
with solar winds more than 30 thousand

305
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,480
organization that uh was uh

306
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,560
hacked and they have open doors

307
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,600
so they just need do it like you know

308
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,519
the uh

309
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,920
the famous shield company said just do

310
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,040
it

311
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,800
and it's very and you can see it on the

312
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,880
field we can sit

313
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,399
on the ground boots on the ground

314
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,120
we can see the attacker on the ground

315
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,320
it's happened

316
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,440
every day i don't know if it's thousand

317
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,360
but a lot of companies

318
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,279
have been hacked got a run somewhere

319
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,920
or whatever they uh it's happened to

320
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,720
them but it's

321
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,600
happened uh much more

322
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,240
times than that ever so i think it's

323
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,959
it's very

324
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,600
unique point on the time scale

325
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,760
also um i think that the copy 19

326
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,199
it took us to uh you know to a different

327
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,240
world

328
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,680
and um i just read some

329
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,360
uh data that you know it's it's a

330
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,160
different

331
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,160
if it took years to change behavior

332
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,920
in one year most of the world changed

333
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,519
behavior

334
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,600
a lot of people that didn't know how to

335
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,880
um

336
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,639
touch a computer open account uh

337
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,759
even send a mail now they are expert

338
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,639
so the word move to uh to the digital uh

339
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,320
cyberspace and it's of course open again

340
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,839
the um attack surfaces for the attacker

341
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,000
again because everybody on the same

342
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,880
place

343
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,800
with a digital um tools

344
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,160
and the awareness it's zero

345
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,120
zero nobody know nothing about it even

346
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,240
you know

347
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,920
when i work for the government and for

348
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,040
the large-scale organization

349
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,720
i came to our managers and i try

350
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,759
you know the c-level managers and i try

351
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,800
to explain them

352
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,839
about cyber security when i started

353
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,279
to explain them they lock down cyber no

354
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,560
no i don't understand

355
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,360
leave me alone i have a business to run

356
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,959
cyber it's not for me

357
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,000
and also you come to the cyber guys

358
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,320
and you try to explain them and what

359
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,079
what is the business about

360
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,000
again they said okay leave me with

361
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,399
business i'm a cyber guy i'm techno

362
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,320
technology guy and our goal on this time

363
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,519
is to uh build the bridge

364
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,839
and they create a language to bridge

365
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,360
between these two sides

366
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,079
and said hey we need to talk together

367
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,920
and cooperate to uh defend

368
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,800
our organization

369
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,480
i think uh also on the

370
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,400
human capital it's a lake a big huge

371
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,760
you are on fantastic time came to the

372
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,559
market

373
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,240
all the studio and all the new guys that

374
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,039
came here to uh to be a cyber guy

375
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,079
you are on the spot the number talked

376
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,919
about 1.5

377
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,959
million cyber expert that

378
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,199
missing on the market and it will uh

379
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,439
it will be more so you are in the

380
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,640
perfect time

381
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,840
to be here um

382
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,120
i think let's talk about five minutes

383
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,679
with the

384
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,799
on the attacker and some examples that

385
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,360
happened to the last year first of all

386
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,559
you know

387
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,480
also i assure that you talked about it

388
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,840
in the last three days

389
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,280
and you know it uh very well about the

390
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,960
group if it's an individual if it's a

391
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,880
group if it's an organization if it's a

392
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,000
country

393
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,799
and you see that everybody is involved

394
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,320
on cyber attacks

395
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,200
also we are reached to the country level

396
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,720
so allowing the

397
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,799
referred to a russia i don't know it's

398
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,720
the country or its organization not the

399
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,120
group

400
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,480
but the rumor said

401
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,360
that it's uh connected to the country

402
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,760
it's

403
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,559
i know i'm not sure it's effect but it's

404
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,760
that's what uh

405
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,280
the news tell us and and this

406
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,919
it's a lot of uh example that something

407
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,320
happened also on the attacker's side

408
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,559
for example there is a collaboration

409
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,000
between groups

410
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,200
it's never happened before now

411
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,240
a group of attackers collaborate between

412
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,440
each other they use a double extrusion

413
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,640
you know try to do the ransom twice

414
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,440
also on the production side and also on

415
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,960
the backup side so

416
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,400
just yesterday somebody called me and

417
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,240
said hey i got to run somewhere and say

418
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,679
okay go to the backup saying

419
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,200
no backup it's also be encrypted

420
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,960
so nothing to do close the business

421
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,160
and uh here's a backup one year ago

422
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,600
and let's let's see if they can

423
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,400
release something from one year ago to

424
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,200
the business

425
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,760
that they need to run also there is a

426
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,400
frequent customer operation that the

427
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,280
organization

428
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,080
organization that hacked and after

429
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,480
months they hacked again so it's very

430
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,679
sad

431
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,919
for the defender but it's

432
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,720
i think it's good for us because it gave

433
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,039
us

434
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,600
the opportunity to um to be creative

435
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,440
and to understand what happened on the

436
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
market

437
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,760
for not first time but it's it's very

438
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,640
unique time

439
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,760
that uh the business world need us

440
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,120
and want cyber um

441
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,120
expert and not a long time ago

442
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,679
i remember all time we have a joke that

443
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,640
the cyber guys have

444
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,080
two um weak point one we all time on the

445
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,559
end

446
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,880
on the end of the line and second

447
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,360
that uh if something happened we are the

448
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,799
first to go

449
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,480
and it's not like that now it's changed

450
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,600
we are not on the last on the line

451
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,200
and the management and boards

452
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,200
ask our opinion they want a solution

453
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,799
they know it's cost it's called the

454
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,559
money they know it's not

455
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,840
easy job to defend organization

456
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,159
it's a lot of mission to do

457
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,159
to become a secure and it's no 100

458
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,000
secure never

459
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,120
we can also see what will be the trend

460
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,720
for the next few years

461
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,760
if we can take just a few subjects like

462
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,080
uh

463
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,440
quantic computing nano computing

464
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,799
ml and ai blockchain

465
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,080
av and vr it's a challenge

466
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,280
and the hybrid cloud it's here

467
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,200
it was uh news but it's it's

468
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,480
it's reality uh all the

469
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,919
not all but it's a big movement to the

470
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,640
cloud

471
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,280
if it's hybrid or cloud but the

472
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,440
organization go to the cloud

473
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,840
the instant payment become very very

474
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,360
huge

475
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,159
uh also the autonomic vehicle and the

476
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,520
transportation

477
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,559
drones airplane um

478
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,000
i'm part of group one what's up one for

479
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,880
aviation

480
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,000
one for cars one for uh airplane

481
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,440
one for drones and one for quantum

482
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,600
computing each each of them is a world

483
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,080
it's a full world it's also um

484
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,480
the iot of nauti of course it's part of

485
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,600
the

486
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,240
game for a long time and it's become

487
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,919
bigger and bigger

488
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,200
and look around us all the houses of the

489
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,080
organization

490
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,120
full of iot and ot and nobody

491
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,200
know what to do with them and it's it's

492
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
a it's a door

493
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,440
it's open door if you don't defend them

494
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,840
of course

495
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,280
so for summary my uh

496
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,400

705
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,279
our knowledge ability and skills when

706

is another endeavor in that cause

714
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,600
i just wanted to also share the thoughts

715
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,360
of my faculty who really

716
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,240
put in a lot of effort in here uh one

717
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,840
one one one clear

718
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,480
fact is that today ctf time that

719
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,360
actually

720
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,159
uh you could say ranks all the ctf teams

721
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:22,559
has

722
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,960
close to 11 800 teams worldwide

723
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,640
and to the best of our knowledge is

724
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,919
hardly 10 women only ctf teams

725
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,200
in the world now why is this important

726
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,120
to say

727
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,799
this is important because when we

728
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,440
started uh you know looking into

729
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,600
organizing participating in ctf contests

730
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,440
back in 2010 which is about 11 years ago

731
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,799
we only had say one ctf team from

732
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,640
india india as you know is a very very

733
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,080
large country

734
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,519
and as we introduced this whole concept

735
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,519
of ctf in this country

736
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,200
uh we saw a huge impact and today

737
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
in fact we're very happy to say that

738
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,120
india itself contributes the second

739
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,120
largest counter city of teams in the

740
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,399
world today

741
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,559
and it's the same impact we'd like to

742
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,760
make

743
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,559
on women only players as well so this

744
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,960
year we have launched shakti ctf and our

745
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,760
aims we will be able to generate

746
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,200
and inspire at least 200 plus women only

747
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,600
ctf teams in the next five years

748

852
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,480

playing yeah

857
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,240
it's uh it's require it was uh what i

858
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,880
was

859
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,000
trying to say okay okay and how do we

860
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,359
feel about this event

861
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,800
uh first of all i want to to say that

862
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,640
it was our first challenge in a

863
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,079
women-only team

864
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,160
and what we learned about this

865
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,599
experience was

866
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,119
where these things first of all to use

867
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,880
we discovered the new python library

868
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,480
which is pillow and this

869
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,280
library is really useful when we are

870
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,160
working with

871
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,359
images also we improved

872
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,640
our experience on wireshark we

873
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,680
know better how to use it also i

874
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,800
we also tried to um

875
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,359
we discovered we learned better how to

876
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,240
use one

877
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,560
with the one gadget technique in order

878
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,400
to drop

879
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,200
also we

880
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,680
learned how to compute discrete

881
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,920
logarithm in sage

882
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,119
and uh we also uh this

883
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,320
learned better how uh how to use the

884
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,640
module file system in javascript

885
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,480
in order to read files on the server and

886
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,520
thanks to you i we also

887
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,119
learned something new about new esoteric

888
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,320
languages like grocery list which was

889
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,680
a really funny challenge for us and

890
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,598
yeah let's talk about our emotions now

891
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,119
we grew up as a team and because

892
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,480
it was our first time meeting each other

893
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,880
we helped also each other in categories

894
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,800
we weren't familiar with

895
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,839
and we gained a lot of confidence in

896
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,480
ourselves

897
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,000
we in the future we would like to do

898
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,720
more cps

899
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,480
recruit maybe more girls because

900
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,920
we are few and we want to create a space

901
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,800
woman could feel comfort comfortable

902
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,480

being um having good quality as well

945
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,040
and one of the things i experienced that

946
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,640
the beginner ctfs

947
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,880
uh usually or often doing

948
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,480
the same challenges that all of the

949
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
other beginner ctfs have just

950
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,000
a few variables differences but you

951
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,760
had the very uh

952
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,040
wait i just need to look for my word um

953
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,880
original challenges like there are

954
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,880
different things in the challenges

955
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,319
making us

956
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,359
uh having to not only read a

957
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,440
write-up and follow a write-up that

958
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,599
already exists doing basically the exact

959
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:02,720
same thing

960
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,880
but we also need to understand the

961
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,880
format and understand how things work

962
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,119
and learn

963
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,359
fun stuff which is what i believe is the

964
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,720
coolest things

965
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,480
uh with your challenges uh and i also

966
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,000
want to mention that

967
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,599
this time the second time around we had

968
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,440
a new girl on our team and she sold her

969
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,920
first challenge in your cdf and it was

970
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,000
really cool we were like three people on

971
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,960
the challenge

972
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,599
and she was the one getting the flag so

973
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:36,960
i thought maybe

974
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
leo maybe you would like to say a few

975
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,480
words

976
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,520
about your experience

977
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,200
oh yeah sure um

978
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,119
yeah first of all as you said thank you

979
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,960
so much for arranging this

980
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,560
ctf as a beginner i

981
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,560
first was like really scared when i saw

982
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,000
the challenges

983
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,200
uh but you know once i got my first flag

984
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:01,599
i

985
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,960
immediately got obsessed and and

986
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,599
once the flags kept coming it was just

987
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:08,079
yeah

988
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,119
it's so much fun um

989
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,640
as my teammate mentioned we talked

990
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,839
about the different challenges being

991
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,200
so varied and that was super cool and

992
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,040
personally i also really like the

993
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,960
different hints that we got

994
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,480
some of them were super fun so uh just

995
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,240
amazing

996
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,160

1004
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,680

1005
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,520
experienced uh

1006
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,920

making a female ctf

1038
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,720
