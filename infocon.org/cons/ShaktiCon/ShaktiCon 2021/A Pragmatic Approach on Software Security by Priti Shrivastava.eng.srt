give us an insight on the pragmatic

52
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,759
approach on software security

53
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,200
and to kick start day two of shakticon

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,320
i welcome you to take over man all right

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,920
uh so let me just share the

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,360
what is the sharing right now

57
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,520
okay it's still disabled would you allow

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,840
me to

59
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
share

60
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,000
um

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
just a minute man we're trying to fix

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,920
that

63
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,000
[Music]

64
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,680
yeah oh it worked

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,959
i think are you on the road yes

66
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,319
seems like okay yeah we are able to see

67
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,440
all right okay i should have thought of

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,720
that before

69
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
all right so a few minutes lost here i

70
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,840
guess uh

71
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,000
10 minutes lost almost here so we'll

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,080
speed it up um

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,560
so yeah so let's just start you know um

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,400
like the introductions already has been

75
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,879
there

76
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,560
so this is a i'm just going to talk

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,879
about you know a pragmatic approach to

78
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,959
software security when i started working

79
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,280
on

80
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,080
in intel how you know i sort of brought

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,720
it up

82
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,040
from scratch you know there was no

83
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,799
program on security there was no

84
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,280
security being built into our systems

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,200
in our software or hardware for that

86
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,640
matter um

87
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,360
so you know i started this um from

88
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,000
scratch

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,319
and so i just wanted to share that first

90
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,599
before i would talk about

91
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,720
you know just promoting women here of

92
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,519
course

93
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,760
uh so you know why security matters i

94
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,120
think most of you already know from

95
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,640
yesterday that you've been

96
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,040
to the conference have been attending

97
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,560
and some of you are already in this

98
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,760
field

99
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,519
so we'll talk a little bit about that

100
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,799
not a whole lot

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,120
uh what's the approach then i will begin

102
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,920
to a little bit

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,159
about the security development lifecycle

104
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,200
which most of you are from their sdl

105
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,920
and then many tools that you can use

106
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,000
i'll talk a little bit about them

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,519
and you can obviously find them

108
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,680
otherwise indicators what one should

109
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,478
track

110
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,798
in order to be successful and making

111
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,399
sure that the security is really built

112
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,600
into your software

113
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,199
and then some key takeaways and

114
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,520
hopefully we'll have some time for q a

115
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,800
given that we have some hiccups here

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
um so security really matters and

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,840
nowadays

118
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,240
it's even more every day you hear about

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,960
breaches

120
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,759
right um just yesterday actually i read

121
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,080
in the news google

122
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,400
had a whole bunch of issues but there is

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,639
privacy of their photos

124
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,680
and their many programs you know many

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,720
accounts were hacked about two years ago

126
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,600
and they did not even tell the users and

127
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,680
yesterday they said they have

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,919
legally said that they are not going to

129
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,479
let the users know about this

130
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,960
because none of their important sort of

131
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,160
pii

132
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,759
wasn't impacted pii is your personally

133
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,000
identifiable information so you know

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,600
every day we hear about this

135
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,720
in 2020 i have some data here to say

136
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,320
you know how many data breaches were

137
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,280
there there were over 155 million

138
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,080
speeches

139
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,600
you know and the records which were

140
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,160
exposed

141
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,280
were even larger over 1 billion

142
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,520
so you can imagine you know how this is

143
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,560
really

144
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,759
impacting our lives you know not only

145
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,880
personal lives

146
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,919
business finances everything and couple

147
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,560
of these

148
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,039
um major security incidents that we had

149
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,000
just this year

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,320
it hasn't been that long right we are in

151
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,199
april

152
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,800
um and so parallel is one of the um

153
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,880
you know a social media app it's kind of

154
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
a conservative app i don't know if you

155
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
know much about it

156
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,440
so the data that was that they had

157
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,560
was hacked all of the data was gone

158
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,080
and they didn't even know until the

159
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,160
amazon web services which is also known

160
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,600
as aws

161
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,120
they removed their platform from the

162
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,759
servers that's when they came to know

163
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,960
and it was essentially 70 terabyte

164
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,080
of leaked information that had pretty

165
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,400
much

166
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,000
100 99.9 of their post messages

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,960
video data time location there were

168
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,360
people who verified their identity

169
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
at parallel with the driver license

170
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
photo id

171
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,759
everything got exposed so you know these

172
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,319
are like

173
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,080
huge issues this is like the top hacked

174
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,960
issue this year in just in three months

175
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,280
then facebook instagram and linkedin you

176
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,960
know they all three these three

177
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
companies were impacted

178
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,680
by a chinese social media company which

179
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
is called social arts

180
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,840
that suffered a data leak through an

181
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,599
unsecured database

182
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,120
and that exposed account details and pii

183
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,160
of at least 214 million

184
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,520
social media users from where

185
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,960
facebook instagram and linkedin

186
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
and so these are the kind of things and

187
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,800
once you get exposed like that your

188
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,759
email addresses

189
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,800
phone numbers profile pictures your

190
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
account login names

191
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,919
password your company name you know

192
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,840
whereabouts location

193
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,960
everything gets exposed so this is why

194
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,400
security is important

195
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,199
because we have these hackers who are

196
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,280
out there not doing anything else but

197
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,680
just

198
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
hacking our systems

199
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,319
cloud your platforms your hardware your

200
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,199
devices

201
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,599
your financial systems everything so

202
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,280
security really does matter

203
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,800
you know that's i just wanted to sort of

204
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,319
start with that

205
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,319
um because i know many of you already

206
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,520
are aware of many things

207
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,720
but just to highlight a little bit so

208
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,960
what's the approach we can take

209
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,840
you know to uh oh you can see the whole

210
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
screen can you

211
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,280
yes we can okay um

212
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,240
so the organic growth of security

213
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,759
workforce was one of

214
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,840
my theme of building security from

215
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,000
scratch

216
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,160
i said hey you know what we already have

217
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,759
engineers smart people

218
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,919
let's make sure either they understand

219
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,520
the security already

220
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,919
or we teach them and then we also

221
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,759
understand what are the risk of our

222
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,400
products

223
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,560
because not everything is same in the

224
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,199
software or hardware on devices right

225
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,080
some are more hydrazed security profile

226
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,799
things

227
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,760
others are lower risk so let's

228
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,200
understand what kind of products we're

229
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,640
building in intel

230
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,760
for example and you know so that's risk

231
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,519
assessment is sort of the first thing

232
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,880
you do

233
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,480
then you want to assess the security

234
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,200
capability of your organization or your

235
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,560
company

236
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,240
and then i make sure that you have the

237
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,160
right set of training to make them

238
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,240
good security engineers you know and

239
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,760
these security engineers are people who

240
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,839
are implementing security features

241
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,800
who are testing who are architecting and

242
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
all of those

243
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,880
and in general you can make people a

244
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,000
security architect

245
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,440
or expert off the back just by training

246
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,279
you need to hire some of them right

247
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,720
there are out there

248
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,839
in public so that's what i

249
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,040
actually put together oh sorry um

250
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,800
that we hire security architects and

251
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,560
security experts

252
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,240
and then we need to make sure that we

253
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,360
have a good secure development lifecycle

254
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,200
that's essential to this whole thing

255
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,360
right if you don't have a good security

256
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,120
development process you're not gonna get

257
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,680
there

258
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,800
so you need that and then the security

259
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,959
program you need to have in place

260
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,800
with the right set of people in order to

261
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,640
govern the process

262
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,399
go on the security development life

263
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,480
cycle how it's embedded in your

264
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,000
development cycle

265
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
you know with jira and other things

266
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,720
so managing the sdl process

267
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,839
risk assessments training and

268
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,000
something we called final security sign

269
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,320
off to make sure that the product you're

270
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,240
shipping is really good

271
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
and then you want to manage through your

272
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,399
security experts and security architects

273
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,200
so that they are embedded in different

274
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
teams different product teams

275
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,160
in making sure that they are lifting

276
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,959
them up

277
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,240
on a security retro scale you know

278
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,200
so that's important so that's the sort

279
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,920
of the higher

280
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,839
level approach on this and sort of the

281
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,360
crack of the meat

282
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,880
but if you go into the security

283
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,760
development life cycle which is the next

284
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,200
slide here um this picture right

285
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,440
on the right side is really talks about

286
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,680
secure development life cycle

287
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,640
that what kind of things it comprises so

288
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,240
i'm not sure if you can see

289
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,320
the whole picture maybe i can do this is

290
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
this better

291
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,880
all right so the request starts with you

292
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,240
know you need to understand what are the

293
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,079
requirements for your products

294
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,920
for your software hardware devices

295
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,680
whatever you're building

296
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,600
what what's the design like are you

297
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,040
making sure the design

298
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,000
has the right set of implementation that

299
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,279
is going to

300
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,440
have eventually in that based on the

301
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,560
architecture

302
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,160
so you need to do threat modeling you

303
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,600
need to understand what's the threat

304
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,560
landscape for

305
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,000
your particular product and so along

306
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,440
with the threat landscape and the

307
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
requirements that you have

308
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,920
you can have a good threat model i think

309
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,959
you had a class

310
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,519
yesterday from sangli on threat modeling

311
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,440
by the way she used to be in my team

312
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,480
at intel i had hired her anyway so

313
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,240
threat modeling is important and then

314
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
the design review that comes

315
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,640
after that on the architecture side

316
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,160
using the threat model

317
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,200
and the architecture diagrams that we

318
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
that the product teams provide you

319
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,959
actually do a security design review

320
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,440
you make sure they have the right set of

321
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,800
controls in place

322
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,120
sort of right designed in place so that

323
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
the implementation can begin

324
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,160
so this is a sort of a very important

325
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,680
point here in the sdl and this takes a

326
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,480
lot of time

327
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,440
in general to get through then the next

328
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,600
thing is you start developing on based

329
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,279
on your design and architecture

330
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,519
once the development is done you do need

331
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,000
to put some control to make sure

332
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,920
everything is being done the way it was

333
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,040
designed right

334
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,360
either your architects or your experts

335
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,079
sort of

336
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,320
cross-check these things then you get

337
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,160
into the security testing

338
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,560
and code reviews so the code review is

339
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,920
done to make sure the

340
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,839
seek is a security code review to make

341
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,560
sure that the all the security

342
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,279
errors are taken out of the code right

343
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:35,680
so

344
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,839
it's actual manual code review the

345
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,079
security experts do

346
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,079
and then the security testing we'll talk

347
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,160
a little bit more about the tools but

348
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
one other thing i really emphasize is

349
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,920
important to do is fuzzing

350
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,320
and penetration testing i know everybody

351
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,160
out there does static code analysis

352
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,000
and all of that right clockwork or

353
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,680
covarity you're running those every

354
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,560
night

355
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,760
but it's and that's important but on top

356
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,360
of that you've got to fuzz

357
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,600
your software and do the penetration

358
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,079
testing based on your the threat model

359
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,920
based on your threat landscape you've

360
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,839
got to do penetration testing it's very

361
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,200
important

362
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,279
and then the final security review which

363
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,600
is going to basically ensure that all

364
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,839
the security bugs are fixed

365
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,320
right architecture got defined

366
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,399
appropriately implementation got done

367
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,680
appropriately

368
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,079
and based on your security risk you have

369
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,680
done everything that's ought to be done

370
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,519
in securing testing

371
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,600
and make sure that there are no escapes

372
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,639
right and then

373
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,120
you release now of course at the release

374
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,480
time you also need to make sure the

375
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,079
infrastructure that you're releasing it

376
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,680
is so for example it's a cloud app

377
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,720
you need to make sure that cloud

378
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,480
security is built into that as well

379
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,320
so you know you need to sort of make

380
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
sure all the

381
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,839
issues are on security are resolved

382
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,160
before you release

383
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,719
and then

384
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,480
let's talk about you know from here then

385
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,560
we let's talk about tools

386
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,639
so vulnerability detection tools and

387
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,480
secure development process tracking

388
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,320
tools these two are

389
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,560
key to making a program of security

390
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,760
successful

391
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,839
so vulnerability detection where you

392
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,839
have to do it during development and

393
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,680
during the release cycle

394
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,360
some of the important things you can do

395
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,760
is compiler flags for example

396
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,279
you know you make sure you're using the

397
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,600
right compiler flats

398
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,760
for example runtime buffer overflow

399
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,880
detection

400
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,040
runtime bounce checking c plus plus

401
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
string in containers

402
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,880
uh you know are you do you have the

403
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,079
right set of

404
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,720
security flags that you're using there

405
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,959
increased reliability of back traces

406
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,839
full asr for executable these are

407
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,040
compiler flags

408
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,839
that you can use to you know make sure

409
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,880
that you have

410
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,839
compiled and built your program with the

411
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,760
uh you know without any bugs

412
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,480
now um static and dynamic analysis i'm

413
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,240
sure you may have some other sessions to

414
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,279
talk about

415
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,040
but like i mentioned earlier clockwork

416
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,600
coverity of the static analysis tools

417
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,000
uh dynamic analysis are like appscan

418
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,880
fortify

419
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,399
check marks many others

420
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,120
then for binary analysis for third party

421
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,680
code now this is a very important

422
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,120
item in in a security program the binary

423
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,440
analysis for third-party code means

424
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
the third-party libraries for example

425
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,120
open ssl

426
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,160
is an open source library you need to

427
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,920
make sure you're using the right version

428
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,839
of openssl or you're going to have

429
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,440
security vulnerabilities

430
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,000
so you got to do the binary analysis or

431
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,440
third-party code

432
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,519
one of the tools that we were using was

433
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,639
bdba

434
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,720
it's called black duck binary analysis

435
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,560
tool by synopsis

436
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,839
and it's very powerful so that must be

437
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,320
done

438
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,040
during the release cycle you know once

439
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,399
you finish delivering development when

440
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,279
she's done sas

441
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,839
and that stuff you got to be making sure

442
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:54,480
and in fact

443
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,199
keep doing it during your development as

444
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:57,680
well as

445
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,160
release to make sure you don't have any

446
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,920
old libraries that you're using from

447
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
third party you can either it could be

448
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,519
microsoft or them

449
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,639
um fuzzing now in the fuzzing area there

450
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,000
are lots of different tools out there

451
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,560
they're open source like afl

452
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,360
um there are uh defensives you know

453
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,759
there's

454
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,839
defensives from codenomicon there's

455
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,079
another very good fuzzing tool

456
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,360
puzzy lops spike you know quite a few

457
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,720
um then get into penetration testing now

458
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,120
penetration testing tools

459
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,680
obviously huge lists out there right but

460
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,639
you got to see

461
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,880
what kind of threats are important for

462
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,079
you to detect

463
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,360
based on your posture your product

464
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
so verb suite for example for web

465
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,079
right in order to exploit a

466
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,000
vulnerability that you may already

467
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,839
kind of have a sense about you can use

468
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,279
metasploit

469
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,120
um quality for network and wi-fi

470
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,759
you know issues that you want to detect

471
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,360
wireshark is another one

472
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,720
so just like many of them out there but

473
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,240
some of these are really important that

474
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,640
we were using it until and then that's

475
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,119
something you can also explore

476
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,039
now in terms of secure development

477
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,039
process tracking tool

478
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,679
um a latest one which is getting really

479
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,720
a lot of

480
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,439
good reviews is secure development

481
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,000
elements

482
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,439
it's also known as sd elements um

483
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,280
it's one of the tool that security

484
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,880
compass for example

485
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,919
actually has it's very good

486
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,440
in the sense it's actually going to

487
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,600
track the picture i showed you

488
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,679
pretty much requirement design

489
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,840
development testing

490
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,880
um and final security sign off

491
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,360
the risk assessments all of those things

492
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,200
it tracks and also has

493
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,919
capabilities to provide sdl for agile

494
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,240
which is another topic which of the zone

495
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,799
to talk about

496
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,840
so going into now the next slide which

497
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
talks about the indicators

498
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,400
the indicators are really uh to make

499
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
sure that you're doing the right things

500
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,440
and and you're tracking them well so

501
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,919
internal vulnerability tracking you know

502
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,080
in terms of bugs right vulnerabilities

503
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,360
are security bugs

504
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,440
essentially which could possibly be

505
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,880
above that's what we call them

506
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,080
vulnerability

507
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,880
so during development and pre and post

508
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,640
releases you need to keep

509
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,880
making sure that you are tracking the

510
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,799
number of bugs that are being found

511
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,760
fixed what is the lifetime you know all

512
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,799
of that

513
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,280
um external incidents that are reported

514
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,200
by your customers you need to try

515
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,120
right because you need to understand

516
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,799
whether you're improving your

517
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,440
your product on the continuous basis so

518
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,280
life of an incident how long does it

519
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,400
take to

520
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,559
fix an incident incident is essentially

521
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,880
a security vulnerability right

522
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,200
how long it takes to fix those what are

523
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,480
the severity levels

524
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,919
are they the 24 hour fixed needed type

525
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,080
of you know zero day bugs

526
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,280
or are they something that are low risk

527
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,160
and we can take

528
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,039
you know next at least to fix it so cbd

529
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,400
levels are important

530
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,320
and then time to fix and release now how

531
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,080
long it takes to fix and how long it

532
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,559
takes

533
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,720
to get it to the customer's hand which

534
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,919
is a totally different thing

535
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,520
right and you may have to go through

536
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,039
channels to release a product

537
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,320
and whatnot so you need to track all of

538
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,840
these things and organize

539
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,039
nation's progress now because we have

540
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,120
built this on our approach on our way

541
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,520
there is organization have the right set

542
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,120
of maturity levels and

543
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,039
resources we need to make sure that we

544
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,559
demonstrate the progress

545
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,000
on that as well as training

546
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,919
what kind of usage of the tool we have

547
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,240
are we are they consistently using it

548
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,120
um the level you know what you know

549
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,679
different

550
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,679
variety of tools different variety of

551
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,720
testing they're doing

552
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,120
are they benefiting from the tools and

553
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,760
then

554
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,160
security development process compliance

555
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
of course you need to make sure sdl

556
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,960
compliance is in place so these are the

557
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,320
things that you need to

558
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,919
measure and make sure that your

559
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,679
management understands

560
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,919
from time to time like a quarterly

561
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,360
review or such

562
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,919
and and track these metrics to make sure

563
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,600
that you're making good progress and

564
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,120
making an impact

565
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,320
in the security of your product and then

566
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,760
the key takeaway is really that

567
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,520
in order to have a successful security

568
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,039
program you need to

569
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,159
acquire adequate budget you need to talk

570
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,480
to your management and make sure

571
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,120
you have proper funding to be able to

572
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,200
hire new resources or train current

573
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,320
resources or buy

574
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,679
tools or training or by training

575
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,080
in fact there are many you know vendors

576
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,799
which provide

577
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,240
training right and uh so that's another

578
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,480
like sans for example is very expensive

579
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,080
and by the way security training is very

580
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,159
very expensive in general

581
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,240
so you need to have budget to do that

582
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,840
you need to make sure that you have your

583
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,679
resources are skilled

584
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,520
and have the appropriate training for

585
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,280
example if you're doing any cloud app

586
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,200
you want to make sure you do have

587
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,400
a cloud security expert ignorant cloud

588
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,919
security architect

589
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,440
in place uh similarly other areas right

590
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,360
um and then you want to make sure that

591
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,679
you have deployed all of those required

592
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,720
tools

593
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,559
if you if you buy the tools and you

594
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,400
don't deploy them in consistent manner

595
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,240
they're just sitting on the shelf

596
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,159
it isn't going to help you so you've got

597
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,919
to make sure that they're deployed

598
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,720
and you have this as part of your sdl

599
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,600
process

600
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,360
monitoring them on a curtain chase basis

601
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,120
using a metrics then the required

602
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,960
training for all employees not just the

603
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,720
people who are working on security

604
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,640
need to have training for all of the

605
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,240
software

606
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,000
you know development or hardware

607
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,159
development people

608
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,919
all engineers because you want to make

609
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,760
sure they understand why

610
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,880
security is important and then

611
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,760
robust security architecture i cannot

612
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,679
say less things about that this is so

613
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,480
important

614
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,760
you have to emphasize on that in any

615
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,960
company any design you do you got to

616
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
make sure it's a secure design

617
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,039
because that's where it stops if you

618
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,360
don't have a secure architecture design

619
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,559
then you're not going to get there

620
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,000
you're going to find issues where you

621
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,520
have to go and redesign

622
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,320
so you want to avoid that and then

623
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,640
adequate security testing

624
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,360
it can never be enough keep doing as

625
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,799
much as you can

626
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,000
you know static dynamic fuzzing code

627
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,360
reviews

628
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,240
penetration testing at the end after the

629
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,840
release testing you know

630
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,880
running apps whatever you can do um

631
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,440
and then adhering adherence to security

632
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,559
development process

633
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,679
is really the key the companies fail

634
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,240
where

635
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,600
they implement everything and then

636
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,520
nobody follows so you've got to make

637
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,960
sure that it's being followed you're

638
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,000
tracking it

639
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,240
using sd elements or some other tools

640
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,520
like that

641
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,600
and have a program which is constantly

642
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,360
monitoring it

643
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,400
um so that's all i have today and i

644
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,240
think we are right in time i don't know

645
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,360
if you have time for q

646
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,320
a at this point

647
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:08,400
you guys tell me

648
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,840
so uh uh i have a question um

649
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,880
yes you have been leading security

650
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,159
for uh decades and uh

651
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,360
at intel so so you know uh

652
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,400
tell me uh from your experience

653
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,960
what are like the top three things that

654
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,320
you feel

655
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,240
are the most important uh things uh

656
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,520
that any um you can say medium or

657
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,360
small-scale enterprise

658
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,520
should you know watch out for that do

659
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,760
not have large budgets uh

660
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,120
to really secure uh their systems

661
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,039
but you know the key critical things

662
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,840
that they should have you

663
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,960
um yeah so i think uh

664
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,080
first of all a training just for all of

665
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,440
the you know i mean there are

666
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,919
a lot of open source trainings as well

667
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:00,720
so

668
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
for the small companies even for

669
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,120
startups in fact my son has a startup

670
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,400
so i advise him quite a bit um so what

671
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,240
you do is you want to get

672
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,320
free software free training as much as

673
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,000
possible definitely

674
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,279
because you don't have a budget you

675
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,400
don't have enough budget to buy and

676
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,559
they're very expensive i agree

677
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,799
but there's enough uh information out

678
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,880
there that you can get

679
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,360
and you can you know the top ten ish you

680
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,720
know ways of

681
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,520
managing your security through your open

682
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,159
source

683
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,360
uh you know uh sites websites

684
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
that you can do you know oh wasp is one

685
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,200
of them right i'm a member of

686
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,919
us and oha's top 10 is something pretty

687
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,200
much everybody that's like all the

688
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,320
people who

689
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,159
you know develop apps for apple for

690
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,320
example they go through that list

691
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,880
um so that's one i mean this is

692
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
something minimum you've got to do

693
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,840
is check out our wasp site get the those

694
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,120
bugs out and they're

695
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,200
very good in describing what exactly

696
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,559
you're looking for actually it's like

697
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,919
doing a code review and then

698
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,279
implementing it

699
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,320
uh so do that then in terms of training

700
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,520
there are some

701
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,919
trainings available online that you can

702
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:08,799
take like

703
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,159
you know um basic training you know for

704
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,520
uh for your mail emails for example

705
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,480
right

706
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,720
uh how do you tackle those you know what

707
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,559
kind of things spoofing you know things

708
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,520
like that you have to

709
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,760
look for so i think some of those basic

710
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,760
trainings are available that you should

711
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,200
deploy and cheaper is fine you know as

712
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,840
long as

713
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,000
at least something is happening and then

714
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,039
the third thing is

715
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,679
you know try to make sure that your

716
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,200
infrastructure is secure

717
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,880
you know when you develop you won't

718
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,240
think about the software product that

719
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,520
you're releasing but what about the

720
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,240
infrastructure

721
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,120
you are using you know the i.t part of

722
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,000
the

723
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,840
company so to speak you know what

724
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,600
networks you're using what clouds you're

725
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,159
using

726
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,799
in your desktops all of those need to be

727
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,080
secure you know at least

728
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,720
spend a little bit of money on firewall

729
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,960
i think that's kind of the basic thing i

730
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,679
would say

731
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,080
somebody should think about securing

732
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
infrastructure securing your software

733
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,760
and getting people to have securely

734
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,760
mindset by training

735
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,480
any more questions thank you are the q a

736
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,120
sections

737
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,959
uh here can i ask those questions

738
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,520
yes please yeah so one of the questions

739
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,600
are are there any specific audit

740
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,240
agencies like iso for security

741
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,600
oh hi there are many uh

742
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
in u.s at least uh you know there are

743
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,120
many uh

744
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,400
price pwc is one of the biggest one

745
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,559
price waterhouse we have used them um

746
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,279
so there are many out there i'm not sure

747
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,240
you know

748
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,559
uh in india what i'm sure they are doing

749
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,039
the similar things in india as well

750
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,840
um intel india for example i know i was

751
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,440
using pwc

752
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,960
so that's the first one that comes to my

753
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,120
mind

754
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,360
another question there or what are the

755
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,600
recently used security tools that a

756
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,480
professional

757
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,600
should be familiar with

758
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,960
should you be familiar with like okay so

759
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,880
we talked about tools right

760
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,120
different categories of tools so if

761
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,440
you're asking about the testing tools i

762
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,399
think

763
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,919
you know one of the first thing

764
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,600
everybody should know about clockwork or

765
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,480
clarity

766
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,799
or check marks one of these static

767
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,799
analysis and dynamic analysis tools are

768
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,480
very important

769
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,039
um and if you are into buzzing you know

770
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,720
because your software need requires

771
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,520
flooding

772
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,559
fuzzing essentially random input testing

773
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,240
um so fuzzing you can use like afl

774
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,559
open source is pretty good you know i

775
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,240
would say 90 percent of your issues

776
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,000
would be found by that

777
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
so i think those those are the ones and

778
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,880
then if you're doing web applications

779
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,679
um you know maybe burp suite for

780
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,000
penetration testing would be good

781
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,640
um you know sort of apps are generally

782
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,799
on the web on the internet

783
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,520
so i think that's a good one to do um

784
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,279
but if you're getting into network

785
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,159
you know then you know then wireshark

786
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:12,960
and

787
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,840
others come and call us and etc

788
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:31,840
security audits which must uh

789
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,080
which must have uh security audits

790
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,120
oh i see um

791
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,320
i think in general security audits go

792
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,279
after

793
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,320
whether you have sdl define your secure

794
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,480
development lifecycle are using sdl

795
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,640
that's where they start with then they

796
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,039
look into what tools you're using

797
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,320
and what kind of testing you're doing

798
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
and are you consistently doing it for

799
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,840
example if you're running clockwork or

800
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,000
poverty are you running it every night

801
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,720
you know regression testing and so they

802
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,640
look at that and then they look at your

803
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,600
results

804
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,880
it's not like they look at the

805
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,200
progression in it so it's not just like

806
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,799
okay we're using and you're done

807
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,039
check you know it's going to be that

808
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,240
you're going to have to show them the

809
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,039
outputs

810
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,279
of everything if you did a security

811
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,960
architecture review

812
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
was the proof the audit's always looking

813
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,799
for proof for everything

814
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,960
so that's you know these are some

815
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,159
minimum things that they're going to

816
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:36,799
look at

817
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,159
if you have done testing they're looking

818
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,320
at the testing results they randomly

819
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,080
might look at some of them

820
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,559
and they don't look at in your code to

821
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,080
see if you fixed it

822
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,840
that's one thing which is always missing

823
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,919
in audits i would say

824
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,640
but they're looking at the reports so

825
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,000
just by reports that okay

826
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,200
well you had you know 20 issues and now

827
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,880
you know two weeks later okay they're

828
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,480
all fixed you don't have any more issues

829
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,000
because your regression testing shows

830
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,720
your claim

831
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,039
right so things like that they're going

832
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,000
to look at

833
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,399
they also look at if their compliance

834
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,520
with um

835
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,480
you know isil standards and hipaa you

836
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,200
know depending on

837
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,960
where which um area you're in

838
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,120
uh so they will make sure that you're

839
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,640
following those standards and

840
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,840
meeting those standards

841
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,880
one more last question um you said that

842
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,399
when you started you had to build

843
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,320
security from scratch

844
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,440
so getting people to take security as a

845
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,000
major

846
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,960
con seriously is a constant challenge so

847
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,200
what motivated intel to take it

848
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,840
seriously

849
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,120
i think uh yeah i had to do a little bit

850
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,720
of selling

851
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,399
uh quite a bit of selling to the

852
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,320
management actually it's less

853
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,760
engineers than the management but um the

854
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,360
managers don't want to put their people

855
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,480
on security you know they have

856
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,159
development to do and they have released

857
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,399
to do and all that stuff so

858
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,399
you struggle constantly with the

859
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,320
development managers

860
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,399
you know that's where it starts and

861
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,559
that's why emphasize security training

862
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,919
is one of the thing when uh

863
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,760
krishna asked that question right what

864
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,679
are the three things

865
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,679
that you would tell any company so

866
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,320
training even though it sounds kind of

867
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,720
boring thing you know and it's not like

868
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,399
it's such a big tab oh i gotta do

869
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,320
training i gotta spend time

870
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,519
but you know we go to college don't we

871
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,640
we take our degrees don't we so

872
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,480
how did you get there you obviously did

873
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,919
get trained

874
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,000
that's how you are here so it's

875
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,360
important to train

876
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,960
people and people need to understand

877
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,880
this and that they have to have some

878
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,880
security understanding in order to

879
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,960
even find a buffer or flowing the code

880
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,000
right so

881
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,600
since i come from the kampala background

882
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,120
it was a little bit easier for me to

883
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
understand the importance of security

884
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,360
because i implemented these things you

885
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,320
know but

886
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,120
stack overflows were like big issues or

887
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,240
heap overflows of

888
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,120
big problems for me so i can i could

889
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
talk to people in that sense at that

890
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,360
level and say hey you don't really want

891
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,960
these bugs in your

892
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,720
code you know because first of all

893
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,480
you'll have functional issues as well as

894
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,679
security issues

895
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,519
when they when they can relate it to a

896
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,200
functional issue they get it very

897
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,240
quickly

898
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,399
so that's how i sort of started talking

899
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,960
to people and getting them to understand

900
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,679
um it's a lot of evangelizing you know

901
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,840
the importance of security to people

902
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,679
in all levels engineers

903
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,480
managers you know executives you know

904
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,200
you got to do all of that marketing

905
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,640
marketing doesn't get it they want to

906
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,320
ship the product who cares about the

907
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,159
security you know i gotta just get this

908
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,279
thing out there

909
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,080
for some conference or for some launch

910
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,000
you got to teach them too

911
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,720
so that's you know the training is

912
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,480
important and getting people to

913
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,159
understand the importance of security i

914
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,039
think

915
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,320
it starts at the you know the root level

916
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
and then getting people interested in

917
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,440
work on it

918
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,600
it's not that hard what you do is you

919
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,519
demo a couple of hacks

920
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,519
and then everybody wants to find oh

921
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,519
somebody hacked my code you know

922
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,720
so that's the most easy way to convince

923
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,080
somebody and then they know yeah i want

924
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,679
to do this i want to figure out how this

925
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,720
happened

926
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,399
okay you know one of the conferences

927
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,000
here is black hat

928
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,919
which also has defcon i don't know if

929
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,120
you heard of it

930
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,240
but defcon is basically that a lot of

931
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,600
hacking you know seminars and booths and

932
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,200
people just go and learn there

933
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,039
that's how those conferences got popular

934
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,559
and so many people work on this kind of

935
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,760
stuff now

936
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,440
um but my message to women

937
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,320
we need more women working on security

938
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,080
is really important

939
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,679
and i have sent um you know some uh

940
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,240
outlines uh and some statements to i

941
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,360
think it was

942
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,880
one of you but i think the important

943
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,960
thing is that women can do anything

944
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,240
you know and they have a really good

945
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,720
focus good eyes to find things

946
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,880
i think it's really important that they

947
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,240
become good hackers

948
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,799
you know not the sort of the black

949
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,720
hackers or black head hackers but

950
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,480
good hackers you know who can find white

951
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,359
hat hackers what we call them here

952
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,359
so that's important and i encourage you

953
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,879
you know women out there

954
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,760
who are watching please you know if you

955
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,040
already are in security

956
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,839
great you know improve your knowledge if

957
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:22,639
you

958
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,560
don't have security background you're an

959
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,960
engineer or i.t person

960
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
you know get into it get get some

961
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,960
training just go google some or go to

962
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,599
obas

963
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,918
you know i told you that already was

964
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:34,800
website

965
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
really has a lot of information you can

966
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,320
start poking at it

967
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,440
github has so many stuff so many things

968
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,119
on security so many

969
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,560
little things you know people have

970
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,280
released all these open source tools

971
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,199
there is some github right

972
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,639
afl and i don't know um

973
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,040
was that a fuzzing lop and then a whole

974
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,159
bunch of things

975
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,640
i mean i i don't go and code anymore but

976
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,320
and it fascinates me you know if i go to

977
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,000
github and i see all this kind of stuff

978
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,320
out there i'm like wow so there's a lot

979
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,720
of things you know you guys can find

980
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,760
and you just need motivation you know so

981
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,520
self-motivated get into it

982
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,240
thank you honestly honestly it's been a

pleasure hearing you pour in your

984
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,760
knowledge about software security

985
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,359
including the different tools and

986
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,040
indicators and also giving us

987
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,359
a tada framework on constructing a

988
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,200
successful security program

989
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,119
um seriously thank you so much for such

990
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,160
