1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,439
right what are the kind of demand

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,120
drivers what

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,600
innovation areas are being prioritized

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,279
both by startups and the large

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,400
global industry members and where do we

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,440
see in terms of innovation what kind of

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,239
technology stack is getting adopted how

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,320
more and more cyber security whether it

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,080
is services and products

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,519
are going the cloud native route so i'll

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:23,840
be

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,800
essentially talking more about what is

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,039
the trend that we are seeing in terms of

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,000
demand for cyber

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,040
security and the innovation ecosystem

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,800
that is getting built up

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,960
the first thing i would like to start

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,160
with uh

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,719
i'm being very modest in what i'm saying

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,600
that india

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,760
has emerged as a global hub for cyber

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,640
security

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,559
it's not just the premier academic

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,760
institutions who are

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,360
doing a lot of research a huge pipeline

26
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,719
of phd

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,079
candidates and you know mte candidates

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,079
but there are three industry

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,000
constituents who have

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
made india into a global app for cyber

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,319
security in the last three to four years

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,080
it was almost in 2015-16 we had uh some

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,240
nascom and dhci had something called as

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,320
a cybersecurity task force

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,720
where we took on a mission and a goal to

36
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,400
make india a global hub for cyber

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,240
security it was not at that point of

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,799
time

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,720
in fact uh professor krishna sri was

40
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,840
engaged with us

41
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,320
when we tried to visit some other global

42
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,240
geographies where a lot of

43
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,720
cyber security clusters were developed

44
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,960
whether it was in hague in israel

45
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,360
in the uk in london and of course in

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,960
some locations in the us

47
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,640
she had joined us in a couple of those

48
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,720
locations so

49
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,759
what is driving this attention to india

50
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,960
as a cyber security provider one

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
is the global services industry which

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,560
all of us know

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,600
it's already you know pretty much

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,960
the global hub for it in addition to

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,520
that

56
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,079
in the last four five years we have seen

57
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,079
cyber security from the services

58
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,759
industry all the indian and the global

59
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,040
services companies

60
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,000
which operate of india for example they

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,719
moved

62
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,758
uh their revenues in such a way that we

63
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,720
are almost

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,360
at you know 4.3 billion the 2020 number

65
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,720
will be coming up

66
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,200
and even the talent pool they are hiring

67
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,000
and

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,319
the number of global customers they are

69
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,360
servicing

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
the number of global socks they have

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,520
established in various geographies in

72
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,959
asia pacific you

73
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,760
europe middle east and in the us also

74
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,680
that's one driver that is making and

75
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,959
they're servicing

76
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,599
the world out of india from india and of

77
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,760
course in some of the global geographies

78
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,239
second is the cyber security product

79
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,360
landscape

80
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,920
what was extremely important is that the

81
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,280
cyber security product

82
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,319
landscapes uh the revenue was about

83
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,959
450 million in 2018 but it grew to 1

84
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,000
billion dollars by 2020 december

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,920
and some of the solutions that they're

86
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,280
working on is

87
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,959
whether it is in the next generation

88
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,959
security that we are seeing a lot in

89
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,879
terms of quantum crypto

90
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,280
we are seeing their growth in u.s middle

91
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,080
east and in

92
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,800
asia pacific similarly when you look at

93
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,640
the global corporations

94
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,080
uh there are a lot of global

95
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,440
corporations which were already

96
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,040
operating out of india for shared

97
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,640
services for analytics

98
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,120
but if you look at it now many of them

99
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,000
are actually

100
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,959
setting up cyber gcc's we call them as

101
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,080
global

102
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
competency centers which are setting up

103
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,440
cyber gcc's

104
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,000
and that footprint is growing in most

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,560
cities whether it's gurgaon

106
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,519
hyderabad pune bangalore these are some

107
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,040
of the locations where

108
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,760
they are really growing so if you look

109
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,159
at

110
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,799
globally why is cyber security getting

111
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,239
so much attention

112
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,120
because of which both academia startups

113
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,799
and large industry are beginning to

114
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,599
innovate and

115
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,560
build a lot of new products is because

116
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,720
particularly post covent

117
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,040
while we've had a lot of headwinds for

118
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,000
economy across

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,280
various verticals so many verticals

120
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,360
were really in the red because of the

121
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,720
lockdown but

122
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,280
what is import what is interesting to

123
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,319
note is

124
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,879
covid and the pandemic impact has

125
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,040
actually accelerated the adoption of

126
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,440
digital and online

127
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,759
and because of that the attention to

128
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,519
cyber security data protection and

129
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,320
privacy

130
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,280
has already been improved quite a bit

131
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,840
okay

132
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,160
and globally we are seeing that it can

133
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,880
be

134
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,520
you know at the end of 2020 itself it

135
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,919
was meant to be a 123 billion dollar

136
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,800
industry

137
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,080
because of which there will be

138
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,160
requirement for new talent pool

139
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,840
there will be requirement for new

140
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,080
products new services

141
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,320
new verticals that are getting opened up

142
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,560
for adoption of cyber because they are

143
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,400
going the digital route

144
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,880
and what we are seeing is that because

145
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,080
of the

146
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
work from home at scale that has

147
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,400
happened in india whether it's in the

148
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,440
iit industry

149
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,520
or in the banking and financial services

150
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,720
industry even

151
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,759
very critical you know

152
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,080
sectors like oil and gas lot of work was

153
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
opening from remote locations

154
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,039
so because of which we see that there

155
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,000
will be a

156
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,639
lot the threat landscape will only

157
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,520
increase

158
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,960
because of which there would be more

159
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,639
breaches and because of which there

160
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,400
would be more regulatory attention

161
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
consumer attention to the impact of the

162
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,720
breach because of which businesses

163
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,320
are going to invest they're going to

164
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,240
look for those new products and

165
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,680
technologies

166
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,120
and we are also seeing that because uh

167
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,400
post pandemic before i come to cyber

168
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,720
security the adoption of cloud if you

169
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,160
look at

170
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,479
market reports of the way the large

171
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,840
cloud providers

172
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,240
performed whether it is you know amazon

173
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,840
google microsoft

174
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,479
because of which while there is a cloud

175
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,520
adoption for

176
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,000
the overall i.t and digital there is

177
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,479
also a cloud adoption for security

178
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,240
more security services are being

179
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,160
delivered through the cloud

180
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,199
right the security products are being

181
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,639
hosted on the cloud

182
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,199
increasingly we are saying there is no

183
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,600
new product that is coming to the market

184
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,160
which is either not cloud ready and

185
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,800
mostly

186
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
new products are expected to be cloud

187
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,479
native that means they will only work on

188
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,120
the cloud

189
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,199
we are already seeing a lot of examples

190
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,720
of that globally and in

191
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,039
india why i am repeating that point is

192
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,360
if you are a young researcher

193
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,080
right or a phd student or i am thinking

194
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,199
of a product

195
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,360
you need to understand this trend of

196
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,039
where enterprise digital and

197
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,520
t is moving so that if you're thinking

198
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,880
of a new product

199
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,960
you need to look at a product which is

200
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,840
architected for the cloud

201
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,919
right so it is not a regular

202
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,520
it's not a regular business solution

203
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,840
now even if you're building a security

204
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,240
product for vulnerability management for

205
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,680
an iot device

206
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
or you're building a security product

207
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,759
for mobiles building a security product

208
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,479
for the cloud stack

209
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,039
or for ot security you need to be able

210
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:05,599
to

211
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,680
architect that solution which is likely

212
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
to be cloud-ready

213
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,520
right if you see i think way back in

214
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,800
beginning of 2020 or 2019 gartner had

215
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
predicted that

216
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,720
uh all new entrants into cyber security

217
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,639
which means all the new startups and new

218
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,319
companies which are building a product

219
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,280
for cyber

220
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,160
or any historic vendor who has built an

221
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,680
on-premise solution

222
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,319
is likely to build a new product which

223
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,440
is a cloud-based

224
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,080
subscription-based model and it is

225
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,000
extremely important that if you're a

226
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,960
researcher

227
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,360
you look at enterprise digital trends

228
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,319
i.t adoption trends before you think of

229
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,080
how are you going to build a security

230
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,639
product

231
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,759
because often we see a mismatch that the

232
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,400
i.t industry and the digital adoption of

233
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,479
a large enterprise is going one way

234
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,199
whereas new products are coming

235
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,039
according to the paradigm of the world

236
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:01,680
world

237
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,759
they're still trying to look at a

238
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,520
building a solution which is likely to

239
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,360
be on-prem i think it's extremely

240
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,240
important

241
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,280
you marry your research and innovation

242
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
intellect with what is the enterprise

243
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,479
idea option i often as i engage with

244
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,360
startups

245
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
we engaged from dhci with a lot of

246
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,199
academia and we engaged with

247
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,240
all the cios global cios and the large

248
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,440
enterprise cios there is a mismatch

249
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:27,919
where

250
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,240
enterprise is headed in terms of digital

251
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,159
and the new products that are coming up

252
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,159
where the new products are probably

253
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
you know still looking at the old

254
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,399
construct of how it was being done in

255
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,399
how city was being done on prem

256
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,240
that's why i'm spending this a little

257
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,720
bit of time we are also seeing a lot of

258
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,320
new products that means if you're a new

259
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,920
researcher you should look at some of

260
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,480
this

261
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,240
there's a lot around multi-factor

262
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
authentication because of

263
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,360
all that is happening in the payment

264
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
side even in terms of the user

265
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,279
authentication that is happening

266
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,720
thanks to this entire remote working

267
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,480
there's a lot around user entity

268
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,160
behavioral analytics

269
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,399
and when you do this user entity

270
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,000
behavior analytics can there be

271
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,120
a privacy preserving way or

272
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,240
you balance the demands of privacy with

273
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,080
the productivity requirements of your

274
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
workforce this is another one that we

275
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,040
are looking at

276
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,279
and of course everything to do with you

277
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,120
know the web application security

278
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,839
because

279
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,000
why that is important now i think vaf

280
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,519
was always important

281
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,680
why it is now getting increasingly more

282
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,200
important is because

283
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,880
more critical enterprise

284
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,160
workloads are moving to the cloud right

285
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,480
they're moving on to the web whether it

286
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,320
is in the healthcare domain in the man

287
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,360
in the

288
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,839
you know e-commerce domain edutech

289
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,480
domain

290
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,800
how much education has gone virtual

291
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,360
online so as more applications

292
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,240
move online workloads are moving to the

293
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,880
cloud

294
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,800
you know the web application security

295
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,000
and all of that is

296
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,080
becoming very important we are beginning

297
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,160
to see a lot of new cyber security

298
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,440
frameworks coming

299
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
whether it is in the zero trust network

300
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,959
architecture zero test

301
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,120
this karta from gartner and in the

302
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,720
active defense there are a lot of them

303
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
that are coming up

304
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,360
and when people are building those

305
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,000
products or enterprises are looking at

306
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,680
what they need to do these frameworks so

307
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,040
there's a lot of csos

308
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,880
cios who are looking at all these new

309
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,440
frameworks that are coming up

310
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,360
so globally what we are seeing is um

311
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
there is an increased digital adoption

312
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,440
particularly in india because we can

313
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,240
look at it

314
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,320
we are seeing so much digital happening

315
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,000
even in laggard domains

316
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,920
whether it is in small and medium

317
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,360
manufacturing whether it is in

318
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,680
healthcare i think itits

319
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,839
large banking insurance telecom they

320
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,560
were always leaders in it right

321
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,279
and what we are seeing now is there's a

322
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,240
lot of focus around itot integration

323
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,360
because of which as ot networks get

324
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,240
opened up

325
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,120
you know even the validity of our uh

326
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
you know confidence in air gap networks

327
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,800
is getting test

328
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
is getting challenged now because there

329
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,240
is new research to prove

330
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,200
that uh it may not be adequate enough in

331
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,399
the current scenario

332
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,240
there's so much of remote monitoring

333
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,440
that is happening

334
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,480
on ip networks or on the internet for

335
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,440
uh ot networks they're getting opened up

336
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,720
there is a lot of

337
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,800
uh new devices which are getting

338
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,720
integrated for monitoring with the ot

339
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,600
networks

340
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,680
right and similarly the entire industry

341
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,240
4.0 we've seen a lot of this

342
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,040
in the auto manufacturing sector of

343
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,920
course

344
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
in europe and in germany we have seen

345
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,040
this across all

346
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,279
whereas in india if you look walk into

347
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,399
any new plant

348
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,640
whether it's in the auto sector or large

349
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
consumer appliances which are man

350
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,519
manufacturing

351
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,760
large consumer implies we are seeing an

352
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,120
increased wave of

353
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,240
iiot or industrial 4.0 broadly as it is

354
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,959
called

355
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,839
and increased attention to enterprise

356
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,680
workloads moving to the cloud

357
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
and end user computing moving to the

358
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,040
edge right

359
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,680
because of this workflow so when you com

360
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,079
when you combine these two things off

361
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,480
all that is moving to the edge yeah

362
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,720
maybe beyond the enterprise network

363
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,800
and all the mission critical workloads

364
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,240
that is moving to the cloud

365
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,959
it creates a completely new threat

366
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:19,760
landscape

367
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,200
and creates a completely new demand for

368
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,760
security services and products and i

369
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,200
don't need to repeat this

370
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,839
there is also a wave of consumer demand

371
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,279
right whether it is because of

372
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,120
contactless payments consumers have

373
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,440
adopted contact contactless payments

374
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,760
across the world in india you all of us

375
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,720
are familiar

376
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,800
whether it's because of upi and all the

377
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,959
new instrument contactless has

378
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,560
become so big the entire qr code based

379
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,279
payment i mean the kind of momentum that

380
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,800
has happened in one year

381
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,320
i'm sure you will agree there is a lot

382
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,160
of demand because of that for

383
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,839
both data protection and for cyber

384
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,160
security we are also seeing

385
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,800
uh several use of sectors whether it's

386
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,920
health and fitness

387
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,399
education and of course entertainment

388
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,279
how much

389
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,399
every indian is consuming content online

390
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,920
whether it's content in the area of

391
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,320
entertainment movies tv shows

392
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,720
because of which we see this then there

393
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,519
is an

394
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,760
entire thing of talent pool there is a

395
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,519
huge shortage there are enough and more

396
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,959
reports i don't want to do

397
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,279
scare mongering on that in terms of the

398
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,320
talent pool

399
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,600
uh demand supply gaps across

400
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,920
various vertical specialists application

401
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,000
security people infrastructure security

402
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,560
people uh cloud security right there's

403
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,160
all of this demanding

404
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,880
and another important thing to remember

405
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,600
is

406
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,040
by 2025 75 of

407
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,000
the workforce will be the millennials

408
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,920
now the biggest challenge is every

409
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,839
millennial has an option of where they

410
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:52,959
want to go

411
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,880
right there is so much that is happening

412
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,560
on the digital side there is so much

413
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,079
that is happening on the health care

414
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:58,959
side

415
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,320
how do you attract and motivate

416
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,120
a young engineer an angle or law

417
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,720
professional or an

418
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,880
management graduate young researcher

419
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,639
into the cyber security demand

420
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,800
because in india we have seen that when

421
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
you look at the engineering workforce

422
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,440
that comes out 70 80 percent of them are

423
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,000
going into the regular ito digital

424
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,120
very few are getting drawn into cyber

425
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,320
so i will say that even efforts that

426
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,839
need to be made to evangelize cyber

427
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,639
security as

428
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,680
a nice career to adopt whether it's in

429
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
young women or young men coming out of

430
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,560
colleges

431
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,399
is not a trivial problem that the

432
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,760
country has to solve

433
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,600
every country has to solve i think we

434
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,360
have a bigger problem because

435
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,600
we have a bigger demand supply short gap

436
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,399
because

437
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,720
we are hiring security professionals not

438
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,920
just for india

439
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,959
we are hiring security professionals for

440
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,040
this i.t services and product industry

441
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,120
which is servicing almost 80 to 90

442
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,000
countries

443
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,160
because of the way our services industry

444
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,399
is similarly we are seeing

445
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,240
that in india particularly bfsi itits

446
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,560
are some of the largest verticals but in

447
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,519
future

448
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,040
i think travel hospitality uh

449
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,440
even you know healthcare might have to

450
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,959
adopt a lot

451
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,639
another thing that we are seeing in the

452
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,480
breaches when you look at any of the new

453
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,519
breaches

454
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,079
we've had some reporting of some

455
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,839
breaches in the financial services or

456
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,120
payment industry

457
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,600
or globally in the healthcare industry i

458
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,320
think

459
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,880
sensitive and personally identified

460
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,079
information

461
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,920
and their breaches is creating a lot of

462
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,240
you know impact for the enterprise not

463
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,199
because of

464
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,600
uh the downtime to the business and the

465
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,079
loss of business but also because of the

466
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,560
regulations that have come up where any

467
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,759
data breach

468
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,360
is heavily fined eu gdpr has set that

469
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,079
example

470
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,480
even in india we have seen reserve bank

471
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,120
of india

472
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,040
imposing fines on some banks where a

473
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,639
breach has happened and a breach was not

474
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,519
reported

475
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,000
right so similarly we are seeing in

476
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,040
terms of

477
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,440
cloud right when um

478
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,839
some workload moves into the cloud it

479
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,920
has not been architected for the cloud

480
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,160
it has not been tested for the cloud

481
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,120
some misconfigurations or the

482
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,000
application

483
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,120
not designed for the cloud creating some

484
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,800
potential breaches

485
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,320
and similarly we see that business cost

486
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,399
there is a lot of business cost and

487
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,000
business cost could be because of

488
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,759
consumer trust

489
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,240
or regulators attention or sometimes it

490
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,759
is also in terms of the fines

491
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,040
in terms of the indian cyber security

492
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,959
landscape i'm just giving you a little

493
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,160
bit and then i'll

494
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,399
drill down a little more on what is the

495
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,240
kind of innovation ecosystem that is

496
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,040
happening

497
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,639
right uh we believe that uh

498
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,440
in terms of the india market india

499
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,800
domestic market

500
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,880
we believe that it will be almost 3

501
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,120
billion by 2022.

502
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,799
the two verticals that are going is

503
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,720
obviously the product ecosystem

504
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,640
which i already told you move to 1

505
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,559
billion in 2020

506
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,199
and services and when i say services it

507
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,720
is not just services

508
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,880
companies which are servicing india

509
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
market but it is also companies which

510
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,000
are servicing

511
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,959
the global markets right so it's almost

512
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:23,439
uh

513
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,839
5.2 billion and it is expected to most

514
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,720
importantly

515
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,960
they're one of the largest hires of

516
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,720
cyber security talent

517
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,640
some of the key products that are in

518
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,039
demand in large enterprises worldwide

519
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,760
and large enterprises in india are

520
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,840
around i already talked about whether it

521
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,919
is in identity access management and

522
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,520
point detection

523
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,760
and response zero trust network

524
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,880
architecture

525
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,360
uh particularly zero trust network

526
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,039
architecture for

527
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,400
applications for networks for workloads

528
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,280
right for users all of that has taken a

529
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,840
lot of

530
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,799
momentum in the last one year postponed

531
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,679
and the entire itu and ot security and

532
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,960
user entity

533
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,400
why this is important for you is that

534
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,679
i think the future demand will not be

535
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,760
for generalists that you can do

536
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,360
network security or you can do

537
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,600
application security i think the future

538
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,520
demand for roles will be

539
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,480
a little more specialized so that as you

540
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,919
complete your engineering as you

541
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,360
complete your m tech

542
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,440
and you are looking at a career in cyber

543
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
security it's extremely important you

544
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,720
look at

545
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,640
what is the technology trends and

546
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
adoption and future adoption that is

547
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,520
going to drive

548
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,120
so that you build that area of

549
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,600
specialization from that perspective i

550
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,280
wanted to highlight this point for this

551
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,679
audience which has a lot of students

552
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,400
so in terms of the innovation ecosystem

553
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,240
globally we see this we are beginning to

554
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,840
see this a lot in india

555
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,919
with the kind of product companies that

556
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,039
have come into the

557
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,720
market and the number of startups that

558
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,240
have come into the market

559
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,600
is i think the security operations

560
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,200
centers

561
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,520
i mean i think now a large enterprise

562
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,120
having a security operation

563
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,760
center is almost like a hygiene factor

564
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,360
it's similar to the way you know three

565
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,280
years back or ten years back everybody

566
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,400
had a data center

567
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,679
right i don't think there was any

568
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,600
enterprise id which did not have a data

569
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,320
center

570
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,240
right similarly now every large

571
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,919
enterprise has a security operation

572
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,559
center

573
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,640
but now they're getting augmented

574
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,880
through a lot of new general solutions

575
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,840
whether it is this entire security

576
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,880
orchestration and

577
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,039
the soar technologies that are coming up

578
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,360
similarly we are beginning to see

579
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,080
a lot of cyber fusion centers and cyber

580
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,000
different centers that are coming up and

581
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,200
what is interesting is

582
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,520
several of our industry members run

583
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,559
these centers

584
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,200
out of india for their global customers

585
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,880
they're servicing the global customers

586
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,679
out of india

587
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,120
and some of these centers are there

588
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,840
either in hyderabad or in chennai or in

589
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,760
bangalore or any one of these cities

590
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,640
right for the entire threat hunting and

591
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,480
the threat intelligence team

592
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,000
similarly there's a lot around ai and ml

593
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,159
all of us are familiar with this but

594
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,559
increasingly we are seeing a lot of aiml

595
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,679
integration

596
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,919
for uh the user entity behavior

597
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,000
analytics this is a new area that is

598
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,520
coming up to see

599
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,080
particularly to see what is the

600
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,919
behavioral patterns

601
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,360
to be able to identify insider risk

602
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,840
right and sometimes this insider risk

603
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,039
would be just

604
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,080
uh not a properly trained

605
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,440
employee or it could be a motivated uh

606
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,600
employee trying to create a breach right

607
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,679
so that we are seeing a lot of that

608
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,919
similarly in the area of you know the

609
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:38,960
entire

610
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,679
end point detection and response and

611
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,799
machine

612
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,720
learning that is getting integrated into

613
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,000
a lot of the stack

614
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,880
for predictive analytics similarly if

615
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,000
you see

616
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,480
i talked about it in uh even five ten

617
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,520
minutes back

618
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,000
about how cyber security services

619
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,280
delivery model

620
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,120
is moving from on-site to online

621
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,280
previously cyber security professionals

622
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,120
if an enterprise had a sock

623
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,520
there were those 40 50 of them running

624
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,320
that sock in various shifts 24x7

625
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,120
whereas now socks are being set up and

626
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,000
they're being

627
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,880
managed virtually remotely from using

628
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,520
online

629
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,320
right so we are beginning to see not

630
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
only security products

631
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,360
being delivered on the cloud and

632
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,960
consumed from the cloud

633
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,799
we are being we are seeing a lot of

634
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,799
services that are moving to the cloud

635
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,159
whenever we talk to

636
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,559
the cyber security pro practice of all

637
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,320
our industry members in india

638
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
this is the biggest trend that we are

639
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,640
seeing similarly we see

640
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,440
a lot given the way the pandemic has

641
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,080
panned out

642
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,600
and probably going to extend for some

643
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,760
more time we are beginning to see a lot

644
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,039
of focus around

645
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,159
remote working uh solutions work from

646
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,280
home solutions

647
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,840
and security around that and and around

648
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,679
the mobile device management we actually

649
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,159
brought

650
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,320
out a report on all the work from home

651
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,840
solutions you can look it up on our

652
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,760
website the national coe team brought

653
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,720
out on that

654
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,799
and the amount of innovation that is

655
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,840
happening on

656
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,240
remote working solutions because people

657
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,559
are working from anywhere from home

658
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,039
you can even work from your garden right

659
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,200
so there is a lot of innovation that is

660
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,960
happening both from the global companies

661
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,400
and the indian startups

662
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,919
particularly how can you look at secure

663
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,200
access

664
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,760
and the entire focus around devices

665
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,360
moving to the edge

666
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,000
similarly i think there's a lot of focus

667
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,360
i hope academia will

668
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,520
give lot more attention to this as

669
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,200
they're building their curriculum and

670
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,000
their faculty

671
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,720
development so that every young student

672
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,880
can be taught around this in terms of

673
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,840
the architecture practices of you know

674
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,679
security by design

675
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,880
how do you it has taken every iit

676
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,120
industry member a long time to even move

677
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,080
to devops

678
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,320
right how do you move to the devsec ops

679
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,559
so that security shifts left

680
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,880
and you start looking at it from from

681
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,080
right from upfront

682
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,679
when you're thinking of a product of a

683
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,360
service rather than you build a product

684
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,480
and then you test it

685
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,760
and then you realize there are these

686
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,679
vulnerabilities let me go fix them

687
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,360
i think that's not going to work anymore

688
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,000
because the go-to-market timelines of a

689
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,440
product development

690
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,360
even if it is developed by academy or

691
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,480
industry keeps

692
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,240
is coming down everybody wants to be

693
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
able to take the product to the market

694
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
and the shortest time cycle for which

695
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
i think security by design is extremely

696
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,400
important also privacy by design but

697
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,280
since this is a security

698
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,679
you know conference i'm focusing on that

699
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,000
similarly i think increasingly there's a

700
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,200
focus on

701
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,600
open standards and open architecture

702
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,480
because when you

703
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,880
are building when when a startup or a

704
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,200
researcher is building a product

705
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,880
i don't think that product is going to

706
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,320
be consumed in isolation by a business

707
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,120
the product typically needs to integrate

708
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,600
into

709
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,919
the enterprise securities track deployed

710
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,200
by that enterprise

711
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,279
or that business or a bank or a telecom

712
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,440
right it's not like they're going to

713
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,840
develop a consumer product if i run a

714
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,720
startup and

715
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,679
process from the academia that my

716
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,640
startup product

717
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,559
and the academia solution is going to be

718
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,400
consumed in isolation it's going to be

719
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,360
consumed

720
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
along with the rest of the enterprise

721
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,640
security stack

722
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,919
that that business has um

723
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,640
you know deployed to run their digital

724
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,679
infrastructure

725
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,840
to be able to do that it's extremely

726
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,799
important that

727
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,799
new products are built using open

728
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,880
standards and open architecture

729
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,960
and how do you go ahead and integrate

730
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
with the cloud platforms integrate with

731
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,760
the

732
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,000
you know security incident management

733
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,360
platforms they would have already

734
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:41,919
deployed

735
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,840
this is extremely important and there's

736
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,279
a lot of focus around

737
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,440
zero trust network architecture it's no

738
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,880
longer a buzzword

739
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,679
almost every cso is talking about it

740
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,279
every cso has

741
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,840
either already started evaluating or

742
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,360
already started deploying

743
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,159
or definitely i think 2021 calendar year

744
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,520
is a priority for them

745
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,760
particularly zero trust in terms of user

746
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,039
access network

747
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,520
and devices i think these are the things

748
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,720
going forward

749
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,880
zero trust for applications and

750
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,919
workloads also

751
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,600
should be happening okay so in terms of

752
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,039
uh if you do a scan of the innovation

753
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,159
ecosystem that is happening in india

754
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,080
i talked about those 175 or 180 startups

755
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,640
that are building not not all of them

756
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,480
are early stage some of them are already

757
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,159
five years and 10 years old

758
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,039
who are building products out of india i

759
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:35,600
think we

760
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,640
see they're all getting you know

761
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,200
clustered into these five domains

762
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,679
identity access management there's a lot

763
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,679
of focus because every enterprise

764
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,760
every large government department is

765
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
giving a lot of focus on that

766
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,200
yeah and data security because of

767
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,120
all the regulations around privacy that

768
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,240
are coming up

769
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,000
and threatened vulnerability management

770
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,039
and broadly around email security

771
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,279
self-healing self-feeling of network

772
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,480
self-feeling of

773
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,960
application security vulnerabilities

774
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,640
cryptography is gaining a lot of

775
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,600
attention while

776
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,480
of course cryptography has you know very

777
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,520
severe uh

778
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,960
you know has niche use cases

779
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
compared to others but there is lot we

780
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,000
are beginning to see

781
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,919
a lot of it is happening in academia and

782
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,559
public sector research labs and a few

783
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,960
select startups are also working on that

784
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,720
and broadly around

785
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,360
how do you secure your remote access

786
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,320
because

787
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,640
every large company whom you're talking

788
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,720
to at least in the iit industry and

789
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,679
in telecom and others i think while the

790
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,320
work from home at scale

791
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,760
might get reduced as the pandemic

792
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,400
you know problem is completely solved

793
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,960
right

794
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,720
at some point of time i don't know when

795
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,080
that will happen

796
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,480
but i think given the learnings and

797
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,279
experience

798
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,000
from the last one years operations and

799
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,799
its success and its past organization

800
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,600
its ability to attract talent from

801
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,000
remote

802
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,400
locations i think there will be an

803
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,440
increased

804
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,400
work from home kind of a next scenario

805
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,320
maybe a part of your workforce will work

806
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,000
from offices and part of your workforce

807
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,120
will work from that

808
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,520
because of which all these solutions

809
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,240
around

810
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,399
whether it is a cloud access security

811
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,240
whether it is in terms of

812
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,480
how do you make sure that when you are

813
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,919
on boarding a device

814
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,320
right when an employee's laptop is

815
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,159
onboarded onto the network

816
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,000
there was no challenge because a laptop

817
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,600
used to come to office

818
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,679
that it was an office given laptop it

819
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,159
was a certain way in which the laptop

820
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,159
was configured or locked down

821
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,159
so it was all taken care of whereas now

822
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,399
a device is getting onboarded onto an

823
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,600
enterprise network

824
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,840
to do whatever the other employee is

825
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,880
supposed to do

826
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,440
from home and some home devices may also

827
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,880
be getting onto the network

828
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,120
so how do you onboard devices in a

829
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,440
secure way and what all we need to do

830
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,000
similarly there's a lot around the

831
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,720
perimeter

832
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,480
and defining the perimeter and can

833
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
blockchain and you know distributed

834
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,559
ledger technologies be used for that

835
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,080
so we are seeing a lot of innovation in

836
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,960
the product ecosystem globally and in

837
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,679
india

838
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,760
around the secure remote taxes you will

839
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,159
see a totally new leak of products

840
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,840
and of course in threatened

841
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,520
vulnerability management

842
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,440
there's a lot of focus but if we are

843
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,960
beginning to see

844
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,480
a lot of focus now in terms of deception

845
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,279
in terms of threat hunting and in terms

846
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,559
of data security one

847
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,720
area that you will see i would urge all

848
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,080
of you all to look at

849
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,279
i think security as an area for

850
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,039
innovation and product development is

851
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,000
now known is known

852
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,399
in academia is not an industry but

853
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,720
privacy as an opportunity area for

854
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,000
technology development

855
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,720
is still not picked up so much in india

856
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,480
there are a few startups who are

857
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,320
working on technology solutions for

858
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,760
privacy uh there is a

859
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,600
you know privacy technology landscape

860
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,960
report that iapp

861
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,440
brings up you should look at what are

862
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,600
the technology innovation areas in

863
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
privacy the number of new companies that

864
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,799
have come up in that

865
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,640
because you're beginning to see a lot of

866
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,480
focus around that not because of just

867
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,440
regulator

868
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,520
but the consumer attention to privacy

869
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,720
preservation

870
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,960
uh regulators this thing even the

871
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,120
enterprise is trying to say that

872
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,679
they they're giving enough attention to

873
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:26,480
privacy

874
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,320
in terms of whether it is in the area of

875
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,120
rights management in the area of

876
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,520
using encryption technologies so that

877
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,600
there can be enough privacy preservation

878
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,480
when you're

879
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,200
you know doing something on the wire so

880
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,120
we are beginning to these five this

881
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,720
and lenny will leave the slides you can

882
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,320
look at it right

883
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
so similarly in terms of technology

884
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,000
innovation

885
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,960
uh some trends that we are seeing is

886
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,559
typically in cyber security in the past

887
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,200
there's product development there's some

888
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,640
research in academia

889
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,240
and government is doing something else

890
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,480
they used to work in isolation

891
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,679
whereas across various countries now

892
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,520
and in india we are beginning to see

893
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,039
this there is

894
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,880
a little more harmonized there's still a

895
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,080
lot more to be done

896
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,840
little more harmonizing that is

897
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,120
happening where

898
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,799
industry is beginning to collaborate

899
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,880
with academy or academia is trying to

900
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,480
collaborate with startups

901
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,159
several academic institutions have

902
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,480
incubated security startups

903
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,399
whether it's in the iit's whether it's

904
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,840
in amrita

905
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,240
or even in the a lot of the new private

906
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,279
universities

907
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,360
so academic collaboration we still need

908
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,399
to do more

909
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,440
that means and professor was

910
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,840
done a fundamental research probably as

911
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,640
an ip

912
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,799
he's now saying can i work with this

913
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,880
startup in my incubator or in some other

914
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,559
incubator we're beginning to see that

915
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,399
is there enough of that happening i

916
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,840
would still say a lot more needs to

917
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,640
happen

918
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,880
another interesting area we have seen in

919
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,000
india in the last two

920
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,840
three years is large user enterprises

921
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,960
particularly banks and maybe

922
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,159
some telecom companies who are

923
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,440
partnering with a security startup

924
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,519
for co-creation of a product this is a

925
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,519
very interesting trend we are seeing

926
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,320
where

927
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,519
the uh use cases

928
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,320
and the requirement of a new white space

929
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,760
on which you can innovate

930
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,399
is coming from a user organization and

931
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,000
they are not saying now i am going to

932
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,600
develop it in house because it is not

933
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,760
the job of a large bank or a telecom to

934
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,559
build a product

935
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,880
security product in house they are

936
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,480
saying this is my use case

937
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,279
inviting 10 15 startups trying to match

938
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,440
their competencies with the use case

939
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,679
taking a couple of two startups asking

940
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,360
them to work out of their office and

941
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,360
even giving them some funding sometimes

942
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,200
we need to see more of this happen and

943
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,960
i'm sure there will be more such

944
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,799
co-creation opportunities

945
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,559
another interesting thing we are seeing

946
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,440
in security product innovation in india

947
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,000
is

948
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,399
large system integrators you know the

949
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,279
large

950
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,320
services companies out of india globally

951
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,919
we have seen that whether it's ibm

952
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,519
accenture we are seeing that in india

953
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,799
now infrastructure

954
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,440
tcs all tech mahindra these kind of

955
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,240
companies

956
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,480
trying to partner wanting to partner

957
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,519
with startups

958
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,880
not just by investment and funding but

959
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,720
build a product and jointly go to the

960
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,960
market and take that startups product to

961
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,480
the global markets we're beginning to

962
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,039
see this

963
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,640
and of course several government bodies

964
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,960
like cdac and others do collaborate

965
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,799
and there is also an effort to be able

966
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,399
to do a technology transport

967
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,480
so why am i i'm trying to give this

968
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,840
landscape is that

969
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,000
we are moving in the right direction to

970
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,120
be able to

971
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,279
improve the innovation ecosystem out of

972
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,240
india so that

973
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,559
academia government large industry

974
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,360
players

975
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,080
and the small startups can collaborate

976
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,840
so that we can see more products out of

977
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,480
india

978
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,720
and in terms of technology adoption if i

979
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,360
look at those 180 product companies

980
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,039
what kind of security products they're

981
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,799
building many of them

982
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,679
are built for the cloud about 10 of them

983
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,640
are leveraging blockchain for example

984
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,360
the quantum and post quantum crypto

985
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,720
startups are very few

986
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,120
handful of them three percent of them

987
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,760
and yeah

988
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,159
ml of course almost everybody is using

989
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,519
them

990
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,919
and moving from signature based to

991
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,240
rule-based engines is another trend that

992
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,519
we are seeing

993
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,399
so broadly uh to be able to summarize

994
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,760
where we are seeing

995
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,919
adoption of emerging technologies for

996
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,840
cyber security product development

997
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,880
we are seeing aiml which is almost

998
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,480
you know the foundation in majority of

999
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,559
the products more than 75-80 percent of

1000
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,519
the products

1001
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,760
rpa is another thing remote robotic

1002
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,120
process automation

1003
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,000
and we are beginning to see rpa in a lot

1004
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,600
of the

1005
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,279
you know the threat mitigation

1006
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,960
technologies or in terms of data

1007
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,080
protection

1008
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,559
blockchain and distribution ledger is

1009
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,320
some new use cases we are beginning to

1010
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,080
see interesting use cases

1011
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,799
we have seen blockchain and all of that

1012
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,320
in e-governance applications and

1013
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,519
financial

1014
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,200
fintech applications but we are

1015
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,000
beginning to see them in other areas now

1016
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,519
and increasingly we will see a lot

1017
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,320
around

1018
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,639
this things moving to the edge and the

1019
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,399
software defined parameter

1020
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,679
broadly and cloud of course uh there's

1021
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,159
so many new startups in india which are

1022
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,239
working around

1023
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,119
various solutions around cloud security

1024
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,040
i mean some of them is focusing around

1025
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,560
infrastructure side some of them are

1026
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,000
focusing around application side

1027
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,040
okay and if you want to look at what

1028
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,639
would be the future

1029
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,440
i think emerging technologies whether

1030
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,040
it's aiml

1031
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,639
robotic process automation or blockchain

1032
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,520
increasingly being

1033
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,280
leveraged for new innovation in cyber

1034
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,159
we believe that all the discussions and

1035
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,199
deliberations

1036
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,280
and evangelization of zero trust has

1037
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,839
happened and now this year will pick up

1038
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:56,239
the

1039
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,359
way for adoption banking sector is

1040
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,240
talking a lot about it itits and telecom

1041
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,760
and its only a question of time and

1042
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,960
because of the work from home

1043
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,839
environment

1044
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,800
there is no way a cio or a cso cannot

1045
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,320
focus on this

1046
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,520
and uh several companies are saying that

1047
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,720
we are going to move towards the

1048
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,320
borderless workforce

1049
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,200
so many large it members are saying they

1050
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,480
will now

1051
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,359
have talent hired from tier 2 tier 3

1052
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,920
locations and not disturb them to come

1053
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,480
to a bangalore or a mumbai because of

1054
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,280
which i think this entire focus around

1055
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,480
uh the edge computing and in terms of

1056
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,040
how do you look at securing devices and

1057
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,240
users and

1058
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,760
you know this is an architecture

1059
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,680
paradigm that needs to change in the way

1060
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,000
in which

1061
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,240
you manage users and devices we're

1062
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,680
beginning to see that

1063
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,920
and uh i think there'll be a lot of

1064
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,800
focus around

1065
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,200
from government also how can we leverage

1066
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,839
ai

1067
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,000
while i think in the first two years

1068
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,760
three years the focus of government has

1069
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,560
been

1070
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,800
harnessing ai for social good in the

1071
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,839
area of

1072
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,800
uh healthcare or agri-tech now we are

1073
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,560
beginning to see a lot of focus around

1074
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,240
domains like cyber

1075
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,720
okay in terms of talent pool there's a

1076
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,320
huge shortage i will not

1077
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,359
really elaborate on this nascom and dhci

1078
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,520
is focused on a lot we have a concept of

1079
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,280
a sector skills council and a future

1080
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,720
skills platform

1081
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,119
we partner with government and academic

1082
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,160
institutions

1083
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,240
we've built a lot of job roles we'll be

1084
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,200
increasing

1085
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,440
government is doing a lot of training

1086
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,960
programs for

1087
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,599
government officers and for csos

1088
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,720
similarly

1089
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,520
we believe in the future where there

1090
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,000
would be

1091
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,520
lot more interest our current assessment

1092
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,119
please understand this assessment

1093
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,079
changes

1094
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,200
i think uh even in the

1095
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,680
you know the peak time of the pandemic

1096
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,839
between august to october when we did an

1097
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:52,640
analysis

1098
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,400
in india there were 63 000 published job

1099
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,000
roles in cyber

1100
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,400
between industry members right there may

1101
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,760
be some job roles which are not

1102
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,560
published because

1103
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,480
they're moving people in-house but the

1104
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,320
published external job roles

1105
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,880
were 63 000 and those job roles are

1106
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,960
spanning each of this whether it is

1107
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,520
in terms of foreign states whether it's

1108
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,280
independent penetration testing or pen

1109
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,640
testing

1110
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,680
iot security is a new one cloud security

1111
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,520
these are some of the job roles that we

1112
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,200
are seeing and

1113
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,880
advanced you know coding skills whether

1114
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,320
and in the areas of architecture

1115
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
where you're building solutions which

1116
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,680
are cloud native

1117
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,440
i think some of these will be some of

1118
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,880
the

1119
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,720
this is based on a survey that we have

1120
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,680
done with our security product companies

1121
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,599
they're saying that they're looking at

1122
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,440
more people who understand device

1123
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,119
drivers who understand

1124
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,400
you know the hardware design

1125
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,800
capabilities proficiency in cloud

1126
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,079
security that means

1127
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,280
whether it's aws is your google cloud

1128
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,880
because the products are being developed

1129
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,720
for deployment on the cloud

1130
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,240
these are some of the skills that are

1131
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,079
looking other than your basic software

1132
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,599
engineering and coding skills

1133
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,200
i think that's a hygiene factor in

1134
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,280
addition what are you looking at

1135
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,560
so broadly this is what i wanted to

1136
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,680
focus on in terms of where we are headed

1137
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,839
and i'm happy to take any questions my

1138
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,680
only i mean in closing i would like to

1139
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,320
say

1140
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,880
that any new security product

1141
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,040
innovation research in academy or

1142
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,400
industry

1143
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,320
and talent development efforts that

1144
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,680
happen in academia

1145
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,880
should be in line with where technology

1146
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,520
trends

1147
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,560
are headed both in the overall digital

1148
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,599
and in cyber security

1149
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,839
over time thank you so much ma'am wow

1150
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,040
you really

1151
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,680
made this a very immersive uh experience

1152
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,280
going through each of your slides and

1153
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,760
giving us a full overview this is the

1154
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,079
a talk that actually we needed to have

1155
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,920
perhaps in the first day to just get an

1156
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,280
understanding of

1157
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,440
uh you know where india is headed and

1158
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,359
there are several questions

1159
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,880
um so let's just i'll just quickly go

1160
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,000
over it in fact

1161
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,880
i wanted to you know assign an hour for

1162
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,000
you

1163
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,880
initially and then we cut it down to 45

1164
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,720
minutes which was i think not a good

1165
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,118
idea

1166
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,240
so i think the first question is ai and

1167
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,000
machine learning are considered a

1168
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,680
double-edged sword

1169
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,320
so means you can use it to enable or

1170
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,400
disable security and

1171
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,240
do you see any challenges in terms of

1172
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,640
really um

1173
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,560
attacking ai and machine learning do you

1174
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,079
see any challenges

1175
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,480
in terms of attacking ansible so i guess

1176
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,119
really

1177
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,760
the the it's it's still a very much gray

1178
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,440
area and you know how do you see this

1179
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,480
evolve ai and

1180
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,599
now yeah i mean i do understand that

1181
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,200
particularly when it comes to cyber

1182
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
security attacks

1183
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,720
aiml is being leveraged as much as it is

1184
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,480
being

1185
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,280
you know leveraged by the providers that

1186
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,079
is a challenge i think every technology

1187
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,400
has the dark side of technology as you

1188
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,040
call it

1189
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,800
we've seen that in nuclear we have seen

1190
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,640
that in biomedical we have seen that

1191
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,440
everywhere

1192
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,000
so ai has a lot of potential but

1193
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,319
unfortunately ai is also

1194
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,400
there has been an ethic side of ai and

1195
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,839
there is also a way where

1196
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,280
ai and ml is being leveraged to

1197
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,960
you know kick or launch

1198
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,599
big scale attacks in cyber so that cyber

1199
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,560
crime

1200
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,640
side and the vested interest of the

1201
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,920
cyber criminals from

1202
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,119
all kinds of actors from you know

1203
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,599
fun loving hackers to state actors they

1204
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,680
go all that spectrum yeah aiml is

1205
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,160
there is a dark side of every technology

1206
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,560
and i think it's a question of time but

1207
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,119
that doesn't mean that we will know the

1208
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,800
providers whether it's the products and

1209
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,280
services will not be using it

1210
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,319
every product i've talked about that 80

1211
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,200
of startups in india use aiml for

1212
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,640
whether it's in threat hunting

1213
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,800
you know whether it's in self-feeling so

1214
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,560
many of those technologies

1215
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,280
there is a challenge uh several cyber

1216
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,480
criminals

1217
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,680
do use aml maybe sometimes more

1218
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,800
effectively

1219
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,000
than what we in the profession do that's

1220
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,119
a challenge i think

1221
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,200
it's a question of time we've had those

1222
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,040
challenges even in nuclear right over a

1223
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,319
period of time there will be some

1224
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,599
governance around that

1225
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,800
hopefully and you know the next question

1226
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,599
is like

1227
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,119
how do you think data protection should

1228
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,119
be enforced when you have multiple

1229
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,280
systems of varying device capabilities

1230
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,960
interconnected

1231
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,480
so device capabilities you know probably

1232
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,359
challenging data protection policies how

1233
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,440
do you really cope up with this

1234
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,800
kind of scenario i don't think

1235
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,200
devices i mean maybe i don't get the

1236
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,720
question i don't think the device

1237
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,160
capabilities are

1238
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,839
challenging i think the entire data

1239
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,280
protection first of all comes from a

1240
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,480
point of view of

1241
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,160
how much of user awareness we are

1242
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,079
building right there's

1243
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,000
in india there's a lot of user awareness

1244
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,359
that needs to be done

1245
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,319
second we definitely need regulation

1246
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,560
unfortunately in security and privacy

1247
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,760
regulation drives

1248
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,079
enterprise behavior or business behavior

1249
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,079
right so you know how you

1250
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,680
gdpr got that compliance mindset

1251
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,440
so the regulation needs to come in

1252
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,119
hopefully the india personal data

1253
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,800
correction bill will come in

1254
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,480
but even while that act has not yet come

1255
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
once privacy was declared as a

1256
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,000
fundamental right

1257
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,560
at least several responsible businesses

1258
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,760
are giving it

1259
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,480
due attention because they need to

1260
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,520
ultimately

1261
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,200
win and retain the trust of their

1262
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,560
consumers

1263
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,440
right so if there is an there's a user

1264
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,400
enterprise

1265
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,560
which is completely online delivering

1266
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,079
services online

1267
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,240
and every now and then if they keep

1268
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,760
having the privacy breach

1269
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,280
consumers are going to look at an

1270
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,119
alternative enterprise which is doing a

1271
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,280
better job of security and privacy

1272
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,440
so i would believe that a combination of

1273
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,280
user awareness

1274
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,520
business drivers because the business

1275
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,920
needs to protect

1276
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,920
you know and retain the trust of its

1277
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,119
consumers and

1278
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,839
government and regulation and strong

1279
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:20,960
enforcement

1280
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,960
uh an independent entity which can

1281
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,160
enforce it

1282
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,960
will drive the thing yeah there is a

1283
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,000
host of

1284
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,200
heterogeneous devices operating systems

1285
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,119
how do you get all of that i think those

1286
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,960
problems will get solved as and when the

1287
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,800
regulation and the enforcement mechanism

1288
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,400
is something like gdpr

1289
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,839
uh going to happen in india

1290
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
not really gdpr we have an indian

1291
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,160
personal data protection bill

1292
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,280
which is a 2019 version it was tabled in

1293
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,760
parliament but then it went into the

1294
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,640
joint parliamentary committee i think

1295
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,640
that's a very comprehensive regime

1296
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,880
from whatever version we have seen and

1297
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,960
the deliberations we've had with the jpc

1298
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,720
what exactly is the version of the bill

1299
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,079
that will get

1300
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,400
tabled for enactment we have to see but

1301
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,079
i think it will be a comprehensive

1302
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,800
regime it cannot not be a comprehensive

1303
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,640
regime because our data protection

1304
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,720
regime first needs to meet

1305
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,359
the global expectations because we work

1306
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,440
with so many geographies

1307
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,640
right of privacy and it also needs to

1308
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,440
implement

1309
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,599
privacy as a fundamental right and

1310
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,079
you know make sure those guarantees and

1311
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,079
remedies are provided for a common man

1312
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,599
and a common citizen

1313
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,760
i do believe that it will be a

1314
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,599
comprehensive regime

1315
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,280
one more last question i know there are

1316
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,280
several more but i think we are running

1317
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,400
out of time

1318
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,960
um how realistic is zero trust

1319
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,880
architecture while moving

1320
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,119
traditional network environments like ot

1321
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,400
to cloud

1322
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,760
with remote access see it's

1323
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,720
too technical a question for me but zero

1324
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,640
see zero dress first of all i would like

1325
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,240
to tell you zero trust network

1326
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,240
architecture is not a product

1327
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,560
it's not one product first of all zero

1328
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,640
trust network architecture is a paradigm

1329
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,880
that you need to understand

1330
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,000
apply it to your enterprise what how

1331
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,839
will you apply zero trust network

1332
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:14,960
architecture

1333
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,319
in a large online consumer b2c

1334
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,400
e-commerce company versus zero trust

1335
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,839
network architecture

1336
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,280
in a bank in an oil and gas company

1337
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,680
in a large itits company with remote

1338
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,359
workforce is very different

1339
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,599
so first you need to understand zero

1340
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,359
trust network architecture is a new

1341
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,960
paradigm

1342
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,640
once you understand that you need to map

1343
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,800
your architecture decisions and your

1344
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,640
deployment decisions and your product

1345
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,079
selection criteria

1346
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,240
what products or what stack of products

1347
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,319
you will select to implement zero trust

1348
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:49,520
network

1349
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,280
based on your enterprise digital

1350
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,640
footprint

1351
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,200
right if you're an enterprise completely

1352
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,960
in one location in one building

1353
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,640
versus your an enterprise which is

1354
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,400
spread across the world

1355
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,240
and you have people working from all

1356
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,520
kinds of locations

1357
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,520
or you're an oil and gas company which

1358
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,200
has remote oil wells and remote

1359
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,040
monitoring stations and all of that

1360
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,640
what is zero trust and network

1361
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,160
architecture is going to be different

1362
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,839
and what kind of products you need to do

1363
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:14,400
that

1364
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,520
so i believe now at least most mature

1365
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,560
cios and csos by the end of

1366
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,359
2020 i believe at least have a good

1367
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,599
understanding of zero trust network

1368
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,920
it's not a single product you buy from a

1369
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,520
vendor and you say now i am

1370
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,880
ztna ready you need to understand how

1371
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,760
will you apply

1372
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,160
the concepts and paradigm of the dna to

1373
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,359
your enterprise

1374
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,200
which will be different based on what

1375
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,200
your digital footprint is

1376
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,280
and then go ahead and select the

1377
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,760
necessary products

1378
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,240
so anyway before we conclude i just

1379
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,920
wanted to mention that even though

1380
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,880
amrita has not been formally part of the

1381
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,800
isea program we've done tremendous work

1382
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,560
in reaching out to more than 20

1383
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,480
000 students across 21 plus states

1384
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,560
and training uh students in cyber

1385
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,520
security in in really warming them up

1386
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,480
uh and and upskilling them significantly

1387
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:10,720
and

1388
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,839
love to work with the sei more closely

1389
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,960
on on creating a bigger impact and this

1390
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,319
is all been done

1391
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,119
um you know using our enthusiastic

1392
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,760
faculty and students at our center so

1393
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,520
with that i would really like to thank

1394
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,200
you ma'am for your

1395
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,240
time uh especially on a sunday uh and

1396
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,480
really coming and sharing with us this

1397
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,400
you know new perspective in fact you

1398
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,079
were right when when we traveled

1399
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:36,720
together

1400
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,119
uh you know there were about 35 36

1401
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,200
companies uh um you know focusing on

1402
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,440
cyber security three four years ago

1403
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,680
and it's very heartening to see how that

1404
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,000
number has really grown so much

1405
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,640
uh and you know and and india is reliant

1406
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,599
on its own

1407
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,680
indigenous products which was absolutely

1408
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,720
not the case

1409
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,920
five years ago for example so uh with

1410
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,319
that again i thank you very much and i

1411
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,800
hope to have you as a speaker more

1412
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,000
in our forums uh i think you give a very

1413
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,760
very good perspective and more

1414
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,760

uh really great models as well thank you

1416
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,359
thank you professor krsnaji for having

1417
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,440
me in closing i would say

1418
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,680
if both academy and industry can partner

1419
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,200
to attract more

1420
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,359
women into the cyber security domain

1421
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,520
both in academia and research and also

1422
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,960
in our workforce because it's

1423
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,160
broadly only 11 percent as of now yes

1424
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,160
absolutely that is securities

1425
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,319
that we actively try thank you for
