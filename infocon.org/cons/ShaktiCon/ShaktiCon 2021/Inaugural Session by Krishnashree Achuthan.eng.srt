70
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,239
in that underwear

71
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,000
the center for cyber security systems

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
and networks in its past

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,920
eight years has done extensive work in

74
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,480
addressing various cybersecurity needs

75
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,560
both for the country and the world by

76
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,160
engaging with the government

77
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
academic and industry partners the idea

78
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,080
for this global

79
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,560
conference stemmed from three main

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,599
observations

81
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,760
one there is an exponential growth in

82
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,800
cyber crime

83
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,560
two there's a large deficiency in

84
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,280
available talent to protect and defend

85
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,159
people and assets and thirdly women are

86
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,680
highly underrepresented

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,239
in this area of cyber security well

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,480
amritas and shaktikan's proposition

89
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,680
is by bringing more and more women in

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,440
mainstream cyber security

91
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,800
we will not only address the

92
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,280
availability of skilled

93
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,440
manpower but genuinely bring down the

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,440
potential the intensity and the

95
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,360
occurrences of cyber crime

96
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,480
and please mark my words for it there

97
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,080
can be no other way

98
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,000
better way than showcasing some of the

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,239
most successful women that have crossed

100
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,440
all barriers to be who they are today

101
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,159
shaktikan thus far is one of the largest

102
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:40,799
events

103
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,720
