1
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,119
so

2
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,920
hello everyone welcome back to technicon

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,119
2021

4
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,720
hope you enjoy the conference till now

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,199
with all the informative sessions

6
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,439
we are up with more exciting talks ahead

7
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,360
uh we have

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,559
moshida there with us is working at

9
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,879
nokia bell labs research department as

10
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,879
cyber security specialist

11
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,280
her research area includes utilizing and

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,120
optimizing artificial intelligence for

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,559
iot security

14
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,879
drone robot security digital health

15
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:49,920
security

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,120
and cloud security she has been working

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,800
previously on

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,039
development of lte core network and

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,800
lawful intersection

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,440
so as we all know 5g security is

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,719
becoming the

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,720
key technology serving internet of

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,040
things and subsequently internet of

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,479
drones connectivity

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,560
so our speaker will be giving us an

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,400
insight into the internet of drone

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,600
security

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,479
hi mahanoosh

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,799
hello yeah so this was okay

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,880
session and i will be reminding you in

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,479
five minutes clear so that you can

32
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,240
conclude it well okay sure

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:41,120
thank you

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,399
[Music]

35
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,680
okay hello everyone welcome

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,159
in this presentation i'm going to talk

37
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,200
about

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,320
internet of drone or drones that use

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,200
cellular network for communication their

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,920
application

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,880
security concerns and finally introduce

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,680
security mechanism to detect

43
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,878
cyber attacks targeting these networks

44
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,000
so as we all know uavs or

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,200
drones first been used by individuals as

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,160
stand-alone components for entertainment

47
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,000
purposes however recently

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,560
they got attention of private

49
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,599
enterprises

50
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,239
and government entities for various

51
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,360
applications

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,800
obviously similar to other smart devices

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,840
they need a fast and reliable

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,319
connectivity

55
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,440
in this figure you see that the

56
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,879
entire drone communication is carried by

57
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,440
lce network such as authentication

58
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,239
messages

59
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,840
flight control messages transferring all

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,760
collected data

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,120
to cloud for further analysis is also

62
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,760
done by

63
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,519
lte network and then

64
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,840
here it comes to iot connectivity in

65
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,720
general we emphasize on 5g networks

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,599
rather than

67
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,040
previous generation y okay because

68
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,400
5g network delivers extreme broadband

69
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,040
gigabytes of data connectivity with very

70
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,319
low latency

71
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,280
and high reliability that allows

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,879
immediate communication

73
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,840
for iot devices that carry critical

74
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,400
missions

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,400
such as emergency services

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,519
let's have a comparison here uh

77
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,360
between 4g networks and 5g networks

78
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,959
we see that 4g networks they have been

79
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,840
more about connecting people now we have

80
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,640
connecting

81
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,640
the teams earlier we had 11 billion of

82
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,040
uh

83
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,480
subscriber or people connected to our or

84
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,200
currently connected to our networks

85
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,439
while for 5g we would have tens of

86
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,840
billions of

87
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,680
devices a very average revenue per

88
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,560
customer

89
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,040
for people has been 30 dollar per month

90
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,560
per each customer

91
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,760
or per each subscriber now we have

92
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,360
three dollar per month it's a little but

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,798
we have many of those devices again and

94
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,918
in 4g or for people we had the data

95
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,720
pricing based on the volume of data

96
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,360
while here for things it's based on the

97
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,040
value of data there are

98
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,080
iot devices that they don't consume much

99
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,880
data

100
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,080
but they need a high

101
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,199
reliability and very low latency again

102
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,440
for mission critical

103
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,479
application so then the price

104
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,759
will increase based on that features

105
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,240
and then quality of service or quality

106
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,360
of experience

107
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,080
earlier has been best effort for

108
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,639
everyone but now it is based on the

109
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,440
application

110
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
and also based on the service level

111
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
agreement and finally the

112
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,880
security has been important for people

113
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,680
but now

114
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,400
it is critical there are application as

115
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,600
i mentioned

116
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,520
like emergency services

117
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,720
health public safety that the difference

118
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,080
between

119
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,520
normal functionality means

120
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,960
a difference between death and life

121
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,000
so here uh we can see that

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,759
in 5g robots and drones we put them

123
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,320
in a different category while they are

124
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,840
actually

125
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,800
are applied for many of these areas such

126
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,199
as automotive industry

127
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,639
smart cities health and so on let's uh

128
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,919
talk about

129
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,919
some of the use cases uh that

130
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,039
are considered for drone or unmanned

131
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,240
aerial vehicles in general drone

132
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,280
networks have

133
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,880
four main use cases public safety

134
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,919
emergency services health the second

135
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,479
is smart city industry and finally

136
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,479
transportation

137
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,600
i give a very short one example of each

138
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,400
of them for example for a street

139
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,800
police drones patrolling street they

140
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,080
collect information

141
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,319
about any incident we have for emergency

142
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,360
services searching for missing person

143
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,800
with the thermal cameras

144
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,360
installed on their own daily or delivery

145
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,199
of medical supply then we have a

146
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,400
pre-meter

147
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,120
that drone are used for border

148
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,840
inspection

149
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,080
or inspecting closed area or industrial

150
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,479
area then we have drones that are used

151
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,520
for prevention

152
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,160
finding finding dried or hottest spot in

153
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,039
forest

154
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,479
in order to prevent future big fires

155
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,280
fire monitoring in cities evacuation

156
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,360
warning and then

157
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,720
if we put all others like air quality

158
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,360
water quality or inspection in one

159
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,000
category

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,800
we can say any leakage of gas or

161
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,919
chemical

162
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,960
or even air pollution can be detected by

163
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,000
drones and also for transportation that

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,039
we are using drones for point-to-point

165
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,120
delivery and or parcel delivery

166
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,160
so what are the security

167
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,599
uh concerns now as we mentioned earlier

168
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,720
5g network introduces

169
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,759
new use cases arising from iot

170
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,800
subsequently iod networks

171
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,599
where an anomaly in the original

172
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,440
function means difference between

173
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,520
life and debt therefore considering a

174
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,000
secure and reliable communication

175
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,479
would be a major concern for private

176
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,440
enterprises and government entity

177
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,560
and it is in brief our security

178
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,360
mechanism

179
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,400
for this type of application must have

180
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,599
the highest scalability against huge

181
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,240
volume of data collected from numerous

182
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,039
devices

183
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,160
now they should be robust against any

184
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,759
new type of attack

185
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,919
they should be automated so they are

186
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,120
self-learner

187
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,840
self-adaptive in detecting and reacting

188
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,039
to

189
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,759
different types of attacks and of course

190
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,199
with minimum human

191
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,199
interaction for analyzing the data

192
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,400
and finally they should

193
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,240
have some orchestration mechanism

194
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,640
to distribute result of analysis to

195
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,279
other

196
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,360
sites in order to prevent duplicate

197
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,919
analysis

198
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,440
so um let's now start

199
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,560
um to see some of the

200
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,680
attacks uh attack scenarios it when it

201
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,839
comes to

202
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,279
attack cyber attacks on drone drone can

203
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,040
be used either

204
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,399
by attacker as a weapon to attack other

205
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,120
parties such as other drones cellular

206
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,399
network and so on

207
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,519
or they can be directly targeted

208
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,800
by an attacker

209
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,959
let's talk first about the first

210
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,480
scenario when

211
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,120
the drone is itself a victim of a cyber

212
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,800
attack

213
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,480
then a drone are spoofed

214
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,760
to prob or corrupt their data

215
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
it is very important actually because if

216
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,920
we have a law enforcement

217
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,040
drones or industrial uh drones

218
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,279
because of a leakage of information of

219
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,160
course

220
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,160
they don't want that this uh information

221
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,680
will be uh still then we have a takedown

222
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,320
lock out or takeover of drones we have

223
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,720
sabotage or destruction of drones

224
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,440
um it can be any car kind of sim card

225
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,720
theft or dui step

226
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,480
itself then it is a drone identity theft

227
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,839
manipulating a system with wrong data

228
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,519
or wrong location and when it goes

229
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,279
um to second scenario when drone is used

230
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,120
by attacker as a weapon

231
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,680
they can steal information of other

232
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,079
drones or poorly protected cellular

233
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,320
wi-fi network

234
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,680
they can probe or corrupt

235
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,240
other drones collected data they can

236
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,040
corrupt

237
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,240
other iot devices or smart devices such

238
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,480
as

239
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,519
home appliances light bulbs or

240
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,760
car charging meters and many other

241
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,440
appliances and

242
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,040
now we know some of those attacks

243
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,800
let's uh categorize them so here we see

244
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,720
three main

245
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
security requirements that must be

246
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,399
considered while

247
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,360
designing or applying any uh security

248
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,240
platform

249
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,519
for our iod network these requirements

250
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,320
um

251
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,920
uh considered actually not only for iod

252
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,399
but

253
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,320
for any technology that needs to be

254
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,720
protected against cyber attack the model

255
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,800
is invented in 1998

256
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,160
as a cia or confidentiality integrity

257
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,760
and availability

258
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,680
by parker has been followed

259
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,040
for several years by various

260
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,240
standardization organizations such as

261
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,079
iso and it categorizes a security

262
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,240
concern as we mentioned in three main

263
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,120
groups the first one is

264
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,079
any kind of a confidentiality concern

265
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:34,800
such as

266
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,240
unauthorized access privilege access or

267
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,200
data or information leakage the attacks

268
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,600
that

269
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,480
some of the attacks that we can address

270
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
for this group could be probing

271
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,320
now replay attack is dropping falsified

272
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,320
iod or drones identity location tracking

273
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,120
then we go to availability which we have

274
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,600
in this category data loss configuration

275
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,320
loss

276
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,279
resource and availability and for this

277
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,160
group we can

278
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,959
name uh denial of service attack channel

279
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,959
jamming or gps spoofing

280
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,480
and finally integrity that goes back to

281
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,880
hello

282
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,800
and then we have integrity that goes to

283
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,000
any data sampling data corruption

284
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,120
man-in-the-middle malware injection

285
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,639
message for gerry or access control

286
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,440
modification

287
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,200
also goes to this group so

288
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,839
sorry somebody had questions

289
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,000
okay then now we go

290
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,120
to security mechanism that are

291
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,040
available for drones now they are either

292
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,079
software based

293
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,480
or hardware based or physical based

294
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
security services

295
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,000
and hardware based of course are all of

296
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,040
those security mechanisms such as

297
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,399
accelerated

298
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,680
scriptographic methods they are hard

299
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,120
coded

300
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,560
or they are software based they are

301
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,760
dynamically running on software and then

302
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,399
finally

303
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,839
of course physical security services

304
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,800
because we concentrate on intrusion

305
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,760
detection

306
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,839
system i highlighted it here and then

307
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,160
also this security mechanism should

308
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,399
cover either the cloud network and their

309
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,680
application

310
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,320
the communication channel or

311
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,360
connectivity

312
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,399
network and then or the components

313
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,800
of the whole network and again intrusion

314
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,920
detection sits

315
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,680
in the communication and connectivity

316
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,160
so what is uh the intrusion detection

317
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,720
system

318
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,000
it is a system that monitors and analyze

319
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,880
events either it takes a misuse

320
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,440
detection

321
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,600
approach or anomaly detection approach

322
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,959
for misuse detection

323
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,560
it checks signature of attack

324
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,839
and um actually if anything

325
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,040
is similar or exactly match with that

326
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,959
attack signature it will be considered

327
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,639
as malicious or it has

328
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,959
a pattern of the b9 traffic and if it

329
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,240
anything varies from that b9 traffic it

330
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,839
considers as annually it has its own

331
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:24,720
challenges

332
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,240
it is a static signature it

333
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,920
rely on static signature it can have a

334
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,399
limited number of rules defined

335
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,639
and also it's not very well suited for

336
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,519
ai driven attack or intelligent attack

337
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,320
it has

338
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,639
also long processing time that's why we

339
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,600
move to

340
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,959
uh ml based ai based or data mining

341
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,120
based intrusion detection system they

342
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,240
apply algorithm to extract pattern from

343
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,959
data dynamically learn from those

344
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,079
patterns

345
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,800
identify abnormal pattern and update

346
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,199
their

347
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,600
structure based on the new pattern as as

348
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,920
we see it is not exactly matching with

349
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,839
one signature but it

350
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,760
works based on the text texture of

351
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,880
the traffic and the similarity actually

352
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,440
rather than exact matching

353
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,360
and um it's just a review how

354
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,600
the data mining technique works first we

355
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,959
collect the data

356
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,440
and then data is processed pre-processed

357
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,959
to remove all of the duplicate

358
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,120
data or handle uh the missing

359
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,480
values or for example

360
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,000
convert or split ip address to separated

361
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
or numeric values then we have data

362
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,440
transformation that

363
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,639
convert again numeric values to nominal

364
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,399
attributes to increase the

365
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,040
model efficiency and then finally our

366
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,120
own algorithm itself that

367
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,759
has a different uh different parts like

368
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,839
a feature selection feature extraction i

369
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,360
talk about it later

370
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,120
and finally evaluation of our model

371
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,240
so here uh there is uh one uh

372
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,920
example or our test uh bit for

373
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,199
a uav system uh it's uh it's as i said

374
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,720
it's a test but we are using

375
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,800
lte network it's sufficient for one

376
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,240
drone and uh

377
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,720
and then here uh you can see the

378
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,480
components of

379
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
this architecture we have drone we have

380
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,800
enough vlt network we have a

381
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,519
security mechanism or another detection

382
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,639
mechanism that

383
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,600
located in core network and then cloud

384
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,120
server and ground

385
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,639
control station and

386
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,240
then um in high level the communication

387
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,600
here is carried over tcp or udp

388
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,000
protocol which encapsulated protocols

389
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,800
drone are

390
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,920
using under the tcp or udp it is of

391
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,880
course company

392
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,320
specific but in general i can shortly

393
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,600
review there are

394
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,720
for example possibility to use rtsp

395
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,679
grpc

396
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,359
sorry rtsp rest or

397
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,400
roslink they they can be used for

398
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,119
transferring collecting data such as

399
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,640
video image or

400
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,799
any sensor information rtsp is

401
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,839
over this can be over tcp or udp

402
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,039
then rest is over only over tcp and

403
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,320
roslink is over tcp or udp we have

404
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,760
mod link grpc uav

405
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,600
can or mqtt that can be used for command

406
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,400
and control

407
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,000
and telemetry information link is can be

408
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,919
again on tcp or udp

409
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,080
then grpc can be on tcp and again mqtt

410
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,520
can be over tcp and what are those

411
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,559
messages

412
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,480
command and control and telemetry

413
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,840
messages uh

414
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,840
have all uh kind of status check

415
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,840
health messages or position of the drone

416
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,360
waypoints are information regarding

417
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,480
pre-planned

418
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,440
flight destinations mission commands are

419
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,120
all commands executed

420
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,919
until emission is achieved like take off

421
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,320
uh

422
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,600
turn land collect info or data and the

423
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,919
user data is the actual data collected

424
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:28,720
by drone

425
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,320
video image sensor or any measurement

426
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,559
so what are the vulnerabilities we

427
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,400
should know the vulnerability of these

428
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,280
links so we can design a mechanism for

429
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,240
that

430
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,039
for mob link um it doesn't provide

431
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,160
actually any

432
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,640
cia or confidentiality integrity and

433
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,600
availability

434
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,039
so it is exposed to many of the attacks

435
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,480
uav can also has no shielding it is not

436
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,000
good for mission critical

437
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,280
system then we have grpc it uses

438
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,400
ssl and tls to authenticate server it

439
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,000
also uses encryption

440
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,880
so it has some kind of protection but

441
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,039
still it has its own vulnerabilities

442
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,480
then we have rosly

443
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,799
that has no security encryption or

444
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,000
authentication

445
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,320
we have rtsp unrest both of them are

446
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,760
using a web-based mechanism

447
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,840
as http so they have similar

448
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,600
vulnerabilities and finally

449
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,480
mqtt that only has authentication

450
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,280
mechanism and no

451
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,799
encryption so here is an

452
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,480
example of a network

453
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,520
i am explaining it we are we haven't

454
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,720
used it yet in

455
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,480
our testing uh our testing is um

456
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,720
just either normal network traffic

457
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,760
scenario or

458
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,080
this simple scenario but it can be

459
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,559
extended to a scenario that we have

460
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,880
two factories side in right side you see

461
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,640
drones or robots whatever the

462
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,039
information is collected sent to iot

463
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,080
gateway iot gateway or industrial iot

464
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,320
gateway does the primary monitoring and

465
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,360
analysis that

466
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,480
it sends it to core network either it is

467
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,760
a separate mvn or all of them are under

468
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,440
one mbn or one

469
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,720
enterprise lte or 5g network but if

470
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,200
located in different sites or factories

471
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
or whatever

472
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,320
based on the application or use case or

473
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,280
priority of the mission the data will be

474
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
transferred to anomaly detection for

475
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,440
further analysis i will explain this

476
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,000
module

477
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,120
in details in this um if this module

478
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,000
detects

479
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,880
the traffic as malicious then it will

480
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,840
inform

481
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,280
the iot gateway in the right side

482
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,320
also through the orchestrator it

483
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,679
sends the result of analysis to other

484
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,080
sites in order to prevent duplicate

485
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,919
analysis that's what we were talking

486
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,000
earlier about orchestration and

487
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,760
automatic analysis

488
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,679
and also if drone wants to move from one

489
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,000
side to other side it is prohibited to

490
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,520
enter to the other side

491
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,440
so for that we should consider that um

492
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,679
there are various type of drone

493
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,559
communication

494
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,200
either their own communicate with the

495
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,159
other drones

496
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,520
in the same uh ambient or same uh

497
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,559
cell or it it is between different cell

498
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:24,960
but

499
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,880
uh inside one mvno it is between two

500
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,440
different

501
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,640
nvnos or drone is moving from one side

502
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,720
to the other side

503
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,840
later i show the messages that

504
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,400
is carried between drone and mobile

505
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,039
network

506
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,400
and why we i put it here because um

507
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,640
there are two parts for drone data

508
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,880
either it is control plane or user plane

509
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,000
control plane is

510
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,400
all of those messages that is

511
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,679
transferred with the

512
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,080
lte network so it is just like an

513
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,840
ordinary user

514
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,159
with sim card all of those paging

515
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,039
creating

516
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,280
uh the mirror or authentication messages

517
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,799
are all similar so they follow the same

518
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,679
mechanism

519
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,159
or specification that defined for

520
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,720
ordinary

521
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,200
subscription but of course when it comes

522
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,600
to user plane and header then

523
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,799
the matter is different so

524
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,320
um and then here i

525
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,799
put two different scenarios when the

526
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,280
drone itself carries the sim card

527
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,720
so it won't either it wants to attack or

528
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,039
communicate with drones in same cell or

529
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,240
the other cell everything goes to

530
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,960
through the core network that's why we

531
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,280
put

532
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,600
our anomaly detection in core network or

533
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,799
even the drone is

534
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,440
seamless but because it uses the lte

535
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,080
network

536
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,919
still there is a lrc or local robot

537
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,039
controller that

538
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,039
carries the sim card and drone are

539
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,280
connected via bluetooth or wi-fi

540
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,679
and then this lrc or local robot

541
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,880
controller is

542
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,919
communicating with enob

543
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,039
so in any case it uses the lte net

544
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,480
network

545
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,520
so and finally our hybrid anomaly

546
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,320
detection

547
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,039
model or security platform it is

548
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,159
designed in

549
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,840
nokia and it is

550
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,559
patented actually for nokia that's why i

551
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,360
can

552
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,640
present it so it is um

553
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,919
ai based annually detection

554
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,960
platform it follows all of

555
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,760
the aspects that we mentioned for 5g and

556
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,400
for

557
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,880
iod use cases should be considered for

558
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,480
scalability because

559
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,799
we concentrated on computation time we

560
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,880
tested it

561
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,960
to check the minimum computation time

562
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,000
we checked the robustness against

563
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,039
various data sets with

564
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,440
of course also for scalability various

565
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,600
data with various size has been tested

566
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,840
with this

567
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,919
model for robustness uh we

568
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,760
checked it not only with

569
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,400
data noun data or a supervised

570
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,919
algorithm or technique but also against

571
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:18,799
unknown

572
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,400
traffic so we managed to

573
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,039
fix overfitting issues with the

574
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:25,919
automated

575
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,480
future extraction method and then

576
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,960
finally we also

577
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,640
managed to fix or overcome the challenge

578
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,039
data imbalance challenge uh that all of

579
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,720
them affect the robustness

580
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,960
and for automation i thought earlier we

581
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,159
have dynamic feature extraction

582
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,520
we have cluster analysis uh

583
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,760
and we have orchestration orchestration

584
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
we have iot orchestrator to

585
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,360
uh uh disturb you the result of analysis

586
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,039
for uh cluster analysis we are planning

587
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,159
to

588
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,039
re it's not yet done but we are planning

589
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:03,440
to

590
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,559
uh do the cluster analysis uh with an

591
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,600
algorithm instead of human analysis

592
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,320
and already we have the dynamic feature

593
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,960
extraction and finally it is

594
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,200
the model in first part we have protocol

595
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,480
analyzer

596
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,559
it uh it divides the traffic

597
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,679
to two categories vulnerable protocol

598
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,400
and non-vulnerable protocol vulnerable

599
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,200
protocol

600
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,559
are already predefined such as udp and

601
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,039
tcp and non-vulnerable protocols such as

602
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,440
streaming protocol still they go to an

603
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,480
algorithm

604
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,960
for further analysis if algorithm

605
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,000
detects that

606
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,400
this traffic carry attack or this

607
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,480
protocol carry attack informs our

608
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,559
counter and prioritization

609
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,200
and it decides that it uh consider that

610
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,840
protocol

611
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,200
as vulnerable or not it really decreases

612
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,880
we have the result of

613
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,960
every part of this model published in

614
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,600
journal papers different journal papers

615
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,200
so really the protocol analyzer

616
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,400
decrease considerably the computation

617
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,760
time also it divides uh the traffic

618
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,400
based

619
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,200
based on it it is udp or tcp because

620
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,720
these protocols have different

621
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,559
nature and they require different

622
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,640
algorithm to analyze them and in

623
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,039
addition it also helps that scalability

624
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,200
because they run parallel

625
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,640
and then this part only labels

626
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,919
the attack in very general level but it

627
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,440
doesn't say a specific

628
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,559
type of attack and then traffic goes to

629
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,840
rule extractor and duplicate or if

630
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,760
the system already knows some of these

631
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,000
attacks and already is protected against

632
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,480
those attack for example we have rules

633
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,640
against some of those patterns in

634
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,520
firewall

635
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,360
then it doesn't send it to last part

636
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,799
that it is a dynamic

637
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,039
machine learning for further analysis it

638
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,120
just drops that traffic or forwarded to

639
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,880
the other part of the

640
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,840
system but then at the end we have

641
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,919
our uh algorithm five it is

642
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,360
actually uh it has two parts

643
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,200
it has a classifier and it has a

644
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
clustering in classifier

645
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,000
we from the input traffic we detect uh

646
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,360
the

647
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,240
already known patterns or attacks that

648
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,000
are predefined and the rest of the

649
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,440
traffic that

650
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
is unknown will be forwarded to

651
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,360
clustering here

652
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,240
it is a non-supervised algorithm and we

653
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,679
are using for

654
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,480
this part uh actually a clustering

655
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,240
algorithm that doesn't need to know the

656
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,080
number of clusters so

657
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,919
it just uh yes yes

658
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,279
but can you wrap it up like

659
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,799
okay so i just um we are i uh

660
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,279
tell that to be uh used it against as i

661
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,440
said the different data set from

662
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,480
the different attacks and different size

663
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,840
and then um also with custom data sets

664
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,480
the features that are used are both

665
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,000
network traffic features

666
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,120
and also drone specific features on both

667
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,279
header payload we haven't done the

668
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,320
analysis but

669
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
the header for for example modeling is

670
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,600
one example

671
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,760
and then the attacks are taken from

672
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,520
network traffic attack and they are

673
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,480
injected

674
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,520
to drone traffic

675
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,960
and then um as i said that we were

676
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
using earlier feature extraction and

677
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,880
cross-validation but we automated it

678
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,559
because of the overfitting

679
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,279
we used variational auto encoder we used

680
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,880
many different techniques and based on

681
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,200
that we selected conditional variational

682
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,399
auto encoder that

683
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,799
instead of selecting a subset of feature

684
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,320
it just

685
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,360
selects all of or encode all of the

686
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,000
features

687
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,720
and makes a new uh features from all of

688
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,679
them but nothing

689
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,559
is removed and finally for unknown

690
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,320
traffic why it is important

691
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,039
to label it because a big portion of our

692
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,000
data

693
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,679
about 40 percent is unknown traffic so

694
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,840
um it's really important to be

695
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,320
considered for that we used dba scan but

696
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
combination of dbs can and

697
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,840
different methods so because

698
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,880
the dbs can alone uh couldn't

699
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,000
have um of course it doesn't need the

700
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,279
number of clusters

701
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,760
it doesn't relate it to shape of size of

702
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,960
cluster but it is

703
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,240
extremely density based so we had to

704
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,039
combine it with for example variational

705
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,840
autoencoder and association matrix and

706
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,159
again results are published in journal

707
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:36,960
paper

708
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,240
and what is future work for our it's

709
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,960
replacing the security investigator

710
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
to analyze those clusters because now

711
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,360
the human decides based on the texture

712
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,440
of the cluster or size of the cluster is

713
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,600
it attack or not but later a machine

714
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,159
does it then payload analysis and find

715
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:54,799
finally

716
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,120
analyzing ai driven attack i'm sorry

717
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,000
that it took time

718
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,000
that's fine thank you mahanov that was a

719
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,320
really informative and wonderful session

720
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,399
getting to know about 5g drones and

721
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,760
security

722
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,760
so now we will move on to uh

723
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,679
qa session so i'll

724
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,600
okay so i'll read all the questions for

725
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,840
you

726
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,470
okay um i am just

727
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,679
[Music]

728
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,240
so there's a question tcp is a session

729
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,840
based protocol how the

730
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,240
uh then how drone security provided

731
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,600
throughout the session

732
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,559
is the are the algorithms robust yes

733
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,679
actually

734
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,640
we are not if you are if you mean

735
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,399
session based uh

736
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,840
flow based we are not uh analyzing uh

737
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,039
based of flow so we are analyzing per

738
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:51,520
packet

739
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,679
so it is a robust because it analyzed

740
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,720
each packet arrived

741
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,900
i don't know if i answered it or not

742
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,159
[Music]

743
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,279
and it is network based we have a host

744
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,200
based or we have network based

745
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,519
so if if you mean that it is network

746
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,519
based and if you mean flow based or

747
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,080
uh packet-based it is packaged packet

748
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,600
based

749
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,559
okay so next question are there any

750
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,080
simulation tools for internet

751
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,799
of drones

752
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,600
aha okay yes there are

753
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,440
tools i can provide you a list

754
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,320
i don't know if um you have my email

755
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,519
address probably

756
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,960
but uh currently we are not using any

757
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,159
uh simulator for that either we have uh

758
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,080
the traffic from real lab

759
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,960
real drone or uh as i said new year's

760
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,679
questions

761
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,519
yeah so

762
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,640
shanika i think yeah she's curious to

763
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,519
know

764
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,000
if the performance of it auto encoders

765
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,799
and b

766
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,000
a e g i n for this use case

767
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,080
how did the use of these methods improve

768
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,200
the performance

769
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,480
okay as i said um one major

770
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,159
problem that we had with other methods

771
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,600
of feature selection all of them either

772
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,880
you had overfitting issues or you had to

773
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,000
manually run

774
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,720
your uh model several times and take

775
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,559
mean of that and it was not proper

776
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,840
what we did here we haven't removed any

777
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,519
features we used all

778
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,360
um all attributes or all features we

779
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,159
just

780
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,159
converted them or decoded them to

781
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,000
a smaller dimension and uh then

782
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,720
it is called actually data

783
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,159
generalization or your model is

784
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,480
fit to all types of data and it

785
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,399
increases

786
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,200
greatly the performance of your model

787
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,279
and actually precision

788
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,039
rather than accuracy we work on

789
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,640
precision and recall

790
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,360
so i don't know if i have time i can

791
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:03,679
show

792
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,279
those slides about our result otherwise

793
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,240
again you can see the result in the

794
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,200
ieee journal of artificial intelligence

795
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,720
you just need to

796
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,120
search with my name at least and find

797
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,120
this with variational auto encoder or

798
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,200
data generalization

799
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,730
and then you will find the result

800
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:25,919
[Music]

801
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,200
okay cool uh last question how jamming

802
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,679
can avoid in the rooms

803
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,720
okay uh the jamming um is

804
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,799
when they add too much noise or ratio

805
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,559
of the signal or b9 signal

806
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,840
is much too the noise is uh

807
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,120
decreasing a lot so um

808
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,559
there are methods that um

809
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,279
either it is as i said intrusion

810
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,159
detection

811
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,480
the old version of intrusion detection

812
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,279
that they have

813
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,559
exact signature for those noise uh it is

814
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,679
known to the network or you are using uh

815
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:06,159
the

816
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,679
dynamic machine learning so our self

817
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,440
we haven't tried any jamming or

818
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,440
noise but probably you can find

819
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,839
uh methods for

820
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,399
i think it is a perturbation methods

821
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,119
that

822
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,159
can protect your network about

823
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,560
jamming

824
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,839
yeah that would be for a q and a session

825
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,520
thanks a lot man

826
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:45,520
for this one
