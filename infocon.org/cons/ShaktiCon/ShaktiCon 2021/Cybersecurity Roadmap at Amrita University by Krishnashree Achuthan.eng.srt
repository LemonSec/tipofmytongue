1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,199
uh next we have our dr krishna sri

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,480
akshatan

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,040
mam is our dean of our peace apartments

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,000
and she's the head of our center of

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,320
cyber security system and networks

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,920
along with amrita deviant business

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,720
incubator

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,760
so dr krishnashi is an ardent researcher

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,760
with multi-disciplinary interest and

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,240
holds

11

where mom will give us a guns and a talk

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,400
on the road map

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,040
of our cyber security programs here at

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,040
our amrita university

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,240
so over to you mom thank you very much

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,360
purnima can everybody hear me

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,520
yes mommy can hear you okay great so i'm

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,079
going to just share my screen

39
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,279
can you all see my screen

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,640
yes ma'am you can see your screen okay

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,079
great so i'm just going to run

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,320
through various different aspects of

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,439
amrita

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,640
and hopefully give you a flavor for what

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,439
we do here and what are the important

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,940
problems we look at how

47
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,560
[Music]

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,720
what kind of achievements this group has

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,479
got etc

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,439
so um

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,560
so this is our center um actually we our

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,038
core vision and mission is to really

53
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,080
uh work with academia and government and

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
industry to really

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,720
promote uh and create an ecosystem to

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,280
pursue interdisciplinary research

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,560
um towards protection of assets and

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,800
public international and international

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,920
importance

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,280
and really provide value-based education

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
very hands-on skills etc to our various

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,360
programs

63
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,480
so i'm just going to touch first on very

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,480
the important research outcomes for the

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
center in general the

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,360
the research areas have spanned across

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,160
um

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,599
some of the most pressing uh areas that

69
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,120
we find in the

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,599
um industry today hardware security

71
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,959
system security

72
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,360
network security wireless internet of

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,319
things cloud

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,560
cyber security education and we are also

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,800
slowly getting on to quantum security

76
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,440
and

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,000
our your next speaker will be actually

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,920
speaking a little bit more detail about

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,080
that

80
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
uh this is not my work only so i really

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,920
would like to acknowledge

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,720
all my faculty who have contributed to

83
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,480
various different uh

84
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,319
pieces of outcomes that i'm going to be

85
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,200
presenting today

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,120
so let's start uh uh with the first

87
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,239
area um mobile embedded in wireless

88
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,280
security

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,599
here this area is actually a growing

90
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,200
area as you know

91
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,720
the number of devices connected the

92
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,319
internet is just uh

93
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,959
growing in an exponential space and the

94
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,680
security threats are also

95
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,319
quite uh large in terms of due to the

96
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,000
open nature of the system

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,440
and the wireless interfaces uh in this

98
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,280
perspective

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
and so the capabilities of the attacker

100
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
also has quadrupled in the past few

101
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,480
years

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,799
and to circumvent the wide variety of

103
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,840
protection

104
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,879
in already existing embedded devices so

105
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,439
we work on various different domains

106
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,920
one is automotive security one of the

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,680
most fascinating areas

108
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,599
in embedded devices is the automotive

109
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,640
domain and here we look at looking at

110
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,238
various different components like the

111
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,279
electronic

112
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,759
uh control circuits the different

113
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,639
standards

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,120
networking standards the control area

115
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,080
network

116
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,880
the media oriented system transport will

117
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,000
be equal to vehicle

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,040
and hot networks etc and

119
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,479
so this actually lays the foundation to

120
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,960
really protect and secure the both in

121
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,880
vehicle and vehicular networks

122
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,720
and in the context of in-vehicle

123
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
networks we look

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,479
at actually a hybrid model an anomaly

125
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,120
detection

126
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
in control area networks and some of

127
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,400
this work is already published i'm

128
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,360
actually sharing

129
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,040
some of these things that have already

130
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
come out

131
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,440
and so the audience is welcome to note

132
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,000
this down

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
write to us we are happy to share the

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
papers and have more discussions if any

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
particular area

136
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,720
seems of interest to you and

137
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,639
similarly in the vehicular networks we

138
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,759
look at

139
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,479
defending against civil attacks this is

140
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,160
one of the most prominent attacks

141
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,199
in vehicular networks and

142
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,320
so if you look at platoons are vehicles

143
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,360
that are arranged

144
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,280
in a convoy for facilitating

145
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,440
communications in a streamlined manner

146
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,280
and simple attacks involve you know

147
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,120
insertional malicious codes

148
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,720
malicious nodes fabricating its

149
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
identities and impersonating those

150
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,800
existing nodes so this is the primary

151
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,320
piece of work here

152
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,479
i may not be go able to go into so much

153
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,000
detail so i'm going to

154
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,160
a little bit speed up here since the

155
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,120
time is short

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,039
next to work piece of work is again very

157
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,800
novel in terms of looking

158
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,479
at how much of energy is consumed

159
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,120
due to code obfuscation so if you if you

160
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,319
if you think of

161
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,960
wanting the best of security it requires

162
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,319
various different techniques

163
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,240
but what is the downside of actually

164
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
making anything more secure

165
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,280
the potential downside of of uh

166
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,800
ensuring high security is the amount of

167
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
resources uh that are required to

168
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,160
actually ensure that security one of

169
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,759
those resources are energy

170
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,000
and this piece of work actually looks

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,160
into code obfuscation

172
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,319
on required really secure application

173
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,280
software from

174
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,039
say reverse engineering type of attacks

175
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,919
and so we've done a significant amount

176
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,520
of work in profiling these

177
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,520
energy consumption and

178
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,360
by doing these types of things you can

179
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,039
actually come up with an optimized

180
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,400
way to enable security without say

181
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,160
your phone device completely draining

182
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
out of battery uh

183
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,919
in the shortest amount of time and we

184
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,199
have done a lot of work

185
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,520
looking at attack modeling and

186
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
mitigation

187
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,400
so the space of attacks modeling

188
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,720
analyzing uh its impact on system

189
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,599
operations end users etc

190
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,000
these are all important areas to make

191
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,759
any of these solutions

192
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,039
uh more scalable next is a very very

193
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,160
important area

194
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
called as hardware security here we look

195
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,639
at physical and clonable functions many

196
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
of you have heard of this

197
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
it's a fingerprint in ic circuits and we

198
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,000
use it to identify

199
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,800
counterfeit uh integrated circuits uh

200
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,160
and they are actually very very

201
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,240
vulnerable to inference attacks

202
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,560
and how do we really do efficient

203
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,680
implementation of

204
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,560
crypto algorithms also for fpga this is

205
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,360
the other

206
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
uh project that we look at in hardware

207
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
security now there are several

208
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,759
uh publications that have come out of it

209
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,919
i think if you look at just the puf

210
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,840
the physical and clonable functions i'm

211
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,000
here

212
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,560
uh we've looked at developing a

213
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,720
lightweight hybrid puf

214
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,360
um for enhanced security especially in

215
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,800
the iot world

216
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,280
um and then these are also very

217
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,120
vulnerable to machine learning attacks

218
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
and and we've also

219
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,520
looked at you know a combination of how

220
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
can we really make this resilient

221
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,360
to these types of machine learning

222
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,919
attacks now lightweight ciphers is

223
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,440
another very big area

224
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,280
and this work was done in collaboration

225
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,039
with our french partner

226
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,000
um uh university of grenoble uh pass

227
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,639
through

228
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,599
amaze paolo masonry in fact that the

229
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,919
paper is down there which is local clock

230
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,599
glitching fault injection

231
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,879
with applications to the ascon cipher

232
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,599
so here what we do is uh ciphers are

233
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,680
really vulnerable to fault injection

234
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,919
and side channel attacks and so we need

235
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,159
to be able to model the impact of these

236
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,519
on ascon's

237
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,399
and that was the primary piece of work

238
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,320
here

239
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,080
let's go on to i think this is again

240
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,760
another piece of work energy profiling

241
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,560
but for

242
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,800
shortage of time i'll just keep it um

243
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
let's look at another topic

244
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,640
energy efficient security so i was

245
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,800
mentioning about how it's so important

246
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,120
to

247
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,440
conserve resources as we really plan and

248
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,160
model

249
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,000
um you know security uh solutions

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,320
and given the lightweight nature of

251
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,279
embedded devices

252
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,040
energy efficiency is of paramount

253
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,440
importance um traditional mechanisms

254
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
such as digital signatures etc

255
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,200
may not be directly applicable to

256
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,040
embedded devices since battery power

257
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,760
may really be quickly depleted so in

258
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,040
this regard we have uh

259
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,600
developed uh several lightweight crypto

260
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,560
mechanisms

261
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,600
for secure communications and uh

262
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
in our earlier works we actually

263
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,880
leveraged the hierarchical nature of iot

264
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,720
um and we used kind of the identity

265
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,480
based cryptography

266
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,320
because that offers significant benefits

267
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,480
over traditional public key

268
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:50,160
base cryptography identifiers

269
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,640
so in contrast to by public private key

270
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,800
generator distributing private keys

271
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,440
can result in a single point of failure

272
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,040
and that's what is shown in the diagram

273
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,760
here

274
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,720
and um so we have to designate numerous

275
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,000
private key generators

276
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,839
depending on the functionality say in

277
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,600
the case of smart cities where

278
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,480
you want to have connected um everything

279
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,000
every place of device you want to be

280
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,360
able to connect them to really

281
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,160
function and efficiently control many of

282
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,279
these devices so

283
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,800
the entire process of private key

284
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,920
generation becomes distributed and

285
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,640
that's the outcome of the work done that

286
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
was published very recently

287
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,160
in addition you're also looking at a

288
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
time-bound key management

289
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,760
for iot and prototype on sensors that

290
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,920
are developed in-house uh

291
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,800
as shown here so i i'll have another

292
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,479
slide that just talks about that

293
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,079
so uh this is a very big area as the

294
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,760
title itself says security and cyber

295
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,480
physical

296
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,640
assistance means a lot of things and and

297
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,720
we have not actually captured everything

298
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,360
here

299
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,800
but if you look at some um basic real

300
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,839
uh fundamental blocks uh we really try

301
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,399
to

302
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,800
look at security module how can it

303
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,839
really

304
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,480
be invoked to defend against cyber

305
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,120
attacks

306
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,320
again um powering the security on or

307
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,079
during all times can deplete its

308
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,000
resources so how do you intelligently

309
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,560
turn on the security module on and off

310
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,480
um and here you look at a decision

311
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,600
theoretic approach

312
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,720
using markov decision processes and uh

313
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,320
so that really helps

314
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,240
determine how to invoke the security

315
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,839
module and

316
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,839
so we look at the three different states

317
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,600
idle active shutdown to be able to

318
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,200
intelligently do this

319
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,519
and the impact of trust is also

320
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,079
something that has not been investigated

321
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,120
very much earlier so trust uh can be

322
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,880
classified into direct and indirect

323
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,440
trust

324
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,200
and computing trust values and

325
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
challenging um

326
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
is challenging because uh the very

327
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
behavioral characteristics of devices in

328
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,240
a cyber

329
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
physical system environment so in this

330
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,000
regard we look at again theoretical

331
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,040
so here you see how the center actually

332
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
has done both theoretical work

333
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,079
and very hands-on practical uh work in

334
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,160
terms of developing both devices

335
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,920
and also the um

336
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,160
accompanying modeling uh solutions and

337
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,839
approaches to be able to

338
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,639
look at these problems in whole so many

339
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,839
times you can see

340
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,560
a singular focus but our group is very

341
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,320
very well structured to be able to look

342
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,560
at

343
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,600
both both sides of it and we

344
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,440
do validate this game theoretic approach

345
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,040
you do a multi-loop

346
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,800
in fact unmanned aerial vehicle control

347
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,360
as an example system that we took in

348
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,399
this purpose

349
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,440
so you actually see um on the

350
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,480
left side uh picture of the experimental

351
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,120
subs

352
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,399
set up in a multi-loop uav system

353
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,360
um and uh and and the modeling that that

354
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,240
takes off

355
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,600
from the game theoretic approaches on

356
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,320
the right side

357
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,560
so security in in software-defined

358
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,240
envelopes is again a very very big

359
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,760
emerging area i know this is a busy

360
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,680
slide so don't worry about it

361
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,079
uh but here uh what we've done is

362
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,680
looking at the software defined

363
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,639
networking

364
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,200
um it actually can can provide great

365
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,880
flexibility to the existing

366
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,959
software-based network functions

367
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,120
um for example directing of packet flows

368
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,279
uh and network function virtualization

369
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,800
which is called as nfv

370
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,839
so that's where we see sdn uh giving

371
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,519
very good flexibility

372
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,160
and uh the the fact is that network

373
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,320
functions do pose a lot of challenges in

374
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,519
large scale networks

375
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,959
both inside data centers

376
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,440
and also across the wide area networks

377
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,160
so through

378
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,880
uh our work we proposing a software

379
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,320
defined network function

380
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,720
virtualization so a software defined

381
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,240
stack over an nfv

382
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,040
called as sdn fv framework that expands

383
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,199
the capabilities to help manage

384
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,760
and guide flows based on potentially

385
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,560
complex

386
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,839
data plane information

387
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,600
now what are the specific things that

388
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
you know the way we solve typical

389
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,399
problems is

390
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,000
what we see what we feel is not all

391
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,680
packets and clothes may be forwarded to

392
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,920
a controller so you actually eliminate

393
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,839
and you know selectively select traffic

394
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,959
that needs to be

395
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,560
you know uh defined uh

396
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,920
um and controlled and secured so we are

397
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,600
able to actually reduce the amount of

398
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,399
traffic you

399
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,000
implement uh several ways to be able to

400
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,959
detect anomalies and drop the malicious

401
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,519
packets in the switch fabric so

402
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,320
uh this is like true open flow pipeline

403
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,240
and application awareness in data plane

404
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,600
these are some of the techniques that we

405
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,160
use

406
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,480
to be able to do this um of course there

407
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,000
are some limitations as well

408
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,800
because the data plane itself is prone

409
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,920
to some stateful table attacks

410
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,680
and in terms of the network flow

411
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,120
visualization we do

412
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,279
try to scale them vertically concurrent

413
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,320
processing

414
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,440
um nf service chain sharing common

415
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,639
operations uh etc

416
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,279
uh to be able to provide kind of a

417
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,880
scalable solution

418
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,639
and then finally we actually integrate

419
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,800
this into z and stack

420
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,320
and within a switch we are able to

421
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,639
create a logical chain of different app

422
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,519
modules

423
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,120
kind of like micro services you could

424
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,040
say for each flow that requires a

425
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,839
network service

426
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,399
um this is another very very big area

427
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,760
artificial intelligence and its

428
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,199
application security in fact there's

429
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,320
nobody now

430
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
that does not work on artificial

431
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,839
intelligence so

432
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,120
uh basically we are looking at a lot of

433
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,880
work here and i'm only

434
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,480
sharing with you a couple of pieces of

435
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,120
work here where

436
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,920
machine learning um you know is used to

437
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,000
develop an intrusion detection system

438
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,759
both of these papers are naturally

439
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,519
accessed and to be able to detect

440
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,160
the cyber attacks at a network level and

441
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,000
a host level in a timely and automatic

442
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
way and the problem with that with

443
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,120
really studying these

444
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,360
types of things are one the data sets

445
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,480
that you use

446
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,839
what are they how good are they are they

447
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,079
do they really allow you to make

448
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,320
decisions or conclusions that can really

449
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,079
apply to other scenarios

450
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,160
these are the types of challenges so

451
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,680
mostly in the

452
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,600
intrusive behaviors you can see

453
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,000
intrusion detection classified into

454
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,600
a network based intuition detection

455
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,199
system or a host based intuition

456
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,480
detection system

457
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,120
and here in this pieces of work they've

458
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,839
actually

459
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,839
combined both of these types of

460
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,759
intuition detection behaviors

461
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,120
and and looked at deep learning

462
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,000
approaches to model uh the cyber attacks

463
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,040
proactively

464
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,240
so there are definitely some

465
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,160
deficiencies obviously

466
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,360
like i said data sets are

467
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,240
uh you know very you could say uh

468
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,120
subjective

469
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,320
to many uh limitations and uh you know

470
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,480
but this is very very extensive work and

471
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,600
you're welcome to please

472
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,839
look into it very in detail to be able

473
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,959
to understand

474
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,800
the various different uh outcomes that

475
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,320
they have uh this

476
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,920
these set of researchers have arrived at

477
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,160
looking at how you can do advanced text

478
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,079
representation methods especially using

479
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,039
nlp

480
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,319
uh to explore host level events etc

481
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,640
using various benchmark data sets in

482
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,679
fact they've done a very good

483
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,760
exploratory work looking at very many

484
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,559
data sets on comparative experimentation

485
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,000
they've also done

486
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,640
a scalable hybrid intrusion detection

487
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,439
framework

488
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,720
which is called as a shia framework

489
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,240
to introduce processes um to process

490
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,919
actually large amount of network level

491
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,840
and host level events to automatically

492
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,440
identify malicious characteristics

493
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,640
um lastly from a research perspective uh

494
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,799
what i wanted to mention is this is

495
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,679
again a very

496
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,080
uh new area looking at blockchain blaze

497
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,520
platforms

498
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,679
you see you hear about blockchains a lot

499
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,200
i'm sure these days

500
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,760
and uh and and in this application we

501
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,799
are looking at

502
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,960
how can blockchain be used for critical

503
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,480
infrastructure protection

504
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,760
uh where again performance energy

505
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,160
security are all critical

506
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,679
on the one hand when we have resource

507
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,240
constraint devices to operate for longer

508
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,880
duration on the other hand uh we need to

509
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,640
actually perform operations

510
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,120
and so we are able to actually look at

511
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,520
what are the pros and cons of actually

512
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,080
having decentralized networks um within

513
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,520
the blockchain framework

514
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,240
uh and use lightweight and performance

515
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,160
performance efficient platforms to be

516
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,360
able to solve this

517
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,440
so that brings me to the end of the kind

518
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,640
of an overview of

519
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,880
some of the research activities here is

520
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
another piece of major work in terms of

521
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,080
really developing

522
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,440
uh an in-house iot platform wherein

523
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,840
we've looked at building middleware big

524
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,400
data framework etc within the

525
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,360
research expertise here at our group and

526
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:45,919
also

527
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,840
building actual hardware

528
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,039
you could say devices iot sensors

529
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,120
across the board so these are all great

530
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
outcomes that have come out of our lab

531
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,440
um and then i want to switch on to

532
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,200
another major area that is of

533
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,960
high importance to us as well which is

534
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,440
really education and here we've done

535
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,280
so much of it and actually this

536
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,480
conference is also

537
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,280
a potential outcome you could say of uh

538
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
the the tremendous work we've done we've

539
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,440
trained not only our mata students but

540
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,320
we've done a large amount of nation

541
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,640
nationwide outreach we're also kind of

542
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,760
pioneers of

543
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,320
game based learning we actually have

544
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,640
trained several k-12 schools as well

545
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,320
and actually the objectives have been

546
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,679
how can we really give

547
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,520
hands-on experience in really learning

548
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,919
uh cyber security additionally we also

549
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,840
care a lot about cyber safety cyber

550
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,760
bullying internet safety and hygiene

551
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,720
etc these are just broad areas where a

552
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,400
lot of cyber education

553
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,520
and impact has been made from our center

554
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,000
and these are the you could say recent

555
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,120
ctf achievements

556
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,039
where our students have really the

557
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,720
numbers on the left side and the right

558
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,000
side really indicate

559
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,080
the ranking our teams have gotten

560
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,400
various different international ctfs

561
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,840
um again a commendable job in terms of

562
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,520
really performing at an international

563
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,240
level

564
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,440
um and what has all this resulted to

565
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,880
if you look at this graph on the left

566
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,440
side it shows amrita's ethical hacking

567
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,320
team

568
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,559
and it's worldwide rank how it had kept

569
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,240
up from 2014

570
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,039
um you know being around 250th world

571
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:21,600
rank

572
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,880
to up to 20th world ranked in 2019 end

573
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,360
of 2019 beginning of 2020

574
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,520
and this is uh by a ranking agency

575
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,440
called the ctftime.org

576
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,760
you see below and it actually the 13 has

577
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,600
been the sixth amongst all academic

578
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,799
teams as well

579
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,480
um so the ctftime.org actually ranks

580
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,080
both professional teams and academic

581
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,799
teams

582
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,960
um and our countrywide rank has always

583
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,480
been number one so

584
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,039
uh our student and our faculty have

585
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,840
really really

586
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,799
uh put together programs to be able to

587
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,559
do this and various other achievements

588
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,240
in addition to that our students have

589
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,799
been

590
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,080
very prolific in terms of really looking

591
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,360
at bug bounties

592
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,200
tools talks uh cves etc and even been

593
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,960
recognizing various different halls of

594
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,600
fame

595
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,840
and i'm just going to run this through

596
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,120
these are all work by

597
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,760
our students so i really appreciate what

598
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,240
they have put out in open source uh for

599
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,000
all of you to take a look at

600
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,840
to learn from it to use it in any way

601
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,240
you like uh any prime primarily for

602
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,679
education purposes

603
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,280
how you can really study various

604
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,678
different

605
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,200
there are disciplines of security in a

606
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,799
very effective way especially if you're

607
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,919
a beginner

608
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,120
um so that really just

609
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,640
brings me to the aspect of really

610
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,559
the options that we have at amrita in

611
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,799
terms of various different specialties

612
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,559
what you can do on campus what you can

613
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,280
do online these are the urls that you

614
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,480
can take a look at

615
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,679
and with that i wanted to uh really also

616
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,760
emphasize the institution that i'm

617
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,039
that we are part of um we have six

618
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,360
campuses across the country and

619
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,400
in terms of uh where we are in terms of

620
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,039
various locations that was it and

621
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,679
