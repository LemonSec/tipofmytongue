175
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,720
real growth in terms of not only the

176
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,160
number of

177
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,120
cyber threats or attacks also the

178
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,440
sophistication of these attacks has also

179
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,319
been

180
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,840
increasing because today you know it it

181
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,680
is not only that office work we used to

182
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,120
do it is technology is

183
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,599
truly permeating into our lives whether

184
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,440
it is monitoring our vitals

185
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,240
or whether doing our exams online or

186
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,160
consulting the doctors online

187
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,800
doing our high level board meetings

188
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
online using virtual

189
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,280
conferencing platforms almost

190
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,880
everywhere or even a critical

191
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,720
infrastructure for that matter is

192
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
largely monitored using

193
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,000
technology so so as

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,080
we becoming more and more digital the

195
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,360
threats are increasing

196
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,919
at the same time our vulnerability is

197
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,360
also increasing

198
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,400
as our dependency on digital systems is

199
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
think of it for a few minutes if you

200
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,960
don't have your broadband mobile network

201
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,560
how much you accuse your service

202
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
provider that not good

203
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,639
all those things that's a kind of

204
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,960
unconscious dependency we are building

205
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,479
uh on these systems and which is perhaps

206
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,240
today

207
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,520
the need ah one thing more which is

208
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,160
happening

209
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,360
is in this whole gamut

210
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,440
over the time that the demography of

211
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,479
people who are

212
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,639
who are getting connected into a digital

213
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,000
ecosystem is actually

214
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,440
moving from uh from metro cities or from

215
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,680
professionals to people in the villages

216
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,080
people who may not have that kind of a

217
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
literacy

218
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,080
forget about its awareness

219
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,240
and there also started transacting

220
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,080
they're not only transacting in terms of

221
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,240
their social lives which also sometimes

222
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,440
get into

223
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,640
um some kind of challenges it all they

224
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,399
are also doing a lot of differential

225
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,839
transactions you know we had real

226
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,240
um focus or i should say

227
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,519
a boost on digital payments after our

228
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,040
demonetization

229
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,839
a few years back so people are making

230
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,360
payments they are transacting their

231
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,680
banks government is also transferring

232
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,000
all their subsidies directly into bank

233
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,880
accounts

234
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,560
so it's not only the the kind of cyber

235
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,440
threats which were

236
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,240
generally just defacement which was away

237
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,640
which is today has become a very very

238
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,279
low level of thing today it the attacks

239
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,880
are so sophisticated that

240
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,560
they can really have a far-fetching

241
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,080
impact it can bring

242
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,240
it can make organization attacks like

243
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,360
ransomware can make

244
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,080
organization lose billions of dollars it

245
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,640
can bring

246
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,360
critical infrastructure like hospitals

247
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,800
railways or

248
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,640
or anything you talk in our nuclear

249
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,000
plants it can bring

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,920
anything to standstill i mean and it is

251
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
becoming so sophisticated it can make

252
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,800
these devices

253
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,839
malfunction so there is so cyber

254
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,760
security is really a huge

255
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,720
challenge and and and we in the

256
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,360
government

257
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,160
and in country have lot of such

258
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
uh institutions we are which are working

259
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,480
very very hard including police which

260
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,920
has a very important role

261
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,600
we are fortunate to have madame here

262
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,000
today uh to really help us

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
uh come you know overcome these

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,839
challenges

265
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,360
but uh but at the end if you look at

266
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,560
it it is actually a collaborative effort

267
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,320
whether it is digital payments whether

268
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,079
it is social interaction

269
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,320
as much as the service provider has to

270
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
be

271
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
has to be really taking care that it

272
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,160
provides you a safe environment

273
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,240
as much of our owners is on you also

274
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,079
that you don't click on those phishing

275
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,959
links

276
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,120
and go to those sites which are kind of

277
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,880
malware infected sites and

278
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,560
all right so so today

279
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,079
if you look at it the the onus is on

280
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,240
everybody who's into digital business

281
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
whether it is digital services

282
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,320
people building digital products or

283
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,800
people providing digital infrastructure

284
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,640
as well as people who are consuming

285
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,000
digital service

286
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,440
everybody has to be and so the security

287
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,360
and the cyber security becomes

288
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,160
as much of a core strategy of an

289
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,760
institution

290
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,760
as much as the digital is their strategy

291
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,440
but unfortunately we so that we

292
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,360
so the demand for cyber security

293
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,480
professionals

294
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,560
is really increase over the last few

295
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,760
years but

296
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,920
unfortunately we do not have that many

297
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,000
skilled professionals even today there

298
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,800
is a huge

299
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,120
gap and this is not a story of india

300
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,519
this is a story worldwide

301
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,079
uh there is so there is a lot of

302
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,000
opportunity as well as this domain is

303
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
concerned

304
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,600
and another thing which has been time

305
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,760
and again um

306
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,720
highlighted is that the representation

307
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,519
of women

308
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,399
is far less in cyber security it is less

309
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,920
as far as technology terminal is

310
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,680
concerned and it becomes further less

311
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,240
when you come to cyber security

312
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,680
um and and i think

313
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,800
i will really take uh use this platform

314
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,480
to request

315
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,160
all of you to really choose this

316
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,920
profession this is a very exciting

317
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,800
profession

318
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
and gives you a lot of opportunity i

319
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,320
know many of you may

320
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,959
know uh that the participation in women

321
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,959
in cyber security date backs to

322
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,600
world war where some young girls were

323
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,360
once

324
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,600
kind of recruited to do that secure and

325
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,760
security intelligence during work war

326
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,600
times and you may have noticed that

327
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,440
these girls had not only come from the

328
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,040
stem background they had the

329
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,600
language they had all other aspects of

330
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,040
background so it is

331
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,120
cyber security has also become quite

332
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,560
multi-dimensional

333
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,600
uh that way because it's

334
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,360
it's not only technology there's a lot

335
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,519
of other aspects to it

336
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,639
and this is another domain whose

337
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,800
whose demand over the time is going to

338
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,160
grow and grow i mean

339
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,200
and with ai ml robotics as it gets

340
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,560
more into our deeper into our lives

341
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,720
then demand for cyber security is also

342
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,120
going to increase

343
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,800
at the same pace and there is a lot of

344
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,279
uh and why should i say why should i say

345
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,880
that if you take cyber security

346
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,760
there is a lot of talk in government as

347
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,959
well as

348
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,560
the government is much better off as

349
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,000
well as incorporates

350
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,880
to have a gender diversity uh in the

351
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,839
organization

352
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,839
and i think this is this is something

353
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,600
which is very much needed in cyber

354
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,079
security also because cyber security

355
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,279
uh making a system secure is

356
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,519
not only an aspect of technology it

357
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,440
needs multiple perspectives

358
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,760
to be really working out a comprehensive

359
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,959
strategy to make

360
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,920
organization um organization or an

361
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,720
entity

362
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,240
safe and the kind of works you have in

363
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,560
cyber security normally a perception is

364
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,320
there that cyber security like national

365
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,160
security is something which leads you 24

366
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,760
cross 7 jobs it may need

367
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,560
odd hours and all which is not true

368
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,320
because if you look at cyber security it

369
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,720
has

370
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,000
so many aspects right from we still need

371
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,560
hardcore research to be done in cyber

372
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,600
security

373
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
we need to build a lot of algorithms to

374
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,920
do we need to build develop

375
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,639
tools we need to build ai models into it

376
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,160
for monitoring the

377
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,839
then there is a goal of monitoring the

378
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,600
ict infrastructure

379
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
doing in surveillance how do you bring

380
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,079
in proactive surveillance or

381
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,240
intelligence surveillance into it there

382
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,160
is a whole domain of audits and

383
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,680
compliance because

384
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,800
today whether there is a banking

385
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,560
industry or a government or other

386
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,440
corporates

387
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,399
the demand for these security measures

388
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,320
cyber security measures and their

389
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,519
their kind of standards and

390
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,600
specifications through which you

391
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,680
have to regularly undergo audits that

392
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,880
are the domain

393
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
then the domain of police where you need

394
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,760
to investigate the cyber crimes happen

395
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,800
how do you take measures uh in terms of

396
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,079
prevention of

397
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,600
these crimes then also going forward how

398
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,320
do you create

399
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,760
education in our awareness among users

400
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,399
particularly among masses that how do

401
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,199
they

402
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,519
trend themselves safely when they are

403
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,279
into a digital domain

404
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,519
and then again public policy we also

405
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,199
need to make lot of changes into

406
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,240
policies into our it acts

407
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,639
to be able to effectively investigate

408
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,760
and conclude

409
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,360
um or punish

410
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
the people who are involved about it as

411
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,519
for the cyber crime is concerned

412
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,519
uh and if you look at the numbers which

413
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,440
has been shown worldwide in india

414
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,839
they're really scaring they are not only

415
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,920
uh they're not only really impacting

416
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,600
people in their day-to-day lives they're

417
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,760
actually sometimes impacting the economy

418
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,800
of the country

419
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
uh when it comes to this and if it comes

420
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,480
to critical infrastructure attacks you

421
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,240
know it just takes

422
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,600
a different dimension all together

423
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,160
so in nutshell i'm only trying to uh

424
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,399
tell all of you that cyber security

425
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,320
if cyber security is a very very

426
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,880
multi-dimensional field

427
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,279
it gives you a lot of opportunity and

428
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,279
you you could have a profession which is

429
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,040
completely research oriented which is

430
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
completely soft oriented and it really

431
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,079
excites you

432
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,480
you could have a profession like police

433
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,360
or

434
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,279
or a profession where you're doing a lot

435
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,519
of intelligence services to

436
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,680
prevent because the objective is how do

437
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,920
you really prevent these kind of attacks

438
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,000
from happening and there's a lot of

439
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,680
exciting

440
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,560
roles into it and in fact if you go

441
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,440
forward

442
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,839
uh it is it is not really protecting

443
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,639
your organization protecting yourself

444
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,040
or protecting your society in going

445
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,680
forwards

446
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,320
even the even the cyber the the wars

447
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,360
within the country

448
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,079
will have a very huge component of cyber

449
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,199
cyber wars

450
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,959
uh and so you will you also have an

451
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,040
opportunity to for to work for a

452
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,199
national security organizations if you

453
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,199
do the cyber domains because

454
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,440
that that will again have a very huge

455
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,639
component and

456
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,839
um as far as national security is

457
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,800
concerned

458
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,959
so uh thank you very much and it has

do so please do choose it and we really

466
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
need a lot of women in cyber security to

know uh women as police officers

483
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
there's a very very very small number

484
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,760
out there and

485
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,799

you know the conference on this aspect

507
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,960
that woman leadership and technology you

508
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,559
know because and i'm happy that we are

509
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,559
all pushing in a certain direction

510
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,480
which uh which brings me to the first

511
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,679
point about

512
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,440
being a woman and my journey being a

513
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,160
woman is that i've been fortunate to see

514
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,320
the mainstreaming of women in every

515
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,160
field because

516
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
when i joined when we all joined service

517
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,960
maybe three decades ago four decades ago

518
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,120
we were um you know like especially in

519
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,080
the police when we

520
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,919
wore our uniform and you know senior

521
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,840
police officers we went out and

522
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,640
well i'm having to explain to the others

523
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,000
who are not familiar with the indian

524
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,240
system so i belong to the indian civil

525
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,960
service

526
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,799
indian civil service also has a

527
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,520
component of senior police management

528
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,240
so so when we used to go those days out

529
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,919
over 30 years ago so

530
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,760
we used to be looked at as some kind of

531
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,679
a you know somebody looking at some

532
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,600
something in an exhibition or a zoo you

533
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,440
know we used to be looked on like that

534
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,240
you know from when we were in uniform so

535
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,919
from then on to now

536
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,480
i think and today in delhi police which

537
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,360
i am currently

538
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,200
my designation has changed recently i am

539
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,440
the pres special commissioner in charge

540
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:41,840
of

541
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,120
the administration and the entire uh

542
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
administration and headquarters manpower

543
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,039
management etc of delhi police

544
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,200
from then on to now i think it's amazing

545
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,039
to see the number of women who come into

546
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,000
the force

547
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,320
and in all aspects specialists you know

548
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,160
we have women who are with technical

549
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,400
skills police women and we are doing

550
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
brilliantly in everything from anti and

551
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,159
from anti-terrorist work to christ

552
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,080
sensitive crime investigation

553
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
etc etc so we've done brilliantly in

554
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,559
everything so couple of things which i'd

555
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,960
like to share with you which is you know

556
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,559
i think we all know that

557
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,720
is that um i think all of us who are

558
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,559
here today logged on i think we all

559
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,799
share a common uh

560
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,520
a common feature in that we never

561
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,360
limited ourselves we kind of

562
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,280
went beyond our limitations and i think

563
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,039
that's the reason why all of us are even

564
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,039
logged on this sunday morning

565
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,200
and i've always believed and i think the

566
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,480
credit for this should go

567
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,240
to to my guru amma mata

568
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,880
so she always says that you better be a

569
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,480
first-class woman of instead of trying

570
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,080
to be a second-class man and that is

571
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,880
something

572
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
i ardently believed in you know you or

573
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,000
try to be a first-class

574
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,200
man always and i think as all of us

575
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,919
do all of us have done who all of us who

576
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,520
are here today

577
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,480
that one has constantly uh reinvented

578
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,320
oneself i mean it's not just the fashion

579
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,600
part of it of course that's very

580
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,159
interesting

581
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,720
but i think you know also in terms of

582
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,280
learning

583
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,679
the skills the skills which are relevant

584
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,840
to a certain age and a certain time and

585
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,400
then you were able to identify that need

586
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,640
see the trends of society see the trends

587
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
of where it was going and pick up that

588
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,559
particular skill i think that is what is

589
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,799
very important and apart from me i think

590
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,080
all of us have uh done this uh

591
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,159
this particular thing and that is why

592
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,120
again we are all

593
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,720
logged on today as a kind of a

594
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,159
sisterhood because we've

595
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,000
been bothered to understand the trends

596
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,919
when we bothered to reinvent ourselves

597
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,760
and that is why we are here

598
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,799
so i basically uh so this is about the

599
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,480
personal side and i think

600
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,200
in terms of uh i i remember the times

601
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,679
when early on i think in the early

602
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,039
late 1990 98 99 when i

603
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,440
i head out to do a diploma and

604
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,080
network-centered computing from the nit

605
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
so people are saying what's up with you

606
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,840
i mean what is this all about

607
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,679
and i said no i just want to challenge

608
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,280
my intelligence you know with

609
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,960
with the college kids who are also my

610
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
classmates in that course and it was it

611
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,600
was good

612
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,880
and uh so from then on and when and when

613
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,960
we started the

614
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,360
the cyber crime cell and cbi those days

615
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,960
early 2000

616
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,280
when people did not really know i mean

617
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,360
dr dr anita has been with

618
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,960
with the with us in the government of

619
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,360
india on this journey i said early 2000

620
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,159
people

621
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,480
especially the police of course they

622
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
said cyber crime what who where

623
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,600
so when i joined this the the

624
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,840
the central bureau of investigation in

625
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,120
early 2000

626
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,200
so it was this cyber crime cell and they

627
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,480
said okay now

628
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,559
this is the cyber crime cell and since

629
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,480
you seem to be interested and you have

630
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,919
done this diploma and

631
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,440
you seem to be interested so now you

632
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,280
look after the cyber crime cell so i was

633
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,799
given a piece of paper

634
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,120
which said that in addition to my desk

635
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,720
which was economic offenses

636
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,280
and with the economic offenses desk in

637
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,240
addition to this

638
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,760
they said okay here you look after the

639
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,159
cyber crime cell and all i had were

640
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,039
about four

641
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,880
officers and we had um at that age

642
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,400
the other day i was talking to my kids

643
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,320
about a pentium computer so they said

644
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
what the hell is a pentium computer they

645
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,080
didn't even know the generation today

646
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,960
didn't

647
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,360
i had a pentium 3 computer and a piece

648
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,240
of paper

649
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,880
and we said that okay now you figure out

650
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,400
what cyber crime

651
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,320
it was interesting so those days you

652
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,400
know we had the fbi field office in

653
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
delhi and along with the fbi field

654
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,520
office the

655
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,679
way we went about and the earlier trends

656
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,679
of cyber crime in india were

657
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,480
basically the misuse of credit cards and

658
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,559
we started off from there and today of

659
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,240
course we are

660
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,840
and i remember the first cyber crime

661
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,360
conference that was held for all the

662
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,600
director generals of police by the cbi

663
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,480
then

664
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,360
and it was a kind of a it was kind of

665
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,200
jolted everyone out of their seats when

666
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,120
we showed them the various cases those

667
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,400
days you know of

668
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,039
the the basically the identity theft it

669
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,640
started off with identity theft

670
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,480
theft and then people realized that oh

671
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
this thing called cyber crime can affect

672
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:00,880
my

673
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,039
why wallet so that everyone seemed to

674
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,159
show a lot of interest

675
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,919
and that journey cyber crime journey

676
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,080
started then and we had a lot of

677
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,320
training courses way back in 2000 for

678
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,760
all the state police

679
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,039
because as you know um the cbi and is is

680
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,640
under the federal government

681
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,520
and the state and in india the pulley

682
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
policing is a state subject which is as

683
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,200
per our constitution so

684
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,919
so that we we went out to the states

685
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:26,880
states and we

686
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,120
had training courses for them yeah it's

687
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,480
been a very very

688
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,720
interesting journey and today we are of

689
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,919
course i think

690
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,039
we have come a long long long way and

691
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,360
you would have heard my colleague aneesh

692
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,320
the other day

693
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,480
who heads the delhi police anies roy the

694
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,440
dcp

695
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,240
delhi police cyber crime unit and we've

696
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,760
come a very long way

697
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,840
but the the thing is that we still have

698
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,760
a very long way to go

699
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,159
and for that i think as i fully agree

700
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,400
with doc what dr nita said

701
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,559
we need more and more women coming on to

702
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,320
stem and more and more women

703
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,240
you know evidencing interest in science

704
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
and especially so in cyber crime because

705
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,080
this is something which has

706
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,960
uh which is majorly affecting all our

707
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,559
lives especially so as women

708
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,600
as as women as mothers

709
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,080
you know um from that from from the

710
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,960
social it's

711
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,640
really started affecting our lives

712
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
whether we are looking about

713
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,200
you know children internet addiction and

714
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,120
children and that is an issue which even

715
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,559
somebody like amma

716
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,559
has flagged diamond again internet

717
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,080
addiction and children

718
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,640
and an addiction of various other kinds

719
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,559
through the internet among children and

720
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,720
among family members also

721
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,480
being in law enforcement i know that a

722
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,039
lot of even marriages are

723
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,760
are failing because of pornography

724
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,440
addiction on the internet you know

725
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,799
things like that so there's a lot of

726
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,919
issues which are

727
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,159
really touching our lives which is for

728
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,679
which the medium is

729
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,880
is is the cyber world so

730
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,120
with that and and i and also remember

731
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
that the earlier cases i remember there

732
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,320
was this kid

733
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,000
in uh in pondicherry who launched uh

734
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,640
a dos attack a dos attack on a company

735
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,039
in the

736
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,360
united kingdom and then we got this

737
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,400
reference uh

738
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,200
through the embassy through our embassy

739
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,919
and uh

740
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,520
so they launched a complaint and then

741
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
when we those days when it was still we

742
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,279
could trace the ip with

743
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,600
great clarity nowadays even that's very

744
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,720
confusing but

745
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,039
you know when we did that we landed up

746
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,520
at the house of a doctor in pondicherry

747
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,080
and that was his 14 year old and the

748
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,919
mother and the father were very happy

749
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:32,720
saying that

750
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,320
they got him a computer and they thought

751
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
that he was studying on the computer

752
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,480
but what this kid was doing is this is

753
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,840
his uh

754
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,960
uh his experimentation went into denying

755
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,640
a big company in the uk of their

756
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,919
services and um

757
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,080
so we had to kind of he was a juvenile

758
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,400
so we had to deal with him that way

759
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,200
and and uh so this is a kind of an issue

760
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,039
you know these are issues which we have

761
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,000
to look at

762
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,919
another issue which i like to flag which

763
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,080
is because in terms of raising awareness

764
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,520
is also the fact that

765
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,840
there was this kid in hyderabad who had

766
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,559
um

767
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,480
you know online you know that that

768
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,640
online when you see that little button

769
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,360
i agree it seems very nice so he

770
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,960
developed a program for

771
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,840
a u.s company online and he was in

772
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,720
school

773
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,520
and he very sweetly very easily he said

774
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,120
they sent him a thing and they seem to

775
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,000
like what he'd

776
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,320
developed for them so he just said i

777
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,679
agree press that

778
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,520
and then two years down the line this

779
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,360
kid went into college and then he had

780
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,279
this program developed and then

781
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,080
he used it again he either either i

782
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,399
think he sold it to a company and then

783
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,399
lo behold there was a complaint against

784
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,159
him you know saying that

785
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,760
you know he has committed a criminal

786
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,360
breach of trust he signed this contract

787
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
with us and little did this kid realize

788
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,200
what kind of a contract he was signing

789
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,000
when he

790
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,039
clicked that i i agree button online

791
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,440
when when he was negotiating when he was

792
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,880
talking to his u.s company

793
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,480
so there are a lot of and that u.s

794
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,919
company knew very well that they were

795
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,360
talking to a kid but

796
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,200
nevertheless these are the kind of

797
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,559
issues that are there

798
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,520
and many of them are being reported many

799
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
of them aren't being reported

800
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,840
and these are the kind of issues we have

801
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,480
to

802
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,919
address online so with that

803
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,640
i think we get on to the interaction

804
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,240
thanks again it's great being with all

805
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,720
of you

806
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,360
yes yeah i think the key takeaway at

807
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,240
least i can

808
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,039
take from from what you have mentioned i

809
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,720
mentioned is that

810
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,919
the the cyber world is is is really very

811
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:30,799
complex

812
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,000
and as attendees of this conference

813
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,360
i think we should really commit

814
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,000
ourselves to be able to explore

815
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,399
um apples and solutions to some of these

816
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,799
problems that really hurt the most

817
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:45,760
vulnerables

818
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,799
uh amongst uh uh amongst us so

819
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,559
it has been a message that has come time

820
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,840
and again and and

821
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
that you touched on the potential for a

822
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
cyber pandemic when you know a lot of

823
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,000
infrastructure a lot of services

824
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,760
could you know completely come to a

825
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,600
standstill and what is it that we can do

826
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,799
at that point of time

827
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,640
we absolutely won't be able to do much

828
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,240
unless we prepare now

829
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,720
and and and i think integrating several

830
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,080
of these potential

831
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,480
uh you know skill sets into the

832
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,440
educational

833
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,919
um aspects of what we do today is

834
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,000
probably one way to really build those

835
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,159
cyber warriors as we speak

836
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,200
um in fact so i i just wanted to

837
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,679
switch a little bit anita i saw this

838
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,039
latest you know news

839
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,320
about uh how nic is is is at least

840
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,120
supporting

841
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,640
a github uh you know in in in looking at

842
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,000
open source in a large way now uh

843
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,159
there is both pros and cons about that

844
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,120
and and and

845
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,960
i just wanted to get your thoughts about

846
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,480
it um as to

847
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,720
what we should do as security engineers

848
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,279
to to help that open source community

849
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,799
uh that really government of india is

850
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,640
really promoting in a large way yeah

851
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,720
you know government of india as a matter

852
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,919
of india we've been

853
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,279
always having this philosophy of uh

854
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,760
have as much of an open source as is

855
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,559
possible

856
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,880
the number of reasons to this one in any

857
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,720
case open source doesn't make you

858
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,799
captive at any point of time with any

859
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,840
software

860
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,240
particularly in today's industry where

861
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,640
merger acquisition has become a norm

862
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,240
uh so you depend if you're not dependent

863
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,360
on a particular software or a particular

864
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,919
stack of solution it it sometimes

865
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,840
becomes a challenge for you to

866
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,919
going forward if there is an acquisition

867
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,840
or if that company goes out of

868
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,640
their business and so forth secondly

869
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,960
which is perhaps more driving is that

870
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,799
when something is open source you have

871
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,320
an access to code so you

872
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,640
actually know what is going inside the

873
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,960
kind of trust you have on those set of

874
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,080
softwares

875
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,320
is is is extremely high because you can

876
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,559
always look into it

877
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,799
third aspect is that you know whenever

878
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,480
you take any solution

879
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,559
uh which has been built by open source

880
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,320
could be built by anywhere

881
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,080
ah you need to customize this to various

882
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,440
requirements

883
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
and that becomes very difficult with the

884
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,120
commercial products though

885
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,720
over the time they have also learned

886
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,240
they have started now

887
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,960
providing wrappers and kind of various

888
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,679
uh

889
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,679
other plugins and services through which

890
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,760
you can make changes but still

891
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,519
many times i have many of the

892
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,440
experiences where you can't really

893
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,360
modify it beyond a certain

894
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,559
point or also today

895
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,320
we're getting into this connected world

896
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
is not that if i have one system let's

897
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,519
say in working in

898
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,120
ministry of agriculture and other

899
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
working in ministry of rural development

900
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,440
other working in health these systems

901
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,679
can work in silo and many a times is a

902
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,600
requirement where you need to connect to

903
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,640
these system

904
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,080
and when you need to connect you need to

905
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,640
exchange data among these systems

906
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,960
you need to share information among

907
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,159
these system

908
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,159
within the ministry also you may have a

909
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,679
government you may have systems which

910
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,880
need to talk to

911
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,799
each other for various policy making for

912
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,880
generating insights you know

913
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,960
and now when you need to connect systems

914
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,480
again so you need

915
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,279
a lot of flexibility manageability to be

916
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,159
able to

917
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,919
uh change as it goes so customization to

918
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:10,240
be

919
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,440
able to change is one thing and

920
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,720
having it since i have a

921
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,840
preview or inside view of the code that

922
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,760
gives me far more trust

923
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,600
onto the whole thing which is nowadays

924
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,880
has

925
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,120
become a major concern with governments

926
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,320
worldwide

927
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,679
and and of course the operational cost

928
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,640
because government

929
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,240
most of the time when doing iit

930
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,320
solutions the very few places where

931
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,840
there is a revenue on

932
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,080
largely it is social development of the

933
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,200
country and

934
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,760
so there is no source of revenue there

935
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,240
so you

936
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,840
try to keep these solutions as low cost

937
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,960
particularly the operational cost and

938
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,200
open source gives you and the fourth

939
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,200
thing which is perhaps more exciting and

940
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,000
that is the reason

941
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,120
if you see today not only governments

942
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,519
even

943
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,840
private sectors like microsoft or google

944
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
when they are developing any software

945
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,240
after a time they are contributing to

946
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,159
the open source

947
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,919
while this is contributing to open

948
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,640
source is is a generosity but

949
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,200
also there is a reason because when you

950
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,279
put it at open source and you have

951
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,159
whole of the word contributing it's a

952
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,919
crowd sourcing to the whole thing and

953
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:22,720
you get

954
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,799
so much of an innovation done around

955
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,960
this which would not have been possible

956
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,760
if the

957
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,399
product has been uh has been confined to

958
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,440
only the

959
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,840
uh what do you say uh within the

960
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,080
confines of that corporate that company

961
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,600
so

962
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,960
an innovation around it making it um

963
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,519
far more uh spread out product with so

964
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,360
many different functionalities

965
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,760
uh the the the open source is uh

966
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,799
it really puts that platform on and

967
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,880
uh and if you look at the open source

968
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,399
concept today a lot of government

969
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,519
initiatives

970
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,960
we are we have kind of you know adopted

971
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,240
this philosophy

972
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,960
we have this platform called mygov which

973
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,000
is one of the largest

974
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,360
government to citizen engagement

975
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,359
platform this is there again you know

976
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:09,679
even

977
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,399
today if i have to design some logo for

978
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,918
the government scheme or if i have to

979
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,280
make new policy

980
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
this is the first place i've seen in

981
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,480
often meeting they say

982
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,079
let's put it on miguel and let's see

983
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,079
what public is saying so

984
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,480
and people and i can name at least 10 to

985
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,839
15 students the most

986
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,239
premium government programs logos have

987
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,679
been got designed through

988
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,320
these kinds of would you suggest that

989
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,280
basically if

990
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,359
some of us who are in this audience have

991
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,320
ideas

992
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,800
on contributing then maybe the mygov is

993
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,399
the place to actually

994
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,079
share that okay so that would be also

995
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,000
a very important good takeaway for all

996
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,239
of us

997
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,800
that government should not always be

998
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,560
consuming government should also be

999
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
contributing to this open source i mean

1000
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,320
that's also a responsibility

1001
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,200
but the complete source of was also

1002
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
contributed to the open source for

1003
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,960
other countries or anybody else who

1004
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,560
wants to be a user

1005
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,720
yes actually we have done an analysis of

1006
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,320
various different governed acts and

1007
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,200
actually

1008
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,640
arugula was ranked amongst the top uh

1009
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,720
from what analysis we could actually do

1010
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,240
so it was really negative

1011
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,240
i know we are actually uh down to our

1012
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,560
last five minutes uh

1013
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,920
so i just uh you know really wanted to

1014
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,800
first of all thank both of you for

1015
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,760
coming

1016
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,240
online for us for this short amount of

1017
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,160
time i know it was not sufficient we had

1018
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,599
actually collected some questions

1019
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,200
earlier from the audience and

1020
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
some of my questions actually were

1021
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,560
representative

1022
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,160
of what they also wanted to ask um it's

1023
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,000
in the zoom platform only certainly but

1024
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,760
they they had to actually type in their

1025
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
questions etc so we kind of collected

1026
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,119
them ahead of time

1027
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,839
uh but i think um i think there's one

1028
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,040
more quick question saying

1029
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,680
uh uh will will will the government try

1030
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,720
to restrict

1031
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,760
uh access of the internet like in china

1032
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,560
or you know

1033
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,960
we did hear the news about you know

1034
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,680
building up an

1035
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,240
uh internet for the country so this

1036
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,359
question is with the

1037
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,119
with the government is the ghana serious

1038
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,400
about trying to

1039
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,599
restrict access for the internet

1040
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,400
restrict access to home within the

1041
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:20,960
country

1042
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,040
so you don't have an open internet see

1043
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,680
today uh you know

1044
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,880
yeah also so so so

1045
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,280
as in china like you you they have their

1046
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,240
own uh

1047
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,480
sets of services they block a lot of

1048
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,280
information

1049
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,880
no no no no no no no think of that sort

1050
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,200
we

1051
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,119
are purely democratic country i don't

1052
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,560
think there's in any

1053
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,760
any any kind of a substance to this

1054
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,119
whole thing i mean we

1055
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,960
i mean this is going to be open in fact

1056
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,480
we are promoting sort of

1057
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,280
startups and lot of youngsters to really

1058
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,520
come up and build solutions not only for

1059
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,160
india

1060
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,400
but for word at large i mean we feel

1061
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
that we should be a factory for

1062
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,160
uh and there's a lot of focus under at

1063
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,839
nurbur and all those things and you see

1064
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,680
we such a vibrant startup community

1065
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,320
today so

1066
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,400
there's no question of anything of

1067
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,520
themselves

1068
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,920
i heartily endorse what dr neither is

1069
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,440
saying there is nothing like that i

1070
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,599
think sometimes it's a kind of a

1071
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,280
perception got from the media but

1072
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,640
there's nothing like that yes

1073
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,640
but in short periods of time when it is

1074
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,400
required for law and order issues

1075
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,480
we do that but that is purely for law

1076
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,240
and order period

1077
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,920
they are very very limited and very very

1078
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,280
localized just to

1079
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,280
you know address the situation at that

1080
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,800
time yes

1081
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,760
and i think uh actually also you know

1082
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,920
touched on a very very uh important

1083
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,640
aspect of you know having social media

1084
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,560
and internet you know access

1085
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
at a very very young age can also be

1086
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,320
very very detrimental

1087
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,680
and we are seeing a lot of cases of

1088
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,599
you know cyber bullying and things like

1089
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,760
that at very young age in fact

1090
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,240
india is ranked quite high uh in terms

1091
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,240
of the types of cases that come out in

1092
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,440
this area and

1093
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,480
as security researchers and and

1094
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,079
being passionate about this area we

1095
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,599
should do everything to

1096
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,320
protect people from uh you know

1097
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,400
unnecessarily causing damage to

1098
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,520
individuals

1099
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,320
to families uh etc in this work and i

1100
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,760
think this is something actually also

1101
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,240
called

1102
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,520
them because you know

1103
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,000
objective i think the team shakti i mean

1104
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,440
when i say team shakti

1105
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,520
uh i don't mean just those that have

1106
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,800
actually organized this conference i

1107
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,200
invite

1108
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,960
everybody in the audience who would love

1109
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,480
to be part of this team

1110
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,920
to really chalk out a a you know an

1111
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,760
objective and a plan to be able to

1112
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,880
contribute

1113
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,000
um in in secure ways to be able to

1114
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,200
develop this country

1115
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,960
and and you know pretty much provide

1116
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,320
solutions

1117
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,720
to worldwide challenges in security

1118
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,480
especially affecting young people

1119
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,480
because team shakti is actually

1120
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,880
a group of very young women uh and i

1121
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
think them standing up for women which

1122
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,480
is kind of the core theme of this

1123
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,760
this this conference can be made true in

1124
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,079
addition to actually bringing together

1125
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,640
star wars like both of you to share your

1126
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,520
experiences

1127
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,119
with that i would really like can i

1128
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,560
thank both of you yes please

1129
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,040
can i say something just to uh just take

1130
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,240
another two minutes

1131
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,560
and i think in this kind of an audience

1132
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,320
i'd like to really flag an issue which

1133
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,079
has been really kind of you know it's

1134
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:18,800
been

1135
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,960
it's been bothering all of us uh quite a

1136
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,800
bit especially so me that is

1137
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
we have allowed with the internet and

1138
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,320
etc we have allowed

1139
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,200
the availability of information massive

1140
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,040
amounts of information to society

1141
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,480
especially to kids

1142
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,560
now what i find is like like in the

1143
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,480
initial stages of globalization you know

1144
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,520
the

1145
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,240
various aspects of globalization did

1146
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,320
affect social life it did affect crime

1147
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,240
it did affect social life etc

1148
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,920
so now with this massive amounts of

1149
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,599
information i find that

1150
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,839
we should really start looking at it and

1151
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,119
help children

1152
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,200
you know use that information filter

1153
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,040
that information i mean i'm just talking

1154
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,160
as it comes i mean

1155
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,680
you know kind of catalogue that

1156
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,599
information because i find that is that

1157
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,119
information is confusing them

1158
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,400
a lot that it's confusing them a lot so

1159
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,520
uh so i think this is one area where

1160
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,760
uh krishna we really have to work with

1161
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,359
schools and colleges because

1162
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,359
this is a future generation and many of

1163
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,760
them it leaves them with a crazy sense

1164
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,599
of ego that i know everything because it

1165
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,480
is online

1166
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,240
and i don't have to listen to it so that

1167
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,599
is one one issue

1168
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,040
the second thing is there's too many

1169
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,760
choices online it confuses them and then

1170
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,680
it it contributes to their mental health

1171
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,119
issues also you know

1172
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,319
this because there's too much of

1173
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:31,920
information getting into your head i

1174
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,480
mean

1175
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,720
so i think this is a very serious issue

1176
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,680
and uh

1177
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,760
we need to really work on this thank you

1178
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,440
wonderful definitely

1179
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,920
we will definitely do that uh i think we

1180
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,920
will definitely take that as a potential

1181
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,040
suggestion for the

1182
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,599
from this uh from this discussion uh

1183
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,640
thank you so much

1184
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,599
uh again and uh we really hope uh we

1185
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,000
will have

1186
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,160
more sessions from both of you your

1187
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,920
