um a little bit about me the background

34
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,320
i'm head of cyber security department in

35
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,400
the israel ministry of defense

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,880
i have two teams i have stock team and

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,280
digital forensics investigators team

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,240
and we'll talk about them separately and

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,880
so

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,119
that's it let's begin if you have any

41
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,439
questions during my presentation

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,479
please ask me anything if something is

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,680
not understood

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,159
if any concept is not understood please

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,880
uh

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,320
just ask that's fine

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,520
so my talk topics will be about

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,840
first we'll talk about the sock team

49
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,679
what is the purpose and what is the goal

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,239
of this

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,520
of this team and what is sim systems the

52
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,800
definition and the

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,000
infrastructure cyber event circle how do

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,879
we manage

55
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,239
this a complicated cyber event a

56
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,800
how do we manage it in the right way how

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,480
do we indicate the malware

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,280
what are my indicators um malware

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,160
analysis

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,640
what how do we analyze malware what is

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,040
the methods and the tools to do so

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,959
and and the end your questions and

63
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,519
references

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
now let's discuss a little bit about

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,440
sock sock is security operating center

66
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,480
uh it's a team usually built by five

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,519
to six team members and sometimes it's

68
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,519
even then it depends on the organization

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,800
and its needs

70
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,319
and the purpose and the goal of the

71
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,400
stock is to detect analyze

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,760
respond to cyber security incidents and

73
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,080
the main purpose is really to do this

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,599
the stock analyst

75
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,879
uh this team this team member has

76
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,840
its sim system we'll talk later about

77
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,879
what it means

78
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
and the sock analyst needs to

79
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,080
see the alerts that come on the sim

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
system and to investigate them

81
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,560
and try to understand what is happening

82
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,200
do i have

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,360
a real cyber event or it's something

84
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
that is maybe false positive

85
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,080
we need the eyes on the field as we say

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,599
and we need to understand

87
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,920
exactly what is happening to our

88
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,640
organization

89
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,879
what is sim system so sim system

90
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,760
c means security incident and event

91
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,120
management

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,319
the same has a couple of roles

93
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,120
first collect data from sources we have

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,239
different sources

95
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,879
that we would like to get a different

96
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,159
data from

97
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,640
all our main assets in our network we

98
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,680
would like to get

99
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,799
those logs and those uh

100
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,920
and this that this data to get into our

101
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
sim system

102
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,439
after we did that we want to aggregate

103
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,159
this data

104
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,640
we want to take this whole data and

105
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,000
aggregate it together

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,440
so the stock analyst can try and

107
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,399
work with this data and get to build

108
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,199
those

109
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,759
alerts um and then to get the full

110
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,120
system

111
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,840
after the stock analyst has built those

112
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,479
alerts

113
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,680
and the same purpose now is to discover

114
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,320
and detect those threats and let the

115
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,280
stock analyst

116
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,639
really know that something happened and

117
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,040
then the then we want the scene to

118
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,320
identify bridges

119
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,040
and investigate alerts now when the

120
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,000
stock analyst

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,840
saw that there is something is happening

122
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,040
there is an alert

123
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,800
we want the stock analyst to really

124
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,479
investigate those alerts

125
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,639
and get to know if there is something

126
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,680
that is real

127
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,000
there is an attacker in my network or

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,759
it's just false positive

129
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,520
usually it's it's a it's a lot of false

130
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,960
positive that is happening

131
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,320
and it's also that the stock analyst job

132
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,440
to really try to minimum

133
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,639
uh try really to make

134
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,960
at least uh not thought of false

135
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,759
positive

136
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,160
but really to find a real attacker and

137
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,440
make those

138
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,039
false positive not a lot

139
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,560
a little bit about the same

140
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,440
infrastructure and we have our event

141
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,880
sources

142
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,000
we have firewall network devices servers

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,120
endpoints everything that creates logs

144
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,680
in our network we would like to get to

145
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,120
collect this data

146
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,680
to collect those logs and get this into

147
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,800
my scene

148
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,160
so how do i do that i take specific

149
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,479
connectors that connect to the event

150
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,360
sources

151
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,800
i connect them into the event sources

152
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,600
and then when i connect them i can get

153
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,440
all of the data from the different event

154
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,240
sources

155
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,080
to my a specific server of the sim

156
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,319
the server the same contains all the

157
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,800
data of the sim all the logs

158
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,600
and then from this server we get all our

159
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,800
security alerts

160
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,840
to the terminal the same or specific

161
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,800
and unique dashboard we can also

162
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,080
transfer this data

163
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,960
to forensics analysis database this is

164
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,000
also an option

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,160
really recommended but this is not the

166
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,720
same this is like a different sandbox

167
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,280
made

168
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,240
for investigating the forensics of the

169
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,199
data

170
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,360
really recommended a lot of organization

171
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,479
do that today

172
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,240
um but this is not the same

173
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,840
so how the sim dashboard looks like this

174
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,280
is just an example

175
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,000
there are a lot of companies that build

176
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,720
those

177
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,240
cme systems and the dashboards looks uh

178
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,880
different from any sim system and also

179
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,080
work differently

180
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,639
but this is just an example as you can

181
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,800
see in the sim dashboard you have

182
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
you can create new rules you can create

183
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,039
new alerts alert and rule it's

184
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,520
almost practically the same and you can

185
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,039
create a template

186
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,919
you can see down down the page you can

187
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,240
see

188
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,280
tag tag categories this is your event

189
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,039
sources you have devices

190
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,680
endpoints and anything that you

191
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,000
connected a connector to

192
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,960
and you can see their alerts um let's

193
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
take for an example the first alert we

194
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,400
see on the dashboard

195
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,520
we see critical account logon failures

196
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,919
what does it mean well i haven't built

197
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,400
this sim dashboard but i can assume what

198
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,520
does it mean from

199
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,039
this name um critical account

200
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,520
critical account means an account with

201
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,400
privileged

202
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,680
permissions and they the sock team

203
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,560
of this dashboard they tagged specific

204
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,919
critical account

205
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,240
and they said this critical account is

206
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,120
very critical

207
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,840
it has really privileged permissions if

208
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,160
someone tries to break into this account

209
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,280
tries to log on many many times

210
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,680
this can indicate that maybe i have

211
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,400
brute force attack on my organization

212
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,960
a brute force attack is an attack a

213
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,319
well-known attack

214
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,000
that the attacker tries to get into a

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,680
tries to get into different accounts in

216
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,840
my organization by just guessing the

217
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,560
password

218
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,240
it can be guessing like two three times

219
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,960
and can be

220
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,039
really a thousand times of guessing

221
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,720
until at some point

222
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,120
the attacker might succeed to get into

223
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,080
my network

224
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,159
so we don't want the attacker to get

225
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,440
into my network at

226
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,479
all at any time but we specifically

227
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,479
don't want the attacker to get with a

228
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,399
really a sensitive

229
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,800
and with with privileged permissions to

230
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,120
my network we don't want this to happen

231
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,279
so the sock team they made a good

232
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,320
decision to

233
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,680
build an alert on the subject the modern

234
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,160
alert

235
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,959
that um that shows you that someone

236
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,560
tries to log on to this

237
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,680
a privilege a permission account this

238
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,640
critical account

239
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,760
many times and this one failed a lot of

240
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,320
times

241
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
and it can maybe indicate the brute

242
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,760
force today

243
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,040
the rest of the alerts i won't pass but

244
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,920
of course

245
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,040
you can ask me anything later or no

246
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,160
so the cyber event circle what do we do

247
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,240
when we face a real time event

248
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,959
as i said on the cma we see a lot of

249
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,080
alerts every day

250
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,399
most of them will be false positive will

251
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,200
be something legitimate a user did or

252
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,880
the systems did but we see it as a

253
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,519
as a cyber event but what do we do when

254
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,160
we know

255
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,760
that now we have an attacker uh

256
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,440
first we will start with the

257
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,880
identification

258
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,000
that sock analyst as i said he

259
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,120
or she the team member sits in the sock

260
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,080
and

261
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,720
identified that there is alert and we

262
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,279
need to

263
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,360
investigate it right now after an

264
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,519
investigation on the logs and the data

265
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,480
of the steam

266
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,120
we detect uh that there is something

267
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,399
suspicious that

268
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,120
there is an attacker and we detect what

269
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,399
it's doing the attacker maybe

270
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,720
the attacker has a malware in my system

271
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,440
or maybe

272
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
the attacker ran just really suspicious

273
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,279
commands on my server

274
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,320
after we detected what the attacker is

275
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,959
doing

276
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,880
and where he is right now so

277
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,920
after we detected it we want to respond

278
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
what does it mean this is a really

279
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,279
really tricky uh

280
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,160
phase in the cyber security event

281
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,360
management

282
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,640
the person who runs this a

283
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,120
really complicated cyber event that

284
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,200
leads it and manages it

285
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,480
needs to make a tough decision we need

286
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,279
to understand

287
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,880
if we want to block the attacker we want

288
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,440
to block

289
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,720
the user or the computer of the attacker

290
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,480
or maybe we want to let the attacker

291
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,040
move on with this with its activities to

292
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,920
maybe see

293
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,200
uh what does he do and and how he

294
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,720
responds to things and

295
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,600
how he does all this so this is a really

296
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,120
tough question

297
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,240
he doesn't have um an answer

298
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,959
it really depends on the situation and

299
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,720
at the end we would like to

300
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,600
recover the network our main goal in

301
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,279
cyber event it's very important to

302
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,240
understand

303
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,880
that we want to recover our network and

304
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,519
clear it

305
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,000
from the attacker as soon as possible

306
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,760
imagine a scenario where you come to

307
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,160
your

308
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,800
work place and all the computers are

309
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,760
locked down

310
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,000
no one is working so it's a huge

311
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,920
financial damage to your organization

312
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,600
and in cyber security people

313
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,720
we need to bring the the work to the

314
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,200
people

315
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,680
as fast as possible so this is really

316
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,440
the main goal to recover

317
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,160
our network

318
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,560
now let's discuss a little bit digital

319
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,959
forensics inside response team what is

320
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,800
the purpose and their goal

321
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
and their important role in this

322
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,880
complicated situation

323
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,360
so the main focus of digital forensics

324
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,639
investigations

325
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,600
uh is to recover objective evidence of

326
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,079
criminal

327
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,839
activity on a server or a computer or

328
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,360
any device in our network

329
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,600
we have a lot of evidences of what the

330
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,560
attacker

331
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,839
did and we need those this team to

332
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,680
investigate it even deeper

333
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
the difference between the stock analyst

334
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,519
that the stock investigates

335
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,399
the investigates what's happening on the

336
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,680
sim system

337
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,880
on the data on the theme on the logs

338
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,639
here the those investigators the dfir

339
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,079
they go to the server or the computer

340
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,639
and investigate it even deeper not based

341
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,440
on the

342
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,079
sim logs

343
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,040
so the main question here that needs to

344
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,680
be asked

345
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,079
what are we looking for as the edge

346
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,079
digital forensics investigator

347
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,279
what do i look for what what what do i

348
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,639
need to find to say

349
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,120
there is something suspicious in here so

350
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,560
we have indicators

351
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,720
indicators are items that indicate a

352
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,800
computer has been infected

353
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,440
we have two types of indicators we have

354
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
network indicator this is something that

355
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,240
can be found

356
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,120
also on the steam system by the sox but

357
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,839
usually

358
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,920
um and also not usually we can find it

359
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,200
a also on the computer or the host

360
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,480
that's been infected

361
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,440
so what is network indicator can be any

362
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,000
suspicious connection in your network

363
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,639
it can be connection to a known ip

364
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,320
address connection to unknown

365
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,519
dns address anything that is not

366
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,160
normal any connection that is not normal

367
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,240
also we have the host indicator it's

368
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,720
specific items on your os that can

369
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,600
indicate your computer is being infected

370
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,320
so

371
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,720
what does it mean if there is if there

372
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,279
has been a change in the important os

373
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,160
files

374
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,360
such as an example as host host file is

375
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,959
a file that comes before

376
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,920
the dns server of your organization so

377
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,600
if someone changed it

378
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,839
it can be really suspicious it's not

379
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,519
it's not supposed to be changed

380
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,360
and this is just an example there are a

381
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,600
lot of important os files that you

382
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,399
should be

383
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,519
following always monitor changing

384
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,120
registry key values

385
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,399
the registry is the main and the heart

386
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,560
of the windows os in the registry

387
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,959
everything is happening every software

388
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,480
everything that has read on your

389
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,800
computer is documented in there

390
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,160
so as a digital forensics investigator

391
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,560
you would like to get this registry

392
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,040
and investigate it really deeply because

393
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,160
all your evidence is

394
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,639
almost all of your angry dentists are

395
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,079
there everything that run

396
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,560
you can find the evidence in there uh

397
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,600
changing the manual

398
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,199
in the memory values in the ram the ram

399
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,680
every every software runs also in the

400
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,320
ram

401
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,839
so if something where if there was any

402
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,399
a change in the memory values you would

403
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,440
like to know it's

404
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
very interesting evidence there are a

405
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,519
lot of different evidences this is

406
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,040
just a really three examples but

407
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,880
this is the beginning and really good

408
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,199
start

409
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,600
a little bit about malware analysis so

410
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,959
um as a digital forensics instigator i

411
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,040
would like to take the malware

412
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,160
and try to investigate it uh the best

413
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,560
way i can and the deeper way i can

414
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,920
this is the keyword to malware analysis

415
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,639
we have a lot of methods a lot of tools

416
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,360
so

417
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,959
um we have the basic static analysis

418
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,000
um it's the

419
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,759
basic static analysis it's when you run

420
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,639
sorry excuse me basic static analyzes is

421
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,399
when you don't run the malware

422
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,680
you look only for the strings and

423
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,399
all those methods you can do it together

424
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,000
you can do it step by step

425
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,839
usually you do it step by step but

426
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,920
you can also sometimes skip two

427
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,880
different

428
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,360
method different tool it really depends

429
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,480
on the malware and

430
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,880
on the tool so basic static analyzes

431
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,519
it's just strings you don't run the file

432
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,040
you only look for the strings because

433
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,759
the strings

434
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,120
can give you some clues about what uh

435
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,560
what the malware is doing so after you

436
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,519
did that

437
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,000
you maybe want to move forward to basic

438
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
dynamic analysis

439
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,759
and you want to run the file in an

440
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,079
intended sandbox you don't want to run

441
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,120
this file

442
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,279
on your network you don't want to infect

443
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,399
it even more

444
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,040
so you take the malware and you move it

445
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,160
you copy it

446
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,199
to an intended sandbox then you run it

447
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,040
and in the background of your computer

448
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,839
you run this is internals tools

449
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,160
in one to sentence what is sysenterio's

450
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,079
tools um

451
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,000
you can yeah you can read about it

452
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,120
deeper later

453
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,480
one sentence it's tools uh

454
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,959
those tools are made and developed by

455
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,000
microsoft

456
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,640
to windows environment so you can

457
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,799
analyze and detect and troubleshoot

458
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,640
anything that happens on your computer

459
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,679
in live

460
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,079
so when you run this malware you can

461
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,160
open those tools in the background

462
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,559
and really investigate what happens to

463
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,199
your computer when you run the malware

464
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,280
after you did that you can do advanced

465
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,720
static analysis

466
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,080
using the disassembler such as ida ida

467
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,120
is a perfect tool to do reverse

468
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,960
engineering of the malware

469
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,240
to really go deep into this code and

470
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,360
analyze what is happening and what the

471
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,480
malware

472
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,880
is doing what its capabilities in the

473
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
deepest way

474
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,280
and it's an amazing way to really get to

475
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
know all the capabilities of the malware

476
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,679
and it's really difficult it's very

477
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,640
challenging

478
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,840
um my workers

479
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,960
they study it a lot of time to really

480
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,280
get

481
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,039
it to understand it because it's

482
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,960
assembly uh

483
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,760
knowing assembly language is very hard

484
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,880
it's not python

485
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,520
it's a really hard because sometimes

486
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,120
it's even binary

487
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,600
so you really want to know how to use

488
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,880
this technique

489
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,600
and the last one advanced dynamic

490
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,720
analysis

491
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,360
using a debugger and running line by

492
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,240
line

493
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,480
your malware code so you take the

494
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,000
debugger and you run it

495
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,640
really line by line to get to know all

496
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,160
the steps of your malware

497
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,120
and to understand and to understand what

498
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,080
is the steps

499
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,600
and what it's doing really line by line

500
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,880
as i said usually you do

501
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,039
usually you do all of this step by step

502
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,720
but sometimes in really

503
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,880
specific situations we would like to

504
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
jump right into the advanced

505
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,000
static analysis because we know that we

506
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,039
need it right now

507
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,200
and we don't have time to waste on just

508
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,480
strings or

509
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,760
sysinternal stools and sometimes we know

510
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,679
that we don't have to really break our

511
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,480
heads on

512
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,880
advanced static analysis with ida we can

513
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,559
really find the solution

514
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,640
on basic dynamic analysis it really

515
