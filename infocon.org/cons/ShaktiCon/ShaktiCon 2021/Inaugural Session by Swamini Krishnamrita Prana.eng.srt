1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,800
it is such an honor to have with us

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,080
swamini krishnam

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,720
prana one of the most senior disciples

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,919
of amma

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,559
swamini krishna rita prana was born in

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,840
australia

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,080
she became interested in spirituality

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,360
after feeling that there's

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,119
something more to life than simply

10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,359
acquiring material pleasures

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,840
she traveled through asia to discover

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,760
what life was all about

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,560
her final destination was india when she

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,119
first saw shri mata amrita nandame known

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,080
as amma

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,558
sitting in a small coconut attached hut

17
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,719
there were only 14 residents living in

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,920
the ashram

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,640
today the ashram known as amrita puri

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,280
accommodates several thousand people

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,600
swamini has accompanied amman all

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,399
offered to us

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,719
both in india and around the world for

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,559
the last 38 years

25
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,480
she has written seven books about her

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,160
experience of life with amma

27
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,280
and spirituality i now kindly invite

conference

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,880
wherever you may be in the world i must

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,960
admit when i first saw the poster that

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,799
included the eminent speakers who are

45
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,880
going to address you during the

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,040
three days of this conference i had a

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,079
very wow

48
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,640
moment all of the women are dazzling

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,759
forms of female

50
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,880
shakti making up a very impressive array

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,240
of speakers

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,720
on all sorts of fascinating topics that

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,680
i didn't even know

54
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,280
existed i wish everyone much success in

55
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,720
learning new things

56
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,799
and i wish you even more success in the

57
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,320
complicated task

58
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,560
of translating this new knowledge into

59
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,520
something great

60
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,640
that you can use to help others

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,320
when we look at the world today it

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,000
certainly has become very different

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
from a few years ago especially now

64
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,280
cyber security has become so very

65
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,400
important

66
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
it is imperative that everything be

67
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,480
protected in these

68
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,360
difficult times threats appear from

69
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,000
everywhere

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,200
in so many hidden dangerous ways but

71
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
luckily for everyone

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,200
we have at our helm the guiding force of

73
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,080
a great soul

74
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,879
in the form of amma amma bestows

75
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,680
blessings and protection for everyone

76
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,680
she inspires millions of people all

77
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,959
around the world to live

78
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,599
meaningful and happy lives filled with

79
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,160
love

80
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,599
compassion and selfless service

81
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,000
amma offers the ultimate true and

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,840
genuine protection

83
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,879
protection for our souls hopefully you

84
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,720
will be able to invite something good

85
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,840
from watching the way

86
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,080
she lives her life and performs

87
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,360
wholehearted selfless actions

88
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
i have to admit that i really don't know

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,599
so much about the cyber security world

90
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,480
at all

91
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,120
in my imagination i see people in their

92
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,239
avatars

93
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,239
climbing into little spaceships and

94
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,080
whizzing around the world

95
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,800
and to all different galaxies under a

96
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
cloak of invisibility

97
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,040
just like harry potter ready to battle

98
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,680
all of the evil demons out there

99
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,319
avatars working on the side of dharma

100
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,400
and righteousness

101
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
now i know it's a bit silly for my

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,680
imagination to conjure up

103
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,799
spaceships but i do know it is true that

104
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,640
you are all battling on the side of

105
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,239
righteousness

106
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,840
and even though i'm not a high-tech

107
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,920
person at all as you can probably tell

108
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,720
from the way i

109
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,760
associate computers with spaceships i

110
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
thank you so much on behalf of the world

111
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,799
for what you do

112
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,319
to keep us safe and in that way

113
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,519
we're not so different here at amazon

114
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,000
we're working to help uplift society and

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,760
protect it from darkness

116
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,680
just like all of you are working to

117
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,640
offer protection

118
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,239
even though you might not travel in a

119
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,799
spaceship i know you will have a toolbox

120
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,720
full of high-tech tricks and perhaps

121
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,799
even a magic wand in some form or

122
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,879
another to fix thing

123
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,358
i'm here to remind you that along with

124
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,040
all the things that you will keep in

125
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,918
your fix-it

126
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,120
toolboxes just remember to also keep

127
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,759
some of the old-fashioned things too

128
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,120
hard work compassion empathy

129
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,600
and patience with these ethical

130
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,880
qualities

131
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,720
when they become the backbone of your

132
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,240
work you will find

133
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,280
both success and happiness wherever you

134
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,919
go

135
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,880
and in whatever you do women hold the

136
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,199
capacity to be able to do anything at

137
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,600
all that we set our minds to

138
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,240
dharmic tendencies are inherent within

139
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,960
us

140
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,199
so i just want to remind that we should

141
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,199
always try to give something back to

142
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,400
society

143
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,560
especially when our own needs are taken

144
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,360
care of so gracefully

145
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
there are so many good qualities waiting

146
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,400
inside of us

147
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,320
eager for the chance to come out into

148
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
the world and help the world to shine a

149
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,960
little brighter in difficult times

150
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,759
we can brighten up the darkness if we

151
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,240
really try

152
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,560
a few years ago i accompanied my tour

153
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
conference in the middle east

154
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,919
along with alma a few of us were

155
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,000
accommodated in a very magnificent

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,280
opulent palace style hotel for two days

157
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,160
it was a picture of absolute luxury the

158
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,400
whole hotel and all of the rooms were

159
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,759
huge

160
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,680
inside our rooms and the wall was a

161
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,440
panel of complicated

162
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,000
almost hidden electronics to turn on and

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,440
off the lights

164
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,280
but we actually ended up staying in a

165
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,199
half dark room for much of the time as

166
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,960
we just could not figure out how to

167
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,199
operate the high-tech hidden system

168
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,479
properly

169
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,720
luckily we're used to a simple life in

170
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,120
india so we manage with very little

171
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,319
light

172
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,639
ammo was in a separate room about 30

173
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,680
meters away

174
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,560
with two bodyguards stationed outside of

175
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,280
her room for security

176
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,199
at the end of the first day's event we

177
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,280
returned to our luxury palace

178
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,440
which was really very lonely as there

179
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,080
was not a person inside along the long

180
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,560
sprawling section where we were staying

181
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,880
except for the two burly bodyguards of

182
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,319
course

183
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,319
that evening i just happened to be

184
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,160
standing by my front door

185
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,960
with nothing to do when i saw a filipino

186
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,880
priest in the distance

187
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
this priest had been one of the speakers

188
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,840
that day and was coming out of his room

189
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,680
he had the room next to amma on the

190
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,039
opposite side to me

191
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,080
he was about 50 meters away i watched as

192
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,199
he came up to the guards and asked me

193
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,520
excuse me but do you know how i can turn

194
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,720
the lights on in my room they answered a

195
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,000
quick and sour

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,360
no so he walked ejectedly back to his

197
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,240
room

198
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,319
there wasn't another person in sight to

199
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,560
help him and i knew that the front desk

200
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:58,880
was

201
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,360
miles away very complicated to reach as

202
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,000
i'd been there

203
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,120
only once so i made my way over to help

204
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,280
him find the light panel

205
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,680
i said hello to him and admitted that i

206
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,039
hadn't been able to work out the

207
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,520
electrical panel completely myself

208
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,199
but showed him that if he pressed in a

209
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,440
certain place in a certain way

210
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,199
that at least some light would come on

211
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,919
somewhere he was extremely grateful for

212
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,199
my help

213
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,560
i mentioned that i thought it was

214
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,319
actually a lot more comfortable

215
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,720
and easier to manage in a very simple

216
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,000
place and it was in this

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,599
fancy palace he wholeheartedly agreed

218
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,880
a simple home full of love is definitely

219
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,599
much better than fancy palace

220
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,080
and that was truly our experience after

221
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,400
dwelling in that large and lonely palace

222
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,000
for two days

223
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,560
simplicity and humility bring more

224
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,360
comfort

225
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,560
than luxury or greed ever can so don't

226
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,360
forget

227
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,440
when you deal with your fancy gadgets

228
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,479
and complicated technological fix-its

229
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,160
always remember that the simple

230
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
old-fashioned ways

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,759
they had their own particular magic

232
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,000
about them and can make our life feel

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,720
more whole

234
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,160
and complete one of the biggest

235
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,680
misconceptions that we have in life

236
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,599
is that we think we are all so different

237
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,800
from each other

238
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,680
while in fact we are all in essence

239
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,039
quite similar

240
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,199
everyone craves for love and peace in

241
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,479
their life

242
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,960
the main problem is that most people end

243
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,039
up looking in all the wrong places for

244
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,160
it

245
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,000
just as you strive to cleanse the

246
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,399
computer systems of viruses

247
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,679
so amma is here to do her job too she's

248
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,240
the greatest cleaner in the world

249
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
and she was asked by a reporter once

250
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,839
what her goal was

251
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,279
she said that she would like to be a

252
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,680
sweeper sweeping the minds of

253
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,320
people she wants to clean away the dirt

254
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,480
so that our real divine essence can

255
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,160
shine through

256
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,839
one day while we were traveling we

257
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,080
stopped in transit in dubai

258
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,920
a man working as a cleaner at the

259
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,160
airport recognized him and came to her

260
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,279
to ask her for her blessings he told

261
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,200
amma that he had not been home in a long

262
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,120
time as his cleaning work did not earn

263
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,640
him so much money

264
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,560
he also admitted to her that he was a

265
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,920
little ashamed to be

266
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,120
doing this kind of work alma smiled at

267
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
him and caressed his shoulder

268
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,519
she put her hand on his heart then she

269
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,279
said to him

270
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,000
son don't feel so bad for doing this

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,480
kind of

272
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,200
work it's not so bad to clean the dirt

273
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,160
of others

274
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,519
amma does this too he was so happy to

275
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,279
hear these words from her

276
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,600
it gave him the courage to keep on going

277
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,480
knowing alma

278
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,680
and he were in the same business and i

279
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,720
think a lot of you

280
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,959
had the opportunity to work in the noble

281
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,000
profession

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,080
of cleaning away dirt and helping to

283
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,680
purify our world

284
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,040
at least in some way we all have a small

285
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,240
form of amma

286
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,800
or the divine essence however you

287
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,839
conceive it to be

288
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,040
inside of us this innate divinity urges

289
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,360
us

290
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,720
on to do good things in our lives

291
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,320
one day i was with amma when she was

292
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
given the phone to talk to a devotee in

293
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
london who had recently given birth to

294
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,920
her first child

295
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,000
amma asked her how the baby was doing

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
and if she was able to breastfeed

297
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
the new mother said that the baby

298
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,760
actually preferred to drink from a

299
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,560
bottle as it could get milk more quickly

300
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,440
so she wasn't breastfeeding the baby i

301
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,160
was a bit shocked that in today's world

302
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,800
even the babies prefer fast food instead

303
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,760
of their mother's

304
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,120
precious nourishing breast milk

305
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,760
here in the amrita puri ashram amma pays

306
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,040
a lot of attention

307
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,600
to the small children she talks with

308
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
them and encourages them to learn the

309
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,000
stories in the scriptures in order to

310
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,560
help them develop good qualities

311
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,360
sometimes

312
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,440
sometimes it takes a lot of patience for

313
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,920
us to hear ahmad talk so much to them

314
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,959
about every little aspect of their life

315
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,519
but the other day i heard her say that

316
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,600
it is because she knows that so many

317
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,920
temptations of drugs or different bad

318
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,000
habits or negative choices

319
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,079
may arise for them in the future and

320
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,200
tempt them

321
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,040
she wants to give them the strength to

322
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,240
live a good life

323
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,959
and turn away from harmful behaviors

324
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,880
this is a reason that she's laying down

325
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,800
a good foundation for them now

326
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,120
when they are still young so that they

327
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,480
are equipped to deal with all the

328
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,720
problems that will inevitably arise for

329
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
them in the future

330
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,040
years ago when we were traveling on our

331
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,560
tours by room

332
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,959
there was one small child who loved emma

333
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,360
so much that he insisted on traveling in

334
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,800
alma's camper vehicle

335
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,880
along with us one day amma turned to him

336
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,880
and asked him to see a serious question

337
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,920
why were you born she asked

338
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,760
he looked at her with a blank look on

339
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,600
his face as he could not think of an

340
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,959
answer at all

341
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,160
alma told him the answer is

342
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,519
to know who i am and to serve others

343
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,160
then she told him to repeat these words

344
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,560
five times every single day

345
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,360
i was born to know who i am and to serve

346
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,079
others

347
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,720
i was born to know who i am and to serve

348
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,519
others

349
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,800
to say this five times every day

350
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,480
i think that when emma was giving that

351
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,639
advice to the small boy she was truly

352
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,880
giving it to all of us too

353
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,519
while engaged in your technical work

354
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,760
staring at computer screens all day and

355
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,720
contemplating

356
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,519
solutions for major problems try to

357
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,440
remember to take a few moments

358
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,320
now and then to breathe deeply and close

359
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,440
your eyes

360
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,160
consciously slow down the breath regain

361
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,360
your center

362
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,519
and remember the bigger picture of why

363
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,959
we're all here

364
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,040
you have to look after yourself a little

365
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,279
to be able to help others

366
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,680
no matter where we may be or what we may

367
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,320
do

368
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,240
we're all walking the path to become a

369
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,600
better human being

370
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,240
and to serve society so that they may

371
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,320
want this too

372
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,480
many people choose only to strive on the

373
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,760
path towards name

374
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,480
fame and power as their goal but these

375
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,800
people rarely attain a satisfying

376
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,920
life filled with peace of mind and joy

377
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,399
when your goals are purely selfish there

378
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,160
will always be something missing

379
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,079
even if you manage to achieve all your

380
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,920
material goals

381
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,560
the missing ingredient is the happiness

382
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,839
that we get from serving

383
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,480
others dedicating a little of our time

384
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,800
to helping those in need

385
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,480
this doesn't mean that you have to give

386
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,240
anything up

387
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,279
in fact it is just the opposite

388
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,079
we just add a little more you can still

389
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,560
smite your cyber enemies into a pile of

390
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,120
electrical dust with a triumphant cry of

391
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,000
victory

392
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,240
but just remember to add a prayer that

393
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,639
your enemies may find the right path one

394
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,839
day

395
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,839
when our foundation is built on good

396
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,560
qualities and the true understanding

397
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,800
about where we will find an unshakable

398
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,920
strength

399
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,800
from the divinity within then we find it

400
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,079
easier to deal with

401
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,839
any and all problems that arise from

402
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,600
life i pray for you all to find

403
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,720
success satisfaction and joy in your

404
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,440
work

405
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,839
and to be able to pass it on to others

406
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,240
as well

407
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,880
thank you swamini for your ever

408
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,720
inspiring words and sharing your

409
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,199
insights on a balanced lifestyle

410
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,600
as you rightly said cyber security

411
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,160
professionals should strive to sweep

412
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,519
and erase the dirt in the cyberspace

413
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,839
this brings us to the end of our segment
