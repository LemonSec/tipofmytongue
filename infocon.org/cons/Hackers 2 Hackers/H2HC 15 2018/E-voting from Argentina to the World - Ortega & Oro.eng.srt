00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:16,529
[Music]

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,449
from Argentina to the world first of all

3
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:24,029
meet Oprah God oh well a pillow

4
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:27,480
committed and what is Alfred Sega he's

5
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:31,470
gonna join me in the talk okay and he's

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,590
hackin he's one Merle Haggard nickname

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,870
is hacking because he hacks things so I

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,430
have a pretty good guy as you can read

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,589
here awesome

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,200
yeah he said he's a white hot so be

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,190
careful with that so first first of all

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,539
we are going to define some paneling is

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:55,949
for our talk because we are going to

14
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:59,120
talk about a about every voting system

15
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:04,069
in particular those from Argentina so

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:07,770
just to begin with we're gonna say that

17
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:10,080
okay yeah this is better any voting

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,270
system must determine eight who won the

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,880
election and convinced the losers that

20
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,220
they lost very recently I read a

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,649
statistics about here in Brazil that

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,560
said that less than fourteen percent of

23
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,070
the people actually trusted the the the

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,890
voting system that's really bad because

25
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,570
if the civilians if the people don't

26
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,100
trust in the system if the system

27
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,529
doesn't work we are gonna say also that

28
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:39,869
no technology can fix a political issue

29
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:44,130
voting and democracy is a political

30
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:46,829
issue a civilian societal issue an issue

31
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,199
for of the society we can apply

32
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,270
technology to it but we are not going to

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,540
solve it just by using technology and

34
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,960
finally if the boat must be kept secret

35
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,430
and it it must be kept secret because

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,589
it's the it's in the universal

37
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,049
declaration of human of human rights if

38
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,060
the vote must be kept secret no current

39
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:10,349
technology other than pen and paper can

40
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:13,770
solve the issue so at this point you

41
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:18,410
already can can already see where it is

42
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:22,230
Chuck is going we are not evil team fans

43
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,400
and we are going to show why this is you

44
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,250
know what happened with the boat is not

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,790
secret you got Twitter that's why it

46
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,510
sucks

47
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,310
Twitter boating is not secret so it's a

48
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,290
big part of why Twitter is Luckies

49
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,530
exactly and you to be secret so that's

50
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,530
the difference

51
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:48,330
exactly so let's take a quick overview

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:53,160
on the ocean sign electorate system this

53
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:56,760
is just just to build a big picture and

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,230
to understand what the the electronic

55
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,640
voting systems that we are going to talk

56
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,570
about are trying to solve

57
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:07,459
well a brief explanation we in Argentina

58
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:10,530
have a two-round system similar to yours

59
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,120
we use people Intel and pre-marked party

60
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,800
ballots which is the French ballot

61
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,690
system I'm going to show you an example

62
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:21,060
of those ballots alternatively on some

63
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,390
situations unique paper ballots are used

64
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,200
in Argentina for example for voters for

65
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:31,260
in in other countries Argentine several

66
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,459
other inmates also the vote must be

67
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:40,079
universal equal mandatory and secret

68
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:43,200
Universal this is established by the our

69
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,270
Constitution what it must be secret your

70
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,000
already said you're why it's mandatory

71
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:51,420
meaning that everybody must vote it's

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,880
equal meaning everybody's vote is why

73
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,809
it's the same it's just one vote and

74
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:00,329
it's universal this this is an example

75
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:04,640
of a paper ballot it's a pre-printed

76
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:09,630
valid one can choose to cut the ballot

77
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:12,958
and mix them in the way they want this

78
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:17,159
is a really annoying system it's really

79
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:20,820
crappy but it's the one we have even

80
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:24,000
though I said we don't we don't support

81
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,349
a voting we actually don't support this

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,210
system either we prefer you

83
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,280
about it you need paper ballots which is

84
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,620
much much better I think you already

85
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,130
know the unique paper ballot system you

86
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,930
have used it in the past here in Brazil

87
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:42,460
although I know it has been some many

88
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:47,170
many years ago that this is the the

89
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:50,380
overall procedure once people has voted

90
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:54,400
and each vote is goes to a ballot box

91
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:59,640
then at the end of the of the voting of

92
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:02,530
the voting day the box is open the

93
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:07,650
president of the polling station counts

94
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,650
the votes it gets it gets a system

95
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:15,789
my assistants of each different

96
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:18,390
political party and that defines the the

97
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:23,920
what it's called the table scrutiny

98
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:26,380
after that a telegram is sent as the

99
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,500
preliminary count which gets to the news

100
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,870
and after that we have the definite the

101
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,050
definitive count which happens like one

102
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:37,690
or two weeks after that that this is the

103
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,280
the overall procedure for Argentina you

104
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:44,530
have a very similar procedure here

105
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,669
except that you use about him probably

106
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:50,979
sorry that was the word I was looking

107
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:53,760
for so as I said the in the polling

108
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,830
station the president counts the votes

109
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,909
we make the telegram annex

110
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:03,070
these are speci special certified papers

111
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:06,490
that counts for the prover sorry for the

112
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:08,800
promissory result and then the final

113
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,250
result is done in a by the judicial

114
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,910
branch and it takes like about two or

115
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:20,620
three weeks two or three weeks long

116
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:23,230
something like that now we have been

117
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,170
working in different places

118
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,860
it has me we are different glasses yeah

119
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,790
that's him

120
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,110
that's Javier's maldonia also a partner

121
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,630
who couldn't come today

122
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,640
the other one is me we have been at the

123
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,710
Congress we have delay the

124
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,240
implementation of a voting nationwide we

125
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,690
didn't stop it because it still

126
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:48,639
very alive very real actually just

127
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:51,250
recently we learned the the next week a

128
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,610
new law is going to passed in our city

129
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:57,490
in autonomous city of honest I discover

130
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:59,880
to use actually II vote in there we are

131
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,380
going to talk about that in a moment

132
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,319
well this this thing was going to happen

133
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,930
nationwide but luckily it didn't because

134
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:12,580
of our economy as you know our economy

135
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:16,349
went went sour so the machines were too

136
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,490
too expensive but we'll see what happens

137
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:21,099
now we are going to talk a little bit

138
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:23,320
about the unique electronic palette over

139
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:28,060
little unique electronica which is a

140
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:33,719
patented system by the MMS a company who

141
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:37,539
research it between 2015 and 2017 and we

142
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:40,810
published several reports we found many

143
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:43,780
issues all of those were fixed by the

144
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:48,030
vendor the vendor did it silently of

145
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:51,340
course they didn't reward us at all yes

146
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,309
there are no way to see if I if you fix

147
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,440
it or not because it's closed so

148
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,469
apparently it fixed yeah yeah that's

149
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,940
that's a that's a good quote because

150
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:03,550
yeah the source code it's actually

151
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:08,169
closed we got our hands in the source

152
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:10,659
code through a magic way some some

153
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,940
somebody named from a fierce actually

154
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:20,530
published the code online so we got

155
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:21,909
access to it but what magic because it's

156
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,020
very hard to lick this kind of software

157
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:26,169
I mean this is we are talking about

158
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:29,139
mafia here we do have to basically steal

159
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:32,169
a machine under today that the CEO of

160
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:34,209
the military people and leak it over

161
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,610
where I add nowadays I don't know how

162
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,468
this guy did because this is basically

163
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,209
put his life in danger

164
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:41,620
there's a guy in Congo to actually look

165
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:44,290
at the source code of the voting

166
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,269
machines and he had to travel to I think

167
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,849
to London

168
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:50,790
or the other kind of acai because they

169
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,980
were to killing him I mean it is this is

170
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,139
not a good research to do I mean if you

171
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,999
are thinking about doing this it's not a

172
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:59,399
good idea I mean it's nice to see

173
00:08:56,999 --> 00:09:01,350
results but if you want to start it I

174
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,420
know you don't you don't have an army to

175
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,059
bug you probably but come on I won

176
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:10,860
encourage them to actually lick codes to

177
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:12,569
lick sources of this kind of yeah it's a

178
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,980
dangerous idea but I really want to

179
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:16,290
encourage you to do it we are going to

180
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,769
talk a little bit about that in a moment

181
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,459
but seriously it's dangerous I know I

182
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:22,920
know

183
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,949
leaking things can be very complicated

184
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,509
but it's it's it's a good action

185
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:30,508
eventually well we finally got

186
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:34,800
recognized by Alex Halderman kudos to

187
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:38,160
him let's let's begin with the technical

188
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,790
part so you don't fall asleep this

189
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,618
voting system uses paper backup it's

190
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,559
based on Ubuntu Linux it's written in

191
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:48,119
Python or has a web front-end it's just

192
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,299
recently very recently implemented

193
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:53,970
crypto when we analyzed it it didn't

194
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,259
have any kind of crypto the application

195
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,769
the Python application and everything

196
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:01,709
else one has route directly the vote is

197
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:06,869
printed and it's also stored in an RFID

198
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:11,099
chip it's sunny so 1569 three the

199
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:13,649
machine uses uses this information to

200
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,290
vote and then to count those votes the

201
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:18,299
machine does not store tragically the

202
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,329
machine does not store votes but it's

203
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:27,509
just a Princeton and stored them in a

204
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:29,819
card in this ballot so you can go ahead

205
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:32,670
and check the ballot on the meantime you

206
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:35,099
see chip you can really with the cell

207
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,139
phone you have yeah if you have a cell

208
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,179
phone with NFC you can actually read

209
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:41,129
their contents I think that one is empty

210
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:45,839
but you can actually put some content on

211
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:48,119
it also this very machine that it is

212
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,929
used to emit about it's also used to

213
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:54,689
verify the vote and to count around

214
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:58,829
later later on that day this machine

215
00:10:54,689 --> 00:11:01,260
replaces the the system we saw before

216
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:03,839
prints the act it prints a telegram it

217
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:07,200
transmits them for the promissory

218
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,180
scrutiny and it all on of course you

219
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,230
need to use it for the final scrutiny

220
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:16,310
because you need to read process the

221
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:20,459
same information the machine generates

222
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:22,768
this is the valid I just handled you it

223
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:25,410
has an RFID chip you can see through the

224
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:27,810
light it has a thin metal layer to

225
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:30,959
protect that RFID chip from being read

226
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:34,170
on the distance that is only true if you

227
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,930
close the ballot so that the thin metal

228
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,360
layer is right on top of the RFID chip

229
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:42,779
you can try it with your phones if it if

230
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,420
that's if that's is true the chip cannot

231
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:47,160
be read that that's that's correct but

232
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,170
if there is more than two or three

233
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,290
millimeters then you can read it easily

234
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:55,199
that means when you bend the valid to

235
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,670
put it in the ballot box the valid as

236
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,860
you can see for because of the material

237
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:04,529
it will open up so you will be able to

238
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:09,209
read it remotely as a side note the chip

239
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:13,620
is an NX p i-- code sli or leaks this

240
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:15,750
leaks chip implements crypto it has a

241
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,240
really weak crypto but it doesn't

242
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,399
prevent it however it's it doesn't use

243
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,130
it the system doesn't use it it uses

244
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:27,120
both chips because this one yes a lie is

245
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:29,820
cheaper and it's used for those kind of

246
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,560
ballots that are for testing but it's

247
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,540
funny because it doesn't actually use

248
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:38,310
the crypto and the characteristics of

249
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:41,640
the more expensive chip this is the same

250
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:45,810
ballot but a printer that one is

251
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:48,270
actually empty so theoretically you need

252
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:52,619
to read whatever it's printed there as

253
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:55,860
you can see the the letters are really

254
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,980
really small really tiny so some some

255
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,540
not many people can read it actually and

256
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,240
well of course the information that

257
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,680
counts is salty in the RFID chip the

258
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,870
machine cannot read whatever it's

259
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:12,630
printed so the only thing that counts is

260
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:15,690
the RFID chip this is a special valid

261
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:17,250
there are two or three different kinds

262
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:20,040
of special ballots this one is for the

263
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:23,670
Pauline Pauline station precedent which

264
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:27,180
allows to configure some settings for

265
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:31,349
the machines we will show you we can

266
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:35,520
actually create as many ballots as we

267
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:39,420
want we can fake the ballots in a really

268
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:42,660
easy way this is the overall view of the

269
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,729
machine you can see it's a standard

270
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,949
touchscreen with a printer on the side

271
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,100
the printer is actually a thermal

272
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:56,130
printer and it has in the same module it

273
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:58,230
has the RFID the rfid transceiver so

274
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:01,400
some details on this machine you can

275
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,400
start talking whatever you want you know

276
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:09,630
so we have this machine it's supposed

277
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:12,839
that ballot this is the RFID printer it

278
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:16,410
has a power source below it it has two

279
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:19,110
huge batteries and has a ton of ports on

280
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:22,380
top of it those ports are let's say

281
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,270
protected but they are covered by small

282
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,430
plastic it's really easy to remove it

283
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:30,660
has no no kind of lock nor anything like

284
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:34,829
that and you can access which SVGA

285
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:38,310
for USB an Ethernet port a few leads you

286
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,470
have a DVD a reader basically it's a

287
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:43,859
linux box

288
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:45,990
version of Ubuntu almost almost original

289
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:49,310
without with a web application on top

290
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:52,080
that's basically what it is - yeah yeah

291
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:54,479
VOCs on Ubuntu and it's understandable

292
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:59,370
hoon - it has been a little bit trim but

293
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,110
not nothing more not more than us this

294
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:05,970
is the inside of this machine

295
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:08,400
these pictures are well they didn't

296
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,130
allow us to do this of course nobody

297
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,199
allowed us to do this but nevermind

298
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,810
that's why I say I encouraged you to do

299
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,510
this kind of things so you have the the

300
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:21,689
touchscreen the RFID transceiver the

301
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:25,350
thermal printer and a speaker the

302
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:26,100
speaker actually just beeps it has such

303
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,459
a

304
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:34,050
now the shock for people with how do the

305
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:35,910
audible disabilities this is the is

306
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,219
behind the screen we have a

307
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:42,360
microprocessor we have a microcontroller

308
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:46,589
and an awesome shock port it's really

309
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:49,740
funny because before we get our hands on

310
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:53,040
these machines it has been in use for

311
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:57,149
about seven years in Sultan the province

312
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,519
of Salta it has several outlets but not

313
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:02,160
a single loud it not even one out it

314
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,230
mentioned that microcontroller it didn't

315
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,120
exist it wasn't supposed to be there

316
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:09,839
that microcontroller

317
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,750
I mean motherboards have a lot of CPUs

318
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:16,529
inside nowadays but that particular one

319
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:20,550
is like unexplained it is we know this a

320
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:22,529
customer CPU with a band or and without

321
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,810
mysterious fumer probably has something

322
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:28,050
to do with management of the printer or

323
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:30,420
the touchscreen centralized it's a very

324
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:33,149
like Lisa printed the thing is that is

325
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,639
code that was never out it yeah it was

326
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:39,209
like the principle call was also super

327
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:42,149
good outer Irene pad at least apparently

328
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:43,469
some college took a look at that code

329
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:45,149
not that one

330
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,040
there was several audits at the same

331
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:49,139
time we were looking at the machine the

332
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,360
University of Buenos Aires was it in

333
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:55,439
this very same machine we in a

334
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:58,110
specialized team this how did cost like

335
00:16:55,439 --> 00:17:00,540
about one and a half million pesos they

336
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,610
never even mention the existence of this

337
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,630
controller it wasn't supposed to be

338
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,610
there apparently

339
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:09,059
I saw you you should I'll detail so the

340
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:11,819
BIOS Fe modules I mean the few more of

341
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:13,199
the print I mean you have you cannot do

342
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,539
out of this machine you have a lot of

343
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,699
work to do yeah but it's really

344
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,919
interesting that we also have enable

345
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,350
legit support I mean why would you use a

346
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,970
SATA port a SATA port now an electronic

347
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:27,240
voting machine that it's going to be use

348
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:29,760
in our elections that does anybody here

349
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,049
I guess several but you know can can can

350
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,960
someone tell me what the shades are port

351
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:35,960
is you speak up

352
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:42,100
photobombing yes you can you can see you

353
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,289
cannot only debug but you can actually

354
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,899
rewrote if you want the microcontroller

355
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:50,080
so I could just you know say in the

356
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:51,939
night I could get in getting the

357
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,129
machines are and I could reprogram the

358
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,679
more I could do whatever they want that

359
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:59,350
microcontroller is an atmel it has 256

360
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,929
kilobytes of memory of a the each EEPROM

361
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,260
memory so I can put whatever the I

362
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:04,260
want

363
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,330
and it's really funny because you you

364
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,220
might say well yeah you could reprogram

365
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,289
but you need to open the whole machine I

366
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,779
mean you need to disassemble all of the

367
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:18,460
machines except it has a cable it has a

368
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:20,919
shade up cable connected directly to the

369
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:25,059
port below right next to the batteries

370
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:26,950
and you can see that is a ballot box on

371
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:30,490
official ballot box because we reported

372
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:32,559
this publicly we asked for the people to

373
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,500
take pictures of this because this is

374
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:39,340
this is terrible this is actually I mean

375
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:41,529
how can you put an actual cable to a

376
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:45,189
SATA port on a production machine it's

377
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:47,380
ridiculous much more discreet ways of

378
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:50,590
hugging the machine I mean this is very

379
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:52,090
very obvious to put out crack every kind

380
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,918
of the bottom machinist that's the way

381
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:58,120
that a corps commander will hack these

382
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:00,399
machines I will it take to it probably

383
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,658
say the guys basically don't even care I

384
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:07,270
mean this guy both on with these and

385
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:09,490
yeah I just put one picture but actually

386
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,620
many many many documented cases of these

387
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:15,760
machines having the SATA ports in there

388
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:18,340
the cable was not accidentally there it

389
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,908
was well attached and really very good

390
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,620
pretty good put so it's it's critical so

391
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:26,559
you can start seeing why we actually

392
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:30,699
hate see voting the many many many

393
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:33,760
things can go wrong and really easily so

394
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:36,549
let's talk a little bit more profound on

395
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,100
this topic we are gonna see the data

396
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:41,639
structure inside the tower this is the

397
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:45,969
the basic structure of the tower it's a

398
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:49,380
it's a standard tag it has you know

399
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:54,390
about 112 bytes of

400
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:56,760
the RFID tag I mean the first byte is a

401
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,880
token and it's fixed the second two

402
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:03,690
bytes is a little endian coded value

403
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:07,410
that counts us as a tag category that

404
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:09,690
category differentiates the kind of

405
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,010
ballots because every ballot is

406
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,870
basically the same for the machine is

407
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,790
just a chip so they use this tag

408
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:18,570
category to make a difference between a

409
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:21,330
vote between a special card as I showed

410
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:23,760
for the president for the polling

411
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:27,300
station president of the companies

412
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,300
technician and stuff like that then it

413
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:34,230
has one byte for the day of the rest of

414
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:37,139
the data length a crc32 which is of

415
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:41,280
course impossible to break as you know

416
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:43,680
right it's four bytes for CSC 32 of the

417
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,040
data and then it's data

418
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:49,590
it ends with weird with very real 4

419
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,540
bytes that we assume or at least I

420
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:55,379
assume it's a right test because it says

421
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:57,149
W ok and we find it on every test valid

422
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,930
but we couldn't find it in the

423
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:02,850
production ballots so I'm not sure what

424
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,920
does that do but it doesn't really

425
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:06,899
matter because it won't the machine or

426
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,510
the software born with nothing else

427
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:12,810
beyond the data length and those whites

428
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:21,690
were right on at the end of the RFID

429
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:24,270
chip do you want to basically the way to

430
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:26,760
hack this is to guy a cell phone and

431
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:29,190
write device one by one yeah that's how

432
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,040
we did it yeah basically you grab the

433
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:36,240
the same phone you use we start trying

434
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:41,510
we'll get the source code a hack like

435
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:46,220
you hack anything every other thing so

436
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:48,780
those are the category attacks the first

437
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:52,580
the second the third and the fourth are

438
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:56,820
the most important then the other tax

439
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:59,280
they read Eric went oh and Apertura our

440
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,350
special to open the point station and

441
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,940
when the opponent station closest and

442
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:06,658
you need to start counting the votes

443
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:09,059
so those are some special tasks and

444
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:12,299
there is a really funny category that it

445
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:15,059
it's named know intra which means it

446
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:17,999
doesn't fit so I'm not sure what the

447
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:20,158
fact that means because what kind of

448
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:23,220
valid has a tag that means it doesn't

449
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,009
fit it what doesn't fit it actually then

450
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,710
there is a tag for unknown tag so why

451
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:31,169
would I put the unknown category to a

452
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:33,929
ballot that I don't know which category

453
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:36,479
is it just doesn't make any kind of

454
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:38,279
sense you remembered it how absolutely

455
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:40,200
no security I mean you can forge a

456
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:43,499
ballot and you can present to be about

457
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,149
the president of the table I we did

458
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:47,639
exactly that and we have an in video I

459
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:49,590
mean it's only have a us you see so you

460
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:51,899
can if you notice true - you can force

461
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,129
whatever followed you can and I will

462
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:57,059
show you to you in just a minute about

463
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:59,699
that so what we found we found the same

464
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:01,559
old fears we found common in section

465
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,729
actually he did it he found a command

466
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:07,649
injection yeah we categorized as a

467
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:10,289
median threat because it was really hard

468
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:13,289
to exploit but it did exist the QR code

469
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:15,509
routine was really bad it is a dividend

470
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:17,908
sanitize the user input so it could be

471
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:20,789
simply exploit it

472
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:24,299
we also found weak authentication as we

473
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:27,570
saw before that you just right now you

474
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:29,330
can just make manufacture votes on

475
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:32,759
manufactured tags and whatever you want

476
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:35,330
so it's actually trivial we found multi

477
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:41,549
vote which is a critical felt threat

478
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:43,049
then again you need it was it was the

479
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:46,049
most incredible failure because

480
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:49,289
basically the machine has one one job it

481
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:51,200
is the count boat and the mekong is you

482
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:55,139
can make it to count about several times

483
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,869
with single boat put even 20 votes in a

484
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:59,789
single ballot and the machine didn't

485
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:01,769
test for that yeah that's really funny

486
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:04,259
because the the single thing the machine

487
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:06,960
had to do which was count and counts

488
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:09,419
well it did it wrong so and it was wrong

489
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,669
for seven years it was wrong for seven

490
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:13,859
years it was used in elections during

491
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:16,080
seven years this is certain these

492
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:18,870
machines are not designed for

493
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,909
but for security minded people element

494
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:24,090
it's like basically heating a baby you

495
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:25,200
can auto boom - I mean it's not like you

496
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,120
have super hacker you hack these

497
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,360
machines they're like the easiest thing

498
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,189
to hack but if you if they've made a

499
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,020
mistake in the in the only function

500
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,760
they're made to do that is to count the

501
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,320
vote so what can you expect food

502
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,230
everywhere everything else yes exactly

503
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,389
that's why I wrote several danger

504
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:44,460
indicators the the quality of the code

505
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:46,050
was really poor it has tons of lines it

506
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,980
has many dependencies many Python

507
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:53,360
dependencies too many evils the whole

508
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:55,440
front end is well HTML CSS answer yes

509
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,760
most of the shields have evils

510
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,770
everywhere so it was this was really bad

511
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,410
the company has no internal audit

512
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,210
process the government actually paid for

513
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,950
the audits but the company has no

514
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,620
internal how the process and the cover

515
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:12,420
was not another specialized hard work it

516
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:16,860
was a common heart but a customized

517
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:18,900
motherboard but nothing else here's the

518
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,550
command injection well the comment

519
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,250
section was quite funny because yes

520
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:26,820
basically you put it next to the

521
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:29,370
president name and it will print the

522
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,530
present name in a quirk all and to

523
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:33,600
generate the query will holler at us you

524
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:36,750
will do assistant Commons in the right

525
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,629
man and we put this you who executes yes

526
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:45,590
as you can see in the template commando

527
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:51,540
CT MPL commando the last part it's quote

528
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:54,929
so over here it shines whatever the user

529
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:57,570
has input and executes that result so

530
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:59,760
basically he's just disability almost

531
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:02,129
work because if they just by mistake

532
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,220
they filter our characters so to people

533
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:07,800
so they basically they yeah it was

534
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:11,190
really hard to to exploit because there

535
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:13,919
there was not actually a filter but a

536
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:16,110
visual keyboard where one have to write

537
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,390
and that means what keyword didn't allow

538
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:21,149
you to write these kind of things so it

539
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:22,920
was like well you got passed down that

540
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:26,150
one but if you connect to the keyboard

541
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,960
or whatever that's it that was game over

542
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,030
it was game over

543
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,220
many many many layers

544
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:34,920
evolved because as I said the whole

545
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:37,050
application was running as root after we

546
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,280
reported this it was fixed the

547
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:41,370
application didn't run as root anymore

548
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,590
they fix most of these things

549
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:48,179
there were several leaks of this source

550
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:50,310
code by on every election there was at

551
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,010
least one leak so we believe several

552
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:54,540
people was participating in leaking the

553
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,700
source code which is really good and

554
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,159
again I encourage you to do it if you

555
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,260
can

556
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:03,780
week event occasion we become just

557
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,550
manufacture attack we use this the very

558
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,860
same ballots because we didn't want to

559
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:10,919
buy additional RFID tags so we dis the

560
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:14,010
ballot and you just write that code the

561
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:16,920
first byte is the fixed token the second

562
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:19,350
the second and third is the tag category

563
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:23,340
written in little-endian so it's

564
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:25,679
reversed that's it with that simple code

565
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:30,270
you got to be a technician so you could

566
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:32,790
modify life you could live you can do

567
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:35,490
live modifications of the system and you

568
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:39,090
could actually eject the CD and replace

569
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:41,010
it or whatever you want I haven't

570
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:45,929
mentioned its but the whole system runs

571
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:48,390
in a DVD it doesn't include a pendrive

572
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:50,520
it doesn't include a harddrive nor nor

573
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:54,180
any other storage device again

574
00:27:50,520 --> 00:28:00,870
supposedly so the whole system run from

575
00:27:54,180 --> 00:28:02,400
a DVD this is multi vote yeah very fine

576
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,080
this I was looking at the code the first

577
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,910
thing that I look was of course the

578
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,210
function the counter vault and they

579
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:11,610
forgot to to check that you can put a

580
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:15,000
vote for the same guy many times

581
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:18,090
exactly so basically if you have a PC

582
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,580
with 200 bytes of memory you can put to

583
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,679
handle both and they were at the same

584
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,470
president and the way we just count

585
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:28,260
about exactly and it was quite funny

586
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:30,750
with tests it is not only we can't beat

587
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,360
that the totals will be completely wrong

588
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:37,710
I mean we will try to count and we

589
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,840
basically con wrong with the calculation

590
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,820
don't match don't notice and you can

591
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,488
read

592
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:47,129
you know that was a very big one yeah if

593
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:50,340
you read the code really quickly you can

594
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:52,649
notice that there is a for its rating

595
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,299
directly from the data from the tile so

596
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:56,789
basically whatever data is in the tile

597
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,320
gets iterated and processed so you can

598
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:59,789
just write more data to the talk and it

599
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,249
will be iterated on process this is

600
00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:03,690
critical

601
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:06,989
to be honest probably they never

602
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:08,999
expected a ballot with that twenty vote

603
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:10,619
for the same president exactly they

604
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:13,169
didn't expect that so they because they

605
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:15,449
machine doesn't it I don't probably cold

606
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:18,299
it defensively that you have to so

607
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:20,700
that's why this thing happens yeah it's

608
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:22,139
it's really crappy and it was really fun

609
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,619
because actually the machine didn't

610
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:28,080
check that the results were wrong or at

611
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:32,728
least throw a warning maybe a come on I

612
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,830
mean I counted a the vote count is

613
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,869
bigger than the amount of votes maybe

614
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,970
throw a warning no nothing like that it

615
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:41,820
was just showed the result and that's it

616
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:44,580
all good so it was really hard to detect

617
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:48,509
if you want it to detect it you need to

618
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:50,549
be really really careful when you count

619
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:52,470
it with this machine because otherwise

620
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:56,549
you would never realize there was a

621
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:58,799
crafted vote and as you can see here

622
00:29:56,549 --> 00:30:03,059
it's an example of a vote this is the

623
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:09,119
data the the later part I mentioned

624
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:12,178
before the first the first digit the oh

625
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:14,789
six is the school number no it was a

626
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:17,820
district and the point one point is

627
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:19,979
separator and the one is the either

628
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,470
school number and then we have the

629
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:27,389
different categories and a vote for each

630
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:30,809
category these come or tip or have is

631
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:34,769
the east a category and the numbers are

632
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:37,139
the candidates the this information was

633
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:40,919
published online so you could

634
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:42,748
manufacture the votes previously so if

635
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:44,460
once you did you just could do it I

636
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:46,619
don't know you can't rely that even can

637
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,470
read the vote in extra decimal in his

638
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:51,149
mind yeah it's like it's like seeing the

639
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:53,580
matrix I mean he already can see that

640
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:55,709
the candidates there but

641
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,389
but when you wanna fight an adversary

642
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,710
you're gonna fight people like him that

643
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:01,110
can basically read the Bolton

644
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:03,390
hexadecimal and the cold in his mind it

645
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,909
was really funny that that that very

646
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:10,320
moment when we first try this please

647
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:13,170
this exploit he was on the phone

648
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,710
dictating the codes and numbers to a

649
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:18,420
friend that that guy was telling me what

650
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,130
what do I have to write and I was

651
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,440
decoding it I'm writing infidelity that

652
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,300
saga with my phone and we were trying it

653
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,330
and it just worked and it was like holy

654
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,830
 this really works because we don't

655
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,510
really have any any permission to do

656
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:32,850
this yeah the day after she doesn't

657
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:34,890
allow you to feel with the world so it

658
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:37,080
wasn't a hidden position I didn't know

659
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:38,850
him even know me I mean we unpacked

660
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,520
every every each other maybe we're

661
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:44,629
policemen we didn't know each other back

662
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,889
then so yeah yeah it all worked really

663
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:48,990
really interesting environment but

664
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,850
another thing maybe you don't know judo

665
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,510
can see there but that this is not

666
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,530
encrypted

667
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:57,540
that's very incentive lesson because

668
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:59,399
that is using fees NPC that is using

669
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:05,250
radio what happened with you is rather

670
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:06,150
with that unencrypted data what I yeah

671
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,060
we're going to see in a minute what

672
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:13,620
happens when you use unencrypted data on

673
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:16,200
a radio so this is just a tiny example

674
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:19,580
of a word was I know if you know what a

675
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:23,280
word was is political boss it

676
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:27,270
someone here told me you you know with

677
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:31,020
us both of the coverage though so you

678
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:34,190
could actually do this very easily with

679
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:38,780
this machine then you find the pointer

680
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:38,780
let's see how it goes this video

681
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:48,910
this is an example so as you can see

682
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,320
it's touchscreen and you just choose

683
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:55,720
whatever you want to choose and you

684
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,220
print those are just fake candidates of

685
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,730
course and all the Vinci is not a

686
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:07,030
candidate this is just a mere example on

687
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:11,650
a real machine of course so basically um

688
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:15,280
it's about we we Vivint somebody years

689
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:18,430
he signed an app a card reader to

690
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:22,180
register to vote and detect if that vote

691
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:26,200
was the same or it was different this

692
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:28,600
the idea for this is for the the world

693
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,900
was to tell somebody look you need to

694
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:34,719
vote for for these candidates or s there

695
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:38,590
will be consequences so this word was

696
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:42,160
just needs to give a give a cellphone or

697
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:47,320
whatever to to this person this person

698
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:48,910
will check with the application if the

699
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:53,189
vote was the same as they were a

700
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:55,900
political world said it should be or not

701
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,490
never see YouTube I devote yeah

702
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,950
basically you can buy votes like this

703
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:02,410
and a really really easy way because you

704
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:05,530
can effectively prove what did you vote

705
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:08,110
who did you vote for stuff like that one

706
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:11,590
of the points one of the key points for

707
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:14,440
the vote to be secret is to actually for

708
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:17,260
the voter to not be able to prove its

709
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:22,149
vote the voter must not be able to prove

710
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:25,540
whatever it vote you must not be able to

711
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:28,270
tell a lie from a truth this is my cheap

712
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:31,179
cheap supper I was going to bring it

713
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:33,940
here but it was hidden in a Marwari box

714
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:36,399
and a cigarette box and it looked pretty

715
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:38,050
much like a bomb so I thought that in

716
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,509
the airport I gonna had some problems so

717
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:45,399
I didn't bring it but I didn't bracket

718
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:45,820
it but this basically is a it's a camera

719
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:50,049
flash

720
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:54,600
I didn't invent this this was done the

721
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:57,960
CCC evac Nagano like 2008 or so

722
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:00,660
it was it enables you to easily burn

723
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,240
RFID chips without leaving any kind of

724
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:06,180
trace or mark and the idea was to put it

725
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,939
in a cigarette box so you would like go

726
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,500
near the ballot box or whatever you

727
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,600
might just you know once it's you smoke

728
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:16,500
and you just put that box there and

729
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,850
click no more votes you can always set

730
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,340
the votes on fire

731
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,860
but yeah and it will be the same result

732
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:25,710
but it's very visible and this is a very

733
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,330
discreet and exactly way to do it this

734
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,030
is a very discreet attack and you have

735
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:33,420
two kinds of attacks you can attack a

736
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:36,180
valid with votes or you can attack a box

737
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:39,570
that has empty ballots so you can do a

738
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:42,600
denial of service nobody else both if

739
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:44,910
you have no more ballots it's a very

740
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,690
simple device it doesn't have much power

741
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:51,690
it can World War two but they they need

742
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:54,120
to be really really close by believe an

743
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,760
experiment that experimented much on a

744
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:58,589
larger device but it could be fun

745
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,950
because it's also very dangerous maybe

746
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:05,090
we could bro broke cell phones or other

747
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:10,140
electronic devices so we didn't do it

748
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:12,930
this is what we call Nemo this is a RFID

749
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:16,379
sniffing and this is what happens when

750
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:22,379
you have unencrypted data written on an

751
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:25,970
RFID chip you can read it let me have

752
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,970
outta here good

753
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,180
so how she was here to simplify when the

754
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:34,339
green candidate and when the red

755
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,410
candidate yeah the idea is to put a

756
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,670
computer next to the machine and try to

757
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:40,910
guess your boat

758
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:46,010
I mean it's that's eliminated secret of

759
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:50,450
the boat we use a regular survey radio

760
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:53,960
mmm a cheap non modifier I mean it's

761
00:36:50,450 --> 00:37:08,509
just plug to the audio and then we have

762
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:10,550
a wave something in her that he says

763
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:13,400
then it's effective I'm sure where he's

764
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:16,010
so sensitive that you can hear I mean

765
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,980
NPC safe because you can arrive but you

766
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:22,070
can't hear very far away in this little

767
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:31,940
radio a here with a small antenna can

768
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:34,100
read it almost two meters away and we

769
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:36,350
detect a hundred percent of the vote so

770
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,609
that's pretty much a lot so imagine if

771
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:39,950
you actually know something about

772
00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:43,670
electronics and like us yeah and you

773
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:48,490
write a custom machine diagram listen

774
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:48,490
for the boats I mean a couple weeks

775
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:54,710
this is already two meters and we are

776
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:59,930
still on their 100% also you don't need

777
00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:03,310
read and presented exactly when you do

778
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:06,140
when you have about 50% you are done I

779
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:08,990
don't know it's 50 but it forgive me I

780
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:10,759
know how to convince enough people to

781
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:14,140
make sorry about this you can actually

782
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:20,810
know how the election is going live

783
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:23,080
within the votes with a simple radio fix

784
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:25,460
my encryption but the encryption itself

785
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:27,470
they have their own problems they

786
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,710
actually can do it Twitter because you

787
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:32,660
have to be able to read you both in

788
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:35,090
zephyra machines that means that every

789
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:39,620
machine has tomorrow the king and how do

790
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:41,390
you beat routinely don't even have to be

791
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:44,540
different I mean encryption is overall

792
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:46,750
complete war off off forth that way they

793
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:50,210
don't do it on if they don't do it

794
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:52,310
actually after we publish this they

795
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:56,180
start in the winter crypto and they do

796
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:57,890
it all wrong and they disable it they

797
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:02,180
tried to use it in a couple of elections

798
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:07,120
for tests it went really really well it

799
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:09,649
went really bad because since the key is

800
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,089
withheld with a single machine you

801
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:13,220
cannot change the machine if if

802
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:15,290
something happens like if it breaks or

803
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:21,560
whatever and the machines break a lot

804
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:23,840
like a lot so you have really long a lot

805
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,670
of time of delay if one machine got

806
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,280
broken because you couldn't just swap

807
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:31,870
the machines so actually in encryption

808
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:35,360
Mike might solve this RFID sniffing

809
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:38,740
partially but it brings a whole lots

810
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:42,170
more of problems and they disable it so

811
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:45,279
we still won so and yesterday this was a

812
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:50,030
presentation in hot glue conference

813
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,770
called nfpc leak that use an FPC cheap

814
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:54,980
similar similar to us with exactly the

815
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:57,500
same ratio that we use and it can read

816
00:39:54,980 --> 00:40:00,080
the exactly same distance and we did and

817
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:02,630
the guy didn't name us but it's okay I

818
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:08,049
mean we'll be cellular take it fine

819
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:10,700
anyway as he uses in radio the same

820
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:13,040
this.element disposition and stuff so I

821
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:17,779
don't know maybe we we encouraged him to

822
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:19,700
do it so after these events we were

823
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:21,830
unable to get our hands on any other

824
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,810
agenda in voting system we weren't

825
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:26,779
actually able to get our hands on this

826
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:29,270
voting system we just did it but after

827
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:32,090
this it was impossible to find any other

828
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:35,030
voting system in Argentina we have

829
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:37,550
several tries on different voting

830
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:41,210
systems but we cannot touch them we're

831
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:45,500
gonna get even near them they are like

832
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:48,080
forbidden to us anyway we are gonna do

833
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:52,400
we're gonna do some comments about all

834
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:55,220
of this every voting system we name here

835
00:40:52,400 --> 00:41:00,310
is a it's actually pure crap it doesn't

836
00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:05,390
work it's expensive this really slow nah

837
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:07,610
just go up oh the room below us the

838
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:11,859
Matias is talking about the your voting

839
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:17,090
system which is also a crap I'm sorry

840
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:19,040
so this is the a photo a vote from I'll

841
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:20,930
check and take it's a company founded by

842
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,840
the province of Leonardo it was almost

843
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:26,359
used in Tierra del Fuego but we made a

844
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:30,500
few comments about it and eventually it

845
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:33,790
didn't got God needed and God used we

846
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:36,950
never got we were we were never able to

847
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:40,340
take a look at it directly so we just

848
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:44,089
used the public documentation it's

849
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:46,160
really funny because on this machine on

850
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:50,990
the same machine you vote you actually

851
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:53,120
have to ten minutes hoho okay so in this

852
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:54,950
machine it was really funny because you

853
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,370
also vote and you had to put your

854
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:59,720
fingerprints and another five e card so

855
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:04,580
basically you were registering your

856
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:07,098
fingerprint with your vote then you made

857
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:10,190
the simple choose in this tax ID

858
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:13,460
screen touchscreen like very similar to

859
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:16,910
the other one and then the machine

860
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:21,410
printed sort of ticket and via wrote

861
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:24,739
devote to another RFID tag this very

862
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:28,009
same RFID tag you put here so basically

863
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:30,289
you have two sources of the vote you

864
00:42:28,009 --> 00:42:33,440
have the paper and you have the RFID

865
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:36,289
chip so guess which one counts we RFID

866
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:40,489
chip of course the paper is just just a

867
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:41,989
pantomime I just received yeah it's it's

868
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:46,279
not a receipt because it's the actual

869
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:48,410
valid it's not used the paper is just

870
00:42:46,279 --> 00:42:50,960
for the public to say oh but come on it

871
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:52,940
has a paper it can be verified

872
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,450
yoshua you can verify it can't you read

873
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:58,519
the contents of that NFC chip No the

874
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:03,799
most fun part is that they got mixed so

875
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:05,569
the paper ballot and the car weren't all

876
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:07,160
together so they were mixed so cow how

877
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:09,920
can you verify one with the other you

878
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,420
can't it's a really crappy system they

879
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,400
didn't even spend like ten minutes

880
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:17,299
thinking on it this is another one

881
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:19,960
Valka me which which means photo khalifa

882
00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:22,759
column is on arrow

883
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,839
we didn't participate it on this but

884
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:25,369
javier's maldonia

885
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:29,058
the that's all guide we mentioned before

886
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:32,690
I was able to see it for like 30 seconds

887
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:34,880
or so it was written even named smart

888
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:36,469
cities it was held at the same time as

889
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,759
the echo part see the echo part he asked

890
00:43:36,469 --> 00:43:42,049
for machines to to review electro

891
00:43:40,759 --> 00:43:43,819
official said there were no machines

892
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:46,160
available to view it because of course

893
00:43:43,819 --> 00:43:48,170
they were on the other event that event

894
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,719
was about selling electoral system and

895
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:58,759
stuff like that we are gonna do this

896
00:43:50,719 --> 00:44:00,799
really quickly so this machine prints

897
00:43:58,759 --> 00:44:03,289
are tickets really similar for the of

898
00:44:00,799 --> 00:44:08,059
the one you have except that ticket is

899
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:10,609
actually the the ballot so there is

900
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:12,739
Xavier trying to read the QR code the QR

901
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:15,609
code is non-standard code so it cannot

902
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:15,609
be read with a cell phone

903
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:23,150
we were able to read it eventually one

904
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:25,910
guy found find out that it was a version

905
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:30,590
one QR code and was able to read with a

906
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:34,220
really old and deprecated library and

907
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:42,500
after you decode that you get a base64

908
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:45,169
string you get a base64 string of data

909
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:49,370
we didn't know which data because it's

910
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:51,890
then it's then recipe and after the

911
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:57,859
Hesiod it's just binary data we weren't

912
00:44:51,890 --> 00:45:00,259
we weren't able to decode it but yeah so

913
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:02,600
basically this machine prints it like

914
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,050
that and guess what the paper doesn't

915
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,060
count

916
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:07,330
because whatever what what really counts

917
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:15,770
is that via code and we cannot read it

918
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:18,650
so next this is the valid what II from

919
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:21,590
the University of who show this is the

920
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:23,420
worst I'm sorry but this this is just a

921
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:27,050
standard computer a standard PC running

922
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:28,430
Windows the software I think it's

923
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:31,100
written in C sharp or something like

924
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:34,460
that the application crashed in just a

925
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,410
30 second test we didn't use it the guy

926
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,240
that was showing it are they that was

927
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:40,759
running the demo were using it and it

928
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,000
just crash and if a - yeah I happen to

929
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:46,190
win of - so it's not like the guy it

930
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,400
happens to all software yeah I had to

931
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:52,070
kill explore the taxi and well that's

932
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:55,220
what can we say about this this machine

933
00:45:52,070 --> 00:46:01,370
printed to a normal printer this kind of

934
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:03,830
violet which had a barcode exactly thank

935
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:07,640
you that file code represented directly

936
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:11,029
they devote so this was the West

937
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:13,930
encoding but yet in the then again

938
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:17,240
whatever it counts here it's just the

939
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:19,279
it's just the the code and and not what

940
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:22,899
they're the rest of stuff that's printed

941
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:26,950
so we cannot read barcodes with our eyes

942
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:29,680
the last one well almost Smartmatic

943
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:33,370
actually it's magmatic

944
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:35,750
was was just able to participate in one

945
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:38,089
actually two really really really small

946
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:41,210
elections in Cordova those are the

947
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:42,860
machines it's the very same machines

948
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:45,440
they use in Venezuela

949
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:47,900
it's my Matic is from Venezuela also

950
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:51,320
spermatic manufacture biometric devices

951
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:53,270
for our electoral Authority the this

952
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:56,090
device is stored the volumetric data of

953
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:58,630
everybody every every single registered

954
00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:05,300
voter in an SD card it was supposedly

955
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:08,840
encrypted with AES yes it uses a

956
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:12,320
symmetric key so there is one key for

957
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:13,490
every device yes one at least one that

958
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:16,070
we know of got lost

959
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:19,160
so basically somebody has the biometric

960
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:23,210
our records of every Argentinian older

961
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:25,190
than 18 years old SMO Matic was charged

962
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:27,950
with the election tampering in 2017 in

963
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:31,160
Venezuela and finally media systems a

964
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:34,160
South Korean company which provides

965
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:36,529
electoral services and South Korea does

966
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:40,220
not use them South Korea vote Sweden ich

967
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:42,380
paper ballots our government denied

968
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:44,959
denies everything we are gonna we're

969
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,970
gonna say here it was proven in 2016

970
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,380
that delegates from the South Korean

971
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,730
government visit Argentina

972
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:52,760
the South Korean government wrote a

973
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:55,340
memorandum the Argentine part did not

974
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:58,970
write anything several machines were

975
00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:01,280
left in customs even though the e-voting

976
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:02,779
was not yet approved in Congress and the

977
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,450
machines were not assigned yet however

978
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:09,140
we already have the machines so this is

979
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:11,089
kind of kinda shady basically they're

980
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,990
like 20,000 machines and nobody know

981
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:14,000
where they are

982
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:15,770
but compared to the regular corruption

983
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,200
going on and honest or American conduct

984
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:20,240
it is like nothing yeah Russian they

985
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,710
don't even care about this but yeah but

986
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,689
this kind important because I'm voting

987
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:25,970
machines yeah yes and this is not a

988
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:28,880
corruption and when me no system arrived

989
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:32,799
the VRC there's a democratic republic of

990
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:35,600
congo we were contacted by the century

991
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,000
the centuries are very very important

992
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:41,549
media

993
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:47,580
organization overseas democratic

994
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:49,740
countries in they gave us classified

995
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,810
documents we analyzed that document and

996
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:54,240
we find out it had covered information

997
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:58,830
prepared to use in Argentina we were a

998
00:48:54,240 --> 00:49:01,169
technical document for them it has this

999
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:05,880
kind of information as you can see it's

1000
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:08,010
not in French but in Spanish around the

1001
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,720
Congo Election Day nobody speak Spanish

1002
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:12,000
in Congo yeah nobody speaks Spanish in

1003
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:15,689
Congo this was actually in the official

1004
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,780
document if there is Sdn I which is the

1005
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:23,450
Argentinian documents ID document there

1006
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:27,119
you will read it here is the name of our

1007
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:28,950
candidates so they are not Congolese

1008
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,260
candidates was clearly made for

1009
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:36,899
Argentina the same thing that supposedly

1010
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:37,650
never happened so conclusions at this

1011
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,480
for us

1012
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:41,190
voting is a real adventure it's a really

1013
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,950
great addition to democracy and it will

1014
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:48,030
be for a long long time we cannot know

1015
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:49,980
how our system works we work all of us

1016
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:52,080
here work hacking systems all the time

1017
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,310
so we know everything is broken

1018
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:56,910
everything is bugged

1019
00:49:53,310 --> 00:50:01,049
we know we can secure layer through

1020
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:03,180
layers layer any other system but voting

1021
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:05,850
is a critical critical parts of our

1022
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:08,129
democracy and we cannot patch it

1023
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:10,290
we cannot elect a president and a couple

1024
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:14,280
of years say oh there was a valve

1025
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:15,930
and no he wasn't a president what we

1026
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,910
cannot do that you cannot undo you

1027
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,890
cannot roll roll over an election it's

1028
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:23,879
not it's not right in you know that in a

1029
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:25,200
database we can use of course more in

1030
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,720
technology in the electoral process

1031
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,819
we just need we recommend just avoiding

1032
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:32,459
the world custom face we can use

1033
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:35,400
technology to wait on the count and to

1034
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:39,030
wait on many many many other stages but

1035
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:41,640
not on the podcasting face it's it's

1036
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:44,580
easier using unique paper ballots or

1037
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:46,350
maybe we can start thinking on something

1038
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,960
different than the unique paper ballots

1039
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:51,600
but it has to be paper it has to be a

1040
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,600
understood by

1041
00:50:51,600 --> 00:51:00,620
and of course as hackers we mustn't get

1042
00:50:54,600 --> 00:51:06,029
involved agamotto vida do you also have

1043
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:10,470
politicians who say that the Koons is is

1044
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:13,530
like a poster the what that's a toaster

1045
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:15,419
yeah of course it is really similar in

1046
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:17,400
Brazil yeah exactly

1047
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:19,380
they actually politicians in Argentina

1048
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,320
said it was a printer it was just a

1049
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:28,530
printer it wasn't a computer yeah it's

1050
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:30,200
really similar I mean obviously the

1051
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:32,970
printer have several computers inside

1052
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:35,790
maybe at modern toaster has or have

1053
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:39,299
computers inside but the the

1054
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:43,050
explanations for our our politicians are

1055
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:48,810
they owned is not connected on the

1056
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:50,400
Internet tell that to the Russian power

1057
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:52,470
station with the stack net it was also

1058
00:51:50,400 --> 00:52:00,120
not connected to internet and it blow

1059
00:51:52,470 --> 00:52:01,830
anyway thank you very much I'm sorry but

1060
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:04,529
the developer to do the machines they

1061
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:08,000
are connected to to Internet do you have

1062
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:11,940
your coq10 you know no hard machines

1063
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,880
last week we saw huge theoretical attack

1064
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:18,000
I mean it's not confirmed but actually

1065
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:22,200
the Chinese were doing a supply chain

1066
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,880
attack on US companies I mean the

1067
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,710
Machine might or might not have internet

1068
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,920
might or might not be a corrupt but

1069
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:31,260
developer computers are not corrupt the

1070
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,800
production stage is not corrupt

1071
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:38,520
so our gap in is just one layer as I

1072
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:41,010
told you before here in security we try

1073
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,420
layer after layer to protect something

1074
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:46,800
but this is really critical

1075
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:51,860
thank you have you ever considered like

1076
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:58,950
a proposition solution like develop a

1077
00:52:51,860 --> 00:53:03,450
method or even in a machine I know you

1078
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:06,210
are not a voting but proposing a machine

1079
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:09,450
that ok that is our specification that

1080
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:11,490
we consider that our secure actually

1081
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:13,740
we're working on that because it's not

1082
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:15,689
like you can use like you say at the end

1083
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:18,600
you cannot use absolutely electronic in

1084
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:20,550
any portion of the I mean the coated the

1085
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:23,880
tallying the final tiling is a server

1086
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:26,520
that is online like 10 years ago that

1087
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,830
also was crack that's another talk but

1088
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,960
you can safely use electronics and

1089
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:34,950
computer in several steps of the voting

1090
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:37,200
excepting the most critical one if you

1091
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:39,299
could do a method actually you you can

1092
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,339
accelerate that can you use electronic

1093
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:44,040
in a safe way and we are kind of working

1094
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:46,890
so so so we can propose something

1095
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:50,520
instead of only criticizing that we love

1096
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:53,250
to do but it's good to to propose also

1097
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:56,490
yeah we don't just criticize everything

1098
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:58,890
but we don't have time here to talk

1099
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:03,270
about all our proposals but yeah the

1100
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:05,100
voting the voting stage is not for a

1101
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:07,490
machine it's just for human some papers

1102
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:12,520
which is the most simple technology

1103
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:15,759
thank you thank you my visions

1104
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,759
