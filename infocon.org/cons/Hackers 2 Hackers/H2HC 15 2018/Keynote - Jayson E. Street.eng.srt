[Music]

2
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:15,870
this is the title of my talk you're

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,060
right this talk really isn't about you

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,100
I'm gonna be talking about one of the

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,250
biggest zero days in the world that no

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,570
one really likes to talk about and what

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,599
we're doing about it but it sort of it's

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,550
like a joke on communication and that's

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,619
that first comic says your big project

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,840
is running late what can you do and the

11
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,180
guys like people are already flat out

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,660
conference calls morning and night 60

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,430
emails a day and our half hour time and

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,890
meetings I don't see what else we can do

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,730
what do you think is the real problem he

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,300
says I think it's a lack of

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,398
communication really it's like so that's

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,269
gonna be the whole things that's like

19
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,180
that that's gonna be the whole theme

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,320
through this is communication this is

21
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,539
basically a little bit about me I don't

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,550
do they need to know is that I do a lot

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,980
of break-in it's like I've done one on

24
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,349
national Geographics like news and but I

25
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,210
like robbing people and that's one on

26
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,729
one that's good for patching humans on a

27
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,320
one-on-one basis so for the last year I

28
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,310
decided to try to expand that and try to

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,419
do more security awareness for

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,250
enterprises and that's when the main

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,720
things I'm focusing on and you're gonna

32
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,060
see that a little bit about in this talk

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,250
but we talked about communication we

34
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,950
also have to talk about how our message

35
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,890
is translated this are these are two

36
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,240
famous quotes by John F Kennedy an

37
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,619
American president that everybody and

38
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,960
this first one on the Left

39
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,530
everybody likes to talk about this one

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,729
everybody loves to like talk about how

41
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,650
intelligent that sounds and inspiring

42
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,140
and it's like it's just a great quote

43
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,390
when written in Chinese the word crisis

44
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,009
is composed of two characters one

45
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,960
represents danger and the other

46
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,250
represents opportunity that sounds

47
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,229
really nice you know you usually see

48
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,700
that on a poster with a lake or a little

49
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,990
bird flying over it and stuff you know

50
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,890
with clouds it's like it's very

51
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:59,158
inspirational right it's wrong

52
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:03,060
completely utterly wrong it's like that

53
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,619
is not crisis in Chinese is not danger

54
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,990
and opportunity the two words can do

55
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,580
it's like I gave a this light up as soon

56
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,109
as I put this light up when I was giving

57
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,120
this talk like this and shinjin

58
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,680
everybody started laughing immediately

59
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,560
it's like because they knew exact

60
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,989
that was incorrect but we give him

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,450
credit for that he is still quoted to

62
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,189
this day as saying a factual statement

63
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,810
that that was a factual statement and

64
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:26,519
that was correct and it's like him

65
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,959
people still use it and still people try

66
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,450
to inspire people with that without

67
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,709
quote it's like but he was wrong and

68
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,170
that is a wrong quote that we're

69
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:37,019
perpetrating on that the second one is

70
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,208
the famous I've been ein Berliner

71
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:40,079
you know it's like Lucas is from Berlin

72
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,790
it's like he'll probably say that I

73
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,730
didn't say that properly but still you

74
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:47,159
get the gist he was made fun of

75
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,108
ruthlessly for this statement because he

76
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,939
was said and reported in the press that

77
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:54,750
what he was talking about was a Berliner

78
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,459
is a donut that's famous in Berlin so he

79
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,950
was everybody made fun of him because he

80
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,319
was he basically told the world I am a

81
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:05,179
jelly doughnut and that's hilarious

82
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:08,250
right but it's a hundred percent wrong

83
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:11,280
he actually if you're from the city of

84
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,349
Berlin the proper usage of the word to

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,569
say Ike bin ein Berliner is saying I'm

86
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:18,478
one with Berlin I am one from the city

87
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:20,760
so he was actually saying a truthful

88
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,699
statement and to this day he is

89
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,668
ridiculed for that statement though he

90
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:28,919
was correct so one the only the two men

91
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:30,900
quotes one that he got horribly wrong

92
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,639
and we still give him credit for and the

93
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,609
other one we ruthlessly mock at him and

94
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,229
he was totally correct on say we have a

95
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:41,040
problem when we get the message out

96
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:43,079
versus how we communicate and let's talk

97
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,578
about zero days you're gonna be at this

98
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:47,009
conference you're gonna hear about a lot

99
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:49,590
of zero days a lot of technical talks

100
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:51,478
don't worry this isn't one of them but

101
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,040
it's like I am going to be talking about

102
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,560
a zero day that we don't talk about very

103
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,590
often it's like and what is it what is

104
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,879
the definition of a zero day a

105
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,040
vulnerability that's been discovered but

106
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,739
not past correct we can all agree on

107
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,138
that zero day it's like a vulnerability

108
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,909
that's been discovered and not patched

109
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:12,439
so let's face it the biggest zero day

110
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:14,489
facing our industry is what people

111
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,289
humans are the biggest hero that they

112
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,509
have not been past day they're still out

113
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,880
there they are still vulnerable and what

114
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:22,560
have we done to try to fix that well

115
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,300
that's a hard problem we can fix you

116
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,870
know like the technical problems so

117
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,370
let's just ridicule that problem

118
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,949
it's like it's better to just put it all

119
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,020
out on the user and make fun of them I

120
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:36,110
said of actually trying to fix that zero

121
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,060
day it's like finding a gaping hole in

122
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,960
Microsoft which is you know pretty easy

123
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,820
it's like or

124
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,948
Linux it's got one going on right now

125
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,630
it's like finding these and just

126
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,400
laughing it off and saying that's gonna

127
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,630
make it better

128
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,859
it doesn't really make it better does it

129
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,380
does it make your systems less

130
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:57,020
compromised if you don't pass for MSO

131
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:59,150
867 or m/s 1810 are 1710 you're gonna

132
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,070
have a bad day right it's like it does

133
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,099
that all the lappet in the world is not

134
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,990
going to make your system more secure

135
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,330
but we laugh about the human errors all

136
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,100
the time with this joke saying in this

137
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,020
corner we have firewalls encryption

138
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,770
antivirus software etc and in this

139
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:19,940
corner we have Dave human error I hate

140
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:22,010
this cartoon I hate it so much that I

141
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,080
complain to my supervising adult you

142
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,419
know the my business manager about how

143
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,448
much I hated this cartoon so do you know

144
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:32,479
what he did he went and contacted the

145
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:36,260
artist of this cartoon and we actually

146
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:39,260
paid him to fix it this is the way the

147
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,940
cartoon should be if you don't think

148
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,460
that's the proper way for this cartoon

149
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,870
to be then you're part of the problem

150
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,870
it's like this should be what you rely

151
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:50,240
on we keep trying to get technology to

152
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,830
solve our human problems instead of

153
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,190
getting humans to help with our

154
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:57,260
technology problem we've I don't care

155
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,270
how many blinky boxes you you buy and

156
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,770
I'm sorry for blinky box laundry vendors

157
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,830
that are in the room but it's like

158
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,479
that's not going to solve your problems

159
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,490
until we start addressing the root cause

160
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,620
of a lot of our issues which are people

161
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,510
and how they deal with the issues we're

162
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,750
still going to keep getting compromised

163
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,760
it's like technology should ottoman the

164
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,789
human it should be an added layer of

165
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:22,070
Defense it's not the solution it never

166
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:24,320
will be the solution it's like so we

167
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,610
have to address that and one of the

168
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,680
things that people tell me the most

169
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,020
about is like yeah but how do we get

170
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,789
users to get involved in it's like you

171
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,990
know that's not part of their job it's

172
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:34,460
like they don't want to do those kind of

173
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,440
things that'll make them more secure you

174
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,000
know study link so it's like you're not

175
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,650
fall for spearfishing it's like we're

176
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,110
skiing

177
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,849
and devices before they plug them into

178
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,580
the machines or gets they don't want to

179
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,479
do those things I'm like are you serious

180
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,520
do you know what people will do for

181
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,870
money

182
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:55,599
people will do what's required of them

183
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:56,710
to keep their job this was a job it's

184
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,350
not really a job I'm particularly

185
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:01,859
careful you know excited about you know

186
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:04,630
but it's like it was a job it paid money

187
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:08,740
people will do what is required of them

188
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:11,560
to stay employed our problem is we're

189
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,419
not requiring them to be secure we're

190
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,220
adding it as an add-on we're adding it

191
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:17,979
as like oh you also need to do this and

192
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:21,190
there's no repercussions when they do it

193
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:23,169
wrong no one gets anything bad if

194
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,580
something goes wrong it's like we're not

195
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:27,010
giving them any repercussions no

196
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,680
consequences it's usually just a slap on

197
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:32,560
the wrist we have to understand that

198
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,240
every employee if they understand that

199
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,910
their job responsibilities is

200
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,509
information security and that their job

201
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:43,210
required to be employed requires that

202
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:43,780
they will do it they won't go above and

203
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,669
beyond

204
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,888
no one goes above and beyond what

205
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:49,750
they're supposed to do right it's like

206
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:51,880
if I'm not gonna get in trouble for not

207
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,889
doing something security then I don't

208
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,590
need to do it I mean I literally googled

209
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:59,320
excited worker and all I found were

210
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:01,840
stock photos I could even find a real

211
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,580
excited worker and I guarantee you after

212
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,530
every single one of these people took

213
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,940
this picture being an excited worker as

214
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,729
soon as that picture was over like oh

215
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,889
god I hate this job you know it's like

216
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:14,979
you couldn't even find a real stock I

217
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:17,139
mean it's that's just the way it is no

218
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:19,510
one is going to do more above and beyond

219
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:22,419
what is required of them if there's no

220
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,919
negative repercussions from it if they

221
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,799
don't have anything negative happening

222
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,049
to them for not doing a secure job why

223
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,990
bother I have all these other deadlines

224
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,700
I have all these other tasks it's like I

225
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,279
mean do we really look at that we tell

226
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,709
coders it's like code securely you know

227
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,779
security loves to talk about the coders

228
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,309
right oh my gosh and developers it's

229
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:43,870
like they don't even know how to code

230
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,729
securely they don't know how to take

231
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,970
time to actually when do they get a

232
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,500
chance every every developer usually

233
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,880
gets a project instead I was like here's

234
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,480
the project it's like it was due three

235
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,550
weeks ago

236
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,530
and then we comes oh but make sure it's

237
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,939
securely coated make sure you go and you

238
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,630
double-check make sure there's no holes

239
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,670
in it make sure there's no

240
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,820
vulnerabilities but we need that by 5:00

241
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,520
and you get it at noon right it's like

242
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,930
not reasonable it's like so they're not

243
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,819
if we don't say that this is the

244
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,339
requirement and willing to give them the

245
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,220
time to actually in the instructions to

246
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,920
do that they're not going to do it one

247
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,250
of the things I talk about is trying to

248
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,870
educate the user by giving them actual

249
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,970
analogies that they can comprehend and

250
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:28,330
so one of the ones that I like to use is

251
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:31,300
a delivery driver you have delivery

252
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:33,100
drivers here correct it's like an you

253
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,660
the companies will give them a vehicle

254
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,890
as I can to give me the expensive

255
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,530
vehicle you know like a really good van

256
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,910
it's like the as soon as that as soon as

257
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,740
that starts it's like as soon as that

258
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,810
first day on the job of the delivery

259
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,270
driver you go and you tell them hey it's

260
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,380
like by the way you got the job so we

261
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,970
know you know what you're doing so here

262
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,470
are the keys here's your delivery route

263
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:54,670
have fun we'll see you back at 5:00 no

264
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,350
that's that's an important piece of

265
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,880
equipment that cost like you know fifty

266
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,350
thousand dollars it's like you tell them

267
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,820
it's like you need to make sure that

268
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,590
you're using your seat belt you have to

269
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,090
use turn signals these are the speed

270
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,530
limits this is how you operate our

271
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,640
vehicle it's like you need to go through

272
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,920
a test to make sure that you drive

273
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,449
correctly and safely there's a number on

274
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,069
the back of the vehicle and in case you

275
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,080
drive recklessly we can be you can get

276
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,370
reported we put a GPS tracker in the

277
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,530
unit to make sure you're not going over

278
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,850
the speed limit we take a lot of time to

279
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,949
make sure that that delivery driver is

280
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,780
not going to screw up that's a very

281
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:25,630
expensive piece of equipment fifty

282
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:27,069
thousand dollars first day of the job of

283
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,320
someone that's working in the computers

284
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,610
heat almost like with the computer all

285
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,930
you do is you tell them like how to do

286
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,880
the numbers how to how to make the

287
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,620
widgets how to market the widgets but on

288
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,560
the security of the vehicle on the

289
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,940
computer not so much but when they fall

290
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,739
for a Spearfish and they cost your

291
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,050
company three hundred million dollars

292
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:49,360
you go oops that was bad

293
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:53,229
a employee can lose millions of dollars

294
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,510
from a computer or a delivery driver can

295
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:58,570
lose fifty thousand dollars from a van

296
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:01,150
by having an an accident which one gets

297
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:05,170
more repercussions at they make that

298
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:06,130
mistake a delivery driver how many times

299
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:10,810
could a delivery dry

300
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:15,070
rekka van and still be employed it's

301
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:16,599
like one maybe two but in a person that

302
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,700
goes and keeps on clicking on spear

303
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,640
phishing emails or they keep downloading

304
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,910
viruses on their system how long do they

305
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,319
get to keep being employed this is one

306
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,020
of my main things that I talk about

307
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,330
that's very unpopular but I am Telling

308
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,850
You if an employee is constantly being a

309
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:36,610
security risk if they keep clicking on a

310
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:39,880
link in emails willy-nilly if they keep

311
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:42,730
going and downloading viruses after the

312
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,890
second third or fourth time terminate

313
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,150
them they should be fired they're

314
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,980
jeopardizing the security of your

315
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,959
company why are you still letting them

316
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,330
be employed you don't let a delivery

317
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,000
driver keep wrecking your van why do you

318
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:58,810
let in a worker keep jeopardizing your

319
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,990
network because there's no consequences

320
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,609
for online actions it's like I did

321
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,720
something really funny a while back it's

322
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,120
like Anna and I talked about it's like

323
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,570
we have a problem understanding the

324
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,910
consequences online and and putting it

325
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,320
into the real world effect right I play

326
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,780
I just who started playing call of duty

327

328
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,630
like the new Call of Duty with

329
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,420
Activision I'm the only guy playing call

330
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,920
of duty here okay you're lying it's like

331
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,630

332
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,130
shooters it's like you know or you know

333
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,590
pub G it's like you know you get these

334
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,939
games and you when I play Call of Duty i

335
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,860
love first-person shooters I can just go

336
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,390
in and just start shooting right it's

337
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,680
like I don't do any the teamwork stuff

338
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,630
you know it's like I played team

339
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,579
deathmatch they hate me because they're

340
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,020
all trying to be like all sneaky and

341
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,140
like you know like a military unit and

342
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:46,030
I'm like Yolo America you know it's like

343
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,280
I'm just running a gun and shooting down

344
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,230
the car it's like it's like I died and

345
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,470
I'm like oh well I respawn I start

346
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:55,960
shooting again in America but guess what

347
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:59,110
happens if you put electrodes on my body

348
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:02,200
that every time I got shot in the game I

349
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:05,650
got a shock would I be fired

350
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:10,640
would I be playing that way no I'd be

351
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:13,660
like America

352
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,740
it's like I don't want to get shocked

353
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,420
there's online Reaper there's

354
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,130
repercussions in the real world for what

355
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,949
happened online I don't want that to

356
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,920
happen we need to start explaining to

357
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:27,019
our employees that there are real-world

358
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,660
consequences for what they do on in

359
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:30,940
virtual work in the virtual world it's

360
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,850
like they need to understand that

361
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,529
because they don't they don't understand

362
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,540
that we have to make sure that they

363
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:40,820
understand that those consequences exist

364
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,649
is that you can actually YouTube

365
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,540
adorable kids caught by dad after

366
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:46,850
painting themselves and it's a great

367
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,560
show on how not to take responsibility

368
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,800
for your actions it's like you know

369
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,109
because when an employee gets caught

370
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,769
opening up a link or downloading a file

371
00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:01,310
is that ever their fault

372
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:03,230
is it ever like oh I flagrantly

373
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,609
disregarded security policy and I

374
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,120
clicked on that link when I know I

375
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:10,550
shouldn't have that was totally my bad

376
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,470
no it was security fell that's this way

377
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,109
the technology wasn't in place to

378
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:17,420
protect us from here it's like or I

379
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,790
wasn't properly educated on what the

380
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,560
process was but they're not taking

381
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,599
responsibility for their actions and is

382
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,550
that really their fault about not taking

383
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,800
responsibility which is funny because

384
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,790
it's not their fault for taking

385
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,250
responsibility for the stuff that

386
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:33,230
they're responsible for it's our fault

387
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,610
for not explaining to them and letting

388
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,220
them know that they have to be

389
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,860
responsible for those actions we have to

390
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,480
put it back on them we have to let them

391
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,670
know and let them understand what

392
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,649
security policies are and how they're

393
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,649
supposed to be part of that how many

394
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:50,810
people know how to contact information

395
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:54,410
security if they see a suspicious email

396
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:56,060
or if they see a person in the facility

397
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,500
they're not supposed to be in how many

398
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,268
people do you have an extension number

399
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,279
for everybody to call do you have an

400
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:04,579
email address for everybody to forward

401
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:07,579
to it if you don't how is that their

402
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:09,649
fault if they don't if you're not

403
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:12,349
empowering and educating your employees

404
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:14,360
on how to be part of the security team

405
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,820
you can't be upset when they're not part

406
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,110
of your security team you have to give

407
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,000
them that you have to arm them with

408
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,100
those things and then give them that

409
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,880
responsibility of it it's like but we

410
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,280
like to just offset it on them and just

411
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:29,490
the scapegoats but that's not the case

412
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,260
and I love that this just happened a

413
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,690
week or so ago this was actually from

414
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,939
the White House Kanye West as everybody

415
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:39,870
realized Kanye West's pass code was zero

416
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,580
zero zero zero zero zero which you know

417
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,160
you make fun of it because it's six

418
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,780
zeroes is like that's a lousy password

419
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,209
well you also have to remember back in

420
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:51,089
the 1980s the US nuclear launch codes

421
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:54,360
default passcode was zero zero zero zero

422
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,950
zero zero zero zero zero it was nine so

423
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,160
it was a little bit more secure right

424
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:02,100
it's like it was like the US nuclear

425
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,050
pass codes were only three zeroes more

426
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,570
secure than Kanye's iPhone

427
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,709
okay so let that sink in for a second

428
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,960
when we talk about security and

429
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,870
responsibilities and thank God we didn't

430
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,340
die but so I like this one i pwned all

431
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,020
the things I liked his tweak the most

432
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,940
because he talks about lots of folks

433
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,620
will laugh at this but I think it's a

434
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,290
useful illustration of how security

435
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,660
features fail when security decisions

436
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:27,750
get offloaded to users who see them as

437
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,030
annoying obstacles if you're not

438
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,280
educating your users on why these are

439
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,560
important it's not just because security

440
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,510
says so it's not just because security

441
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,250
is says this is the way to do it if

442
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:40,200
you're not actually talking to them

443
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,430
about the risk and why it's important

444
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,440
and why they have to follow these

445
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,599
guidelines then they're gonna find a way

446
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,550
around it it's like you know one of the

447
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,820
things I hate the worst is the word

448
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:51,300
stupid user you know stupid user clicked

449
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,790
on a link

450
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,439
stupid user went to a website I go

451
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,719
stupid information security didn't

452
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,690
properly train your user it's like if

453
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,960
you think users are stupid do me a favor

454
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:05,760
uninstall solitaire from your machine

455
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:08,610
see how quickly that one comes back okay

456
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,040
if you want to put a policy in there

457
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:12,448
saying that you'll through the GPL that

458
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,060
you take solitaire off the see how

459
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,530
quickly it comes back he can be very

460
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:19,230
inventive when you take things away that

461
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,970
they like I was literally at a hacker

462
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,550
meeting at DEFCON groups meeting in

463
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:26,550
Dallas one time and there was a guy from

464
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:29,460
an insurance company there he did not

465
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:31,470
blend well okay it's like and he was

466
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:35,070
there you know why he was there because

467
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:37,049
his company had just instituted a proxy

468
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,450
that disabled Facebook from the

469
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:42,989
Desktop and he was trying to he was he

470
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:45,330
googled and looked for hackers so he

471
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:47,480
could find a way to circumvent the proxy

472
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,489
to get back to Facebook

473
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,769
that's sometime it's like that's effort

474
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:54,119
it's like why not the phone I mean come

475
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:57,119
on the mobile apps not that bad right

476
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:59,850
it's like but that's what he did it's

477
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,408
like so users will be inventive they

478
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,509
will do these things they're not

479
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:05,639
unintelligent it's like they have a job

480
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:07,470
they're employed for a reason it's like

481
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:10,019
we have to educate them on what they

482
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:14,009
need to do to be better secured oh and I

483
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:16,409
have a confession to make which is this

484
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:19,350
isn't really a regular keynote rant kind

485
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:22,409
of thing it's a group panel and y'all

486
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:24,748
are the panelists so I'm gonna ask you a

487
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:26,399
question now and one of you in the

488
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:28,859
audience or two or three are going to

489
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:30,570
answer the question but don't worry if

490
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:32,340
no one wants to answer the question I'm

491
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,549
going to run into the audience and

492
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:38,070
randomly pick one of you okay and and

493
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:41,249
and trust me you in the back I go there

494
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,749
first okay so that's not nice not saving

495
00:18:41,249 --> 00:18:45,149
you it's like I need the exercise so I

496
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:48,269
will run back there and ask you first so

497
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:50,580
here's the our first question it's like

498
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:54,929
what is our biggest challenge in InfoSec

499
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:56,668
when it comes to users and also I have a

500
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:59,369
translator so you don't have to worry

501
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,779
about not being as well I don't have to

502
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:03,029
say it in English that's okay

503
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:06,779
I'll listen this way so who wants to

504
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:08,129
answer that question you're gonna make

505
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:12,029
me start off right off the bat running

506
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:13,709
we can do this someone's gonna raise

507
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:17,820
their hand yes someone raised his hand

508
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:21,629
you'd raise your hand I'm gonna pick you

509
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:23,220
anyway okay here here we go so what is

510
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:26,668
your biggest challenge in InfoSec when

511
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,139
it comes to users Eastern álava and can

512
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:30,840
we change for coddling keys keys no

513
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:34,949
living clicker for example how do we

514
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,699
actually help technology modify or I

515
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,009
forgot

516
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,059
you also get speak the Snickers you

517
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:40,320
should have set off that right off the

518
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,029
bat Jason it's like I would have

519
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,220
answered the question there you go

520
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:45,869
so one of the things is how are we

521
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,029
getting technology to properly do that

522
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:49,709
it's like how do we augment it it's like

523
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:55,020
one of the biggest challenges it

524
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:58,080
is our technology augmenting the help of

525
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,539
the users we want them to identify links

526
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,740
and emails but how can they do that when

527
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,840
there's actually Java scripts that are

528
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,890
actually off you skate what the link

529
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,658
looks like until they click it so yeah

530
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,309
technology has to be there we have to

531
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:14,580
use technology we have to use it in a

532
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:17,070
way that augments the users one of the

533
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,080
things that I say that we do is on your

534
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,970
a lot of people using exchange servers

535
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,000
do you know there's an option an

536
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:27,049
exchange server that says any external

537
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,250
email that comes in you can add

538
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:31,049
something in the subject line or the

539
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:36,990
body of the message that says warning

540
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:38,070
external email it's ugly it's like we

541
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,169
just had it implemented in one of the

542
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,928
companies that I work with they hate it

543
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:45,270
all they employees hate it but you know

544
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:47,970
what they don't hate they don't hate

545
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,918
having a CEO email coming in telling

546
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,080
them to buy them with $3,000 worth of

547
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,120
item gift cards because it comes from

548
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,439
the CEO and then actually buying into

549
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,668
that because they didn't check the email

550
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,950
header to see who it was

551
00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:01,169
as soon as you see warning coming from

552
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,779
an external email source you know that

553
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:06,179
it wasn't from your CEO you instantly

554
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:08,549
know that's not going to work so there

555
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:12,779
are ways that we can use to help office

556
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:15,270
Kate to augment what these source

557
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:17,010
sources are it's like you can do that

558
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,399
it's like we can use technology to do

559
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,230
that

560
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:21,299
but we have to make sure that we are

561
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,590
under we're talking to the users and

562
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,658
explaining to them what those

563
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,879
technologies are for and what they're in

564
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:29,549
place for and how they are not 100%

565
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,230
correct it's like there's no technology

566
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:33,658
that's going a hundred percent fix the

567
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,919
problem of anything so we need to make

568
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,529
sure that the users know that that's

569
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,659
there that helps augment their their

570
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:41,700
decisions but it's not going to offset

571
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:44,789
the responsibility of clicking on the

572
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,080
links anybody else have an answer now

573
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:47,279
that they know now they know I have

574
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,169
stickers it's like yeah they're all over

575
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:57,570
the place okay yeah just look it okay

576
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:58,020
I'll go here and there Oh am i you speak

577
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,580
English

578
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:02,430
okay thank goodness because I forgot the

579
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,500
translator thingy they go to make the

580
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:06,450
understanding perchance of a strong

581
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,450
password it's the most difficult thing

582
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,590
oh that's a good one it's like one of

583
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,990
the key things is like password

584
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:15,389
passwords reuse one of the things I talk

585
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:19,680
about when I do security awareness

586
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:23,100
classes I tell people stop using

587
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,870
passwords it's like stop using them and

588
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,340
they're like it's like Jason it's like

589
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,020
stop using passwords it's like I thought

590
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,280
that was a good thing don't get on

591
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,710
Twitter that jason says not to use

592
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,710
passwords do you know that the spacebar

593
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:36,660
is actually a valid character and your

594
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:40,500
network logins and most web applications

595
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:43,560
the spacebar so stop writing passwords

596
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,630
and start writing pass phrases it's like

597
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:49,139
use the space use the proper punctuation

598
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:51,630
like I'm or I've or you've or would of

599
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,370
or could of or didn't or can't it's like

600
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,870
that's got an apostrophe in there and

601
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,750
then the space and an exclamation point

602
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:00,270
at the end substitute one work one

603
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,580
letter for a number and you've got an

604
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:04,379
almost unbreakable passphrase it's like

605
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,399
I mean and you can you can reuse you

606
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,050
don't have to reuse them on different

607
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,050
sites come up with different movie

608
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:12,350
quotes or song lyrics you know a good

609
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:15,000
movie quote is a great way to remember

610
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:18,030
your web password I mean you know you

611
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,710
gotta I'm I'll be back or get to the

612
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,690
chopper don't use force and Edgar quotes

613
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:23,010
they're too short but it uh but you know

614
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,100
there's other movie quotes that you can

615
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:27,150
use that it's like will help you do that

616
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,590
I'm gonna get you on the next one sorry

617
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,260
it's like here we go so the next

618
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,610
question is how do we engage users to be

619
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:39,180
part of the security process and not

620
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:40,919
part of the problem how do how do we

621
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,630
engage users to be part of the security

622
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,220
process and not part of the problem how

623
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,590
do we engage with them how do we get

624
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:51,180
them to be part of it what's a good way

625
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:52,980
oh there's one in the very back they had

626
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,320
my Wheaties uh I'll run this find a

627
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,760
hurry raise your hand again I can't see

628
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,750
you now

629
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:03,580
don't let me run back there for nothing

630
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:08,230
okay yes okay I believe in gamification

631
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:10,059
as a learning process to user he was

632
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,360
talking about gamification which is

633
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:12,360
really great

634
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,740
can we have the answers up front next

635
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:22,390
time things but yeah we'll talk a little

636
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:25,090
bit more about gamification in a little

637
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:29,679
bit that is a good point to do one of

638
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:32,260
our other problems is ourselves how many

639
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:36,220
people here know how your company does

640
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:37,570
business and makes money I mean the

641
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,950
whole process from the beginning of the

642
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:44,049
are you sure we have ten minutes yeah

643
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:46,360
after the second I started way late it's

644
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:48,820
like okay I don't buy that it's like I'm

645
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,379
and I tell people the best example of

646
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,939
not knowing what you're supposed to be

647
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,669
doing when you're supposed to be

648
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,590
securing something is the TSA so they're

649
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:57,760
a great example of the competence and I

650
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:01,030
shouldn't say that too much because I

651
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,400
have to go back but uh but literally if

652
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:07,418
you don't know how your company makes

653
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,460
money how can you protect it do you know

654
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:11,260
what's important to them I mean and they

655
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:14,289
may not realize what's important to them

656
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:17,230
until it's gone or till it's on

657
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:19,179
ransomware or it got hacked restore the

658
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,740
database custom so you need to make sure

659
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:23,770
you're going through your company and

660
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:27,010
finding out what's critical to them can

661
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:31,480
they be out of email communication from

662
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:32,250
their clients for an hour or a day or a

663
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,020
week

664
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:38,049
do they need web presence to continue

665
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:41,260
work is that important can they be down

666
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:42,940
for five minutes to an hour or five

667
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,370
seconds and that causes an interruption

668
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,409
it's like some companies depending on

669
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,570
what business they are they have certain

670
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:52,750
requirements in certain ways they may

671
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,908
not need an email automatically they may

672
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:57,220
not have a big web presence so it's not

673
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:58,840
important it's like where does the

674
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,460
backend what are the back in

675
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,799
communication channels it's like in your

676
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,880
suppliers trust me target which wish

677
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,260
they would have realized what their

678
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,659
security risks were when they were

679
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:10,270
talking about back-end vendors right it

680
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:11,440
was an HVAC company that got them not an

681
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,870
actual intruder directly into their

682
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,299
network

683
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,739
it was a third party representative but

684
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:17,690
they didn't realize all the different

685
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:21,140
connections that were coming in and that

686
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:23,510
was their problem also how do we

687
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,490
communicate it's like this is day five

688
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,470
at the RSA Conference it's like I like

689
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,210
taking on the RSA for some reason no I'm

690
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,710
not paranoid after four days at an IT

691
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,059
security conference who are you why are

692
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:34,460
you asking me all these questions you

693
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:36,200
know it's like because we do we have a

694
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,809
problem with how we communicate how we

695
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,380
communicate to executives and users how

696
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:43,970
do we talk to them we usually talk to

697
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,779
them the way we talk to each other and

698
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:49,250
then we look at them like they're idiots

699
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:52,070
can I tell you something it's like there

700
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:55,130
is no executive in the world that needs

701
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:57,980
to learn the terminology that you use to

702
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:00,169
do their job it is part of your

703
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,570
requirement as a security professional

704
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:05,570
to speak in terms that they understand

705
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:08,870
readily it's like I don't care how

706
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:10,899
amazing that not sled that you made or

707
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,399
you pop the shells or you did whatever

708
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:17,360
if you talk in terms that I don't

709
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:19,639
understand you wasted my time how did I

710
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,529
learn from that I learned you're smart

711
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,840
you understand words and say words that

712
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:25,520
I don't know which makes me feel stupid

713
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,199
usually a lot especially that these

714
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,320
hacker conferences right it's like let's

715
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,390
still that's what we need to start doing

716
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,450
you need to communicate in the way that

717
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:37,190
an executive understands metrics pie

718
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,570
charts everybody loves pie right it's

719
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,130
like you know it's like pie charts it's

720
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:43,580
like numbers give them something

721
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:45,890
concrete to go on explain it down it's

722
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,840
like not dumb it down explain it down so

723
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:49,909
they understand what the threats are and

724
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,459
how it relates to the risk of their

725
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:53,770
company and the risk of the profits and

726
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,360
how you're going to mitigate that risk

727
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:58,668
you have to talk in their trauma

728
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,678
terminology they don't have to talk in

729
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:02,720
yours so it would be nice that they did

730
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,700
wouldn't it but it's not going to happen

731
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,320
usually so it's like you need to better

732
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,419
communicate to your executives and to

733
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:13,240
your users do your users see you as a

734
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:15,260
threat or do they see you as an ally

735
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,029
it's like most time when people see

736
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,820
security it's like it's not really a

737
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,620
good thing right it's like it's like are

738
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,010
we really going and trying to facilitate

739
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:27,080
a communication between the users

740
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,760
and security are we letting them know

741
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,770
that I'm not just here to catch you

742
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,350
surfing porn on the on the kennel

743
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:35,660
company computer I'm here to see if

744
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:38,120
you're secure I'm here to help keep you

745
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,110
employed and keep you having a job to

746
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,870
make sure that we're still secure

747
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:43,549
because if our job is gone because of

748
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,559
someone takes our database and steals

749
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:48,230
our data it's like we all lose our jobs

750
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:50,120
and you're partly responsible for that

751
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,280
you're helping keep the company secure

752
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,678
helps keep us employed are you

753
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,030
communicating that to your users if

754
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,620
you're not teaching them that and

755
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,840
showing them that you're not there just

756
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:02,149
when they screw up you're there to help

757
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,770
them do lunch & Learn sessions where you

758
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,510
teach them how to secure their Wi-Fi at

759
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:07,370
home teach them how to check their

760
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,290
privacy settings on Facebook and social

761
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,270
media teach them how to do these things

762
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,370
and you start becoming an ally and then

763
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:16,129
when they see something suspicious

764
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:17,928
they're more likely to come to you it's

765
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:21,220
like they probably see things that are

766
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:23,240
shady and sketchy at AF every single day

767
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,280
but they don't want to tell you because

768
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,150
they don't want to deal with you they

769
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,750
don't want to look like they're in

770
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:31,730
trouble

771
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:33,530
you have to change that look so what is

772
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,880
the biggest impediment you're facing and

773
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:37,520
doing a more effective job what's

774
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,650
keeping you from doing a better job in

775
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:45,620
information security what do you think

776
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:52,750
it that is I still got stickers okay

777
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:52,750
here we go halfway so that's good okay

778
00:29:54,010 --> 00:30:02,299
I'm gonna have so much ice cream after

779
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:05,179
this awesome yes as I said the prejudice

780
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:07,549
we have on the user always been done and

781
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:11,179
don't know what the hell he's doing only

782
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:19,809
comes the other this might be might be

783
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:21,650
or BS flow okay so so yeah we put

784
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:26,030
unnecessary pressure on the user

785
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:28,130
sometimes where they feel like it's

786
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,120
their responsibility to get that to be

787
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,490
like they're taking all the

788
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,290
responsibility you be you need to come

789
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,730
as an ally you need to show that they're

790
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,740
there to augment it they're part of the

791
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,030
security team if they don't realize

792
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,950
they're part of the security team

793
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,780
they're never going to act like it it's

794
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:43,640
like they'll see you as an outsider they

795
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,990
need to see you as a team member you

796
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,280
need to show them that you're part of

797
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:51,470
the team that's one of the biggest

798
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:53,060
things to do so what is your ago what is

799
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,140
your biggest accomplishment as it

800
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,419
relates to creating a more secure

801
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,370
environment at work I should give

802
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,570
everybody hand up what's the best thing

803
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:04,790
that you've done to create a better

804
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:09,919
secure environment at work wait hold on

805
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:15,280
he said something so he volunteered so

806
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:15,280
what's your answer show the consequences

807
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:28,250
many ways for example financial damages

808
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:30,200
and network damages and so on perfect

809
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:32,150
it's like you show consequences it's

810
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,930
like there are so many wonderful

811
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:38,570
examples of terribleness out there right

812
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:41,420
target OPM Experian there are so many

813
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:43,730
different there are so many wonderful

814
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:46,760
examples you can show that show actual

815
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:49,730
five financial damage whose company here

816
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:53,420
in this room can stand withstand losing

817
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:57,350
300 million USD in one year and shake it

818
00:31:53,420 --> 00:32:01,520
off okay what's your IP address and

819
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:04,340
website please oh no ok not so funny now

820
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:07,580
ok ok good good to know it's like yeah

821
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:09,590
not many people can do that right it's

822
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,870
like we have to do that we have to show

823
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:14,480
them what the risk are there's a lot of

824
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:16,580
examples of that it's like so you have

825
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,350
to you have to show them that now also

826
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:23,360
how do we approach the problem versus

827
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:25,340
users are we actually trying to set yeah

828
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,770
the comic says our devices are now 100%

829
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:31,129
secure he says how did you do that I

830
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:34,820
turned them all off is that the proper

831
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:36,590
response it's like we need to understand

832
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,899
it's like you have to have technology to

833
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:41,720
augment it it's like you can't just but

834
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:43,070
you in and one thing that Benton said in

835
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,340
one of the talks that I recently saw he

836
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,289
says that your

837
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:50,010
company should be able to survive a

838
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:52,500
click it's like your defenses should be

839
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:55,470
able to survive a click do you have

840
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,120
exfiltration monitoring on your

841
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,809
firewalls are you monitoring when data

842
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,149
goes out

843
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,950
I mean Sony let's face it Sony's a major

844
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:04,230
corporation right all over the world

845
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:07,429
they didn't notice one point three

846
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:11,429
terabytes leaving their network

847
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:13,230
seriously I know I know companies that

848
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:16,230
Ono's 100 Meg's leaving their network

849
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:18,120
1.3 terabytes in that o 1 point 3

850
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:20,700
terabytes going to Paraguay looks cool

851
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:23,549
sure you know that should that should

852
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,020
raise some alarm bells it's like so we

853
00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:26,820
have to have the technology in there to

854
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:30,899
augment but we can't just rely on the

855
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:33,000
humans to be the solution and so and how

856
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:34,739
do we take the risk and make it

857
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,450
effective it's like how do we give them

858
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:39,510
the signs it's like how do we how do we

859
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:41,490
stop fail gamification like gentlemen

860
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:45,120
said at the back we need to start

861
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:49,080
gamifying security awareness can your

862
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:53,399
company afford four thousand reals a

863
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:55,230
year for better security every quarter

864
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,100
every three months you have a drawing

865
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,700
company-wide

866
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:03,570
and you get a thousand real or a ten

867
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:06,330
thousand real gift certificate to a -

868
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:09,210
like Starbucks or to wherever it's like

869
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:11,310
or you get a prize or it's like whatever

870
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:14,070
you get like but it's a nice big prize

871
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:15,270
and it's only that price it's like you

872
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,460
only have that much money to work with

873
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:20,330
so that's fine but how do you get the

874
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:22,530
how do you get in dirt into the drawing

875
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:25,348
every time you report a security

876
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:27,210
incident every time you see a suspicious

877
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:29,669
email and you forward it to your

878
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:31,260
information security team every time you

879
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:33,149
see someone suspicious walking if you

880
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,369
see someone walking behind you trying to

881
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:38,009
tell gate and you report that they maybe

882
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:40,230
three entries if it's just a suspicious

883
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:42,240
email you may just get one entry it's

884
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:44,520
like if you actually catch an actual

885
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:48,449
real Spearfish that maybe five entries

886
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,619
and you have to play to pay you know

887
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:51,449
it's like it's like you have to be

888
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,320
security conscious if you want to get a

889
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:53,730
chance to win

890
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,830
they still don't care about your data

891
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:57,369
don't get me wrong okay they still don't

892
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,650
care about your security but now the

893
00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:02,230
something in it for them that's how you

894
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:05,799
do it you make them invested in trying

895
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:07,990
to be more secure it's like and how do

896
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:10,150
we constantly deal with this you know

897
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:12,578
constant changing battlefield it's like

898
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,059
how do we do this it's like we keep it

899
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:15,369
interesting

900
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:16,869
we keep them engaged it's like through

901
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:18,609
monthly newsletters through ways that we

902
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:20,440
can keep talking to them we keep them

903
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:21,700
engaged in it it's like that's one of

904
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,740
the things that we have to do it's like

905
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,529
you can't just say we've installed a

906
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,029
security policy we've done a web browser

907
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:31,119
where they have to take ten questions

908
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:32,589
it's like and then go boom it's like you

909
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,749
answer that and you're you you've done

910
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:36,640
your security awareness class we've got

911
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:38,890
to do more than that it's like we've got

912
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,200
to constantly engage them through

913
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:42,788
monthly announcements it's like heads up

914
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,799
it's like whatever there's a when

915
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:46,630
there's an iOS patch that came out for

916
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:49,150
the iPhone or the iPad it's like you

917
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:50,980
know whatever I device it's like send a

918
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,359
company-wide email out saying by the way

919
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,130
there's a security patch out that you

920
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:55,328
should update your phones let them

921
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:57,130
realize that there's things that they

922
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:58,599
need to take care of it's like I mean

923
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,740
you don't do that for every passions

924
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:00,849
like you know it's like for Adobe it

925
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,319
would be like every five minutes you'd

926
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:04,569
be sitting out emails but it's like

927
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:05,769
North instead o B people in the room but

928
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:07,299
it's like still it's like that's what

929
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:09,098
you do it's like you send them out

930
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:10,509
alerts when there's like a major when

931
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:12,400
wanna cry was going on

932
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:13,749
it's like send out an executive letter

933
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,890
to your executives letting them know

934
00:36:13,749 --> 00:36:17,169
what it was and what the repercussions

935
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:19,390
were it's like I mean that's a great

936
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:21,400
teachable moment it's like we have to

937
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:23,950
you start using those it's like to

938
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,259
better our education of our users we

939
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:29,109
don't just say oh crap that's bad to

940
00:36:26,259 --> 00:36:30,880
ourselves educate and talk out to your

941
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:32,950
executives talk out to your users let

942
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,749
them know why it was bad let them know

943
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:37,029
why you'd be susceptible to that if it

944
00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:38,709
hit you or why you're not susceptible to

945
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:41,109
it because of the defenses that you put

946
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:43,269
in so I give them those that kind of

947
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:45,549
information educate them on those things

948
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:46,930
oh and I do have one confession when I

949
00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:52,210
said the title the talk was you're right

950
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:53,769
this wasn't about you yeah my bad it was

951
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,509
about our industry it's like our

952
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:57,970
industry has to get better at

953
00:36:55,509 --> 00:37:00,369
communication it's like and it doesn't

954
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:01,899
matter how many zero days you patch it's

955
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:04,989
like how good your applications are

956
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,880
secured if you can still have a human

957
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:08,319
who was just in tooling saying there's

958
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,630
dancing gerbils on the other side of

959
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:11,200
this warning box that says do you want

960
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,930
to go to this guy

961
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,000
she's like yes or no guess what you lose

962
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:18,730
there's dancing gerbils on the other

963
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,470
side right it's like we have to start

964
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,119
communicating we have to start creating

965
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,589
a communication channel to our users if

966
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:25,660
we want to be successful in this

967
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:27,820
industry it's like patching technology

968
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,560
is not going to be enough it's never

969
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,660
been enough it's like we just like to

970
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,099
joke off and laugh it off but it's not

971
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,629
until we start patching the humans and

972
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:39,040
there is a patch for human stupidity

973
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:44,859
