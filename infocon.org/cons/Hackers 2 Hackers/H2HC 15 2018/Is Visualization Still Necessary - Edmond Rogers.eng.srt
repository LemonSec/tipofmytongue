2
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:21,509
good morning holy a lot of people

3
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:23,970
here speak English well that was a

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,019
surprise when I got moved downstairs to

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,220
the h2 HC University I thought that

6
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:31,679
nobody in this room would understand a

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:37,430
word that I said now I'm a little more

8
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:40,739
nervous so this talk is not about

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:45,239
virtualization it's about visualization

10
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,190
I just wanted to add that caveat because

11
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,110
if you want you can go and see Jason

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,459
streets non-technical talk upstairs and

13
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,860
but you can stay down here with me and

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,379
we're going to talk about visualization

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,149
I work at the University of Illinois I'm

16
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,329
a researcher there and we make tools

17
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:07,530
that visualize Network flows and attack

18
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:11,640
surface am I too loud for you what does

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:15,659
this mean no I'm not too loud I can get

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,970
louder if necessary you want me to get

21
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,710
louder okay I need to be louder I'm

22
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:25,530
sorry so this is where I live it's flat

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,280
and all the corn is gone because we've

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:33,119
harvested it already but you know I flew

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:37,049
into some Palo a couple of days ago and

26
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,570
then like in true Brazilian fashion I

27
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,220
got a message from Rodrigo one of the

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,720
conference organizers here anybody know

29
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,640
Rodrigo yeah a few people maybe so my

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,700
phone finally connects to the Brazilian

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,299
network and I see like oh Brian will be

32
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,520
coming to meet you at the airport and it

33
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,920
was like oh man how am I supposed to

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,539
meet somebody at the airport but you

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,159
know it everything worked out because I

36
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,920
kind of like he was there waiting for me

37
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,899
so we got the same car together and the

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,699
one thing that amazes me about Brazil is

39
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,020
at this last minute plan

40
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:14,310
it's done and everything just kind of

41
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,260
comes together and everything's fine but

42
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,849
I was very tired because it's a long

43
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,060
flight from the United States to get

44
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:23,250
here and but they let me check into my

45
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,010
room early so I had a nice view from the

46
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,290
room and then I was hoping to get a nap

47
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,630
because you know in the true tradition

48
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,280
of Brazilian conferences they like to

49
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:37,170
take you out to a party the night before

50
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,910
you're supposed to speak and so I'm

51
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,079
starting to relax in bed and I'm like I

52
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,840
have plenty of time

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,540
and so I hear drumming noises and then I

54
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,519
look out my window and I see there's an

55
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,380
entire you know is this like something

56
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,630
that you do in your culture where people

57
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,160
get together and beat drums in the

58
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,630
courtyard underneath the hotel in the

59
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,180
Milley afternoon when people are trying

60
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,680
to sleep and I had no idea how to

61
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,560
complain about this because it looked

62
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,060
like an official event so it was pretty

63
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,209
nice I don't if anybody was here for it

64
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,829
the other day because getting into the

65
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,810
conference I had a very long week like I

66
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:13,530
said I'm a researcher at the University

67
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,420
of Illinois and what we do is a lot of

68
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,100
things we build tools that visualize

69
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,160
Network flows and critical

70
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,690
infrastructure and we also have critical

71
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,250
infrastructure in our lab and we just

72
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,950
got finished a big exercise and what I

73
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,810
did was I have a lot of pictures of

74
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,000
different places that have been on the

75
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,130
power grid and I never thought that it'd

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,319
be able to add pictures from a series I

77
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,720
like to call stupid that I've seen

78
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,839
as I've been working on critical

79
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,139
infrastructure so we had a project where

80
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,549
we had to build little substations that

81
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,130
we were going to deploy in this

82
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,930
experiment there was like 22 substations

83
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:54,840
and like we were at at least two weeks

84
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:56,790
behind and so you know the the cabling

85
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,480
and everything the protective relays and

86
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,400
stuff that we were doing is was that was

87
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,260
a feat there but the thing that's

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,329
interesting is even if you don't

89
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,980
understand English what you're getting

90
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:13,200
ready to see might be a little up

91
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:15,000
because I went off and we did a cable

92
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,310
management for the switch that's a

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,940
Schweitzer it's a switch that sits on

94
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,548
the inside

95
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,920
substation and does all of the control

96
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:26,400
signaling if you look I come back in the

97
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,810
and our electrical engineers have taken

98
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,570
the switch out and it'll just letting it

99
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:35,100
dangle down outside of these boxes and

100
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:37,170
I'm like oh that's not good what and and

101
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,180
again this is a visualization talk all

102
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:42,540
I'm trying to do is visualize how

103
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,830
up my life is sometimes and I think that

104
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,820
maybe you're getting a picture that but

105
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,210
if you really want to look at this a

106
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:51,800
little closer it's like what human being

107
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:55,409
thinks this is good outside of Brazil

108
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,770
come on we're gonna fight about Brazil

109
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:07,800
would you like a drink but look at this

110
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:10,440
so the entire into that so there's a

111
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,730
hundred and twenty volts of AC going

112
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,469
through that wire because they didn't

113
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,790
bother even turning the switch off or

114
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,250
de-energizing he's just kind of like

115
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,300
laying there so it's like a disaster

116
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,800
waiting to happen

117
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,990
so this is what I had to deal with

118
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,020
before I could come to Brazil so I did

119
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,310
drink heavily after I got here and then

120
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,650
these are some more switches that we

121
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,690
were working on in the lab but the the

122
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,210
lab just looked like a bomb went off in

123
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,950
it this is like the state that we were

124
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,330
in because we had so many things that we

125
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,630
needed to put together to get this thing

126
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,169
done on time and then at the end of the

127
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:45,150
day things were kind of coming together

128
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:47,340
but when you're trying to put the thing

129
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,989
together at the end and the electrical

130
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,659
engineer does all the internal wiring

131
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,370
because you know network guys aren't

132
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,650
allowed to touch the electrical

133
00:05:53,370 --> 00:06:01,980
engineering pieces because here is a

134
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:05,489
mass of wires that have 120 volt AC 48

135
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:08,310
volt DC nine volt DC 6 volt DC and

136
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:11,340
telemetry all in there and they're all

137
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:14,340
the same colored cables so now we've got

138
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:17,070
a rack these things up because these

139
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,260
things have 48 volt DC in them and if

140
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,300
you know anything about 48 volt DC isn't

141
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,960
that wire feeds loose and it connects to

142
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,100
it won't let go it will kill you so this

143
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,620
one's on 2

144
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,690
by the way so I'm like oh this is pretty

145
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,390
dangerous how how am I supposed to get

146
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,610
this into a din-rail I have to turn this

147
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,289
90 degrees to get it into the den rails

148
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,660
so we had to have them rewire the entire

149
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:42,450
thing because it's supposed to look like

150
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:45,360
this so those things are supposed to be

151
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,460
faced around nice and neat right so you

152
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,380
get the idea of this visualization where

153
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:55,169
I say this is bad and this is good so

154
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,409
can we all get past that is that like am

155
00:06:55,170 --> 00:07:02,150
i communicating effectively so far and

156
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:10,560
this is even better because this means

157
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:13,200
that I can leave and go to Brazil so the

158
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,450
this idea about privacy though is like

159
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,120
we're gonna have a conversation and I

160
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,770
may say a few things that are contrary

161
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,840
to the place where I work is I really

162
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,909
don't necessarily represent the official

163
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,729
opinion of the university I work for

164
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:30,480
this is my opinion and if you know me

165
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:34,820
you know that I'm not very shy about

166
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,820
letting you know what my opinion is and

167
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:43,410
thank you I don't feel like I don't want

168
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,270
to get very loud because the actual talk

169
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:49,140
is starting in a minute here so now that

170
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:53,760
I'm warmed up I want to talk about

171
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:57,890
visualization because you know I found a

172
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:00,090
visualization of anybody ever heard of

173
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:03,240
JavaScript you know they've run some

174
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:07,409
webpages and stuff like that so this is

175
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,830
a visualization of JavaScript does

176
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,550
anybody see a problem with this

177
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:17,580
visualization it's a very detailed

178
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:18,930
visualization I don't know much out of

179
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,630
this it looks about as good as the

180
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,310
picture of my substation earlier I don't

181
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,870
know I can't get anything out of this

182
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,300
and then a lot of problems with

183
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:30,780
visualizations are if you put too much

184
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,030
information in it you can make it do or

185
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,659
say anything that you really want it's

186
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:39,039
like you know oh yeah I can find the

187
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,509
bottom you know this is it

188
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,639
everything's gonna start to come up now

189
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:45,420
we've got all this information in our in

190
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,649
our in our visuals and then

191
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,069
visualization is also a function of

192
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:52,750
perspective so I don't know if it's made

193
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:57,670
it down to Brazil but do you know what

194
00:08:52,750 --> 00:09:01,720
color this dress is so when you make a

195
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:03,219
visualization you don't know what the

196
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,050
person that you're giving that

197
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,089
visualization to is going to perceive

198
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:10,300
because they may see this dress as a

199
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:12,819
different color because I don't know the

200
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,349
words for it what's this color we're

201
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:16,149
going to get an argument here because I

202
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:20,889
think people see this in two different

203
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:23,589
colors but at h2h see we like to you

204
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:27,550
know pull underneath the hood so to

205
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:28,870
speak but I think that we're not going

206
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,939
to get involved in that kind of

207
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,269
visualization because you know as Bert

208
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,269
says

209
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,589
Ernie educates Bert about why the

210
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,089
Japanese deserve a third nuclear bombing

211
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:41,440
so we're not going to get involved in

212
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:44,050
that type of visualization this is

213
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,319
actually going to be proper

214
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:49,149
visualization so in my country we have a

215
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:51,490
Department of Defense that's very good

216
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:54,069
at providing visualization it's about

217
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,899
everything so this is the integrated

218
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:58,750
defense acquisition technology and

219
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:04,060
logistics lifecycle management system so

220
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:06,160
of course everybody looking at this

221
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,800
visualization can't you it's very

222
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,579
straight forward all the information

223
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,500
that you need is there it says but you

224
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:16,269
know again it doesn't look much better

225
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:20,170
than that substation picture I showed

226
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:23,649
you earlier but you can also do a lot of

227
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:26,560
powerful things with visualization such

228
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:29,230
as you know if I'm looking for pickups

229
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,939
inside of a chip and I have access to an

230
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,579
x-ray machine maybe I can figure out

231
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:35,889
where I need to use my micro probing

232
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:38,109
station to get certain information out

233
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:43,720
of computers and it looks really cool on

234
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:46,569
a slide right but a lot of people are

235
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,180
into network visualization and so this

236
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:50,490
is a tool that I run on my computer it's

237
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,750
called glass wire

238
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,900
I don't know is anybody else use

239
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,300
glasswire good so you're going to see

240
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,370
this last wire so what it does is it

241
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,650
just measures all the network traffic on

242
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,540
my computer and also looks at all of the

243
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:06,230
executables on my computer and tells me

244
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:11,219
when they change so I can get

245
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:13,590
notifications when new network flows and

246
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,440
then I can make decisions about what I

247
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:19,530
want to do with this new network traffic

248
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,630
but it took a while to set the video up

249
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,790
because I'm gonna do demos so what we're

250
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,230
going to do here is tempt a god of the

251
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:29,370
demos and see how the first one's gonna

252
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:33,480
work out so hopefully the screen will

253
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:36,810
come back on all right so the AV guy and

254
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:41,070
I are still in Congress here now let me

255
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:45,719
find this tool cuz I've got a few things

256
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:48,090
running on my computer right now no no I

257
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,730
don't want a VPN into work I had this

258
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:53,190
all set up and organized before valestra

259
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:59,340
made me move my laptop here we go so

260
00:11:53,190 --> 00:12:01,020
this is glass wire so what I can do is I

261
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,910
can look at like I think I'm still

262
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,340
connected this is like the last five

263
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,959
minutes of traffic that I've seen while

264
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,060
I was doing the presentation but what

265
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,060
can do is I could also look at three

266
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,650
hours and the visualization is going to

267
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,469
move and give me more information but

268
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:18,900
you see like when I was home downloading

269
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,750
some stuff to get off my computer before

270
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,790
I left a country because I get concerned

271
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,350
about borders just like anybody would oh

272
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,860
wait this is three hours let's find a

273
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,520
good one

274
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:32,250
a week ago there we go so I was pretty

275
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:36,569
busy but then you can do things like you

276
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:38,430
can see I can see where all of the

277
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:42,060
applications inside my computer are

278
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,859
going to and the reason is because this

279
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,699
is a much better visualization as far as

280
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,240
not good

281
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,370
tomatoes are know I'm going to all these

282
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,540
different places and then I get a use of

283
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:56,160
what my bandwidth is and and then I can

284
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:01,939
also do interesting things like I can

285
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,939
block access to applications that I

286
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,840
really don't want to just communicate

287
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:15,090
indiscriminately to the Internet that's

288
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:16,650
not really a good idea so but the idea

289
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,340
that I wanted to really portray about

290
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:22,170
visualization here is that the the more

291
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,790
fine-grained you get a visualization you

292
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,790
can see what's happening now but if I

293
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:29,579
want to back up and look at like all of

294
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:35,209
the data that I've captured and this is

295
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:35,210
like almost two years of data but I get

296
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,980
get anything specifically about what

297
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,410
might be happening right now

298
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,540
I can just see weird trends like there

299
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,400
are times when I download or upload a

300
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,310
bunch of off my laptop because I'm

301
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:53,340
always moving stuff around and I lose a

302
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:55,500
lot of the detail by looking at a high

303
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,840
level and then we're going to possibly

304
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,310
see this in some other demos but so this

305
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,900
is glasswire I didn't write it or

306
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,989
anything it's just a program that I use

307
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:06,600
and now I need to figure out so like I

308
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,910
said this is like the power grid in the

309
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,250
United States it's really big it goes

310
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:14,219
for thousands and thousands of

311
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:18,300
kilometers but again here's another

312
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:20,070
dense piece of visualization that it

313
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,050
just looks like a bunch of lines on a

314
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,540
map somewhere because you know it does

315
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,640
look like America I think but you know

316
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,260
your guys we're in Brazil so it

317
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,610
represents it's about it's a map of

318
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:35,460
America this is like the lab where we

319
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:40,650
have some power grid equipment at work

320
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:42,420
and so we're doing a project and so this

321
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,610
is kind of like what real power grid

322
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,819
equipment looks like that we have an

323
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,710
application running on that laptop but

324
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,890
we're at a hacker conference does

325
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:54,190
anybody see anything

326
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:58,689
interesting in the picture maybe some I

327
00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:00,430
know that this Def Con dog has an idea

328
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,770
that there might be something

329
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:06,040
interesting in this picture and that's

330
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:08,890
we have the username and password for

331
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:13,240
the devices on the chalkboard by the

332
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:16,150
devices so the whole idea behind what

333
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,780
we're doing with the research on this

334
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:21,610
particular device is we want to give the

335
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,900
adversary the credentials for the

336
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:26,230
application because we're looking at

337
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,720
technology called

338
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,580
HDX now there are some people here know

339
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,290
a lot more about HDX in Idaho I'm not

340
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,690
really going to talk about SGX at the

341
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,520
presentation but I'm gonna I'm gonna

342
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,910
make a visualization to show you what

343
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:43,030
HDX can do so this basic application

344
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:47,860
that we have is an array which is a

345
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:51,160
piece of power it goes to a scatter

346
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:54,340
network which that's where they operate

347
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,709
the power grid so we build a little box

348
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,800
called badger three now though and then

349
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:01,890
we put this HDX on top of that and what

350
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,750
SGX is going to do it's an encrypt

351
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,750
critical information like any kind of

352
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,940
settings or passwords that we need and

353
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:13,480
protect it from access from the

354
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:19,180
operating system so the idea is if you

355
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:22,060
go in and then kind of connect this data

356
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:26,229
into a flow application you can provide

357
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:28,869
a completely encrypted enclave of

358
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,640
information from an operational device

359
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:33,450
all the way into things where they would

360
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:42,460
operate in a corporate environment and

361
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:44,140
so I can try to express something that's

362
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,020
quite complicated to you so you can get

363
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:50,640
at least a high level feeling for what

364
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:53,110
is actually going on in this data flow

365
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,990
and there's not a demo of this yet

366
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,910
because it's something that we're

367
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,370
working on right now and then I work

368
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,410
with a lot of PhD and postdocs and then

369
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,110
we also get a lot of benefit out of

370
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:09,709
simple

371
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:11,270
like this one where this is I guess a

372
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,070
lot for lack of a better word it's a

373
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:16,629
rootkit that one of the students wrote

374
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:20,980
we wanted to build a shim between the

375
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:25,880
the kernel and user LAN so that we could

376
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,860
stop certain processes from reaching the

377
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,450
netfilter

378
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:31,129
so we built folks around the net filter

379
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,900
this is kind of like our first

380
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,790
representation of what it is we want to

381
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,410
do whenever you're trying to convey

382
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,940
something that's technical you want to

383
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,700
get very simple with your diagrams

384
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,290
because you know I can make it or show

385
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,150
you a diagram that we did this is our

386
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,649
lab and then again we have a lot of

387
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,950
information on the screen but it's very

388
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,570
hard to ascertain what's going on so if

389
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,040
we just look at a particular piece of

390
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,470
this diagram and say okay here we go

391
00:17:52,040 --> 00:18:02,149
this is a power flow so we're in this

392
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:04,040
application some stuff that on the power

393
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:07,790
grid operational side things are turning

394
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,680
red and so you can get an idea things

395
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,450
might be going on what's happening under

396
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,340
the hood behind here so that we try to

397
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,770
map physical connections and impact

398
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,020
together so like what would happen if a

399
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,210
got hacked what would be the impact on

400
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,320
the larger system in order to do that we

401
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:24,290
have to look at all the individual

402
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,270
components of the system and then we can

403
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,639
graph what it looks like normally so

404
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,870
this is normal power flow state and then

405
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,080
when something weird happens on the

406
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:35,658
power grid there's a perturbation and

407
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:40,019
the power starts to come back now

408
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:42,239
what now again in terms of visualization

409
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:44,700
I don't think any of us need to be an

410
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:47,820
electrical engineer to know this is not

411
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,129
a steady-state there's a problem here

412
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,839
can everybody see that there's a problem

413
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,428
it's pretty clear in the visualization

414
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,099
that there's a problem we don't know a

415
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:57,749
lot of reasons about why it is I just

416
00:18:56,099 --> 00:19:00,749
know that's bad and I'm not an

417
00:18:57,749 --> 00:19:02,249
electrical engineer and then and in

418
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:03,659
terms of modeling we do a lot of things

419
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:06,929
like oh here's a bunch of different

420
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:09,450
substations and then we did a we wrote a

421
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:11,369
tool that did visualization of eight

422
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:15,419
substations based on the I Triple E

423
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:18,209
model and so here's a screenshot from

424
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,429
the tool and then we played with

425
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,559
different visualizations like we had a

426
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:24,089
tree that we tried to use to show

427
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,739
individual components inside a

428
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:28,408
substation yard but the problem we had

429
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:30,479
was like when it got to show 300

430
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:32,070
substation there was a problem because

431
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:33,779
we got really against and then

432
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:38,820
everything really didn't move around

433
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:40,950
well inside the computer so we tried d3

434
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,468
so this is kind of a screenshot of d3

435
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,239
and what it looks like when and it looks

436
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:48,450
really shitty on this screen because I

437
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:50,940
don't know it's just Brazil and maybe my

438
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:54,869
computer doesn't like Brazilian video

439
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:57,509
adapters so there's in that picture a

440
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:59,039
substation networks but I think that

441
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:00,690
it's better just to show you the tool

442
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,580
because it's a tool we actually wrote so

443
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,710
let's see if this works okay here we go

444
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,019
so this is the tool that I had two

445
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:10,109
screenshots of let's see if it's still

446
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:12,059
working so basically what it is is you

447
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:16,019
have a blended view here where we have a

448
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:18,889
list of all of the different individual

449
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:22,739
components and then I can look at the

450
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:26,399
cybersecurity view we also have a view

451
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:30,059
of the physical network so here's an the

452
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:34,018
the physical network and then what we

453
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:38,158
can also get is if we come down here I

454
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:41,549
can get a list of which hosts are

455
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,320
patched and not patched we can mark host

456
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:46,879
is being compromised and then you can

457
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,230
get a recalculation of the the top in

458
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:52,980
priority devices and

459
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:55,500
then back to the visualizations so this

460
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,090
is the I'm going to zoom out a little

461
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,690
bit so you can see both of them at the

462
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,520
same time the same visualization that I

463
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,630
had the screenshot of so if i zoom in

464
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:09,660
here we can see the Springfield sub and

465
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:12,620
then we have ogdenville Paris and

466
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:15,240
Cypress Creek and then there's

467
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:19,370
haverbrook in capital city North

468
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:24,000
Haverhill broker so pick a substation

469
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:26,520
which one do you want to see this one's

470
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,970
good you sure all right let's see what

471
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,799
happens I'm going to click on it and so

472
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,210
when I click on Shelby Velma to zoom out

473
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:37,139
a little bit hopefully you can see this

474
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:41,910
I see that I can get a view overview of

475
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:43,830
the network over here and then so this

476
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,660
is a tree view so I can click on this

477
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:50,129
and then I get a view of what's in the

478
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:53,070
yard so the idea being how do you dean s

479
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:55,110
these things and get a better

480
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,129
visualization about what's going on it's

481
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:00,780
something that's a little complicated

482
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:02,850
and spread out but again even as this

483
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,530
tiny screen actually get busy then I can

484
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,530
click on individual links and get

485
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,090
information about specific devices in a

486
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:12,178
column that really doesn't come up when

487
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,070
I'm in 1024 by 768 or whatever small

488
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,650
amount of real estate I get to project

489
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:19,168
on right now

490
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:20,730
but the other visualization we worked on

491
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:23,610
is kind of like this it's a tabular

492
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:25,410
format where you get all of the

493
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:28,229
information sitting on the left side and

494
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,700
and and it's kind of fainted out here

495
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:33,210
but we still have the capital city

496
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,880
Cypress Creek haverbrook etc and we just

497
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,470
looked at at Springfield so I'm going to

498
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,480
click on Shelbyville which is right here

499
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:42,540
it's the the link right before it and

500
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,080
see that each one of these substations

501
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:48,928
is now represented in the right screen

502
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:51,000
and you can get a better idea of where

503
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:52,530
each location is and what devices and

504
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,390
where the connectivity is in here and

505
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:59,460
this is a live diagram that also has an

506
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:03,150
entire markup language behind it in owl

507
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:05,100
and you can do different style

508
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:07,860
and if you're into that kind of json ii

509
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,050
thing you can make and add a lot of rich

510
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,240
metadata into these documents with this

511
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,490
and this is open source you can actually

512
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,720
download this I can give you a link to

513
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,460
it or something like that but I'm not

514
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,050
really trying to hawk software that I've

515
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,480
written I was just showing you the

516
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:22,710
visualization because so if we go into

517
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,500
this this is the three hundred

518
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,520
substations and if I were to try and

519
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,650
zoom in to this it would take

520
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,960
approximately 30 seconds to go in one

521
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:32,670
degree so would take a really long time

522
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,830
to get it seen one substation and this

523
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:36,630
is like the problem that you have in

524
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,870
visualization and then like I said we

525
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:42,420
tried d3 for a little bit so that this

526
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:44,669
exact diagram over here where we have

527
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,320
all these different substations we did

528
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,140
it in d3 and it kind of looks like this

529
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:54,360
so now here we have eight substations

530
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:56,490
and it's visualized in d3 so you know I

531
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,469
can zoom in on this and grab something

532
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:01,710
and move it around but then I have no

533
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:03,450
idea where I am with this little one

534
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:07,850
device and then I have to zoom back out

535
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:13,380
and I'm losing losing it again and so

536
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:15,870
from perspective of we build tools are

537
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,820
we wasting our energy and resources and

538
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:20,459
making visualizations and tools that

539
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,350
effectively don't really provide

540
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:28,530
anything but really cool demos that you

541
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:30,449
can do at hacker conferences so we're

542
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,790
not done yet but that was a demo let's

543
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:35,000
see if we can get back into the slides

544
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:40,530
there's another tool that I worked on

545
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:43,520
called network network perception so

546
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:45,840
what it does is it takes a firewall and

547
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,389
ingest the configuration of file and

548
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,428
makes a diagram of the attack surface

549
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:52,679
and you can make pretty pictures like

550
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:56,760
this this this is like what a power grid

551
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:58,320
would look like like a real utility that

552
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,860
operates the power grid and what they

553
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,470
use for things like EMS specific traffic

554
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:06,169
and you can make really nice

555
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:09,809
visualizations but it all comes out from

556
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:11,520
things like oh I can also show specific

557
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:15,030
protocol traffic in this visualization

558
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,418
and then as academics we get we get

559
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,908
funding to add on fee

560
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:23,529
so there was a government agency that

561
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:27,850
asked us to add this idea of how do you

562
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:30,460
measure attack surface from what can get

563
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:32,769
to a from B and then what can get to B

564
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:35,739
from C and how do you really visualize

565
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:37,840
this idea of attack surface where if we

566
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:39,519
look over there on the left

567
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,279
or if i zoom in a little bit you can see

568
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,989
you get some some numerical information

569
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:46,330
about how big the attack surface of

570
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:49,840
different things might be so I can see

571
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:52,059
that while there's only one device that

572
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,189
can directly connect to this I see that

573
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:57,279
there's 78 devices that can connect to

574
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:58,899
this device to get to the other device

575
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,029
and then we could try to measure these

576
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:03,518
things and attack surface mathematically

577
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:04,720
because if I do 10,000 things on the

578
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,960
screen and not really going to be able

579
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,200
to see it as a human being but we can

580
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,359
see it mathematically and then like the

581
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,609
tool you know it kind of looks like this

582
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:19,749
when networks first come out and then

583
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:23,100
this is kind of like what it looks like

584
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:25,929
if you expand everything initially but

585
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,969
you know I was drinking last night I'm

586
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:30,009
kind of like drinking already today I'm

587
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:32,549
doing a lot of demos so we're gonna try

588
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:35,109
and do another demo of this actual tool

589
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:37,119
if I don't really just blow out the

590
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:40,178
presentation here let's find this so

591
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:43,029
I've already loaded the firewalls into

592
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:45,549
this tool so this is actual firewall

593
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:48,129
information so if I go into the map I

594
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:50,799
can kind of like expand all our nodes

595
00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:52,869
and you can see that this is also a live

596
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:56,139
tool where I can go in and seed this is

597
00:26:52,869 --> 00:27:01,029
a network of I think this is a control

598
00:26:56,139 --> 00:27:02,830
network somewhere and then again with

599
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:05,499
the idea of being at or a current theme

600
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:07,269
in this talk is when i zoom in to get

601
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:09,489
more information specifically about an

602
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:12,070
object I lose a perspective of where it

603
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:15,249
is in the larger diagram and then how do

604
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:16,928
I present that when I'm in front of a

605
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:18,909
bunch of people trying to explain how

606
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:21,549
complicated the power grid might be and

607
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:23,259
they say oh this is this is the inside

608
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:26,440
of the power grid but then I have to

609
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:27,550
zoom back out again ago and if it will

610
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,650
let me zoom out

611
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:31,690
and it's connected to all this other

612
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:33,550
stuff but now you're really losing focus

613
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:35,170
of what was important because we have a

614
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,270
much larger diagram and you're losing

615
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:39,790
the frame of reference about how that

616
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:41,860
one specific thing is connected and this

617
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:44,409
is a very hard problem at visualization

618
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:47,080
because do you want information that's

619
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,970
relevant to you as a security analyst or

620
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,649
do you want information that a

621
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:53,640
non-technical person is going to

622
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:57,010
understand that this is complicated and

623
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:00,040
then so that's like the story behind

624
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,990
this tool and you know if I'm still

625
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,670
sober later you can always come to me

626
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,990
and I can give you a more detailed view

627
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,120
of any of these tools if you might be

628
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,080
interested in them but I don't want to

629
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,760
be here all day

630
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,100
because I'm not going to be the single

631
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,520
man at the h2 HC University today

632
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:17,169
unfortunately or fortunately we should

633
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,389
probably already sick of me anyway let's

634
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:23,950
see so let's see if we can get back into

635
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:25,990
this because you know at my heart I am a

636
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:29,440
security analyst oh and we have another

637
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:31,420
so this was an interesting one so the

638
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,310
tool I just showed you with the eight

639
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,110
substations is going through a new

640
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:38,530
version this is like a mock-up of the

641
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:42,820
front end and so we're going right back

642
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:45,850
into another demo this is the actual

643
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:49,179
tool so the problem is that I can't

644
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:56,760
really give you a good visualization

645
00:28:49,180 --> 00:29:00,010
because it's got some problems possibly

646
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:05,730
the researcher that wrote this school

647
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:08,800
did it in anybody ever heard of Pascal

648
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:10,570
right Pascal is not a person it's a

649
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:15,010
language so do you know that there's

650
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:17,439
actually a visual Pascal so this is

651
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:19,990
written in visual Pascal it is a

652
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,370
complete nightmare of an application

653
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:25,690
right now so it's being completely

654
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:26,979
rewritten in html5 so but right now it's

655
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:30,340
it's loaded with all kind of

656
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:32,500
vulnerabilities but the owner of the

657
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,600
software was notified because I'm the

658
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,640
owner of the software so there was

659
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:40,469
responsible disclosure in this problem

660
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,470
but this thing is riddled with problems

661
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:46,919
Pascal is bad it is very unsafe and and

662
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:51,279
it really shouldn't even be mentioned

663
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:55,240
ever but there are Power Grid

664
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:57,460
applications that run on a development

665
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:02,230
suite that is basis basically visual

666
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:04,870
Pascal so the third world still exists

667
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:10,029
in America in terms of running software

668
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:11,350
in utilities so alright that was a quick

669
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:19,409
demo so now we I got it back on the

670
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:21,520
slides because let's see all right so

671
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:24,149
I'm also working with other group of

672
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,580
folks where we're trying to visualize

673
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:29,639
the mr. logical reference model so the

674
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,559
government gave us a bunch of money to

675
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,720
categorize a bunch of regulations that

676
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,020
are called the 61 850 which is a

677
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,309
standard for the power grid you don't

678
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:42,190
really need to know anything more than

679
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:43,990
it's very convoluted this is kind of

680
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:46,929
like a 2d graph of all the relationships

681
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:48,940
between objects in the NIST or 61 850

682
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:51,159
and you can kind of zoom in a little bit

683
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,970
on this and see some other things so we

684
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:58,600
were playing around with a certain

685
00:30:53,970 --> 00:31:01,029
library and we have a tool that kind of

686
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,250
like doesn't turn on visualization here

687
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:05,380
and of course we're going to do another

688
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:10,210
demo because I haven't done enough demos

689
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:12,789
yet in my talk so let's see about this

690
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:15,490
is it actually going to work the screen

691
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:16,840
comes up so here we go this is the

692
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,700
nistrim I'll kind of like you saw in the

693
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,779
screenshot and we can zoom out a little

694
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:24,760
bit and then you can see I could turn

695
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:27,610
the visualization on its side and I can

696
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:32,169
get a frame of reference for different

697
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:35,189
pieces of operation and doesn't that

698
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:38,289
look cool it's really sexy

699
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:39,760
and I've got a lot of information here

700
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:41,529
but they're not gonna go over here and

701
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,270
I'm gonna try and drive this from here

702
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:44,870
and that from that screen because I

703
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,670
really

704
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:50,010
sunglasses anything that's on this

705
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:51,270
screen so if anybody wants to see this

706
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:53,190
later I'll leave it running in the

707
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:56,430
laptop if you can find me before I get

708
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,360
too drunk but I can go and over here on

709
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:00,660
the right we have these different

710
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:05,909
categories so I can click and get a

711
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:07,710
filtered view of different pieces of the

712
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:11,340
operation that we might be interested in

713
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,990
and feed and in the next version of this

714
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,860
visualization we want to feed real-time

715
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:19,080
data from both cyber and physical impact

716
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:22,290
into a diagram like this so that may be

717
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,600
a compulsion you can remove certain

718
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:25,530
aspects like the business-to-business

719
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,490
connectivity or see where it might be

720
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:31,170
inside this visualization so I think

721
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,600
this might be the first time I've showed

722
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:37,170
this one on it in a different hemisphere

723
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:40,800
so does it play well in South America I

724
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:42,240
mean was does this suck I mean what what

725
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:50,540
do you think of a visualization like

726
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:53,490
this awesome now I think that the word

727
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,680
if it works because I understand the

728
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:58,260
word terrific means something different

729
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,890
in Portuguese it's like it's right

730
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:03,210
I think this is terrific

731
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:05,670
because you know in my language terrific

732
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,590
is a good thing but I think that what

733
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:10,950
you really don't get is like I still

734
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:13,560
have basically a really pretty diagram I

735
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,390
can zoom into but there's a lot of

736
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,190
complexity involved in sending

737
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:18,420
information into a diagram like this in

738
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:20,820
real time but I can do cool things

739
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:25,020
especially in a demo with non-technical

740
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:27,689
people or solo well you know here is the

741
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,610
the systems that are connected to AMI

742
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,920
and then I can kind of like maybe just

743
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:34,020
remove everything from the diagram and

744
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:38,130
show only those systems so that you can

745
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:41,970
see the ami piece of this is just a very

746
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:47,700
small layer inside this nested object

747
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:49,440
and you can see in this entire piece of

748
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,060
operational equipment they only are a

749
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,550
very small number of things that

750
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:56,909
actually do anything and then if we

751
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:58,470
click back on this there's supposed to

752
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,900
be a button that I can click on it

753
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:04,770
turns everything back on but in the true

754
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:07,559
spirit of hangover and not quite drunk

755
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:10,230
yet I can't find that button but there

756
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:12,320
are also filters that you can you can

757
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:14,668
come in here and then add a filter if

758
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,679
you want to select different things and

759
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:19,830
search on metadata and individual

760
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,990
devices so yeah it's what was the word

761
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:23,790
that somebody use awesome that that

762
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:27,750
probably goes well between both of our

763
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:33,320
languages I think it's terrific let's

764
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:38,580
just leave it at that and this is

765
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:40,560
possibly available via open source if I

766
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,540
remember to turn it on in the github

767
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,599
it's actually in the github you can

768
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:48,830
download it it's JSON so you could run

769
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:51,270
this in a browser just like I am this is

770
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:54,179
the one thing that we need to do is

771
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:56,940
though the grad student that wrote it

772
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,710
drop some of the JSON config files

773
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:02,040
online so you actually need to be online

774
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:03,060
to load the tool so like the first time

775
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,119
you do this and again we have to

776
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:08,099
remember that oh I need to load the demo

777
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,080
before I do the presentation I'm giving

778
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:11,880
you like my inside sequence here so like

779
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,098
I don't need to be online but if I

780
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,080
wanted to change the size of the diagram

781
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:17,010
I need to be online and one of the

782
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,750
things we're trying to work on is to

783
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,400
make the application portable so that

784
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:24,359
you don't need to be online to change

785
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,190
the screen size so airing all of my

786
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:29,369
dirty laundry in front of my friends in

787
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:31,230
Brazil and whoever might be hearing me

788
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:35,280
in the video here we go so let's get

789
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:37,140
back and see what's next because I think

790
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,330
I've got a couple of more demos before

791
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:41,069
we're done unless you just want me to

792
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:43,170
end now because I think I'm ending on a

793
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:46,220
pretty good notice I stop now but I want

794
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,820
to talk about this because this is

795
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:51,799
awesome to me

796
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:55,800
I'm a security analyst I like to see

797
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:58,440
closed and off to the left the IP

798
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,960
address column is hidden because this is

799
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:05,570
real data so we work with a utility and

800
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,710
what we're doing is modeling their

801
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:10,800
primary protocols that use to

802
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:12,240
communicate with substations and we made

803
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,330
a few visualizations

804
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,009
and you know the idea behind power grid

805
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:20,250
traffic is that it's deterministic and

806
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:22,050
then that there is predictability in

807
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,609
data flows and if you look at this

808
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:26,280
visualization it really depicts that

809
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:27,869
well doesn't it does that look it's very

810
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,940
predictable what the data flows are

811
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:33,839
going to be but the interesting thing is

812
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:35,880
if you zoom in you don't really see that

813
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,339
same thing and it's we're going back to

814
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,440
the same recurring theme where when you

815
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:42,150
provide more detailed information in a

816
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,680
visualization you lose the bigger

817
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:49,140
picture but I'm getting tired of this

818
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,810
presentation just like you are and I'd

819
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,368
rather just see another demo so should

820
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,980
we actually load up the live demo here

821
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:59,250
the live data in a Wireshark and we

822
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:03,240
could take a look at it so let's see the

823
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:04,800
actual graph is right here so this is

824
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,580
actually from a different trace from the

825
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,040
screenshot this is our DNP trace number

826
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:14,220
4 so you have here this these little

827
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,920
bumps we see a burst out of traffic but

828
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,270
again if i zoom in on the diagram you

829
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,280
can see that there's a layer of

830
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:23,910
abstraction here when we zoom in but

831
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,520
then we're losing the the bigger picture

832
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:29,160
so in terms of visualization how do you

833
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:32,280
really depict that there is this this

834
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,049
jump up and down in packet rate in this

835
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,960
diagram that you really can't see when

836
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:40,650
you zoom back out again and this is a

837
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,839
traffic over a 14 hour period so it

838
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:46,140
actually took almost two minutes to load

839
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:47,849
the graphic in Wireshark and it's kind

840
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,799
of a miracle my laptop hasn't crashed

841
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,300
yet with all these programs that I'm

842
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:59,280
running while I'm doing a presentation

843
00:37:51,300 --> 00:38:04,020
live but I think let's see if I did this

844
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:07,230
correctly I did nice so here's that same

845
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:09,300
column with the IP addresses redacted

846
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,130
off to the left so if I wanted to be

847
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,230
really cool I could kind of move over

848
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:16,849
here and tease you and show you the last

849
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:21,140
octet of the traffic but so this is like

850
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:23,569
communication out to substations

851
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,859
and it's controlled traffic that keeps

852
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:27,019
the power up and down and one of the

853
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:28,700
things we noticed in this run of traffic

854
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:34,160
was that there were a couple that were

855
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:35,509
like not working and so they they had

856
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,399
connections in place but they weren't

857
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:41,420
actually using this protocol in

858
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:44,089
production yet so you know I can see

859
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,109
that as an analyst it zero is not good

860
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:48,109
when I'm supposed to have a

861
00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:49,940
deterministic traffic flow but if I go

862
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:54,740
back to the visualization I can't really

863
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:56,660
see any zeros in this I mean it looks

864
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,129
like a very deterministic traffic flow

865
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:04,970
to me if i zoom out on it

866
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:06,799
pretty steady rate of packets so let me

867
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:12,200
see if I can find my presentation again

868
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:15,500
so this traffic that I just showed you

869
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,000
in Wireshark also looks like this so I

870
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,240
actually don't have access to this

871
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,500
application to show you live short of

872
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:28,788
hacking into fortune 500 utility live

873
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:30,259
while I'm on stage in Brazil and the

874
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:31,460
network here is a little bit hostile

875
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:33,289
right now so I don't think I really want

876
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:36,559
to do that but if you were to go into

877
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:39,470
the not they have a big giant 4k screen

878
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:44,210
and this is all of the the flow of

879
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:46,970
traffic at this utility and they did a

880
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:49,730
lot of work to block out all the names

881
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:52,519
of the substations to release this so

882
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:54,680
that I could show publicly that the flow

883
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:55,848
diagram but the thing that's more

884
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,038
interesting to me in terms of

885
00:39:55,849 --> 00:40:01,190
visualization is it's a really cool

886
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:03,849
visualization it's awesome right isn't

887
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:06,380
this awesome it's also terrible because

888
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:06,950
look over here it's terrible it's not

889
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,150
terrible

890
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:12,589
what was the word I was using earlier

891
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:14,299
this it's terrific exactly because if

892
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:17,150
you look over here to the left and see

893
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:19,069
all those blue squares that's 400

894
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:21,380
devices that can't fit onto the screen

895
00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:23,839
because there's not enough computing

896
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:27,259
power in the server class machine that

897
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,029
is doing this basically pulling this

898
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:31,099
information off attack and visualizing

899
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:32,910
it this is the state of the art event in

900
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:34,800
real time visualization

901
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:37,920
and this is a very small Network it's

902
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,270
400 devices and they can't provide

903
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,510
anything more than what you see on the

904
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:45,690
right dismiss traffic from 400 different

905
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:47,960
flows and then like if you zoom in

906
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:50,610
further we lose a complete picture of

907
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,530
the context of the diagram again but I

908
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:54,510
get more fine-grained information about

909
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:56,550
how the different EMS service

910
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:59,160
communicate to each other and in what

911
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:01,890
specific TCP protocols they're using and

912
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,779
then I can relatively size the data

913
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,310
flows by using little circles and it

914
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:08,190
looks really cool but again if we come

915
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:11,009
back out again I really lose that that

916
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:15,710
detail in the visualization so the real

917
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:21,270
question is as developers of tools is is

918
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:24,860
visualization necessary still you know

919
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:29,460
that's the that's the real question and

920
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:30,960
that is the end of the presentation I

921
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,450
think so

922
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,360
I made it all the way through all of

923
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:38,399
these demos without anything going wrong

924
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,680
other than I probably started a some

925
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,060
kind of really big feud between me and

926
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,580
the AV guy in the beginning of the

927
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,180
presentation because he wouldn't listen

928
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,120
to me

929
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:51,690
so if anybody has any questions we can

930
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:53,700
maybe take some now I don't know this is

931
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:54,900
a Brazilian conference so I don't know

932
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,790
that they're really paying close

933
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:01,400
attention to when when the talk is going

934
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:07,890
to end and how much time I actually used

935
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:10,350
because it's 10 o'clock 9 10:09 so any

936
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:16,470
questions anybody the Washington was so

937
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:17,549
curious about the trees dark trees dark

938
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:22,259
trace yeah

939
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:25,620
no the movie hackers no no no no no no

940
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:30,710
that trees are too dark traces at all

941
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:36,080
you know I don't know that so ok because

942
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:42,870
the visualization reminded me a lot and

943
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:47,130
the details the this tile yeah do

944
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:49,470
I mean the style is common because what

945
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:51,870
we use are open source available

946
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:54,299
libraries for visualization you know

947
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:57,480
there's there's a d3 in these

948
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:59,430
visualizations and we use JSON and tools

949
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,140
that folks like the people who wrote

950
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:03,509
dart race would so a lot of these tools

951
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,640
are going to look similar yeah what

952
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:07,650
differentiates the tools is the data

953
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:10,379
that you put into them to make the

954
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:12,330
visualization go and as an analyst you

955
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,130
need to understand the information

956
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:16,350
that's going into the visualization

957
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:17,940
because folks that don't understand your

958
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,529
field of expertise are just going to

959
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,840
depend on the visualization to get an

960
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:25,610
idea about what it is you're doing so

961
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:29,550
yeah it's a great question though hi

962
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:33,120
when when you have a cloud cloud

963
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:36,960
infrastructure you don't have border

964
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:41,810
devices and something some device that

965
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:44,700
have this information how you resolve to

966
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:47,040
monitoring those connections and those

967
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,319
device what lives in your network and

968
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:53,759
you know you are not monitoring that

969
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:58,050
like it will be answered so I think

970
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,640
you're asking the question about how do

971
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:01,920
you ensure that you're seeing all the

972
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:05,220
network traffic and how do you use taps

973
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,580
or traces to get the the data like if

974
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:10,500
you look at how does the data come from

975
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,759
this visualization is maybe as an

976
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,870
example of the question that you're

977
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,330
having so this utility has tapped on the

978
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:20,850
backbone so they they tap the entire

979
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:23,910
Ethernet switch in a 10 gig connection

980
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:26,700
and then it gets put into a 48 processor

981
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:28,649
computer so there's a lot of hardware

982
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,200
behind a visualization like this and

983
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:33,030
it's not like a bump in the wire like

984
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,830
you would see with an Ethernet tap or

985
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:37,230
something like that this is done at the

986
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:38,850
switch level and I don't know if that

987
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:42,540
answered the question you had but I gave

988
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:45,750
it a good shot ok and you can see me

989
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:48,740
after I'll be around all day all right

990
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,740
well thank you very much

991
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:01,650
hopefully to talk wasn't terrific good

992
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,650
morning
