[Music]

2
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:21,180
this talk is about sonic attack -

3
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:23,240
spinning hard drives and I am an

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,090
authority I am a security researcher

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,369
developer whatever from Argentina so I

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,759
come here because a very short trip a

7
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,320
very nice country let's start with the

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,930
talk because basically this talk is

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,149
about demonstration I have like a five

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,519
or six demonstration maybe not all will

11
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,600
work but that's the good thing about

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,719
them right

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,910
ok this talk is about measuring audio

14
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,129
with hard disk these look like a crazy

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:56,218
thing but it actually works quite fine

16
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:58,260
you need to set up this is I create a

17
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:04,830
set up is basically a regular hard disk

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:09,689
blue - just a piece of iron that

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,310
simulates a computer box also this can

20
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:15,919
be done with a heart inside a notebook

21
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,920
but it's not so obvious so to increase

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,140
the effect I do it remotely so I so you

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,909
can see that it's actually a regular

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,229
hard disk it's not like a magic trick so

25
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,700
let's let's go in

26
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:36,750
let's go on how this works but this is a

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,820
timing attack I mean if you do security

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,850
since why you can see that time and like

29
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,470
timing attacks can be very serious

30
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,390
lightly in the last year there's a lot

31
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,030
of time in attack for example a spectra

32
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,950
and meltdown there are timing attacks

33
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,530
the problem with the computers are they

34
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,189
are too fast and too precise and you can

35
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,560
measure anything the way that you

36
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,750
basically rack or algo with the hard

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,320
disk is measuring the difference of time

38
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,649
is basically the same side channel that

39
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,919
you can use measuring difference in CPU

40
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:13,230
processing or or whatever you can for

41
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:16,679
any system to be safe you cannot leave

42
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,790
information and religion you very I see

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,810
the tracer variation and timing between

44
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,250
an assistant as shown

45
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,080
shouldn't be any variation you can

46
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,670
measure Advent detect things in this

47
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,840
case we can detect Lu

48
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:33,540
but we can detect a lot of things for

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,959
example what this is what I was speaking

50
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,450
with just now I it's very easy to

51
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,470
actually measure out your heart is a

52
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,929
very sensitive device they don't stand a

53
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,690
lot of liberation and audio as you can

54
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,549
see is vibration that's why in the

55
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,250
server environment I say that you have

56
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:55,910
to mount hard disk in rubber amounts

57
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:59,609
because they are very sensitive to

58
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:02,160
vibrations and audio the thing that they

59
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:05,069
want say is that the person of of hard

60
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,930
drives actually varies a lot with the

61
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:08,578
vibrations I mean you havin a lot of

62
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,769
environment with a lot of vibration they

63
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:13,890
the person will go down and we can

64
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:17,220
measure that I mean this is super simple

65
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,779
this is C code that you can see down is

66
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,109
basically all the thing what you had to

67
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:26,810
do we only need to read a file our times

68
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:28,799
and measure how you will think that is

69
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,019
simple read will take the same time

70
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,819
every time and not that is not right

71
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,299
that's not right

72
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,548
this simple color to read a little file

73
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,919
in the hard disk will change something

74
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,750
we will take 100 milliseconds on the

75
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,849
return 1 milliseconds and this

76
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,569
difference is basically the vibration

77
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:50,730
that they heard this is bass feeling so

78
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:54,089
that does basically this is very easy

79
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,459
now the thing we can do is a little

80
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,799
toughest demonstration is about not a

81
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:03,989
heart lies with about anything else for

82
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:07,049
example every siskel whether you recover

83
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:13,790
you to the kernel should take the same

84
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:13,790
amount of time Terry but in reality

85
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:20,209
let's do the first demonstration here

86
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:30,419
but what we are seeing here is a simple

87
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,090
culture to the camel to ask from the

88
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,310
process number is get Pete if you can

89
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,679
see just just I asked the colonel okay

90
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,710
give me my process number so this year

91
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,100
we take exactly the same amount of time

92
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:45,930
we plot this time in the x-axis and the

93
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,400
I axis is the time and we can see a

94
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,290
brain interesting thing here sim well

95
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,320
what it is what is that that thing that

96
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:54,870
we are seeing here the blue part is it a

97
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,540
spectrum and the yellow part is basic

98
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,660
like no oscilloscope so that line should

99
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,660
be a straight line but it is not because

100
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,540
why because the colonel have a lot of

101
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,000
internal there are a lot of process in

102
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,520
this computer and they're firing

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,130
constantly and while you were seeing

104
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,560
here is basically kernel load that we

105
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,120
are not supposed to see but we can see

106
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,830
it anyway because because the computers

107
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,410
are really fast and they optimize a lot

108
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,620
so every time we see a little line here

109
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,970
is the camera waking up to do some

110
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,710
additional some hiding process for

111
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:32,460
example there are these maintenance or

112
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:34,409
or or Y field car so we actually can see

113
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,260
this from our own privilege process and

114
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,630
this is basically from every Cisco we

115
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:46,620
can we can call for example we can try

116
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:48,240
whatever Cisco we want sorry I'm not

117
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,620
very good programmers on how to kill it

118
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,770
the old-school way for example we can

119
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:59,460
try with a stub Cisco start Siskel is

120
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,680
just ask for information about a file

121
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,219
what whatever file we can see there is a

122
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,990
different pattern here but it's

123
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,700
basically the same and we can for

124
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,010
example it let's do another thing in

125
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,849
another process here you will move this

126
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:17,070
window it should see I will not see very

127
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,710
much but that is demonstration Center

128
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,840
station was working very well but the

129
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,909
thing is we actually are seeing the

130
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,390
internal behavior of the kernel that we

131
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,620
shall see and we use these two ratings

132
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,229
and a hard disk

133
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,630
it's the same thing but you the thing I

134
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:35,460
want to say is this not only for

135
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,080
artistic you can miss you can use a

136
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:41,810
timely attack to measure all kind of

137
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:46,710
physical external physical variables

138
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:49,400
let's continue with with the demo so

139
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:53,940
this is but we are sweet we are looking

140
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:56,880
just now we can this is this is

141
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,100
basically a security program in is in

142
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,710
the future tax people will use this and

143
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,410
we read things into T's we take all what

144
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:07,049
is this cows in this variation I don't

145
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,570
know what is that is it there shouldn't

146
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:14,280
be there

147
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:16,770
okay so let's the list - this is a

148
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,989
little graph about the capabilities of

149
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:22,530
the harddrive microphonic off of course

150
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:25,410
is not a high definition microphone is

151
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:28,349
actually is very bad it just listen to

152
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,120
the term it in frequencies because it's

153
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,120
basically a metal case it's not designed

154
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,340
to be a microphone basically it just you

155
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,140
can use to read low frequencies and some

156
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,229
high frequencies but not much in the

157
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:42,419
middle does barriers from hardest to

158
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:47,510
heard this because of resonance of day

159
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:50,100
of the metal box basically and also is

160
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,800
depend a lot in what they hardly see

161
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,530
screw you on I mean is you screw on a

162
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,600
big metal plate like this it basically

163
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,559
will measure the vibration of altimeter

164
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:08,460
place and will be much more sensitive

165
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:10,110
this is the setup that I have here let's

166
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:14,460
do a demonstration now about how this

167
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:17,820
work right okay this is we can we can

168
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,380
measure a movement because the heart is

169
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,550
actually is sensitive to movement the

170
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,830
movement is it's a very low frequency

171
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:26,370
vibration but there's Harless is very

172
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:31,109
very sensitive to it vibration and some

173
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:35,700
sound for example this let's do the

174
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:40,590
demonstration here I think here come the

175
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:44,210
demonstrations let's see the works

176
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,210
I know you work because I just tested

177
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,650
okay now we have a very similar graph

178
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:59,109
but we are plotting the real time of the

179
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,270
hard disk in the yellow line is the is

180
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:05,770
basically we do a lot of really hard

181
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:07,630
disk and every time we are measure it of

182
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,930
course the time we will value less let's

183
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,730
see how it is works okay look at it is

184
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:16,859
quite sensitive I just touched the hard

185
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:21,100
disk and it already took a measurement

186
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:23,380
already since an audio wave also I can

187
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,880
type is so sensitive I can take the

188
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,510
table

189
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:33,280
it actually can play some some music

190
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:37,569
here that is the microphone is thesis

191
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:41,350
but you can see it is super sensitive to

192
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:43,810
to audio we can we can type whatever it

193
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:47,050
may be we can clap how to do very very

194
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:49,540
very very very strong I have another

195
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:52,240
task you to this a self speaker that we

196
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,219
can actually see how sensitive the hair

197
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,440
is to frequency you I want to try to do

198
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,100
is to apply a frequency here to see

199
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,690
which one the harddisks can record this

200
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,570
is a sweep we're gonna do a frequency

201
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:11,040
from 20 Hertz to a very high very high

202
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:11,040
tone you have to be working

203
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:34,830
okay so this is another way that is

204
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:34,830
playing as the frequency is increasing

205
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:45,970
it speakers working

206
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:52,960
yeah printer is working maybe you can

207
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:55,720
see it I don't know it actually it is

208
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,220
world work because we need to have take

209
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,400
Cork a lot of value here and the

210
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:03,100
speakers are really really not a lot of

211
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:09,610
volume here for example is put in there

212
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:11,080
oh this is working well actually the

213
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,750
volume was enough I mean now the hair

214
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,220
this is completely stopped a completely

215
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,100
blocked because it is entering a

216
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,650
resonance the idol took the speaker look

217
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:24,430
at least are working well there were

218
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:26,680
some glitches there the thing is the

219
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,479
hardest if the heretics top working the

220
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,859
kernel with ever Tory crash I mean in no

221
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,260
weight class you will disconnect the

222
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,120
hard disk we can see that as the

223
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,330
frequency increase the Horlicks is no

224
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,120
longer sensitive to it

225
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:42,760
that's it no song but now it's sensitive

226
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:48,520
again I'm gonna stop this horrible

227
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:49,230
because it's hurting my ears so we have

228
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,810
here

229
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,280
it's basically yeah it's cry I used to

230
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,680
do it with a song but this is more

231
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,630
remote more like scientific and a little

232
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,550
strange we can see this is basically

233
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,490
graph of the frequency response I mean

234
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:06,040
with that for 20 Hertz to 20 I know I

235
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:09,220
think to 2 kilo Hertz I mean within

236
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:12,930
reach 20 kilo Hertz but if it is for the

237
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:15,310
microphone it will be a complete as

238
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:18,219
writing but it's not it's not a really a

239
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,199
good microphone and the one person thing

240
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,870
is maybe you can see that at one time

241
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,980
the heart is completely stopped that is

242
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:28,960
because if you find the primordial

243
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,210
resonant frequency of the hard disk I

244
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,310
mean the plate will sublimate a lot and

245
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:36,250
the hardest controller will basically

246
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,439
just stop communication at the crazy

247
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,900
thing is it will not just stop

248
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,480
we stopped responding to the computer I

249
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,250
mean he will not respond even a tea

250
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,870
comment you know I did commands from

251
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,730
Scotty come on to the Harvey's you will

252
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,160
stop completely responding so the camera

253
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,570
will go a little crazy we're gonna see

254
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,339
that we can actually crush a computer

255
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,610
there was some research that a Windows

256
00:12:54,340 --> 00:13:00,430
it just blows blue screen Linux doesn't

257
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,960
blue screen but it just won't disconnect

258
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,030
the hard disk and we can see in our

259
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,860
demonstration here I want do a

260
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:09,370
demonstration of that here because I

261
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:12,690
need a very high song for 60 seconds

262
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:16,090
that's it that I'm out of the kernel and

263
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:20,710
it's crazy and II use undo it if you

264
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:24,640
want this continual demonstration oh

265
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:26,620
this is some crazy things because I just

266
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,120
realized what is this should work

267
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,690
remotely I mean there's nothing has

268
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,910
taught me to log to clothes or wealth I

269
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:37,230
use hard disk and do exactly the same

270
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:40,600
test so maybe I can listen to how the

271
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:44,920
abrasions footstep whatever that are in

272
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:48,160
a remote data center I mean that will

273
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:53,310
work well I tried I tried not Microsoft

274
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:55,270
servers and I have a video to prove it I

275
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,459
don't want to connect your microphone

276
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,980
Microsoft server now also you had to

277
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:09,280
wait on jalisa - sound - Sunday - to

278
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:12,640
step on the data in the data center okay

279
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:16,439
I have in video what I did now you can

280
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:19,240
see there is I connect to the UN Asher

281
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,870
Asher is the cloud computer from

282
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:25,810
Microsoft that's the IP yes whatever law

283
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:29,800
you need I don't care and I run to the

284
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:34,209
same mesh room system I just I know I'm

285
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,890
measuring the hard disk of the willful

286
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,710
machine now the vector machine actually

287
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,780
Svidler will use a real hard disk so in

288
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:43,390
theory we can measure out your entire

289
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,370
hard is in the claw environment and to

290
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,319
think is that at first I didn't see

291
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:50,809
anything I mean I

292
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,998
it was several several miners' without

293
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:57,800
anything that is industr lubrication

294
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:59,569
there's nobody in a computer so this

295
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,660
video is actually pride long you can see

296
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:04,519
here 15 minutes nothing 60-minute

297
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,949
there's some space liberation there but

298
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:12,980
maybe it's the candle juice blocking for

299
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:15,829
some from some things we go to about 4

300
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:20,149
min 4 you can see we start listen to

301
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:22,670
things the thing is this thing on the

302
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:25,549
side you can see this this red points

303
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:30,589
that is on the right side that one

304
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:33,949
actually that is like like the waveform

305
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:35,449
of the audio variation and and it's

306
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:37,519
different if the camera is waiting for

307
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:40,368
something and if the how this is

308
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,549
vibrating so I can see this is exactly

309
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:45,920
the same way from that I get if I heard

310
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:48,259
this is getting vibration so where we

311
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,139
are looking here is vibrations in the

312
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:53,209
Microsoft data center so I don't know

313
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:55,670
what it is I don't I don't think it's

314
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:59,660
music and in no it's playing music in

315
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:01,910
that center but probably some vibrations

316
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:05,209
on machines start running or something

317
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:07,368
working so the thing is this is so

318
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:10,189
powerful it actually can measure things

319
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:11,600
outside the booth from machine as long

320
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:13,670
as you have a real hardest but this

321
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,910
doesn't work in SSD so if you have an

322
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:18,019
SSD you're safe I try it

323
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:21,199
stupidly because of course nothing will

324
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:24,230
graze an SSD but the thing is it's

325
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,569
actually work you can measure vibrations

326
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,389
in a remote at the center is crazy but

327
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:32,179
work but the crazier things is you

328
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:34,490
actually can attack a heretical causa

329
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:38,419
Daniel sorry actually we just saw that

330
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:42,319
when we reach about 150 Hertz you can

331
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:44,089
see the hardest stop working and this is

332
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:46,729
basically physics I mean you find the

333
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:49,699
resonant frequencies of any mechanical

334
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:52,069
device you will break it and you can

335
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:54,559
bring down that a bridge with that so

336
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:58,309
the thing is you need very little power

337
00:16:54,559 --> 00:17:00,730
I mean this speaker is only not even a

338
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:02,350
word any no not even half of what

339
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,360
the stocks that actually worked as way

340
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,579
you just found this restaurant frequency

341
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:09,040
of this entry figure just blow away so

342
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:11,349
we can do it with the hard disk yes we

343
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,240
can do it and I have another

344
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:14,559
demonstration I won't do here because I

345
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,569
don't want to spin out a different how

346
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:23,339
this every time I do this this

347
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:23,339
demonstration but I have in video

348
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:30,140
so this is the sound you know it's very

349
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:32,990
very loud

350
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:36,950
the Hardys here is just stop stop

351
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:40,760
responding to the kernel and if you can

352
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:43,580
see here I just I just did our I just

353
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,919
did a common to the kernel asking from

354
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,510
harvest and then we can see there is the

355
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,909
camera basically disconnect the hard

356
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,610
disk it doesn't exist anymore because

357
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:54,020
they can't the Linux kernel you can see

358
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,850
the errors they see that is it camera

359
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,350
saying that they do the harvest is not

360
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:01,070
responding anymore it's not responding

361
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:04,520
anymore and after a minute it just just

362
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,408
disconnected and it doesn't work anymore

363
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,150
I mean the only thing you can you can do

364
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:11,750
it is to reboot the Machine and it will

365
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:14,990
recognize the Hardys again but of course

366
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,700
you can damage to have this community i

367
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:19,220
damaged a lot I mean if with enough

368
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:22,179
volume you can you can destroy it very

369
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:25,610
easily they're very sensitive devices

370
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:27,950
I meant idea is that actually you need

371
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:31,820
very little sound to do it of course you

372
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:34,700
do have a bigger sound you can really

373
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:43,730
destroy how far this very easily let's

374
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:46,480
see a demonstration of course okay now I

375
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:52,210
use a song here so we can actually see

376
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,210
the beads you can hear

377
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,899
[Music]

378
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:12,230
that's the 1000 watt speaker I'm

379
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:12,230
increasing the volume you can see it

380
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:26,070
actually stopped working but that is

381
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,410
really not the Anna Spector I mean if

382
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,720
you put a 1000 speaker the hardest it

383
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:33,690
will basically destroy yourself but the

384
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,100
thing is you can't do it with a 200

385
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,050
milli watt speaker that is basically

386
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,469
that ain't a new thing that you can do

387
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:42,629
this are several select cases when

388
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,700
alarms going on in in data centers and

389
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:49,050
blowing up the hard disk and completely

390
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:51,360
destroy them so let's go in to speak

391
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,830
about similar work because this is not

392
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,429
actually probably hooked you actually a

393
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:59,300
poster your works I presented this

394
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:02,340
research about an Argentine in about

395
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:05,669
2016 I think one year ago a couple years

396
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:10,110
ago and they were after that they were

397
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:12,150
much better research at the warm what

398
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:15,600
ROFL I mean they measure things actually

399
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:18,360
build models and they discovered the

400
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,860
same thing basically you you blast a

401
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,929
hard disk without you would destroy it

402
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:28,919
I'm surprised here this is from the

403
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:31,440
material niversity is blue note they I

404
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,350
think they did inside me I'm not angry

405
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,880
about that of course not this is another

406
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,679
from Princeton it's the same thing

407
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,440
basically they did a very nice model and

408
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,360
discovered the same thing dimension

409
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,050
actually matched what I did I did it

410
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,090
much more not really scientific

411
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,560
environment but they've measurement

412
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:54,860
actually match pretty well the same

413
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,860
frequency also didn't side me it's okay

414
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:05,460
and well basically that's it we have a

415
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:08,580
lot of the problem here is basically

416
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:11,800
timing attack the cameras should not be

417
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:16,809
able to to let allow you to measure time

418
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:18,850
in such a precise way because you can do

419
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:20,678
this this is only the beginning you can

420
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,980
measure whatever you think I mean you

421
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,840
have wife you can measure position

422
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:28,840
measuring that the variations on the

423
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,428
wife is sinus what can you do you can

424
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,110
measure and measure a lot of things I

425
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:38,230
mean there are timings attack in

426
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:40,689
everything there is a way to to to fix

427
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:44,679
this yes at least to unprivileged user

428
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:48,130
you should made - solution time a

429
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:51,400
survivor this actually is starting to

430
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:55,270
work I mean browsers in JavaScript

431
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,220
doesn't allow and a high precision time

432
00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,429
in anymore because they they know that

433
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:04,270
there are a lot of time aside aside

434
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:06,790
chance there but you still have problems

435
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:09,220
with computers and unprivileged process

436
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,780
and with closed environments because

437
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,809
this actually I had conceived actually

438
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,760
work perfectly in closed environments

439
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:20,050
and what is a fine way to destroy high

440
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:22,260
risk also well nothing that's that's

441
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,260
basically

442
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:34,059
you think it made possible to refer the

443
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:38,470
predetermined sequence of sounds you

444
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:44,730
could write that on that remote hard

445
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:44,730
disk and do your question if if I can

446
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:51,760
using sine modify the content of the

447
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:55,059
hard disk I don't think you can actually

448
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,220
because a hard this is very complex

449
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:59,260
devised when you write a byte you have a

450
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:02,500
error correction code I mean you you

451
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:05,200
have to first find a way to write into

452
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,450
the magnetic plate in such a precision

453
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,710
that you can actually convert a complete

454
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:14,380
sector with the correct the the error

455
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,330
correction called correct and that is

456
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,100
quite unlikely I mean this is basically

457
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:20,620
hitting the harvest wheat up with a

458
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,149
sledgehammer it's not very precise tool

459
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,189
I mean it's precise enough to measure

460
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,350
audio because audio is very slow and

461
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:28,270
actually it's not very good at that

462
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,639
either I mean you can see that you can

463
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:34,559
measure vibration basically like steps

464
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,850
you I cannot measure boys with this yet

465
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:41,470
maybe in the future I will find a way

466
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:44,590
but no it's a very raw technique it's

467
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:49,210
not so precise to write things but you

468
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:52,830
know no the date of the sided drive I

469
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:57,640
restrict this I just try it or just the

470
00:23:52,830 --> 00:24:01,870
harder sorry the data inside the driver

471
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:05,950
is wiped it isn't more driver is it more

472
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:08,919
data inside the driver or they just they

473
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:12,550
drive are destroyed you know the dating

474
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,110
said the driver is relatively safe I

475
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,450
mean it's not safe because the plates

476
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:19,120
are rewriting and eventually we will

477
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:22,510
destroy that I mean I have a Samsung

478
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,090
hard our copper some hydride it won't

479
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,710
work anymore they do a strange noise

480
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:30,040
like like like lick lick lick lick it

481
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:32,050
just completely up but I don't

482
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,120
think it's the place it is like the head

483
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,800
the head is destroyed because the head

484
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,870
is very sensitively the head punch with

485
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,280
the heart is I probably the thing is

486
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,310
when the hardest fields detector

487
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,350
vibration it just

488
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,690
the head automatically and very fast

489
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:47,750
very quickly so the data actually safe

490
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:50,630
but the head stop bouncing around and

491
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,800
eventually you will just just get banned

492
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:55,310
as you destroy I don't know why what did

493
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,419
happen but it just don't work anymore in

494
00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:01,100
a data center

495
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:03,980
how does affect the sound of defense in

496
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:08,000
a broom yeah well the fans has very very

497
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:10,910
low sound it's too low to affect by

498
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,420
depend with the fan but actually you can

499
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:16,250
measure that if you have a very high you

500
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,450
have a lot of noise in the data center

501
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,870
it the hardest we actually will work

502
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,850
slower that is something that isn't the

503
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,800
data I mean you can just have a

504
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:28,060
real video of the guy screaming of the

505
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,409
hard disk and it hard is basically a

506
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,149
starting to decreasing in in the in the

507
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:35,840
throughput I mean this is very sensitive

508
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:37,160
so if there are regular ceiling fan did

509
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,399
not nothing happen but you have a big

510
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:46,060
fan possibly will affect the performance

511
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:50,480
the speakers that that the notebooks can

512
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:53,570
damage the the or reduce the lifetime of

513
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,780
the heart of the hard disk well I did

514
00:25:53,570 --> 00:26:01,490
some tests and it will depend of the

515
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:05,450
speaker of course but I did some tests

516
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:08,030
with a with a team pad in and I could

517
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,380
made to completely stop but it it did

518
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,149
affect this drop boot I mean if you

519
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,340
measure the drop of the heart is about

520
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:16,010
about 10 mega a 10 megabyte for a second

521
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,350
and if you put a speaker at the top it

522
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:20,210
will decrease so it really affects I

523
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,699
made this the speakers can actually as

524
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:25,250
affect the Hadees of this of the safe

525
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,410
not good but the thing is I think

526
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,660
passing specifically either too hard is

527
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:32,230
a rate well mount at the amount in a

528
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:35,390
rubber box you can you know open it so

529
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:37,040
probably if it not work is it's another

530
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,410
contraction it will must be even more

531
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:43,129
sensitive I mean in a tin pot that is

532
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:46,760
rubber mount it affects so maybe in

533
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:48,830
another know who is worst thank you

534
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,990
I have about a video of that in YouTube

535
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:53,419
you enter my channel have an on all go

536
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,240
can and I need use you can measure how

537
00:26:53,420 --> 00:27:01,850
who the hell

538
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:02,780
get slow have you tested with the habit

539
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:06,639
right hybrid-drive

540
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:09,290
like those that have a little SSD inside

541
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,350
how it will be wet sorry hybrid and

542
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:15,320
those are her Bridget hybrid 80s with a

543
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:17,419
little SSD inside yes yeah I didn't try

544
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,210
I did you ask it if I tried this with a

545
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:23,180
hybrid I hardest I have a plate and I

546
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:25,370
also how high density no I did not but

547
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:30,200
the thing is basically and I release a

548
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:34,580
big Akashi this is hard this I also have

549
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:37,700
a cache in RAM I mean the thing is I did

550
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,860
is but you have to bypass takashi by

551
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,320
reading enough if you read our big file

552
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,270
or recons a lot of sectors one after the

553
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,970
other eventually take the cache memory

554
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:50,990
will will will spend I mean no matter if

555
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:53,090
you have a Akashi as a flash memory it

556
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,860
will completely filled up and when you

557
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:57,530
fill up you will start using the plate

558
00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:02,229
and then you can read out you anyway I

559
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:02,230
mean you can bypass the cache memory

560
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:09,950
regarding the frequency is it possible

561
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:12,500
to run a do s attack running extremely

562
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:16,460
low frequency without human beings

563
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:21,620
noticing this attack that's an awesome

564
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:25,100
idea actually that's a very good idea

565
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:27,159
and it's very likely that you can but I

566
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,899
don't know really it's all depend of the

567
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,160
resonance of the hard disk but we can

568
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,290
see that the Hardys has several

569
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:37,130
resonance frequencies and maybe one of

570
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:39,970
them is an ultrasonic range that's a

571
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,970
very good question

572
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:50,020
when I actually you know slightly high I

573
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:51,879
I did a break food plot of the frequency

574
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:57,220
spectrum this the Pfister we can see

575
00:28:51,880 --> 00:29:01,150
here is this one and we have a couple a

576
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:03,730
couple discs here's one of two inches

577
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,980
and the one out of three inches is I

578
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:08,799
sure would use more point here I'll show

579
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,289
you my eyes my science professor we will

580
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,779
kill me would be to the plot but there

581
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:15,820
really is this is not an ugly spectrum I

582
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:18,549
mean and we can see there is several

583
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:21,700
Peaks and that is because the hardest is

584
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:23,830
not they have several metal parts a very

585
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,140
complex device and each one resin and

586
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:36,158
are a different frequency so but one of

587
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:38,320
them is very likely in the thank you hi

588
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,230
I was going to ask about the spectrum

589
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:45,570
also but have you been able to

590
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:49,000
reconstruct some kind of a wave waveform

591
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:51,700
from the the from from what you reading

592
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,299
or something like that so you asking if

593
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:57,760
you I can reconstruct sound bite us well

594
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:59,860
I did some tries but I didn't apply here

595
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,649
because it sound awful it's not very

596
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:06,908
good if you can see here if I applied

597
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:08,199
them again it's very easy to do is you

598
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:12,789
can you can see but it's not very

599
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:17,080
doesn't have a lot of resolution and I

600
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:20,610
try some reconstruction I tried not to

601
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,610
find my password from the user

602
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,149
there you go so you can see it here that

603
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:33,729
it looks like it's really now your bid

604
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:38,559
is very low resolution so I have about

605
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:41,080
the sample rate if you can you can do an

606
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,989
analogy to a sample rate as a regular

607
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:47,139
microphone a sample of 8 kilohertz the

608
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:49,539
minimum 8 kilohertz 8 2 44 kilo Hertz

609
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:52,839
whatever this is about a hundred a

610
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:55,119
hundred hairs so it's very low sample

611
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:57,070
rate does not means that you can

612
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,349
reconstruct anything I mean you can't

613
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:02,739
we'd use the core algorithms you know

614
00:30:59,349 --> 00:31:04,779
whatever new data science can come out

615
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:09,219
you can reconstruct stuff with only a

616
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:10,479
100 hairs but it's very low and but

617
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:13,119
maybe you can increase using another

618
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:15,700
technique keys but I still didn't do it

619
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:18,279
I try to represent the sound sound very

620
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:31,210
often so I didn't know that even even

621
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:34,859
showed you how about exfiltrate in data

622
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:38,529
by sound pulses have you try it

623
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:40,539
are you speaking about exfiltrate in

624
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:43,809
data from well from the hard disk from

625
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:47,408
other machine way because in sound

626
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:49,769
pulses you know let's say it resonates

627
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:52,690
at a hundred Hertz so you can do like

628
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:54,460
small swaps of a hundred Hertz and you

629
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:57,460
could encode it like longer swaps or

630
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,679
shoulder yeah yeah sure so you can do it

631
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:02,679
very easily I mean it will move very

632
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:06,700
fast but you can filter the password in

633
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:08,950
under one second show you and you need

634
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,899
basically our computer that can process

635
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,999
a sound and honest answer I mean is

636
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:14,918
basically communication theory you can

637
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:17,859
of course you can do it so what so long

638
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:19,359
as the computer has a speaker or

639
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:19,978
something you could perhaps exfiltrate

640
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,389
data

641
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:24,399
yeah they can't do it like a like a I

642
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:26,439
cap channel who you were talking about I

643
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,139
caps computer where you can examine a

644
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,889
gap because you know which computers has

645
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:35,258
speakers

646
00:32:29,889 --> 00:32:37,849
voting machines oh yeah like how this to

647
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:40,559
talk you get together

648
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:41,539
that's a great idea you should do that

649
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,249
also

650
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:55,469
actually yeah I mean ultrasound like the

651
00:32:44,249 --> 00:32:57,919
guy did mais okay okay all right thank

652
00:32:55,469 --> 00:32:57,919
you very much
