2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,320
thanks to organizers thanks to the guys

3
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,810
for sorting out the VGA she's not as

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,448
well it's always been a kind of bucket

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,019
list item for me to come to Brazil so

6
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,599
it's amazing yeah thanks for having me I

7
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:30,209
wanted to find out just before I got

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,859
into the talk too much who's using to

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,700
pen testing here who does penetration

10
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,989
testing this is put your hand up okay

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,860
and then who's on who's on the other

12
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,570
side back who's seen like the RFQ

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,950
process who's ever worked unlike the

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,920
sales portion of the penetration testing

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:52,230
okay we've got a few okay so this kind

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,910
of talk is a for both sides it's gonna

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,379
be really interesting I think you guys

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,108
are going to find that a lot more of

19
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,399
information from the reason why I asked

20
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,070
those questions a little bit later on

21
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,320
but basically it's about obtaining

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,330
critical information from really

23
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,729
publicly available documents you're

24
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,990
gonna basically see a lot of stuff that

25
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:16,679
creates like vulnerable situations for

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,630
corporates through the actual process of

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,570
procuring penetration testing so like

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,220
everybody says that there's like the

29
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,669
supply chain attack thing this is a

30
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,798
portion of it but yeah I think you're

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,189
gonna enjoy it so basically more about

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,729
me

33
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,439
I work in penetration testing it's been

34
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,320
almost 20 years I mean doing penetration

35
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,470
testing in a firm in South Africa which

36
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,029
the international firm and I'm trying to

37
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,890
kind of keep a balance between working

38
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,770
laughs but I love what I do so it's very

39
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,780
difficult and I've done about 4,000

40
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,140
responses to penetration testing or if

41
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,369
cues maybe a little bit more so that's

42
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,040
why I did this talk because I found some

43
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,229
interesting stuff for this specific talk

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,869
I looked over about 300 350 RFQ

45
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:05,670
documents and I'm gonna get into some

46
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:07,710
really cool stuff so what the cyber so

47
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,800
like you're gonna hear a lot of these

48
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,430
words which I hate in this presentation

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,109
and it's basically the reason why the

50
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,310
title and in my talk title that she says

51
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:18,260
kill the buzzards will forget the

52
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,819
buzzards is because we talk about the

53
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,739
buzzer with so much in terms of like the

54
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:23,839
sales process people are really pushing

55
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:25,700
the cyber and the apps and the killed

56
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,609
chain just to get sales you know so like

57
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,369
cell devices you know cell antivirus led

58
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:33,200
our cyber next-gen buy my product you're

59
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,920
going to be 100 percent and I'm saying

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,619
that's pretty much a bunch of rubbish so

61
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,138
all around it's really easy to set up

62
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,489
these these companies it's like very

63
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:44,810
simple for us to set up a competitive

64
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:46,939
firm that actually doesn't even do pen

65
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,859
testing or doesn't even do like actually

66
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:50,510
sell products but to get the information

67
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:55,310
we're looking for in terms of additional

68
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:56,328
tech attack vector so we'll be doing

69
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,129
that little bit later that's not

70
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:59,150
specifically for this talk but what I'm

71
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:01,120
going to be highlighting is like

72
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,680
incorrect procedures in the RFQ process

73
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,700
so when you actually like go out in

74
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,430
tender for work that's where the

75
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,659
valuable information is for attackers

76
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,040
another thing I'm trying to focus on

77
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:11,810
here is I could get the buzzwords we

78
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,340
focus too much on the zero day we focus

79
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,530
too much on this is crazy attacks

80
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,019
I think Jason and I have spoken about it

81
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,599
many times how are we getting into

82
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:24,560
networks these days misconfigurations

83
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:26,179
password one password problems incorrect

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,620
firewall rules like out-of-date demons

85
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,299
like it's just the standard stuff we've

86
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,569
been dealing with for the last like 20

87
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:31,760
years

88
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:33,409
does your that stuff is really cool it's

89
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,149
like really like love the zero dead

90
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:36,349
stuff it's not really how browser

91
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,909
breaking internet works right now and

92
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:41,720
this is a really specific targeted

93
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:43,489
attack all right so we're doing this

94
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,609
whole process wrong with the whole RFQ

95
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:48,470
process completely messed up and

96
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:51,379
difficult to fix talk about a little bit

97
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,419
later but it's not something that's a

98
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:55,040
segregated thing so it's not something

99
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:56,449
that's only in my country it's basically

100
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,750
worldwide I'm going to be giving you

101
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:00,769
examples of or incorrect RFQ procedures

102
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,900
like throughout the world

103
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:04,970
some countries called attenders it's the

104
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,919
same kind of thing but basically it's a

105
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,949
request for quotations or request for

106
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:12,439
Proposal on a set of work so very

107
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:14,090
similar scenario would be company comes

108
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,250
to you guys and says I want a

109
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,630
penetration test I have X amount of IP

110
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,889
addresses how long is it gonna take I'm

111
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,430
just gonna cost me that's the typical

112
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:24,560
scenario just to explain that so

113
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,120
essentially for large sets of work all

114
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,740
these very big corporates like telcos

115
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,900
banks

116
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,340
things like that they go out on what we

117
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,650
call like public rfqs or more

118
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,818
closed-door of keys so you'll get a lot

119
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,250
of information from those documents

120
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:37,240
which I'm going to go through now which

121
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,300
basically will help you doing

122
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,220
enumeration and this brings in a lot of

123
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,449
different complications so there's a lot

124
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,130
of complications that come with

125
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:48,400
providing that information just blindly

126
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,530
out there and what we essentially doing

127
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,388
is we inviting a whole bunch of people

128
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,770
to learn about our network that we don't

129
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:57,039
trust

130
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:58,389
so we're basically giving them the inner

131
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,818
workings of our business and of our

132
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,080
company without actually asking for

133
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:04,030
anything in return we don't even know

134
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,770
these people but that's what people are

135
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,330
doing so I'm going to give you a real

136
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,500
real-life scenario I mean obviously like

137
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,659
I said been doing this for a long time

138
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,080
at last month we had a tinder briefing

139
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:15,849
or FQ briefing and there's about 40

140
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,990
suppliers that that came to this tender

141
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,310
briefing and tender briefing is

142
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,630
basically like when you ask questions

143
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,370
about the tender because it's a big set

144
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,500
of work so you'll say like okay we need

145
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,090
like ten resources or it's going to be

146
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,949
like a hundred mandates for the project

147
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,739
a significant project so you have to ask

148
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:31,960
questions so basically like 40 companies

149
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,880
came we don't even have 40 pentesting

150
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,620
suppliers in our country we don't have

151
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,080
40 pentesting I think we have like three

152
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,280
or four so it just showed us like

153
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,960
there's a whole bunch of random people

154
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,229
there that are basically learning about

155
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,090
your business and about your company and

156
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:47,530
how exactly are you guys getting that

157
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,789
list of companies or people that are

158
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,780
just coming to learn about your business

159
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:53,949
so basically what I'm saying is let's

160
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,388
just invite the attackers that's

161
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:56,409
basically what people are doing they

162
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:59,110
basically saying we'll come and listen

163
00:05:56,409 --> 00:06:00,520
to you know what money talks about and

164
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,979
along with like all these random

165
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,440
companies we also find like people that

166
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:07,090
are like really focus on random sets of

167
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,500
works so they will sell anything to make

168
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,630
money basically they'll sell toilet

169
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,919
paper or they'll sell like concrete or

170
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,969
they'll sell anything they just see an

171
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,289
advert and they said well I can do

172
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:15,610
penetration testing sounds pretty

173
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:18,639
interesting and then they'll find a

174
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,400
supplier you know somehow and again

175
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,050
that's like a massive issue so what

176
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,388
we're basically doing is we're seeing

177
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,909
information like external IP s internal

178
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:30,599
IPS like network diagrams get into a

179
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:32,919
little bit of a bigger list but

180
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,270
typically these things are advertised on

181
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:35,740
the Internet so you've seen them on

182
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,510
internet we just search for our queues

183
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,270
or tenders and you'll see them in

184
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,680
newspapers so some countries by law have

185
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,090
you put it in newspapers to say we're

186
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,110
going off because of the procurement

187
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,580
process and there's basically two major

188
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,250
problems that's that's wrong with that

189
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,780
the first case is basically we can win a

190
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,910
set of work by just going in super cheap

191
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,010
you know so basically like normally

192
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,240
cheapest wins so we're going super cheap

193
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,060
we're not really care about the the

194
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,110
price because we like these bad guys and

195
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,730
then what we do is we actually attack

196
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,310
the company we steal the data we've

197
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:08,920
caused the financial ruin and then we

198
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,320
could disappear so that's case one in

199
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,640
case two is better yet like what we do

200
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,830
is we find out all information about the

201
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,960
company and then when the real test

202
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,120
happens from like the real good vendor

203
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,859
just kind of exclude ourselves then we

204
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,930
really actually attack the network and

205
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,520
we've caused a major major damage and we

206
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,530
can blame that penetration testing firm

207
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,880
probably for that damage that we caused

208
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,349
because they know they're getting a

209
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,360
penetration test during that period so

210
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,290
not going to blame some random attack

211
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,300
vector they're probably going to blame

212
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,700
the pen testing firm for causing some

213
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,190
damage there's a lot of lot more issues

214
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,450
than this some of them then we have the

215
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,680
issue with resellers which I basically

216
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,789
spoke to your bar so there's like always

217
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,400
these people that will come to you and

218
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,620
say all right and and this this exists

219
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,929
here a lot actually away basically we've

220
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,940
got this deal and like we know the guy

221
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,050
or whatever the story is so we wanted

222
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,250
you to work through you guys who just

223
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,290
want to put a little markup on it

224
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,900
the resellers completely knock me it's

225
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,830
like a massive problem first of all you

226
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,299
don't even know who's dealing with the

227
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:05,229
data or where the data is actually going

228
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,400
at the end but it's a it's a massive

229
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,140
issue because sometimes we have

230
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,989
customers in we hear about the RFQ

231
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:13,150
documents from a random reseller rather

232
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,450
than the customer sucker as a crazy

233
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,799
situation so all of this like all of

234
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,180
these is because of procurement I said

235
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,740
like they'll know someone for example in

236
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,300
like the business and they'll give them

237
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,770
a tip-off that like basically they're

238
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,380
having a tender for a penetration test

239
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,940
or something similar and then randomly

240
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,350
we'll hear about it because somebody

241
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,450
will come back to us asking if we can do

242
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,490
penetration testing to help him with one

243
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,929
of their customers so this is this is

244
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,120
all stuff that really happens like the

245
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,530
stuff that I'm going to show you is as

246
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,659
real real scenarios you can search for

247
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:44,380
it I included links we actually just

248
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:45,610
look through right now and this is an

249
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,470
active thing has happened in in South

250
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,550
America for us and obviously Africa and

251
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,650
other continents where they force

252
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,199
specific vendors to win sets of work

253
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,980
that's how it works

254
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,940
anyway so

255
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,139
one of the things I want to focus on

256
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,670
here and that's why I'm saying like who

257
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:59,589
was penetration testing and who was

258
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,449
facing on the other side is that the

259
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:02,740
procurement process isn't tested enough

260
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:04,420
it's specially during Red Team

261
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,190
assessments and I hate the word red team

262
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,380
but like it's not tested enough and he's

263
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,880
like really big penetration tests so

264
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,889
people focus on like hardcore

265
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,839
enumeration pin testing zero-days blah

266
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:15,630
blah when they can probably just hack

267
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,399
the you know kind of procurement process

268
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,570
as I've explained now and obviously the

269
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,050
supply chain we always talking about

270
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:25,149
that kind of thing all right so another

271
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,589
thing for you guys to actually kind of

272
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,329
put your foot down is that a lot of

273
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:30,940
companies it happens quite often now is

274
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:33,579
they ask for a free proof-of-concept

275
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:36,160
before you do the work their actual main

276
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:37,959
set of work which is a complete rubbish

277
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,490
get miss never do that don't don't

278
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:44,050
shortchange yourself know your worth

279
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,579
real-life scenario we've been operating

280
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,319
for twenty years we had a very large

281
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:49,599
international financial institution

282
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,720
about two months ago come to us and say

283
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,040
and you know we basically have this huge

284
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,449
set of work and once you'd quote for it

285
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,180
- alright cool sounds awesome

286
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:59,829
so record for the state of work and they

287
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,269
said no it's gonna be like a you just

288
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:03,219
get excited that's like a big set of

289
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:05,740
work and they want to go ahead with us

290
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,529
and then the guy for instance says the

291
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,540
main guy and he says no like actually

292
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,250
we're going to sign off I'm gonna sign

293
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,170
off but before we sign off we actually

294
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,449
have this application that we need

295
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,979
tested and that's not in budget so like

296
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,469
if you can just test that now anymore

297
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,149
like some of your work sounds a little

298
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,589
dodgy to me so we basic said I'll tell

299
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:24,930
you what why don't you sign up the work

300
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:28,120
and then we'll just deduct it from that

301
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:31,380
our way around then he says oh no you

302
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:34,329
know what I'll get back to you so

303
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,949
randomly we get our RFQ or if you

304
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:37,839
document massive RFQ document with all

305
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:39,189
our information in it and it says what

306
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,319
do we need you guys to do is tender now

307
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,490
for the work and randomly included in

308
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:46,930
the terms is that we have to do a free

309
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:49,449
proof-of-concept on a system that has

310
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,069
predefined vulnerabilities so that

311
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,510
sounds a little bit better because it's

312
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:54,279
predefined and sounds like a whole bunch

313
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,630
of companies or you know they're testing

314
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,889
whole bunch of companies against each

315
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,139
other so we said okay cool

316
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:02,649
so we tender for this work put all this

317
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:04,300
effort in and they come back to us oh

318
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:06,430
yeah excellent like you guys have got to

319
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,630
the next round so he said oh that's cool

320
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,839
and they came back to the whole bunch of

321
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,630
Chris

322
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,910
and you answer them again and they said

323
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,560
cool now you guys get to do the proof of

324
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,459
concept that we spoke about in that

325
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,270
document so we said cool so we carry on

326
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,550
randomly and like on a Friday afternoon

327
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:24,040
like without any kind of communication

328
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:27,729
we get a whatsapp message with an

329
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,829
internet banking URL live in prod with

330
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,380
credentials and they're like you can

331
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,480
start hissing on Monday you know this is

332
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,770
I mean there's so many issues of that I

333
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,590
can't even get into that but basically

334
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,180
they gave us a live production internet

335
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,370
banking system to do a proof of concept

336
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:44,229
for freon in order to prove ourselves as

337
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,130
like a real good vendor to get the rest

338
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,900
of the work it was complete rubbish

339
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,950
basically they just one said if we test

340
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,270
and they were trying to get all the

341
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,040
vendors to do the free test for him I

342
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,689
mean when we said no it was like a

343
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,610
massive thing and now we see they

344
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,720
basically said no and we said just give

345
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,490
us the other vendor which I don't even

346
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,550
think there was another vendor but

347
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,590
essentially you know for us not only as

348
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,449
internet banking is a horrible idea to

349
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,580
just randomly give to someone and iPod

350
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,380
to taste but the whole process that

351
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,580
these guys went through was terrible

352
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,220
because they're basically could have

353
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,350
given random criminals like credentials

354
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,230
to incident banking and to go ahead to

355
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:20,020
basically attack it so that's what we

356
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,210
sing anyway so how do we exploit this

357
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,100
RFQ process in more detail this is a

358
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:29,290
extensive diagram that we created

359
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:31,000
in-house and it's a 16,000 line piece of

360
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,730
code and that basically enabled us to

361
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,410
exploit certain processes and correlates

362
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,590
events like all together across like

363
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,300
different media and that basically

364
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:43,210
enabled us to gather like advanced

365
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,790
information from rfqs which basically we

366
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,290
used today not obtain this highly

367
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,930
classified information that was talking

368
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,459
about and from our potential targets so

369
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,319
basically the the code was so advanced

370
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,420
that some say that Rodrigo didn't

371
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,730
understand it which is quite interesting

372
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,819
and I'll CTO William and many like they

373
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,960
also didn't understand it but anyway so

374
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,520
I'm completely jerkiness bunch of

375
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,550
rubbish it's a search engine

376
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,750
optimization diagram and basically

377
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,520
everything is handed to us on a silver

378
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,340
platter so we don't need to write

379
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,569
anything we don't need to do anything

380
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,830
we're not to hack anything the targets

381
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,860
are basically just giving us everything

382
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,450
and it's Google literally that's all it

383
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,120
is and when I mean everything that's

384
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,339
that's

385
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,110
everything so before I get into the

386
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:25,400
actual screenshots of a couple of like a

387
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,290
lot of things that you guys can search

388
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,180
for like right now I'm gonna give you

389
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,670
some personal examples of like a RFQ

390
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,370
gone wrong one of them is that we had a

391
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:36,079
very major international bank that

392
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,610
basically issued us a purchase order for

393
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,140
over two million that wasn't actually

394
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,330
for us it was for another vendor like

395
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,620
one of our competitors so basically a

396
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,250
water that's the work that we didn't

397
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,600
even tinder for for two million dollars

398
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,250
that um you know how that happens for

399
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,690
this massive procurement problem another

400
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,460
thing for you guys to realize is that

401
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,810
they can cancel purchase orders so they

402
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,510
just cancel that purchase order which is

403
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:59,119
always me nothing another one is that we

404
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,860
had a very large government institution

405
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,560
which basically issued us with an award

406
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,600
letter that was actually not competitors

407
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,000
name where that competitors sync on it

408
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,010
so basically said like DXY said

409
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,230
congratulations you've actually won this

410
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:14,000
set of work for this X amount of money

411
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,470
which led to a whole bunch of other

412
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,230
problems because we knew that that

413
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,510
tender was specifically catered for the

414
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,920
cheapest price so we were cheaper than a

415
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,270
price and we still didn't win so there's

416
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,490
like some other thing that's actually

417
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,750
going on there but essentially like

418
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,060
there was a lot of information that we

419
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,520
shouldn't have been shed then we had an

420
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,979
international telco a very large one as

421
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,620
well that sent us an excel sheet to our

422
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,760
pricing and five other vendors pricing

423
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,800
with all the services they're offering

424
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,120
and a lot of other confidential

425
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,430
information that shouldn't have actually

426
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,459
been shared and this is like a kind of

427
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:48,949
day to day thing that we seem which

428
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:51,079
basically says like there's no K that's

429
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,920
being taken by these people or by these

430
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,540
corporates and these aren't small

431
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,029
businesses they're very large businesses

432
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:59,150
and then we had like a Revenue Service

433
00:14:56,029 --> 00:15:01,550
like virus very similar to that that

434
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,990
basically issued a tender arts and

435
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,569
basically told everybody if you don't

436
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:10,310
know our internal acronyms our specific

437
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:11,839
ones then you lose the work so how you

438
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,279
know I mean there's no way that we could

439
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,540
have won that so skated for a specific

440
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,490
vendor but this is the kind of thing

441
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,260
that I'm talking about and we're seeing

442
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:23,240
it very often and it's a it's a very

443
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:25,130
difficult thing to actually solve so I'm

444
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,870
yeah I mean what can we get like what

445
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,980
can we get from Google basically that's

446
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,050
how I'm talking about so we can get

447
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,400
Network diagrams we can get internal

448
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,130
incident response programs and

449
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,990
procedures internal hosts external

450
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,790
we can get operating system versions

451
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,280
patch levels you can get firewall rules

452
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,990
who can get QA which is the best because

453
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,459
that's actually when we ask questions

454
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,780
and then they respond to us so we can

455
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,260
basically ask whatever we want and also

456
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,400
come in tell us information we get a web

457
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,600
application information I'm gonna be

458
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,630
going through a couple of examples

459
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,040
pretty much of each of these and you'll

460
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,330
kind of understand why I'm saying it's

461
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,610
like a huge portion of the enumeration

462
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,290
process but don't forget the senior pen

463
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,030
test don't forget this this is like a

464
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,380
gold mine and you don't really have to

465
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:07,850
do too much then you're gonna have to go

466
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:09,320
to show done so okay so the first

467
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,930
example I don't know if you can see too

468
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,570
clearly over there so I'm gonna focus on

469
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:17,719
a few little sections here my laser

470
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:19,520
pointer sir but these are examples from

471
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,950
international companies this specific

472
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,090
one is in the UK and it's not just one

473
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,160
country I'm trying to give like multiple

474
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,300
examples but you can see here these guys

475
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,339
are still running like BlackBerry

476
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,839
Enterprise Server and something called

477
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,580
edge you serve but this is the kind of

478
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,230
information that we interested in which

479
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,700
is basically you know we know they've

480
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,380
got a VPN they're running BlackBerry

481
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,480
Enterprise Server Microsoft Exchange

482
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,520
outlook they running multifunction

483
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,590
devices princess scanners copiers

484
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,449
anybody was at Def Con we know what

485
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:47,420
princess you know can do from those

486
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,920
attacks and a safe comm application they

487
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,780
have like various firewalls blah blah

488
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,140
blah but we kind of interested in edges

489
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,910
server as well so I'm not going to go

490
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,350
through this specific screenshot in in

491
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:01,250
more detail because I sort of there's

492
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,930
quite a few but you'll see now like

493
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,180
BlackBerry Enterprise Server Microsoft

494
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,470
Exchange and outlook the department's -

495
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,270
BlackBerry Enterprise Service should be

496
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,430
subjected to a configuration review and

497
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,959
IT health check for compliance so we

498
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,459
know there's a compliance check probably

499
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,570
like just a checkbox thing that they're

500
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,030
doing so they just check the whole bunch

501
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:18,409
of information in here but what we also

502
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,790
know here and this is quite cool is that

503
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:23,240
the interface between MS Exchange

504
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:25,129
servers and Microsoft Outlook shall be

505
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,160
tested for compliance with best practice

506
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,200
on one laptop connect and roam connected

507
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,600
laptop and one thing they stopped client

508
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,430
my best part of this whole thing and

509
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,060
this is the information that is useful

510
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,280
for you guys

511
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,810
is that we can see that they're running

512
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,879
outdated applications so in other words

513
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,419
after 2003 and the thin days of

514
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,550
transferring

515
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,140
after 2010 so we kind of have good

516
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,210
attack vectors before we even like you

517
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,690
know worrying about the internal or

518
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,700
external

519
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,640
network topologies we know what they're

520
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,390
running so this kind of changes the game

521
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,680
plan for us

522
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:58,910
so going further into this tender it's

523
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,050
amazing because they even tell us what

524
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,490
kind of domain controllers they have

525
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,710
like what software is running on their

526
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,980
domain controllers so this whole section

527
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,120
over here basically I mean besides

528
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,220
basically telling us that domain

529
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,810
controller is running in in different

530
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,790
locations so we can see that running in

531
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:17,300
like Sheffield Westminster like

532
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,860
different locations in the UK and even

533
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,810
further ones like you can see these two

534
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,399
over here they have clusters we can

535
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:24,740
basically see what what's running at

536
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,120
each site so this ice for like the

537
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,410
social engineering aspect and our

538
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,939
security aspect we kind of know where

539
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,650
the SATs are and what those SATs are

540
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,970
actually hosting so we'll know like

541
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,650
where the domain controller is and we'll

542
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,590
know exactly where for example they're

543
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,700
running like DHCP we're on for DHCP as

544
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,010
an example we can see they're running

545
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:43,460
generic even specifically quite generic

546
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:45,650
windows 2003 server bold so this kind of

547
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,870
information this is amazing for us I

548
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:50,570
even talked about the AV deployment here

549
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:52,280
there I say web proxy surf control the

550
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,929
deployment the AV deployments in two

551
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,010
different places you can see them

552
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,780
running Windows updates and flash

553
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,410
deployment server from this specific

554
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:03,530
location so I mean for me this is kind

555
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:05,810
of like a nice network of a map of the

556
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:08,990
internal network for me and this isn't

557
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:13,820
even like really the juicy stuff but

558
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:15,080
yeah that's pretty cool and then what we

559
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,389
see over here is that they actually tell

560
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,620
us like what I described which is quite

561
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,330
cool because that's more interesting for

562
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,120
me like why is it out of scope but

563
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:25,340
there's 35 live servers on the extranets

564
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,840
which is small portion IDs are facing

565
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,639
extranet rather than internet facing

566
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,330
then this is also cool there's 16

567
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,460
firewalls surrounding this extra net so

568
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,689
so basically like you know the

569
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,090
information that we're getting from this

570
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,370
and the internal network is oh it's

571
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,419
almost gets to ridiculous level at the

572
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,979
bottom of the screen you'll see that

573
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,560
they're going to a nice detail that

574
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,720
they're running nine Cisco pics or a sa

575
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,780
depends which one you know but they're

576
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,920
running on fouls an 18 Nokia you know

577
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,230
which is cool they give you the mass

578
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,620
versions as well and where they're

579
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,820
actually located as well so I mean it's

580
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,810
actually crazy because they they're

581
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,770
telling you where they are what the

582
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,000
firewalls are

583
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,500
the locations what softly they're

584
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,660
running the versions of the software and

585
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,190
this is all public this stuff you can

586
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,810
search for on Google there's no India is

587
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,460
here it's nothing like Confidential's

588
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,110
and I think we had anything like that

589
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,920
you can literally search on google for

590
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:17,240
this specific tender you'll find us then

591
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,010
it gets more interesting because in the

592
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,910
beginning in the last few slides I told

593
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,800
you that there was something called edge

594
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,300
you serve so if your server is actually

595
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,889
like an application in this case or

596
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,899
looks like application and what you'll

597
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,700
see here is that it's to a system to

598
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,400
facilitate schools transfer people

599
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,800
records in XML format bla bla bla and

600
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,480
then it says that each school has its

601
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,909
own access control upload and download

602
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,410
repository so if you do web application

603
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,530
hacking and you know that it's got like

604
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,880
upload functionality what do you think

605
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:46,820
what kind of vulnerability would you

606
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,260
kind of exploit them so we already have

607
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,649
an idea of what we can exploit once we

608
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:53,330
already in the network so essentially

609
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,560
like that's typical application security

610
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,960
that we're really learning about the

611
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,030
inner inner workings of how the

612
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,430
applications work so for these ones

613
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:03,320
these are different government

614
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,760
institutions or corporates I put URLs at

615
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,350
the top so you guys can actually just go

616
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,000
there and check them out for yourself

617
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,620
but like these are even more interesting

618
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,540
this seems a little bit blurry on this

619
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:15,409
project X may be running a VGA or not

620
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:17,270
but that's okay these are like very

621
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,760
typical scoping assessments this is from

622
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:21,889
government in the US and what you can

623
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,810
see here is that basically like they're

624
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,160
talking about internal external servers

625
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,440
how many lot of hosts they have the

626
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,000
internal address target space this over

627
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,160
here is this Civic configuration review

628
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,180
portion of the document and basically

629
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,110
you can see there's two domain

630
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:37,490
controllers one is Windows 2012 r2 which

631
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:40,010
is awesome it's all - exactly which one

632
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,990
it is and one server is 2016 - file

633
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,230
servers the versions of them web server

634
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:47,810
3 maintenance servers exchange server

635
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,920
voice mail servers ms SQL servers

636
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,960
sharepoint servers I mean it just

637
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:55,070
carries on right for these guys and this

638
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,620
is government so that's it's it's pretty

639
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:59,030
it's pretty bad right anyway so what I'm

640
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,860
saying from something like this is that

641
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,240
we can start structuring our attacks if

642
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,959
we don't structure our text we can at

643
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,540
least have a plan

644
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,220
so this just say we know a version of

645
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,930
something that they're running we're not

646
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,390
these are the experts we don't know how

647
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,020
to create 0 as an example and so we just

648
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,820
kind of wait it out

649
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:19,500
and so someone else does then the day

650
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:20,428
they do we exploit that's it so you know

651
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,530
there's a lot of different scenarios

652
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:23,760
that I can run it through but the basics

653
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,559
is very serious stuff

654
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,179
then there's follow reviews they even

655
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,920
tell you how many rules they are in the

656
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,179
fouls they have web application

657
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,470
assessments they even tell you that this

658
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:33,870
is credit card base and it's called

659
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,130
symphony and how many inputs pages are

660
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,600
there for each application is pretty

661
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:40,050
how many user also there is three user

662
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,699
roles so we can carry on but basically

663
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,770
you get the idea for this these kind of

664
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,390
guards and this is government if you go

665
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:49,920
to another government example and this

666
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:51,900
is Kirkland so this is a URL again which

667
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,570
is very interesting because this URL

668
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,490
over here when I actually pasted it it's

669
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,530
like Fort slash finance plus admin for

670
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,760
slash finance plus plus admin this has

671
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:03,059
got me thinking what else is under date

672
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:06,390
but basically I didn't look at anything

673
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:08,129
I want you guys to focus on this because

674
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,970
it's cities utility operations so

675
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,280
there's one we're talking about

676
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,350
and skater this gets even more serious

677
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,690
and then it actually these questions

678
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,159
here so it's like is the electric water

679
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:20,250
and sewer in scope for penetration

680
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,530
testing yes it is awesome best part when

681
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,940
was the last paint is than 2011 she's a

682
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,770
quite a while ago isn't he ever lost you

683
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,050
lost faintest but thanks for telling us

684
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,250
what types of devices operating systems

685
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,350
will be reviewed for the critical

686
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,340
configuration analysis how many will be

687
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,790
reviewed so they give you a breakdown

688
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:38,040
here there's all Cisco all windows as

689
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,090
some VMs of Cisco McAfee and Linux so

690
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,250
it's quite cool because now we start

691
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,389
focusing on AV as well so you know what

692
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,150
the follows running we know what

693
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,350
everyday running and it does get quite a

694
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,580
funny level because at the bottom over

695
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,559
here asks like what kind of physical

696
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,580
security is and it's like we do not use

697
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:56,660
dogs or gods

698
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:58,678
sorry it's good for Jason I guess so

699
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,570
anyway what we do know here is this

700
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,040
predominantly at Cisco Network we know

701
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,270
when the pet loss pin test was done we

702
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,610
know that this physical infrastructure

703
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,860
attached this penetration test this is

704
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,729
quite serious

705
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:12,030
anyway so we're gonna move on to another

706
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:15,300
one another example also another gov so

707
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:16,530
that's quite cool it gets quite

708
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,149
interesting because this is the network

709
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:21,090
diagram I haven't showed you need to a

710
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:22,740
diagram yet but they even go so far into

711
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,000
saying like this is a proposed near to a

712
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,250
diagram so they view like the current

713
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,210
one

714
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:28,030
and then I have ones that they actually

715
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:30,670
proposed for the future so hearin know

716
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:32,320
what's coming in like in the future I

717
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,030
know this isn't too clear but basically

718
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,149
it's a typical network infrastructure

719
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:38,560
diagram and pretty much this is used in

720
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,670
a lot of tender documents not obviously

721
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,470
not the same one this is a very

722
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,940
customized one for these guys but you

723
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,800
can see like we just did office one

724
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,300
registered office two like the port

725
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,040
office how they connected through call

726
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,230
switches where the incident breakouts

727
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,909
are where the firewall is where the DMZ

728
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:54,130
is you know where the Cisco stuff is

729
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:55,810
running I can carry on with this diagram

730
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,640
but you get to kind of get the picture I

731
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:59,230
just included the two URLs for you guys

732
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,180
at the top because actually different an

733
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:06,580
RFQ documents just out of interest oh

734
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,690
yes so this is another example very cool

735
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,210
because this is actually Internet

736
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:13,570
Banking so these guys winds out on a

737
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:15,820
tinder huge bank that basically said you

738
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,169
know we need Internet Banking tested

739
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,790
they tell you what product it is that

740
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,710
they're running they tell you four

741
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:23,110
examples running off Oracle 11g

742
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,820
which is which one server and it has one

743
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:27,490
public IP or if you see like in this

744
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,780
case but essentially this is the kind of

745
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,430
stuff that we see for application

746
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,750
assessments I mean I'm gonna go into

747
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,370
more detail with another one now but

748
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,930
basically like we see this very often

749
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:36,939
the problem with this is that again like

750
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:38,550
if you know that there's a new

751
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,470
vulnerability that came out in vs. I

752
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:44,320
doubt the guys are gonna patch as soon

753
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:46,120
as a real life at second finds out so

754
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,870
you've got some really good gold

755
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,639
information here all right these ones

756
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,620
are really cool these are possibly my

757
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,000
favorites these are web applications and

758
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,590
the one I'll tell you about why it's

759
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,090
like one of my favorites and again this

760
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,649
is what the breakdown is for when you do

761
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:02,620
web application assessment normally you

762
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:04,330
like to pick what they give you and so

763
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,729
in this instance this one is a payment

764
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,860
portal and it actually says this portal

765
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,400
is developed for online payments that's

766
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,550
pretty cool

767
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,140
and it gives you a URL temporary only so

768
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,280
you can go view it so you know you can

769
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,630
actually start getting to like

770
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,220
understand the application quite a lot

771
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:20,470
but then it gets into like a really cool

772
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,630
detail tells you what version of my

773
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,910
sequel is running PHP how many privilege

774
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:27,370
levels of access access there are and

775
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:30,070
does the application again provide file

776
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,949
download facilities it also has like an

777
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:35,290
upload one over here and this all yes no

778
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:36,659
is it in staging is there a CMS the the

779
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:38,399
basically the list is pretty standard

780
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:40,080
carries on so we basically enumerated

781
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:42,359
the whole application or for one page

782
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,820
before going through it it's pretty cool

783
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:47,158
and this one was specifically developed

784
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:51,779
for IT security professionals so that's

785
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:53,309
why it's one of my favorite ones so so I

786
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:55,979
didn't go to these URLs by the way but

787
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:57,960
you can I mean it's still there and

788
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:59,909
again like you can even see which Maria

789
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,889
DB is actually running here I mean this

790
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,590
kind of stuff even for like very basic

791
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:06,029
junior pen testers it's gold because you

792
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,509
just basically like use motorsports and

793
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:10,679
you're tackling you you're done but yeah

794
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:11,940
I mean this is awesome as well because

795
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,220
it tells you what version of Moodle is

796
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,950
running and if anybody's ever exploited

797
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,479
or actually attacked Moodle I mean the

798
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,419
version is pretty gold and in this

799
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:22,830
instance as well and you are anyway it

800
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,840
basically carries on and it talks about

801
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,478
SMS integration as well a two-factor

802
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,759
authentication and email integration but

803
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:31,590
essentially this is pretty much

804
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,149
everything I want as an attacker and I

805
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,678
haven't really done much enumeration in

806
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:35,879
the process this is the third

807
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,580
application and with three applications

808
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:39,988
and there's tender document for them

809
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:42,629
this one specifically talks about that

810
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:44,249
JSP and HTML there is actually a CMS in

811
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:45,509
this instance so we know what you're

812
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:48,090
looking for it's probably going to be

813
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:50,659
like something arbitrary but anyway and

814
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:53,129
then again it does feature file uploads

815
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:54,509
once again so basically like we've got a

816
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:57,330
pretty good idea of these three

817
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:58,859
applications like from the same person

818
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,210
like the same developers like what

819
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:01,739
they're running the versions of software

820
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,359
they're running and like how we can

821
00:28:01,739 --> 00:28:04,619
actually attack everything in detail

822
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,599
before we've actually even started our

823
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:09,689
pen tests or you know whatever you

824
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:11,460
getting up to alright so this is pretty

825
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,229
cool and you might actually even know

826
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,700
some of the companies that I mentioned

827
00:28:13,229 --> 00:28:15,539
yeah

828
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,729
these are called like international

829
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:19,408
tender boards right and this is for

830
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:23,279
transparency so basically a lot of

831
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:24,809
governments actually use this and the US

832
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,309
military does it as well so you know

833
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:28,918
without the spending is going basically

834
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:30,629
this is quite cool because it basically

835
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,619
tells us who won in penetration tests if

836
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:32,699
you remember what I said in the

837
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:34,769
beginning if we know who wins the

838
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,200
penetration test we're you know they're

839
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:38,639
really in a losing position because in

840
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,109
this instance there's a few things I

841
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:41,340
want to point out but and that's the URL

842
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:43,408
because they didn't want people to think

843
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,658
I'm like dodgy and just made this up but

844
00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:47,429
Deloitte's actually won this penetration

845
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:48,610
test and this one was for financial

846
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:51,640
services board

847
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,990
it's quite a serious tinder this is

848
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,400
don't worry too much about this this is

849
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,200
a local thing that we do in South Africa

850
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,900
but these companies are here pretty

851
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,429
well-known companies I'd say like these

852
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,730
ones over here this is a few ordered

853
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:04,990
films a few paint testing firms and one

854
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,360
of those painting firm is a very

855
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,950
reputable provider and I'd say their

856
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,830
pricing is if you look over here's about

857
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,840
2.2 million as those it's a pretty

858
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:16,149
expensive price but it's a it's a it's a

859
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,428
well-known painting providers so it's

860
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,790
acceptable and unfortunately they didn't

861
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:20,440
win

862
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,970
Deloitte won so obviously we can attack

863
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,380
the network as a Deloitte and fir name

864
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,490
and say we running from Deloitte please

865
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,080
can you give me more information about

866
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:27,610
your network because I'm from Deloitte

867
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,830
and I'd like your more information about

868
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:31,299
your network and applications and IPS

869
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,379
and everything else and I probably gonna

870
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:34,530
believe us because they're getting a

871
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,280
penetration test from Deloitte so

872
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,960
they're gonna give you the stuff that

873
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,970
you need there's also another spin on

874
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,080
this is that basically we can completely

875
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:47,200
pull out of the list in the process and

876
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,939
basically if we again know who actually

877
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,380
tended for that so they actually signed

878
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,270
documents basically saying okay there's

879
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,530
like 40 different vendors they're back

880
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:57,510
in the beginning of the presentation I

881
00:29:53,530 --> 00:30:01,030
spoke about that and we can basically

882
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:03,970
attack the network again in this case

883
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:06,190
obviously as Deloitte and kind of cause

884
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:08,260
a massive amount of issues but we can

885
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,090
also back out of the tender process so

886
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,860
as an example if I'm like a really

887
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,540
malicious person or if a sucker a

888
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,790
business decision this procurement

889
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,730
process is terrible because I can find

890
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:20,470
from any of these vendors right if I'm

891
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,610
the main comparison I want to work I

892
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,600
could just phone them and say like oh

893
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,250
actually you know what we can't actually

894
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,389
do the work anymore I'm really sorry we

895
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,630
tended we wasted our time

896
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,799
but you know I've turns out we don't

897
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,960
have the resources to actually do this

898
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:34,030
project and we can just phone from any

899
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,580
company or we can email from any company

900
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:39,010
so we can email from Deloitte's in this

901
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,120
case and we could you know kick them out

902
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,980
of the tender process she's not phoning

903
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,570
them saying hey we applied for this

904
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,620
unfortunately currently the work we

905
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,210
don't know the resources sorry about

906
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,739
that please excluded from the process

907
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,660
they're gonna exclude you and another

908
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,150
vendor is gonna win so this is a mess

909
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:54,160
and you know there's problems that is

910
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,760
not saying it's easily fixed but I mean

911
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,990
it gets worse

912
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,910
I spoke to you a little bit earlier

913
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,500
about resellers this is where the reset

914
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,240
is tine because a lot of these other

915
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,059
people here are completely random

916
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,469
companies

917
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:05,450
like never heard of these companies

918
00:31:03,469 --> 00:31:08,929
before and if you if you just remember

919
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:12,129
this kind of 2.2 million a VM I want to

920
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:14,119
show you something a next slide

921
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:17,449
obviously still people that lost but

922
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:19,389
right at the bottom it's 31 million so

923
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:22,099
there's a slight price discrepancy

924
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:24,439
between even the you know one of the

925
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:25,820
most reputable vendors in the stander

926
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,409
and like somebody that's completely

927
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,418
random and this is exactly where

928
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:30,889
resellers come in and I mean obviously

929
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:33,619
it's it didn't pass functionality

930
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,668
evaluation stage but I mean you know 32

931
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:35,238
million I don't think it would have one

932
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:36,919
anyway

933
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:38,659
but it's 15 times the standard pricing

934
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:42,229
of like a really reputable pen testing

935
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:43,099
for him so um that's crazy and this is

936
00:31:42,229 --> 00:31:45,349
the stuff that we're seeing and

937
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:46,939
unfortunately like those companies

938
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:49,099
actually winning work and they can't do

939
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,629
the work sorry all rights yes here's

940
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:54,168
another one I included the URL just for

941
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:56,418
transparency again this is a centralized

942
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:57,409
data center which basically has as you

943
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:00,139
can see over here like three hundred

944
00:31:57,409 --> 00:32:02,299
servers 700 endpoints and it has IP

945
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:04,039
phones basically it's running Splunk

946
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:07,009
which is quite cool for us to know so

947
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:08,989
you know it's it's pretty cool than I

948
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:10,519
who they go into some weird detail I

949
00:32:08,989 --> 00:32:11,779
mean they even tell you like please

950
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:13,399
provide average number of Farwell

951
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:15,049
related changes received per month and

952
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:16,758
locked in I do about him

953
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:18,469
change the man but they give you that

954
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:19,879
information and then obviously like

955
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,080
going back and you can see this is

956
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:22,879
pretty standard I mean this isn't the

957
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,408
first document you've seen now windows

958
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:30,049
2003 server 2012 windows 7 and 8 lonex

959
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:31,849
IX hp-ux sorry it carries on we know

960
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,960
that certain pieces of software or

961
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,879
end-of-life so they probably not gonna

962
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,529
be patched but when stuff like eternal

963
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:37,939
blue came out like if you knew exactly

964
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:41,690
what they were running even if you

965
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:43,519
didn't I mean there's gonna be issues

966
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:45,619
here's more questions from the same

967
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,169
document actually took out the response

968
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:50,238
of this one because it was it starts to

969
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:51,889
get ridiculous but we do know that

970
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:53,960
they're running cisco Asaf our walls we

971
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:56,418
know that they have smartly 24 by 7 a.m.

972
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,940
see details when it's actually valid

973
00:32:56,419 --> 00:33:00,440
until and the last part that I actually

974
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,099
took out the fact what is the expected

975
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,479
SLA response once there's an intrusion

976
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:06,799
so I actually took that up because no

977
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:08,029
one actually including me I mean you can

978
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,489
still go to the tender documents all day

979
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:12,919
but like basically like they're telling

980
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:15,730
us how long we've brought until they

981
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:17,950
find us or even they started they start

982
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:19,480
finding us which is crazy so we know

983
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,280
kind of like the window for exploit

984
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,860
exploitation as well as the software

985
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,270
versions that we attacking yeah so

986
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,520
basically what I was saying before about

987
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,600
waiting for an exploit to come out we

988
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,100
can just wait for the exploit to come

989
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,629
out we can exploit the software we know

990
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,040
how long it's gonna take for them to

991
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,430
respond to our attack and we can get out

992
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,889
of there

993
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:40,750
so it's pretty cool for an attacker

994
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:42,820
they're all pen testers right so this

995
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,930
one is quite a serious one and I was

996
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,389
like debating putting it in this

997
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:48,280
presentation or not but I decided it is

998
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:51,070
Brazil and it is hackers to hackers so

999
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:56,649
I'll include it and this is a Reserve

1000
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:57,040
Bank Reserve Bank which is pretty

1001
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,880
serious

1002
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:03,490
and this basically handles like all of

1003
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,570
our transfers in and out the country

1004
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:08,679
it's really big so I'm gonna read this

1005
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,239
out a little bit for you because I think

1006
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:12,399
that the screens will look like small

1007
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,989
but basically you can see this business

1008
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,790
systems and technology departments in

1009
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:17,109
conjunction with the National Payment

1010
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:18,820
Systems department within the bank or

1011
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:20,050
seeking services a company to write

1012
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,820
web-based security and penetration

1013
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:25,060
testing on the web-based user interface

1014
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:27,550
semak's web for the bank's to real-time

1015
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,719
gross settlement system Samar's so we

1016
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,050
talked about a real-time settlements

1017
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,429
international cross-border payments and

1018
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:37,990
then it goes into general architecture

1019
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:39,520
design overview and now you can see why

1020
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:43,239
I debated putting this in but the URLs

1021
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:47,170
there so it's a Google thing and here it

1022
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:49,089
is so basically we can see exactly how

1023
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:51,040
everything works and properly as how

1024
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:53,350
such transactions would work and how

1025
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,840
swiftnet interacts with local semak's

1026
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,400
web and essentially it like you can see

1027
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,060
the bottom its architectural logical

1028
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:03,310
view so what sort of in web browsers

1029
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:07,660
swiftnet browse the swift effing copy

1030
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:09,700
HTTP thank goodness thank you VPN box

1031
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,770
the user session goes over here and

1032
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,720
basically like this is a really good

1033
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,770
diagram of how everything works I'm not

1034
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,149
gonna go into too much detail you guys

1035
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,740
can play around with it if you really

1036
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,270
want to go into more detail but this is

1037
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,640
what I really want to see is in a second

1038
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,390
obviously the actual swift messages are

1039
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,930
still encrypted

1040
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:27,190
I think and I hope not that a hundred

1041
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,600
percent believe that based on the pen

1042
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:31,440
test

1043
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,400
we've done but pretty much this is as

1044
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,710
serious as it gets

1045
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,150
then it goes into more detail on the

1046
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,980
same one that basically tells us more

1047
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,470
about the semi app and the database

1048
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,630
server and and half actually hosted and

1049
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,370
the db2 database management system on

1050
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,410
what kind of mainframe partitions

1051
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,490
actually running and the application

1052
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,940
binaries and where they physically

1053
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:52,709
stored on a sin so obviously the

1054
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,800
transactional messages are the Swift

1055
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,270
alliance access messages so if you're

1056
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,470
doing an international Civ transaction

1057
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,790
those are the actual messages that say

1058
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,200
like where the money's going to the

1059
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,650
amount of money and everything like that

1060
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,230
so if you're a bad guy you pretty much

1061
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:11,970
know everything that you want about like

1062
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:15,390
a major you know way to get money out of

1063
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,620
a country you know that's crazy and then

1064
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:19,890
we have application server so they're

1065
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:21,089
going into more detail and basically

1066
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,520
thanks for explaining how the semak's

1067
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:25,020
web application actually works but we

1068
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,670
also know that we can see as j2ee

1069
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,290
application components on a hex

1070
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,360
partition so what I was telling you

1071
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,710
before about enumeration this is even

1072
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,000
more enumeration but obviously more

1073
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:35,250
serious enumeration on something more

1074
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,050
serious and the critical system is

1075
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,370
basically like this if you worked on

1076
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,930
mainframes and if you works on things

1077
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,700
like this they hardly ever get patched

1078
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,080
it's just it's too risky to actually

1079
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,839
patch those things so if we've got

1080
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,330
information like this it's again it's

1081
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,830
pretty cool anyway user authentication

1082
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,720
is actually discussed as well as

1083
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:53,430
sessions and this documentation and how

1084
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,870
it integrates with submit evolution to

1085
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,759
authenticate users during the login

1086
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,259
process but it provides user

1087
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,660
authentication information services

1088
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,210
information in detail in this document

1089
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,040
and even tells us about the the sending

1090
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,290
and receiving of messages and how they

1091
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,720
work from the samos application to a vie

1092
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:11,730
mq and swift alliance access anybody

1093
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,509
knows about the major success happened

1094
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:16,590
this is again pretty serious anyway it's

1095
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,790
it's really nice to explain how

1096
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,380
everything works to us in terms of

1097
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:21,930
alliance as well and how htps

1098
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,180
connectivity from the semak's web users

1099
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,350
who to advise swift nearby VPN box all

1100
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,569
of this stuff was in that network

1101
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:29,549
diagram but at all that we basically see

1102
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:30,930
as pen testers is easy money that's kind

1103
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:33,240
of how I see it I'm pretty sure that

1104
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:36,259
that criminal see it the same way I'm

1105
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,370
gonna go into another section here

1106
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,800
basically about user authentication

1107
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:42,750
authorization so in this specific

1108
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,250
slide it basically tells us what kind of

1109
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,350
two-factor authentication they're using

1110
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,550
as well so we know exactly what we're

1111
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,110
dealing with so we can see that there's

1112
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,910
two facts a USB token speaker

1113
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:52,920
certificate combination which is that

1114
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,390
you provided by Swift but we know what

1115
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,220
we info like if we're attacking these

1116
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:57,210
guys so it's not like this surprise so

1117
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,560
you're getting to the near to agree then

1118
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,640
what's going on like we know what we're

1119
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,549
in fourth we actually get into the

1120
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,900
network we know where to go and you can

1121
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,190
see at the bottom here the user

1122
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,080
authentication is based on a proprietary

1123
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,910
application level user repository

1124
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,980
integrated in semak's web application

1125
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,509
servers so yes there's segregation of

1126
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:16,740
duties you can see they're in multiple

1127
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:18,930
applications layers but again my

1128
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,459
favorite part of this entire tender and

1129
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,890
this is the most serious one that I'm

1130
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,240
going to talk about is that right at the

1131
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,560
bottom it says that the successful

1132
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,870
window will be provided with additional

1133
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,290
details and a copy of the semak's trust

1134
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,600
model

1135
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:32,279
once the india is in place so I don't

1136
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,569
really know what other information do we

1137
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,770
actually need but yeah I mean it's just

1138
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,060
this is open for anyone you can actually

1139
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,290
see there was no India assigned yet

1140
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:43,290
because it's telling you that if you

1141
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:45,180
successful you're then sign India so

1142
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:48,120
that's enough of this some think you get

1143
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,740
the idea I just want to go into a few

1144
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,660
more there's not too many slides left so

1145
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:54,359
it's like the last talk but basically

1146
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:56,790
this is not only for pen testing it

1147
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,380
basically relates to AV relates to EDR

1148
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:03,300
tenders it relates to basically anything

1149
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:05,040
in IT not just cyber so I'm gonna go

1150
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:10,500
through like one or two examples nothing

1151
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:12,029
too big short examples pretty sure one

1152
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,920
or two people know what this is but

1153
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:17,940
basically it's the official site of a

1154
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,170
municipal governments in Canada so how

1155
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,630
do facts I think that's how you say it

1156
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:23,640
and it looks pretty official to me you

1157
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:27,120
can see that ever bus transit schedules

1158
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:29,930
and all that kind of stuff but what they

1159
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:33,750
did is they went out on tinder for

1160
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:35,279
endpoint security so as an attacker I

1161
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,750
know exactly what kind of in Port

1162
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,580
protection is being used and they

1163
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,540
basically said this is how many units we

1164
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,890
have as well so you kind of know how

1165
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,210
many endpoints that are that need to be

1166
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,799
protected but as an attacker we know how

1167
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:47,010
many endpoints they are and what they're

1168
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,570
using is in Port protection so they

1169
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,100
provide mask contact details as well

1170
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,270
with a point number so if you're any

1171
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,180
questions you can just throw an awesome

1172
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:55,110
you know but you'll see here that's on

1173
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,120
it's difficult to read at the back

1174
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:59,760
Symantec endpoint protection version

1175
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:02,130
12.1 essential support renewal academic

1176
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,500
license piece and anyway it goes into

1177
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:06,420
detail about that so you get the idea

1178
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,470
like if we combine all the information

1179
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,270
from all the changes that we're going

1180
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:12,089
through we have a significant amounts of

1181
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:14,820
information about the target that we

1182
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:18,420
actually attacking here's another one

1183
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:22,350
this is the man gas company pretty

1184
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,090
serious pretty big and you can see they

1185
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,880
work around the clock so the hotter one

1186
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:29,100
is and what they did is a very similar

1187
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,600
thing McAfee plus in point protection

1188
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,430
but in this case they actually looking

1189
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,089
for upgrades because obviously they like

1190
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,390
the current one

1191
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:38,550
so the upgrades are upgraded from ATP to

1192
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,960
CTP which is like endpoint trade

1193
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:42,000
protection to lock complete protection

1194
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,440
complete endpoint protection I think

1195
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
that's what's cool when it goes back to

1196
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,910
the buzz words buzz words match threat

1197
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,910
points complete table and what we can

1198
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:52,529
see here again is that you know they

1199
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,970
basically need licenses from this day to

1200
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:56,400
this it's actually that putter april

1201
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:58,379
disuse is pretty recent and they need

1202
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,040
maintenance licenses they need that data

1203
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:03,090
loss prevention in points licenses so

1204
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,370
again and obviously the amount of units

1205
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:06,840
is pretty essential so yeah you're

1206
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:08,069
getting the information you understand

1207
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,480
what i'm talking about you they'll have

1208
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:11,790
standard licensing at the top as well

1209
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,110
which is nolan McAfee licensing but for

1210
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:16,980
endpoint protection and for attackers

1211
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:20,130
this is pretty serious again anyway so

1212
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,690
enough of the examples and there's a bit

1213
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:22,890
of a scale here and I have eeeh see have

1214
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,570
to discuss it because I keep on talking

1215
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,799
about like a typical pentas that we

1216
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,870
smashed is who broke into this we

1217
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,970
destroyed all of what it's really

1218
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:31,589
difficult to solve this and it's kind of

1219
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:33,629
like a thing for corporates widths and

1220
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:36,960
government to its transparency versus

1221
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:38,670
the the XYZ now when I say XYZ that's

1222
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,590
that at the end of the company is kind

1223
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,390
of going through this whole process for

1224
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:45,000
transparency and for best price and for

1225
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:47,609
best fit it doesn't work and fixing that

1226
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,740
is very hard it's not necessarily always

1227
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:51,540
the best vendor that's gonna win some

1228
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,830
technicalities vendors get knocked out

1229
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,720
because they forgot to fill in a form

1230
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:58,140
correctly or tick a box and that's the

1231
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,149
reality it's it's really a fine line for

1232
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,609
me as somebody who works on this for 20

1233
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:04,800
years between exposing your key assets

1234
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:06,990
and exposing confidential information

1235
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,700
and really being like somebody who's

1236
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:10,220
untrusted

1237
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:14,450
Network versus just looking for

1238
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:16,220
transparency so and tender review it's

1239
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:18,470
it's a difficult thing for me to

1240
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,450
actually look at because I know what I

1241
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:22,910
will choose after going through all of

1242
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:24,500
this and obviously we can discuss supply

1243
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,899
chain attacks because this is just the

1244
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,859
beginning of it and we spoke about it

1245
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,270
briefly yesterday at the other

1246
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:31,790
conference that we were at

1247
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:33,710
but basically you know we can go through

1248
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,470
the supply of desktops and we can go

1249
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:37,220
through supply laptops and

1250
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,629
microcontrollers and all sorts of other

1251
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,578
things where we can back door before we

1252
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,990
even get this you know before we even do

1253
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:44,780
any of this we can basically supply

1254
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:50,058
really cheap computers to corporate and

1255
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:52,059
we ready in so for me it's it is

1256
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:54,140
difficult to solve that we need proper

1257
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:55,460
information security experts that are

1258
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,859
actually managing information security

1259
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,480
product services are elated stuff not

1260
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:02,270
just random procurement people looking

1261
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,910
for the best price or the best amount of

1262
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:08,210
points or whatever it may be

1263
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:10,790
so there's a little challenge for you

1264
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:13,520
guys that did actually start a while ago

1265
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:15,920
there was something called J 262 from a

1266
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,630
BIOS if anybody can tell me what that

1267
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,280
was you maybe get a little bit of a

1268
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:24,380
prize might show my age though so just

1269
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,700
think have a think about it anyway so

1270
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,020
like I said solving this issue is really

1271
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,980
hard what do you what do we do about the

1272
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:31,180
decision this issue

1273
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:33,500
my advice close tender processes like

1274
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:35,089
specific vendors you have three vendors

1275
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,849
three trusted vendors you vetted them or

1276
00:43:35,089 --> 00:43:39,349
two or however many you really trust you

1277
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:41,349
vet them thoroughly criminal checks

1278
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:44,869
background checks qualifications and

1279
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:46,220
really trusted well-known vendors who

1280
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:47,680
have been around for a long time have a

1281
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,609
really good track record

1282
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,290
contact oral reference let's pick up the

1283
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:53,290
phone have they done pentas before

1284
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:56,180
however the result was it like but shady

1285
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:58,730
I wanted to see your soft credentials I

1286
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,049
need to see the criminal checks like be

1287
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,460
as thorough as possible but also getting

1288
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:02,900
involved in a procurement process so

1289
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,520
this is specifically with regards to

1290
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,410
pain testing I'm talking about overall

1291
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,480
the security bottom shouldn't be

1292
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:10,808
involved in procurement that any device

1293
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,220
comes into your network will be anything

1294
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:15,079
and also don't advertise randomly on

1295
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,058
websites like that I mean this is stuff

1296
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:18,140
that you can you guys go do it now like

1297
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:20,150
after this so you can do it right now

1298
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:22,069
you can just sit for RFQ or tenders in

1299
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:26,420
google gov

1300
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:27,740
and you'll find it so I know it's tricky

1301
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,240
because they have to go out for that

1302
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,609
transparency but again it's that scale I

1303
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,649
spoke about and most importantly for me

1304
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,700
is you know again going back to right to

1305
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:36,140
the beginning of the presentation as I

1306
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,660
forget all the buzzwords that the

1307
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:40,400
vendors are using to sell their products

1308
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:42,230
and services and everything else it's

1309
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,670
it's an overwhelming thing anybody's

1310
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:45,380
walked through any kind of vendor hall

1311
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,040
at any of the major conferences you'll

1312
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,160
know what I mean

1313
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,840
but the last point is basically just

1314
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,629
remember this presentation remember what

1315
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:56,120
you saw if you got any questions

1316
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:57,740
I'm here I try to finish pretty much

1317
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,350
exactly on time so I have a few

1318
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:01,459
questions and also because this lost

1319
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:04,400
presentation of the day so thanks a lot

1320
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:06,080
guys thanks for having me so I like it

1321
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,970
from the social engineering standpoint

1322
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,860
of like when they do the license can you

1323
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:12,470
go and elaborate more of what you can do

1324
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:15,800
from knowing when they're impersonating

1325
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:17,689
like agents or something when their

1326
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:20,900
their licences are up or when you know

1327
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:22,040
when they're when they're broadcasting

1328
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,480
when their license is up you can

1329
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,100
impersonate or something is that

1330
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,840
something is that a good process yeah

1331
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,279
exactly so it's the same as when you

1332
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,290
phone and like just cancel your tender

1333
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,210
as an example if you can phone and say

1334
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:34,040
and you know we actually we're funding

1335
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:35,210
for the renewal you know and the

1336
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,670
software that you provide them can be

1337
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:40,490
backdoored it's a very simple process

1338
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:41,000
and well simple but you understand what

1339
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,250
I'm saying

1340
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,990
so you can for example if the McAfee

1341
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:46,220
license is like a hundred dollars you

1342
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:48,919
can make yours twenty dollars per

1343
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,540
license they're gonna buy it you know

1344
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,680
and chances are they're probably not

1345
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,060
going to check that they've McAfee

1346
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,160
hasn't got something weird attached to

1347
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:57,740
it so yeah that's like a really good

1348
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:00,170
attack vector we've had we've actually

1349
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:03,310
used that in pen test so it's like real

1350
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:03,310
life real life scenarios

1351
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,460
you
