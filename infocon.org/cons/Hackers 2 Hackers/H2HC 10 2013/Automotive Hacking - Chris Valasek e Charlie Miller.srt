1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,330
yes on son charley is Press

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,520
I were exactly as about on automotive

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,980
packing cameras and stuff like that a so

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,049
if you saw my you know I've talked a lot
about

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,240
fact that our like super awesome and fun
but prolly on ever seen a life and this

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,390
is another example

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,730
as they say I did I so who are we

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,769
on up

9
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:31,230
I talked about me earlier chris is a guy
my favorite up

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,660
usually and doing Windows keep stuff
Windows exploits to

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:42,420
and decided that without a car so we're
not actually mechanics even though we

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:42,800
have

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,550
official makings doesn't think you might
not know a

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,879
we're not we're not so I'm yet they were
you talk about so

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,239
personal title the about the cars we use
then why we chose them

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,210
and I what the the computers in the cars
are

17
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,030
and sort of how the bus works overall a
mouse and he had no time seeing what the

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,960
heck is going on

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,479
and we'll talk about how we injected
messages

20
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:10,790
how you that and and what the facts are
when

21
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,100
wait I'm going to a game from our offer
that

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,820
devices you can reverse so

23
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,560
this story cites like we're not the
person I see this back in 2010 does 11

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,140
some academics from University of
Washington

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,689
and University of California San Diego
write a couple papers

26
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,200
about exactly the stuff like him but and

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,340
back in the car they are the first paper
was about

28
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,490
a how these things work and how you can
check messages

29
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:41,960
and

30
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,330
and effect I have on the car which is
basing that we did

31
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,770
I mean they were second paper about how
you can

32
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,340
you can attack remotely so they a they
said how do the booty

33
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,119
in your car they can remotely get code
execution and send him messages

34
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,530
when they also showed you put a mp3

35
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,580
into a car and the rhythm there was a
bug in the parser for the mp3 in a radio

36
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,060
and maybe get her in that way

37
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,259
thing I like that the same thing we
never did a remote part really good

38
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,840
you are somehow on the cameras already
but they did the same

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,150
they did what we did and then another
step but the one thing that they didn't

40
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,790
do

41
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,760
was release any information about what
what they did so

42
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,390
like this video you can the a likes me
that would be an issue black box

43
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,980
and the videos I walk across the street
and he

44
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,080
a you like remotely taxi car gets done
lock

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,510
and you get the car sorry guys of it
when I saw the video I was like holy

46
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,319
shit he just stole someone's car

47
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,390
and that's why they blacked out because
they don't want to go to jail

48
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,290
what turned out to be blacked out
because they were scared to release

49
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,950
the exact car model that they used and I
was in the paper you can see

50
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,209
but that's only actual my messages they
send they write about it out some other

51
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,650
things that you wouldn't be able to

52
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,519
like replicate at work I'm into a big
thing about what we want to do

53
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,650
is talk about you release everything so

54
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,739
release are tools all the messages we is
from

55
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,880
you know so that you can replicate what
we did you can follow exactly long

56
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,380
and you come your thing that we did I
was different than what the academics

57
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:17,980
that was

58
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,820
I we had cars I had more so advanced
technology and

59
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,920
in their cars and so that enabled us to
do work on it acts like for example

60
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,940
their car didn't have any any serve on
image to enlarge

61
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,260
goods that allows to be some stuff
mister on

62
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,200
a hang out and I think yeah I mean I
think Charlie and I were both very

63
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,420
intrigued by what the academics did

64
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,430
but they did release any information so
we figured we do the opposite

65
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,030
release everything right so it's a guys
nine months through the whole project

66
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,940
I'm with those are working on related
things a

67
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,489
if you want to rate we feel we did it
may be well I think the three-month

68
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:58,070
because I'm a little really so trying to
save are going to have a good day all

69
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,109
the pain that we went there

70
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:03,329
back yeah

71
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:06,410
so car acting his heart a

72
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,680
a the regular exploitation world if you
want to

73
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,979
attack something right you down my PC
software

74
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:17,030
and I you can start reverse engineering
right away

75
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,510
a talking cars as a bit harder

76
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,000
we had to you actually find cars that
had the features

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,710
we wanted to you try to attack that
actually took us

78
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,210
like a month just a fine the exact cars
we wanted to use

79
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,919
so it ended up being difficult just to
get the automobiles

80
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,320
someone I I

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,419
so we we took the car because

82
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:46,720
I they were affordable originally

83
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,340
I think we wanted some Ferraris and
Lamborghinis to work with

84
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,389
but funding didn't permit getting those
cars

85
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:57,240
so we had to find cars that had features
such

86
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,100
as automated steering the caramel
parallel park itself

87
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,199
I N you know assisted braking preclusion
system

88
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,210
as they call it so we needed specific
features to a

89
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,940
you know we we realize that their
computer was controlling I

90
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,280
forces the car we were hoping that we
could do it as well working conditions

91
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,860
for me

92
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,960
on the everyday is laptop there

93
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,550
on the couch a pretty relaxed a rocking
a pretty wicked fun can't

94
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,740
I do say so on working conditions in the
car

95
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,210
I force they were a bit difficult the
cars usually work running

96
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,600
so in the winter you have Charlie
freezing outside but its lectured on

97
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,740
and in the summer it was super hot but
you know we could on the roll down the

98
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,380
windows

99
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,550
so conditions in the car kinda and
workplace and

100
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,930
to be especially since it took us so
long do this you

101
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,030
the you have goes on

102
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,319
number where ever I you when I passed
that target

103
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,250
I'll with regular software it's just as
easy as

104
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,250
sipping drinks a cabana Las Vegas

105
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,979
a a attaching to a car

106
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:13,789
ends up being a bit harder you had a
bleeding from your hand a lot

107
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:17,300
it seems a recent IBM

108
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,849
it's like when I use a manual where I'm
not very good

109
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:23,909
at mechanics work so I was always
busting my knuckles of

110
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:26,939
bolts and bleeding everywhere all the
time

111
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:30,919
a this assembly right a

112
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,620
there's probably a lot of people this
rumor familiar with reading

113
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,969
disassembly up 'cause I'm computer
programs you're looking at code

114
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:43,039
you generally have an idea where entry
point would be

115
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,520
a cars on the other hand work wire a bit
more

116
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,840
assembly we wanted to physically located
computers

117
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,389
so that involved ripping the car up a

118
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:56,719
they would usually get you we both had
accounts on our

119
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:59,770
mechanics website purporting to
respectively

120
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,860
I and they would say things like

121
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,159
here's 28 steps to remove the death for
the car

122
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:10,710
and I was like I'm crowbar business
ripped it right off

123
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,360
I just tried it ruined it because I
don't care my you know we're not going

124
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,479
to be using these cars when we're done
so

125
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,719
we didn't really care we damage them

126
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:24,610
debugging again is up whole different
story when you're dealing with cars

127
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,800
as opposed to you software software you
have a nice

128
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,389
the bugger it's pretty easy you can set
breakpoints

129
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:36,719
I a process crashes you restart the
process and be on your way

130
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:39,889
a debugging into cars a a bit more
difficult

131
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:44,020
as Charlie shows here in the forward
you're basically

132
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,520
cutting wires and reading network
traffic and try the

133
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,629
relate that to you physical attributes
that the automobile such as breaking

134
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:55,069
or steering yeah I'm here the car with
working right

135
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:58,090
and new I'm when two wires but

136
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,360
I thought I had a move that right but
and I'll try to figure out what other

137
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,990
than that

138
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,120
writer went s yeah especially I think
since we don't have much experience with

139
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,159
electronics or automobiles was

140
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:13,840
pretty difficult for other there so many
times that we would have known a

141
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,529
mechanic

142
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:17,979
it would save us like a month you have
heard no idea what we

143
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:21,590
that I'll bugs in software

144
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,300
right you can yes see the may trigger a

145
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,120
unfortunately when you have a bug in
your car you end up getting it towed to

146
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,599
dealership for them

147
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,159
effects and this is a Charlie and I

148
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,719
said the signal to the accelerator
saying

149
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,060
put more gas and oxygen in the internal
combustion engine

150
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,240
a we did that for a bit too long I

151
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,400
the their inverter in the car

152
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,689
makes electricity from physical motion
up blew up

153
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,750
and we had to have it towed and I had to
drive a rental car

154
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,560
back to back home and the other hand if
they are car

155
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,029
and look like that last picture that has
gone on the computer hanging out

156
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:07,120
and yes I like who the who the fuck are
you guys I

157
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,529
like the along store does make a drive
to fix any other stuff yeah he was

158
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:16,300
they said Toyota states that they should
reassemble the automobile

159
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,770
entirely before they start picking it
said don't do that

160
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,020
though don't resemble the car

161
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,370
crashes obviously a happen when you're
trying to write an exploit

162
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,120
or you know right investigators offered
on ability but I think

163
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,510
try to convey a bit more about the type
of graph is that we had

164
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,290
yes oh one-time something we'll show you
later I figured out a way to make the

165
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,339
boards breaking not work arms the press
the brakes but it doesn't actually

166
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:47,150
stopping

167
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,520
I was outside in my neighborhood testing
a

168
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,830
and i got very comfortable testing a so

169
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,000
so comfortable that when I pulled into
my driveway I don't think the turn it

170
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,210
off

171
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:02,390
side right now my driveway and I tried
to stop

172
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,690
and the car wouldn't stop so I was

173
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,339
I was II my I was driving right to my
garage

174
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:12,990
I could either drive to the left then
rent my house a guy and

175
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,680
to the right him I have my actual car as
I just got straight

176
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,840
and I just ran into the back of my
garage and you can see I i

177
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,790
this is my work area might drive into
everything like I'll often

178
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,910
likely by it stop to it that the law

179
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,080
on but you can see I some are scenes
from some

180
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,750
an accident like my lawn mower got
destroyed that table is all wrapped up

181
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,370
this is the back in my garage as of:
bowed out from hitting it

182
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,260
this is like the wood splinters than the
Sun coming into the body rubs

183
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,780
which is never a good sign and this is
the

184
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,790
again the a lot more that

185
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,820
wished I had never started this project
I i think

186
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,110
I think it should be publicly documented
this lawn mower

187
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,650
is the first casualty automotive packing
I in the world

188
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,290
so rest in peace lawnmower yeah

189
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,500
and we yeah it was not part of our
funding to a place while I'm already

190
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,410
there

191
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,420
so a unlike the academic guys we
actually release all the details

192
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,010
including what

193
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,430
the economy's so a like chris said we
wanted to find the cheapest cars

194
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,960
that had the hat part missus basically

195
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,480
on so when we would buy them they would
say like what color do you want

196
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,800
we would say we don't care we're gonna
engine we don't care what kinda

197
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,490
you know color interior we don't care
that does auto part

198
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,710
and like when Chris got the car from
from the

199
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,740
you know it showed up at his house and I
was like

200
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,300
I think do not sign for it so you watch
it auto parts of because that's all we

201
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,470
care about

202
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,790
the the people we are buying the cars of
were very confused because we didn't

203
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,330
care what condition they were in

204
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,570
either said auto Park it probably
remember our apartment

205
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:00,280
like yes we're buying I yes we have many
miles it had like

206
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,200
anything that most people care about we
don't care about so this is the

207
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,400
2010 Ford Escape that we use it didn't
have much on it compared to tie up a

208
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,890
stake in auto part

209
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,210
and I had like cruise control on and
stuff but not much

210
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,440
so this is a a video well a

211
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
the car auto Park in South so this is
not happening this is

212
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,410
a features is what's supposed to happen
something play

213
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,410
you me driving in my

214
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,420
my neighborhood the like a very very sad

215
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,580
and i cant cuz you anymore but in here
and I'm driving

216
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:43,580
an exhilarating with that with the mail
turns out a mangled

217
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,790
and then the car that that so so the
other parking in the board

218
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,810
control the steering but not the years
and not the

219
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,570
the gas right be

220
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,950
car that I had was a 2010

221
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,250
Toyota Prius this for a PS had

222
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,410
almost every technological package she
could get

223
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:15,180
on a previous in 2010 so it had radar
cruise control

224
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,560
which means the car would slow down if
it was coming up on another vehicle

225
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,660
I had a thing called lane keep Asus
where

226
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,670
it knew it you're going off the road it
would correct we offer you

227
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,370
P collision system so it really thought
you were going to

228
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,649
collide with something it would apply
the brakes for you

229
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:35,110
even if you're what was on the
acceleration pedal I

230
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,180
area and they had auto Park as well

231
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,490
like a charlie's car I don't think we
did a demo that but

232
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,019
it work the same passion that you
control the gas

233
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:48,149
at the break and we would turn itself so
this PS

234
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:52,959
was pretty promising because I had so
many technology features that we figured

235
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,329
we could definitely use them

236
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:58,760
you do whatever we want and you'll see
when you wish I came to the attacks

237
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,290
that the we have we do a lot more guns
the crease because it was so much more

238
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:10,290
automated them court well the first
thing I think we need to talk about

239
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,760
are things called ECU's were electronic
control units

240
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,230
I'm these little computers really

241
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,070
tend to control every aspect I'll the
automobile

242
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,079
a from the odometer readings

243
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,360
to acceleration to breaking sometimes
steering

244
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,670
up auto manufacturers and realize that

245
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,819
building these individual computers and
putting the car and writing software

246
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:42,560
to do white a they want is a lot more
cost effective than having all the wires

247
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,699
and all the leakage in a pickle

248
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:46,899
about right so they basically

249
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:51,329
take input from sensors and then use
things called actuators

250
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:54,630
to perform physical actions right you
could hear

251
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,709
in Charlie's video when he was auto
parking you heard a beeping noise

252
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:02,300
that was a sensor saying he was getting
close to the car behind and

253
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,350
those with these ECU's kinda you and
their

254
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,819
place various places throughout the
automobile a

255
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:12,819
usually the first thing people ask is
you know what operating system

256
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:16,550
are these things running and they're
really not running traditional operating

257
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,140
system

258
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,810
it's not just some readings burying
they're running custom code

259
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,079
on that specific chip that really a

260
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:30,069
doesn't have much functionality other
than performing its job for example

261
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:31,269
there is a

262
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:34,640
ECU in the previous that was

263
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,670
solely responsible for tightly the seat
belts

264
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,110
in the case that you were to be in a
collision so

265
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,130
matter there's not much code on this
device

266
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,550
writers all it does is get a signal pick
it up that's really all these things do

267
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,620
while the engine control is very
sophisticated there are ones for simple

268
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,079
things

269
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:56,470
the ECU's

270
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,680
a the snarky vehicles were generally set
up

271
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,750
on a CAN bus and the

272
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,220
Candice Controller Area Network which
will talk about here

273
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:11,720
in a little bit but to generalize it all
these issues were on the network

274
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,529
take it all communicate with each other
and all here each other so

275
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:18,730
is long as you were on this network you
could

276
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,880
listen to messages that were coming from
other issues and send messages out

277
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,040
I you know to to the issues as well
there's no we owe addressing

278
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,370
so forging messages quite simple

279
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,730
yes if you wanna see you on an easy
looks like

280
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,300
on this is the our train control module

281
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,459
or the porn basically they want to
control the engine

282
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,760
as this is what it looks like under the
hood what is it like it

283
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,050
on the wires that go into it if you have
been out

284
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,910
it looks like this the you can see
there's like a chip

285
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,380
& like Mike the memory in a much other
stuff but

286
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,980
units it's just the embedded device
basically and it has 17 points

287
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:06,980
one of which is like an hour

288
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,630
a so we were only interested

289
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,740
in can we're aware that there are other
types of networks in automobiles

290
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,460
such as what's right and land and other
things I think with it

291
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,810
becoming popular but we wanted to look
at Cannes

292
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,950
because we figured it was our best
chance to

293
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:30,350
see how the cars that works work and can
is generally

294
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,320
a in every car released in America the

295
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,610
ID's can be 11 or 29 bits in my

296
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,760
we only saw 11 bit ID's on a car

297
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,520
and that seems to be the most common way
so instead of having an address

298
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,730
the ID is used I'm

299
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,450
kinda as a priority function which the
lower ID's

300
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,710
the greater priority so the so the
message

301
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,720
with the highest priority in the car
would be

302
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,340
id0 and I'm and may contain varying
amounts of data

303
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,360
so really there's no addressing it to
just

304
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,530
it's this message out on the network and
the ECU's on the network

305
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,270
look at the ID if it's an ID that they
want as import

306
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:18,350
they take the message and digest the
data that's available with it so it's

307
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,430
really quite simple

308
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,680
I'm

309
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,830
these are kinda example messages the
first

310
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,100
being from the Ford Escape and this data
format was

311
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,950
invented by Charlie and I I just to be
human-readable

312
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,550
and digestible by our API this is a some
standard

313
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:42,580
definition I as you can see here there's
one message that has

314
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,450
and ID were combined idea 03 b1

315
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,220
and the like that a and then followed
are eight bytes of data

316
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,000
I while the previous there's another
message this 1800 b6

317
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,520
I remember this one it's for the speed
of the automobile

318
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,380
as I like the poor and then has or by
today to

319
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,080
a in the Toyota it was very common the
last day to buy

320
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,440
to be attacked some so that 95 is a
check some a

321
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,080
i th us I DL a slight

322
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,090
plus the first three by today to so

323
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:20,130
I'm these messages are constantly being
up without

324
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,940
onto the network they don't a car when
something happens the data bytes or

325
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,450
change when certain events happen

326
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,060
but generally speaking you'll see the
message PBS without

327
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,370
a constant rate and that eight bytes

328
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,380
is the most the message yeah

329
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,660
that a by is the biggest I'm

330
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,670
there's also diagnostic messages

331
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,500
as well these art it constantly

332
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,770
omitted from the car a you they kind of
have a addressing scheme

333
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,290
where you send a message and the ECU
live with

334
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:57,120
an ID that is eight more band the idea
that we set out

335
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,820
so in this example you have an idea 07

336
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:06,450
60 on the ECU sees that that's a
diagnostic messages someone replies

337
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,530
with the ID 076 a this is just for away

338
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,140
for testing tools to be able to
communicate with a single ECU

339
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,910
at any given time I'm there are ways to
get

340
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,660
more than eight bytes in I'm a request
for a response

341
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,270
and we'll talk about that here in a
little bit but it should be noted that

342
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,000
these diagnostic messages are usually
use by mechanics

343
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,940
to troubleshoot problems with either
physical attributes

344
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,490
up the car or say you know the ECU
itself

345
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,720
right so

346
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,510
to tax you can message is the kind that
are always there we call a normal and

347
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,090
then the dynastic ones are the ones that
make an excuse

348
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,870
when a mechanic tools I'm so

349
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,010
sending aid by today to ASM really gonna
cut it

350
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,810
so you need to be or have waists and
more than eight bytes even though you're

351
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,710
sort of underlying protocols

352
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:05,180
so other way a standard way to do it and
the way they both are scars that

353
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,200
as using something I 30 P so it says

354
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,350
ices into I'm 576i to messages the way

355
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,200
send more than a bite at a time and they
do it by a change in the value the first

356
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,570
by

357
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,130
up the masses so there's 0 for is the
very first line:

358
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,230
one if its up a

359
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,350
0 excuse me if it's only going to be one
message one

360
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,360
lesson he bites one of the first lessons
to

361
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,460
its some some a follow-on

362
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,260
3 it's like going out such examples I
make sense

363
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:43,780
so I hear some real in traffic using
this I said. /p P standard the first

364
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,520
line at

365
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,610
the very personable the euro

366
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,670
zeros as it's all going to contain here
then that the reef the there's gonna be

367
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,620
three by today

368
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,740
the biter 14 about

369
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,910
00 and then 13

370
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,540
we are sending last day to sign a lease
at three bites lip US and a lot

371
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,470
with other example is the one on the

372
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:11,160
so this one so

373
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,680
there's the one that says that this is
going to be the first of many messages

374
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,720
to expect and then the link:

375
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,970
$0.80 so expect eighty 82 hacked by

376
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,590
altogether when the day starts when
they're on the first packet

377
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,790
the the receiver send back 3

378
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,120
repack it there indicate

379
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,490
that receive the message and they can
have some information for like about how

380
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,390
fast the Senators

381
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:40,510
hear that anything to get the rest love
it you get all the SMS I would too

382
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:44,390
and the second is going in the day which
one it is make sure that there in order

383
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,750
them 120 .3 in SoCal and that the way
that use and

384
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,570
a data on the car 1 you might be but and
those

385
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,620
see how it goes 21 22 23 what happens
when you get to

386
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,850
to at it just wrapped around to the game
again and will start it

387
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,070
2021 that them you know

388
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,380
basically implemented dated well your

389
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,260
actually concerned a there but

390
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,480
at like the

391
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,100
so that is as hot as an ally detente but
doesn't specify like what date it was an

392
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,180
I so there's a I mean the you can do
anything

393
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,590
but there's a standard as I so 14 to 29

394
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,000
and 14 to 30 that specify the format a

395
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,140
a the data and believe our cars sorta
followed it

396
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,310
at times on so they

397
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:40,650
they aside different services that you
can talk to you

398
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,940
especially this is especially for
diagnostic so let's see

399
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,700
so the first thing you have to do is a
establish a connection with

400
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,010
with issue if Europe's a mechanic's tool
you have to

401
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,060
you know same get ready I'm gonna be
something with you

402
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,040
and so the way we do here is a get I
said. /p P

403
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,020
expecting bites an 03 the planned by the

404
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,080
by the specification the that I'm not
successfully control

405
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,620
on and then at three something else
something to cram into

406
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,880
NEC respond back i mean the

407
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,880
already more than the time and it's
always like that

408
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,300
at all you stand back reporting more the
sixty

409
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,200
and a when will you get 3

410
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,880
which is a course but it's like saying
I'm acknowledging that you sent three

411
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,510
I'm announcing that and buy items and
some information

412
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,000
and is yet a security access

413
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,100
is a interesting one because this

414
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,840
punctuality is usually needed when you
want to perform

415
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,550
I privitize operations on the issue such
as

416
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,520
we flashing the firmware or performing
certain diagnostic facts

417
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,830
that could be considered dangerous so
what you see happens here

418
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,930
is you try to authenticate and its

419
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,680
were sending two bites NEC 2701

420
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,990
that's just saying hey I need a I need
to see that I may be used to you

421
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,720
I create this response to let you know
that I'm authorized the stuff you

422
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,410
I the server then sends back a the 67

423
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:24,170
which is 40 more than 27 and that in
this instance

424
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,700
there's three bites the 54 61

425
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,160
b6 that is gonna be used to you

426
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,660
thank you be key that will be used to
you unlock the ECU

427
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,010
for private functions but at african
happens

428
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,110
on the programmer which is you know

429
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,680
our point is our laptop and it sends it
back and

430
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,120
by sending back the bakke drive fancy

431
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,700
a if it's wrong you won't be able to get
private access

432
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,770
a it's right it sends back 67

433
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:00,070
I 02 say yep we're good you request that
privilege level

434
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,670
I'm and we're going to be able to put
that stuff

435
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,670
I will show you kinda here later I

436
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:11,940
how we derived the how to create these
keys for each marquardt

437
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,300
it's a so it basically you you're
proving to the

438
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,890
ECU that you should have privileged
communication

439
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,720
by using a proprietary algorithm and
their key

440
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,000
thank you a response so it's kinda like
a password

441
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,450
no they don't publish what the algorithm
is to use but we'll talk later

442
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,450
up

443
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:36,910
sir on Another Earth another type a

444
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:41,660
message you can stand dynastic masses is
and put up a control

445
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,690
and so basically this is the idea is

446
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,880
in testing maybe you want that's what
happens when

447
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,910
the some some sort of sensor we discern
value

448
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,810
and so this is %uh that tell the if you
pretend

449
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,690
that your sensor has value or yup it and
the persons present a gas or whatever

450
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,780
and then you can you can diagnose
problems as a mechanic

451
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:09,180
I'm so again their use and to up is the
one that doesn't put up a control

452
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:14,380
and use and two bites to indicate which
in proper controls like which sensor

453
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:18,420
and in some parameters and i won you
know this seems really promising at

454
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,230
first

455
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,670
like I can just you know Senate Intel

456
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:26,310
like rations of whoever but it will
personal loan or

457
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,920
you most the time and second of all
there's no documents indicate what

458
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,760
0307 as you've no idea what that maybe
as you have to try every value

459
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,950
and he had the wrong parameters and
those were it so it's actually very

460
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,170
difficult

461
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:45,590
you have no idea how how it works and
how to get to work

462
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,620
I'm so there's lots of other ones as
well as we talked about

463
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,480
re memory by address request download
transfer data

464
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,540
right memory my address when you read
the the document you think

465
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:00,050
very very easy I can just you read the
memory

466
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:03,430
a good thing I would do anything right
memory with I'll be done

467
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:07,660
but at least our cars EC is based base
they do not implement

468
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,940
almost any so it's very difficult to get
the premiere of

469
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,060
and it even harder to write market we
got really excited

470
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,170
when reading the I suspect because like
he said

471
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:22,010
with this rip the firmware of reverse
engineer that's what we do

472
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:26,130
and then right back on their need to say
the 2002 supported manatees

473
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:29,750
and I think I'll ever supported cue the
services so

474
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,820
you know if you're doing this work and
the services are supported

475
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,280
don't be surprised

476
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,690
or suit now we're gonna talk about the
tools that we use the

477
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,940
mainly the physical tools that we use to
you before

478
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,680
a you functions %uh the first thing

479
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,420
we is a thing called in become cable

480
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:55,170
you can buy the regular cable I think or

481
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:59,720
like a 150 US dollars a you could also
buy a special

482
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,980
mechanics addition for twelve hundred
dollars

483
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,380
we would recommend not buying the
mechanics addition because

484
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,670
if you look at the wiring diagram you
can snap a few wires

485
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:13,830
and by nod2 shell and put the wires in a
public place

486
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:17,810
and it serves the same okay I basically
the expensive one

487
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,800
just as exposed wires now I think that
someone also comes with software

488
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,200
which isn't as good as well we yet the
save yourself the money if you're going

489
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,210
to buy one is just by regular

490
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,140
cable look at wiring diagram in our
paper explains you how to you

491
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:36,520
hit the wires and connect them to you
you know db2 shell

492
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,440
a wanna the a items that I used a lot

493
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,200
is the J 20 534 passed through device

494
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,330
this is a car back plus I this is a
couple hundred US dollars

495
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,430
added this was a way for the software

496
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:56,520
that we downloaded from Toyota the
mechanics use

497
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,330
to communicate with the car so basically
most mechanic shops will have something

498
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,760
very similar to this

499
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,870
I it's just the standard way for
software to talk to.

500
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,520
automobile through the obd2 port

501
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,350
up by if you gonna do this research by a
lot of these

502
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,420
they're like 20 cents US

503
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,460
but basically it's a shell that that is
blank

504
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,940
40 db2 and you can put metal pins where
the pins are

505
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,420
in your car the standard pains are 6

506
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,570
and 14 but Charlie had plans for the
four that were

507
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,650
different so he could create his own
kinda device

508
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:38,890
it's a you know packing up a whole big
cable

509
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,910
well since we show you the hardware
tools now will

510
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,590
explain the software that we're out
which is now publicly available

511
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,690
online you can download it and use it
yourself

512
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:52,050
I the first thing that we rewrote was

513
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,980
I think all geek oMG cat and as you can
probably guess

514
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,490
this the software that leverages the

515
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,020
Tom Cable you read right onto

516
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,860
the can-bus it basically with our Swiss
Army knife

517
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,720
right we would sit there and we messages
on the wire

518
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,720
and we go to his impartiality to send
multiple messages

519
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,740
continuously loop messages filter on
certain ID's

520
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,750
a its not very well written I would say

521
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:26,010
but it definitely serves the purpose and
I is very useful

522
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,170
this is a call when we wanted to figure
out

523
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:33,440
how parallel parking work Charlie and I
would be out parallel parking their cars

524
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:33,800
for

525
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,260
hours on end for a couple weeks look in
our computer

526
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,860
and using this software to narrow down
the idea is that were used

527
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,390
for the parking a the other

528
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:48,470
portion that we wrote is that the
compact API

529
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:52,450
and its basically Python ATI

530
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,190
that a is quite useful and leverages a
lot of the functionality

531
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,850
a the become cat program which is
written

532
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:04,350
in C I'm this just makes it really easy
to you

533
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,790
right 51 scripts that you up for some
action

534
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:11,780
and you'll see in our examples we
actually using our own API

535
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:16,550
few right little programs in Python to
control piece the car

536
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:20,690
and then we also wrote this other
portion called P why he come

537
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:24,130
and it really just abstract a a lot a

538
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:27,660
the but the the comp at ATI

539
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,240
library especially for the Toyota since
the total was

540
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,670
quite different than the four on there
was a lot of different functions that

541
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,210
were needed

542
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:41,670
we figured create another rapper library
would make it easier to do stuff

543
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,720
so Obama color by numbers typeof guy

544
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,140
so example makes it easy I if you're
using army camp at API

545
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,160
the first thing your gonna do you is
plugged it become

546
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,420
a it on cable in your computer and hope
that up to the car

547
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,900
and then you open the device after
opening device

548
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,090
you can I setup a

549
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:08,450
we caught the bug lying to you as a fat
I it's basically the format that we

550
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,410
invented

551
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,610
its tax and then you can write a message

552
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:16,790
on the can-bus were certain amount of
time so you can see in literally

553
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:20,970
four lines of code you can continuously
write messages to the damn bus

554
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,770
this was one of our goals we wanted to
bring this research

555
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,650
cue more people you don't have to spend
time thinking on this stuff out

556
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,250
you can download our library start
sending messages to your car

557
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:37,370
or reading messages quite easily we have
other functions such as writing messages

558
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,640
I right a message to a file you can
actually

559
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,120
take a a you know I don't like you would
in Wireshark to file and import that

560
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,760
file

561
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:52,590
to try to recreate a scenario the car

562
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,990
so now let's talk about and now that we
can write messages

563
00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:00,220
what type 2 messages to me right and
what can we do to the car

564
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:06,060
so on it should be said the perfect I
want to do everything we want to control

565
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,180
scary in breaks acceleration

566
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,260
there's some things in the car you just
can't control with

567
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,450
but can messages on and for example and

568
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:19,950
poured there is no way to control the
throttle

569
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:23,270
the gas on because all that is

570
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,419
in one ECU so there's no communication

571
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:30,540
on the cam us to tell the ECU how to
behave it is not has all those stated in

572
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,250
the

573
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,500
on site itself make all the decisions
are there's no way you can fill some

574
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,050
stuff

575
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:38,890
it's taking a physical state up the car
you go in and order that

576
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:42,530
the pedal is pressed then taking only
that isn't but not messages from the

577
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,010
network

578
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,270
right you can place that the key and
wire and now it's homework

579
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:50,040
so there's nothing you can do there
another thing is that

580
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,020
we can forge messages and that's a to do
something like maybe

581
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,520
you turn the steering wheel but there is
the original masses are still going to

582
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,330
be there

583
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,770
so there is an issue still standing the
real state the car

584
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:05,030
and you can you can but other messages
on top of that

585
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,880
but there's there's always gonna be a
fight between the real messages in your

586
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,770
injecting message

587
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:14,310
on and finally the the car makers bill
then security

588
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:18,430
some I should say safety thing

589
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,760
um that the driver bed

590
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,280
an accident I think the you know a
message is crafted they don't want the

591
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,910
car to

592
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:29,030
to crash so there are a lot of
precautions that they put

593
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:32,550
into it that either stop us from doing
something or at least made it more

594
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:35,750
difficult to be

595
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,900
so again there were two thousand can
messages normal

596
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,700
dynastic let's first talk about what we
could do with with normal

597
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:47,140
missus I'm

598
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:51,790
so I think so the first thing is the

599
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,740
it's pretty simple but people seem to
think it's cool a you can chose been on

600
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,150
there

601
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,720
on and your car so without the board one

602
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,760
so here the ID you need to know is that
0201

603
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,410
the only way we figure that out like
that's not document it was just trial in

604
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,650
there

605
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,770
I'm so has a bye the format looks like
this

606
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,220
me take you see a but in that formula

607
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,170
you take your that RPM's like that if I
mean up

608
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,350
and then you get you get the steering
wheel to I means

609
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:26,210
you get the now under to think what you
want

610
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,290
and said he was the only easy it is visa
Atia

611
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:33,050
a there's a few lines a a pipe and that
this at this

612
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:39,160
your here's a video

613
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,630
a I'm driving on the street and I'm
quite flowing

614
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:47,590
a look like working out now to me and I
for them going quite bass

615
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:51,960
but I'm I'm not actually I'm this is
obviously a close

616
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,270
course around Charlie's house or not day
during his neighbors

617
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:58,630
yet this is very say

618
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,720
on and here's a man to

619
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,120
separate thread to different P&ID a
different message by the same idea

620
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,200
as one message you play tennis at the
sea and sitting by my garage and not

621
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,820
moving at all

622
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,070
yep I'm definitely not moving

623
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:19,100
you can have a car that I'm

624
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,180
it's going quite fast

625
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,560
putting out an hour and you're not
moving so

626
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,890
you can report but these messages for
the automobile

627
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,640
to trick the speedometer you think it's
going to be you want

628
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,790
and you'll see later why that's actually
important for

629
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:40,220
other types a things we wanted to do

630
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:44,190
a fruit whether we want to be able to
you arbitrarily

631
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,840
apply the brakes I and the way we did
this

632
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,260
again a I would dry

633
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,490
a car cruise control a really close to
another car and

634
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:59,790
have my sniper hooked up with the car
brake a record the traffic

635
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,990
we would sit through the messages and
figure out which ones are used for

636
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,310
automatic braking I again you

637
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,800
kinda plugin how much 41 apply the
brakes I

638
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,870
you know obviously we wanted to you
claim them completely shut a and then

639
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,850
there's a check some

640
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,700
and then there's adjustments they which
if you read the paper explains what that

641
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,210
is

642
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:25,600
a again while this is a bunch this is
the whole program

643
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,230
to a completely locked the brakes a 2010
Toyota Prius

644
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:33,390
if it has the preclusion system the
brakes

645
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:37,420
who be applied 4/4 regardless of how
fast you going

646
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:42,490
you could even press the acceleration
pedal the whole way down in the car will

647
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:49,490
we r a video that

648
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,980
down

649
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:58,360
others usually sound rar on heard

650
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:03,330
right a up

651
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:06,490
the that's that's what you get with our
part

652
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:09,960
that a classic

653
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,830
the I'm

654
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:19,400
doing I'm morning william I'm

655
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,589
in

656
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:26,489
and then we went on between send the
packet and we stop okay

657
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:30,739
cream II I got a

658
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:34,169
for the Toyota we could also control the
steering

659
00:39:34,169 --> 00:39:38,719
a it had the the key pieces which is one
way until the steering

660
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:41,819
but it also had the intelligent Park
assess

661
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:44,919
parallel parking the car again with

662
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:48,609
parallel park the car with Arsenal
perked up for hours on end

663
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:52,499
trying to figure out what messages and
what data corresponded to you say the

664
00:39:52,499 --> 00:39:53,729
angle at the wheel

665
00:39:53,729 --> 00:39:58,149
at things like that I bit wet actually
had

666
00:39:58,149 --> 00:40:02,049
some a lot of restrictions on when the
wheel could turn

667
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:06,809
if you're using the park assist you
needed to be in the park assist mode

668
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:11,029
the car needed to be in reverse and the
car could not see

669
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:14,549
more than five miles an hour so a

670
00:40:14,549 --> 00:40:17,559
first it seemed pretty daunting but I am

671
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:20,639
what we did is up you got away

672
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:24,409
cue track the car so before you saw how
we set the

673
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:28,099
speedometer 320 miles an hour this time
around we

674
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:32,369
gave the automotive network assist the
that the car could go

675
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:36,049
so no one knew what to do from there we
told the car that was

676
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:39,089
actually reverse when it wasn't and that
it was

677
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:43,499
parallel park itself so by combining all
the knowledge we learned about car

678
00:40:43,499 --> 00:40:47,409
we could make we'll turn I again as try
to talk before

679
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:50,419
it's not really smooth like it would be
if you're packing the car

680
00:40:50,419 --> 00:40:53,949
but it really just the way our hands on
you can definitely rack

681
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:57,039
we we just met someone giving a demo
last week

682
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,839
there up there are two ways in Toyota

683
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:05,389
that you can you could turn revealing he
misses and the safety built in there was

684
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:06,769
even on time five degrees

685
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:10,899
that's not very and the safety for the
car parking was

686
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:16,209
it only work if your slow and in reverse
and that was it mezzo by tricking

687
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:19,989
the that we really at the time here's a
thriving again

688
00:41:19,989 --> 00:41:24,959
may actually I think it'd gonna make the
meal times in a lifetime

689
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:31,959
did a little bit but they require ok

690
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,530
I was really trying to kill time

691
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,860
I'm good but

692
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,740
as quite a rabbit

693
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,600
so here's I give you driving what it
would look like okay looking for

694
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,070
anything

695
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:54,990
picking and always seem to turn when it
senses you're gonna crash yeah

696
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,450
we're yeah but I see we didn't really
have

697
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:01,730
of control unfortunately but it stepping
up the rescue

698
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,960
I acceleration was another one of our
goals

699
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,570
and the 3s actually had acceleration

700
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:13,380
by wire that is it communicated on the
campus certainly see you

701
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,790
and that ECU kinda control the speed a

702
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:20,130
a car I'm while entirely scar

703
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:23,750
really didn't work that way again we
figure it out

704
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,110
the can I D that was used for
acceleration

705
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:31,060
unfortunately for this example we could
be you know db2 you

706
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,410
poor we actually had to connect into
another place in the cannot work

707
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,240
but we figured a you're going to
compromise a car you're probably gonna

708
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,770
get multiple entry points after you came
here initial

709
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:46,080
entry point so it's still feasible and
it showed that week 8

710
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,600
control acceleration the automobile
again

711
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,360
this is the whole program as long as you
backed into the can that work in the

712
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,130
right spot

713
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:59,340
these couple lines will accelerate the
automobile

714
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:02,920
I the progresses up Hybrid Synergy Drive

715
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,600
so the gasoline engine is and always
doing all the work you know the electric

716
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,170
motor

717
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:10,290
will help the car out so this really
works

718
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:13,690
within the gasoline internal combustion
engine

719
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:16,740
I is engaged I am and will

720
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,550
and up you know making the car go for
you let off the gas pedal

721
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:24,730
and you send these messages and the car
continues to accelerate warning

722
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:29,000
this can and will harm your car if this
was my personal car

723
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,860
I would have done any of this work but
specifically I would have not done

724
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,260
death because we did blow-up a inverter

725
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:41,200
it cost us four thousand USD affects and
took a lot of budget at a bar project

726
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,760
so here's a video a celebrating its
really hard to show but you'll see that

727
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,560
I had with my legs up the crew that I'm
not press the pedal

728
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,750
and hopefully you'll hear the car
continue to accelerate

729
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:58,980
you

730
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:05,980
Lee

731
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:28,299
I'm grand

732
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:32,960
I'm if we wouldn't let the camera roll

733
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,640
two more seconds you heard this loud
palm

734
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,740
and that was the invoker blowing up and
the car never worked after that but

735
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,599
that that they don't do that us that was
the

736
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,740
just something normal traffic that the
car normally would send

737
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:51,900
except weeks we've sent thing with them
now wanna talk about

738
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,000
using the diagnostic messages to pack
the car the first thing you have to do

739
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,849
it you wanna

740
00:44:56,849 --> 00:45:01,180
and I'm massive messages yet know how to
get around the security access

741
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,599
on and so a the way that

742
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:08,089
that this free access works is you you
need to know the other than

743
00:45:08,089 --> 00:45:11,319
and you need to know this secret for use
each

744
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:14,500
ECU has a different secret value that it
only with those

745
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,720
with and others not only the the

746
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,839
the DEC's now on the the mechanic school
has to also know

747
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,260
so the way we got it was we base it is
reverse engineer

748
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,079
the Castells so as an example

749
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:32,520
up first also there's a issue and
therefore called the

750
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,930
park in this is Michael him and actually
screw this one up

751
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:39,510
the he did them as balls here and then

752
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:43,319
and every time it will be different here
and always and 11 TT

753
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:48,470
33 which is which is wrong so as long as
you see this won t know the answer

754
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:51,190
as always gonna be the same and you can
send it without knowing the other the

755
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:54,970
more the secret I'm since they screwed
up that but other SEC use they did the

756
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:55,539
right way

757
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:59,150
um so the way we had to do that was we
had a reversal

758
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:03,299
new things which shockingly was probably
one of the easiest part for us to do

759
00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:07,339
we had windows 32 bit software and we
had a reverse it to get the keys out

760
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:07,950
that was

761
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:11,400
literally probably the easiest thing we
didn't compare product release for us

762
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,549
right as we know about software we don't
know so much about her

763
00:46:14,549 --> 00:46:18,359
so this is where the cord to looks like
it's like straight out in nineteen

764
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:18,980
ninety

765
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,230
on and I you can reverse it and

766
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:25,849
they said Samantha debugging built into
it but there was very trivial to get

767
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:26,200
around

768
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:31,410
I'm certain this is the actual outer
than they used to compute a

769
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:35,210
you know the the skaters plants and this
is an x-ray system

770
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:38,289
a know here's all that he's done that
x-rays

771
00:46:38,289 --> 00:46:43,460
so you can just see used up the
mountains with a lot for every issue

772
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,349
every port and because they're five
bites

773
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:51,279
they can be a name random bites but
sometimes they made the bites ASCII

774
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:52,250
characters just

775
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:55,789
I guess inside Barakat thing with some
other more

776
00:46:55,789 --> 00:47:01,440
on so I here's the actual keys you need
to know

777
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,589
those little is the like 60 he either a
hundred or whatever

778
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:07,819
but these are the ones that are actually
in the 2010 word

779
00:47:07,819 --> 00:47:11,359
escape so a and there's some there's a
yet though

780
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,200
other ticket to get even higher
prevalence it's like again and again

781
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,660
router something in those are those

782
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,770
we have all the keys on weekend we can

783
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:23,599
wit and where the tool about the same
went for the previous

784
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,710
a there up to you more keys

785
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:30,490
port where does Lexus and Scion but
generally speaking

786
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:35,000
for the updatable issues in my car a it
was a simple actually reparation

787
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,700
with one a the what are these two keys a

788
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,900
we reverse that right out and boil it
down to make it easy

789
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,789
so if you check out our tools and the
paper we show you if you want to

790
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:50,260
the security access for Toyota Lexus and
Scion

791
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:55,089
ago say here's one and turns out

792
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:58,630
that there's a lot of ways to do now
service the car with can-bus

793
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,079
you can make the car not working I do
anything so that's actually like very

794
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:02,799
easy to do

795
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:06,220
and singers at one example you can use
to do it a

796
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:09,890
in this case you to send this message
and the car will die

797
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:14,099
engine will die and you will feel
started lives on this message so here's

798
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,280
love you me

799
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,930
the drive going and I'm your time

800
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:25,600
and I'm going to start the car I'm I'm
right back room

801
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:31,650
better player bueno 2009 as likely mom
and son wartime

802
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:35,180
thing I don't know you no matter what
you do you miss

803
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:39,110
not unlike I'm I

804
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:43,040
we can do things like a turn the lights

805
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,240
on our for the Toyota they usually have
to be in the

806
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,140
auto state which i think a lot of people
keep it on so when it gets dark like to

807
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,070
make the turn on

808
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:55,500
you know you have a daytime running
lights a we wanted to do a demo but

809
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,610
unfortunately

810
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:59,800
I plan to do this then oh after we blew
up the car

811
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,260
so I never had to do a demo this but the
you can turn the lights on and off the

812
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:04,900
press

813
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,070
thing in the four you can

814
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:12,130
you can turn the lights off and the this
one is kinda

815
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:15,900
especially scary because not only did
turn up like the headlights you can turn

816
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,220
off the brake lights the

817
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:20,820
you when you press the brake lights
won't turn on as likable completely dark

818
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:25,150
using I about the

819
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:29,900
dog p time i'm saying is I i send the
packet and

820
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,000
interior lights are on there and it's
time for the bill outside lights are off

821
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,010
and like the air conditioner doesn't
work the radio doesn't work I'm

822
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:41,750
does the eye open the door but the the
dome light to come on

823
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,780
I'm pressing the button and nuts and
enlightening putting the brakes

824
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,880
on Sat so gotta get outta I can get out

825
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,560
are you know which is our I its disabled
the thing that might make sure that you

826
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,170
press the button to get at a park

827
00:49:55,170 --> 00:50:00,500
and so I'm by pulitzer wanna the

828
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:05,250
forty-ones I thought the previous was
the you could and diagnostic messages to

829
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:05,820
you engage

830
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:09,630
or the automobile and as long as he said
this message the horn would hope for

831
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,140
ever

832
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:16,979
which we know it any greenberg reports
but the 2009 yeah he

833
00:50:16,979 --> 00:50:22,589
aluminum hmm again it's not really a
malicious

834
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:25,960
but it is annoying he's playing in the
family car

835
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,390
that even if you turn the car off an
airplane message the Cornwall

836
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:33,450
for just about ever my neighbors are
probably upset with me

837
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,599
protesting that for several days a

838
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,859
the seat belts as I have mentioned
before in the previous

839
00:50:39,859 --> 00:50:42,910
a were linked up to the people living
system so

840
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:46,109
if you were to be an accident they would
be takes the seat belt

841
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:49,720
ensure that you didn't smash your face
into the windshield

842
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:55,059
I we found that we had this continuously
said these diagnostic messages as well

843
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:58,529
and a papacy about annoying

844
00:50:58,529 --> 00:51:02,579
I don't think the you know it could
really hurt you but it is weird

845
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:08,450
mom

846
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:12,880
Miami home

847
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:19,530
ok

848
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:23,430
again we really enjoyed any green bag
with that when he was driving a car with

849
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:24,960
really despite the seat belt

850
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,090
I'll locking and unlocking the doors

851
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:33,370
a again with use the diagnostics it was
pretty trivial

852
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:37,010
but I think these would be a good
candidate if you had

853
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:40,530
a remote vector you could every skate is
going to to the car

854
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:43,930
again I plan to make these demos

855
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:48,860
the car blew up I never got to make them
up I

856
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:52,430
your case a even the fuel gauge is
reliance on

857
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:56,230
things such as the can-bus even though
it measures how much she was in there

858
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:59,520
you can test the gauges a with
diagnostic tools

859
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,680
right so you watch the video have been
proposed that we will hang

860
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,340
and that even work %uh you know wow I
don't think I while you're

861
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:11,560
I'm looking for a friend with a previous
because I wanna it what are these little

862
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,650
plug the constant plays a message that
he has a full tank of gas

863
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:21,020
so this breaks down and I can laugh at
it so here is like

864
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:25,030
one thing that made me crash my car into
the ground that's by when the scary

865
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:25,520
things

866
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,760
on its command mechanical used to bleed
the brakes

867
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,880
like let the and a router whatever on

868
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,030
so they did bill precaution like
security into that

869
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:39,240
it only works if you're driving like
around five miles an hour last

870
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,430
so that means that you're going like 40
the breaks the work but

871
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:47,260
the problem with that feature is that if
you want to use your brakes at some

872
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,760
point you want to actually stop

873
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,890
so you always want to eventually go less
than five miles an hour

874
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:57,180
on and so you can so here's a video of
the

875
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,790
me doing it to Chris for change so he's
gonna go park the car

876
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:06,050
and I'm gonna make the brakes I'm

877
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:10,140
down to the bottom

878
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,600
name

879
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,530
movie maybe maybe not okay

880
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:21,720
okay driving I get it back a I

881
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,640
I was panicking up to try to use my left
foot to press the brake pedal

882
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:30,030
I don't know I've if you see like we had
the car

883
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,070
and I go up and they were driving like
into the the region's up and

884
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:37,330
no reason that he ever stop week when he
was mass in the brakes to this but

885
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:42,040
he actually not the the cable out so
otherwise out a meeting privately had

886
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:42,490
some

887
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:46,250
it was a spare parts a

888
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:49,340
that the you know I know is that it
makes it like you got an awesome

889
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:53,290
like her it's like a tiger that know
them I got hit the breaker

890
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:56,900
are not working but so I think we're
gonna cry

891
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,550
so up well

892
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:04,320
if you want to learn more about the
firmware get our paper Mon

893
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,720
the stem over this really quickly is
running on time on the base the

894
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,700
the way that we did it for the for the
toilet we're still working on

895
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,960
ways to watch the way that the
mechanicals updated the firmware

896
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,410
and then try to pick it up so we do

897
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:23,570
for three issues and the poor so I had
actually

898
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:28,040
as that the board out and I'm use a
hybrid debugger

899
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,070
to done the firmware thats quite
difficult

900
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:36,120
are compacted you just on campus I'm so
use this guy

901
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,460
this 8012 development and then once I
had firmware

902
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:44,770
there was actually already a module and
I to protest some words that made it

903
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:45,220
easy

904
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,670
the disassembled the whole thing and I
could figure out

905
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:52,720
like how it worked then on it it's
pretty easy and the

906
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,130
and embedded world said to reverse
things because

907
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:59,390
with particular things and hardware that
tell you exactly what's going on

908
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:02,740
so you know it's some particular address
that's where the canned stuff happens

909
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:05,900
and so is it pretty easy to reverse out
where all the

910
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,800
interesting and things are you can't by
Michael base which thing with animals

911
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,720
and support

912
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,440
so on I got the paper if you wanna see

913
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,350
more information about that so here's a
video to show that

914
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,900
I can I can do that so am I doing this
video is

915
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,820
I'm gonna plug into the the is they can
bus

916
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:31,730
I'm going to a reef last the firmware on
the

917
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:35,780
and when the models and make it do
something and this gave them a maybe

918
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,400
it's another package over and over

919
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,120
the tells the car that it in reverse
when there are things that that means as

920
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,530
the backup camera comes on

921
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:46,200
so tobacco prob on even though I'm not
universe

922
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,000
and then I'm india summer unplugged from
the member show that I don't have to be

923
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,160
on the network anymore

924
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:55,780
as the deployment your car I seconds and
unplug and I cancer control the things

925
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,960
your your community now right with his
persistence

926
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,360
and play games in a row bTW for price i
cant

927
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:08,040
or on my program so the permit so making
my whole are no BBQ or

928
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,810
know when you're driving along I'm
driving up may about was by my side like

929
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:13,960
I think I've ever

930
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,710
the ECU and because I happen to me that
he had an active I knew he would you

931
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:19,390
know I know

932
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:23,680
minor won't be you world

933
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,390
I'm up so anyway that is so that you can

934
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:31,110
you can last things and James the the
firmware I'll survive

935
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:34,680
even if you're not an hour he could we
could have done any other

936
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:38,440
up the operations he didn't words such
as you know we the brakes and things

937
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,030
like that obviously the backup camera
was the safest

938
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:46,550
often on that Toyota is really weird
really quite area quickly we don't have

939
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:47,280
much time

940
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,040
it didn't actually use their request
upload across download thing

941
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,060
I they do their own proprietary thing

942
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:59,350
and shocking you know that the the
japanese auto manufacturer do that right

943
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:04,060
but they have these calibration file
that contain stop

944
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:08,930
in them a lot of its in motorola's
format so you can actually get the

945
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:12,060
you know calibration update the car from
photo site

946
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:15,400
and then pull them out here but you can
only really

947
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,830
I you need a special password before

948
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:22,910
you can actually be flashing and it can
make a time he's really low can I these

949
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:26,660
I like probably starving you could do
security access and then reflash

950
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:31,800
I had to do security access send this
kinda one-time password for the given

951
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,740
calibration

952
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:37,370
along I figure out this proprietary
communication protocol between

953
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:41,800
the computer necu there were still kinda
working on that but if you're interested

954
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,500
read the paper

955
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,530
there's like 10 a disinformation that
will tell you how

956
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:49,690
how we went about doing this that

957
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:53,590
so the filing a case for a talk about as
how you could now that we know this how

958
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:55,170
you can actually detect these attacks

959
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:59,000
in your own car and so it's pretty easy
to spot ours

960
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,900
on the the package to see a very regular

961
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:07,370
very expected nothing unusual but when
we send our track

962
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:10,920
looks very different it's a love back to
the way that we get the car to ignore

963
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,430
the real

964
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:14,800
packets and the ours as we just let the
network

965
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,450
and in the car is which is are packed
and so

966
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:22,850
as the histogram other types the rate
that you see messages and are

967
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:26,310
attacked with the way off the chart so
if you just

968
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:31,220
track at the rate the messages you would
be attacked becomes a tax that we didn't

969
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:35,500
this we say yeah i mean for example that

970
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,960
hearing when we needed to check the car
anything he was going to speed that was

971
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,190
you know below five miles an hour a it
received the speed packet

972
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:46,980
maybe ten times second we send we said
it ten thousand times a second

973
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:50,070
so we just literally plotted the network
I

974
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:53,550
yes 0 there are things that you can do
to protect these a lot of the diagnostic

975
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:54,040
stuff

976
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,230
like Charlie the brakes should never
occur when the cars

977
00:58:57,230 --> 00:59:01,550
driving but you know those are safety
mechanism for the manufacture can fix

978
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:01,980
them

979
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:06,240
and maybe should be something about

980
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,020
your so we set this the forward in
Toyota

981
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,390
before we gave it our about this and
that and

982
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:17,290
and so Toyota basically said that this
is no big deal

983
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:21,090
a they focus on stopping remote attacks

984
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:24,470
which I'm sure is bullshit but work we
know we can't say

985
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:27,480
prove otherwise at this point the they

986
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,300
so they they they say um so that what we
did is even happening it's like

987
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:35,750
you know what's supposed to happen but I
know it which is that plan true

988
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:39,380
right that's like saying don't worry I
have a firewall all my computers behind

989
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,650
her say

990
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:46,380
its Bay yes %uh they they more let's say
that you can get a remote act you can do

991
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:49,490
you can crash the person and they're
okay with that

992
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:53,580
on so it's a wrap things up a

993
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:56,820
there there's a thing called a cam bus
and all the computers listen to it

994
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:59,990
and you can send message you can send
messages on the can-bus

995
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:04,420
you can take the computers and doing
things they probably get one day

996
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:08,340
and then you know the proper research
releasing all the informational tools

997
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:08,860
you can

998
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:12,430
check on the internet down on the paper
it's like a hundred pages or something

999
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:16,000
and download all the tools and right up
your cell we have all the tools

1000
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,780
even the data from Heathrow navarre car
up so you

1001
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:23,360
really can recreate exactly what you get
at me and I to produce I'm so the

1002
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,350
firmware and stuff like that

1003
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:29,170
so thanks to these guys help us out and
the

1004
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:36,170
we can take a question

1005
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,490
alright thanks governments
