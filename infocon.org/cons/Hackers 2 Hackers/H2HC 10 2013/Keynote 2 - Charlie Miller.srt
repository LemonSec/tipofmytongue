1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,299
thanks for having me my first time and
Brazil

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,950
%uh nice to be here I'll try to go slow

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,920
the other countries on

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,340
so a that's the thing I understand he
had things to say

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,109
about the incident so I have like 10
slides all about the fact that

6
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:26,769
just getting I know um

7
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:30,039
so other what white

8
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,800
lead I got me to think about this talk
was

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,739
there's this conference and United
States called up and

10
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,840
that is like a hacker conference and

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,039
it's very common your people go to staff
person talk about I

12
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,120
you know they they're not it turned the
phone off or

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,320
you know they bring a buyer found just
for the conference and then they go to

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,640
wear something ridiculous

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,770
right so a oasis in the Lakers

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,190
me and so the stock is sorta about

17
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,309
that and on and

18
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:07,030
you know what you need to really worry
about with mobile security

19
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,299
and unit what you should you are a doll
how much you should worry

20
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,670
its or just try it you know from my
opinion to get the facts out

21
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,680
a about like the real problems that were
once a person like most people

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,710
I X O

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,270
so there's some stuff about me I can
talk more about that

24
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,680
so here

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,630
like if he does Google Mobile Security
you'll find

26
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,040
tons of articles about that right

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,430
moles okay so here's a son that I just
wrapped up the Anna

28
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,100
things like the smartphone

29
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,240
cyberattacks to grow this year this is
mean year 2013

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,020
and I size ASO these I'll grab

31
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,079
basically and from December he doesn't

32
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,920
well so they're talking about this year
and you can

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,640
you guys like to see that nothing really
happens here so you guys either that

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,920
they were sort of bullshit

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,569
so where's there's one actually at all
really

36
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:14,220
mobile devices the new prime and right
or growing

37
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:21,220
there so this one specific other hand
right answer them our magnet

38
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,260
so how you can protect yourself mobile
rights

39
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:32,010
happened the last so there's the

40
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,609
it basically you never see an article
that those are there is no more that

41
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:37,439
they always talk about how to use the
mobile

42
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,090
on this one was very important to me

43
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,859
because you know if you can't let point
on your phone was the point of having

44
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:45,720
thus far

45
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,139
up so so there's there's a lot of
headlines out there

46
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:54,540
and on and you reporters they like you
to read

47
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,170
read what they have to say and I just
wanna see what you know

48
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,569
I want to talk about what is is you know
reality at least

49
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:06,010
amount so this is so that and I don't
really hate

50
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,790
a all classy news

51
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,250
news stories like you know I think these
are you okay to apply to say here's some

52
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:13,669
more

53
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:17,069
so the sun's about like iPhone being
exploited

54
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,579
the sun's about Android asunder by

55
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:26,150
that's a nice tax this is that happen
kinda

56
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,209
on and about like

57
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,859
does anyone know the what these all have
in common yes these are all about me

58
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:37,329
so a our tax I've done and

59
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:41,870
like I like at you know reporters as
much as anybody maybe more

60
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,099
on but but that doesn't necessarily mean
just because I

61
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:49,849
you know hacked the iPhone that you need
to worry about euro I so that's the

62
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:51,609
difference that's why i wanna talk about

63
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:55,549
is a just because you see that there's a
is that the radical

64
00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:00,729
attack doesn't necessarily something
Paso

65
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:04,150
I wanna talk about supper someone talk
about a

66
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,169
units its very basic level sorta what

67
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:11,540
what kinda attacks are on and I'ma talk
about why those attacks

68
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,000
are different when you're are talking
about your mobile platform

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,269
hearses like your your here and to do
that out I give a little background on

70
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,400
an Android OS and how they're designed

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,090
on now talk about a actual problems that
I think

72
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,650
exists for from all on I'll talk about
so

73
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,580
how attackers the and finally I'll

74
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,789
all you know so today I say mobile isn't
the biggest

75
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:44,029
right but maybe unification out that
won't be the case and so

76
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:50,729
so it's like a wide things might change
oversight at them was a very basic level

77
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:53,130
you guys are probably understand this

78
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,229
like let's let's talk about how

79
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,450
attack happened at all so

80
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,270
lazy two ways that that bad guy can get

81
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,330
code on your your device your computer
or your

82
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,090
your he or whatever the one is that you
download and run it

83
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,419
malware right and the other is that
there's some explain about services

84
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:20,779
your disorder using the the device like
it's supposed to be

85
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,500
use but there's some more ability that
allows

86
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,599
attacker to get coburn that I like it as
a little more

87
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:32,760
so in the case the malware

88
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,469
a you say you're downloading code in
running it

89
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,539
and and maybe you think it does
something that doesn't

90
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:44,590
or you're somehow kinda you know tricked
into running it but but the bottom line

91
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,479
is from the

92
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,889
devices perspective user wants to run
the comps so it's

93
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,479
its you know computers I'm designed to
to help you there

94
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,430
computer designed to run code that you
want to run so

95
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,529
so traditionally the way that we deal
with this promise something like

96
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,339
antivirus

97
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:06,250
with his job the suppose to be able to
tell the good and the bad code

98
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,830
knowing that you want to go and you know

99
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,849
whether it works are not as a different
story but that's what it's there that

100
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:17,779
on the other hand a exploits again

101
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:22,710
are something where a you're not trying
to run code necessarily

102
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,360
news trying to your web page or read
your email or whatever

103
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,070
but because there's some problem with
the software

104
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,029
you have you are exposed to lead in the
bag I

105
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:38,440
on you change what your programs doing
it

106
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,290
to do whatever they want to do and on

107
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,419
a lot of what happens at the end to that
is the code will download

108
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:49,360
you know something sorted software to
run that the attacker want

109
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,260
so

110
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,120
up let's talk about like how you can

111
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,430
you know what you can do to to stop

112
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,570
for the same so it's a basically I'm
there's a few things that you was that

113
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,120
an hour

114
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,460
showing up on your on a computer or are

115
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,770
refrigerator or whatever there's there's
like a few basic things you could try

116
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:18,340
he you tactics so you can make it hard
to get on in the first place

117
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,530
you can limit what he can do you want it
there

118
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,990
a you can

119
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,440
and you can limit how long making me you
can be there

120
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,010
so like if you had malware on your
computer but

121
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,460
after I meant to stop working like that
I would be bad but not too bad

122
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,670
Amanda finally you can you can watch it
and try to

123
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:45,500
attacked when it does something that you
think is bad on

124
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,880
on the exploitation side you can try to
make your software using

125
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,550
and I have on abilities are happy or a

126
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,490
you can make it hard win there is a
vulnerability

127
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,980
to a to actually explain it

128
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,010
missus they say what the industry spent
a lot of time going

129
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,920
me like 830 given up I'm banging on the
bugs

130
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,310
and and and a paper with more on making
it hard

131
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,530
actually yet like on and

132
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,170
you limit what the you know the
compromise of work and do

133
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,740
into this is me ideas like sandbox and
and so far

134
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:30,740
I you can and you make a hard to persist
so this is the idea like we'll talk

135
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,560
about this later but like on the iPhone

136
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,300
I much you have came together I'm
hopeful things typically like when you

137
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,440
you restore your iPhone the the pain
would go away

138
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,900
so you know that we'll talk more about
the persistence

139
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,709
even in the case anyway a so you can
make it to where it hard to stick around

140
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,220
forever

141
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,550
and finally you can try to you thank you

142
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,970
if your phone sex calling out the China
you can you can

143
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,090
alike users so

144
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:05,380
so then if you want to you can I read
that but it's the same thing that is

145
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,190
with the

146
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,570
that I talk about the things that you as
a user can actually do

147
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,190
verses like we're Apple or Google or
something new so

148
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,750
I on those that like basically you can't
do anything you and you can really

149
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,640
try to do is detect problems so you're
not going to be able to make

150
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,440
Mobile Safari fewer bugs you like and we
all make it harder exactly

151
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,680
and these are all things that you know
the device manufactured can do

152
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,660
but you user I'm so you know it's a

153
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,580
to discuss the show that I'm there's not
much you can

154
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,870
you can really do except %um its
pressure your vendors into

155
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,870
going better sounds

156
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,970
so so let's talk such as I talking about
that

157
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,330
everything I just said with
supercomputers are mobile device

158
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,020
lover let's talk about why mobile
devices actually different beers when it

159
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,650
comes to you

160
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,670
now our application like that so

161
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:05,410
a it the David there is genuine or a
slow start because as the Brazilian

162
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,240
thing that you guys

163
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,810
have seen like two people so it is a
movie from the 80's

164
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,940
as their support it's pretty good

165
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,250
he travels around the world as a

166
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,560
archaeologists clicking things

167
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,550
knowingly it's really about but and like
critical

168
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,100
I so anyway i some back and and you know
when computers were

169
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,990
resorted coming into existence and and
people were saying to get them

170
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,120
there really was no security like
thought about it was like these are

171
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,140
devices that you wanted program in run
code and

172
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,500
yeah it when you could download
something when it was like

173
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,400
when you got something you use Rand

174
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,880
and that was it and there is no there
wasn't even really antivirus and there

175
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,490
was a

176
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,250
there that I wasn't like you know memory
RAM is a saying that it was just very

177
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,450
simple and

178
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,340
and I was a on if you move forward to

179
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:04,360
a you know more recent times in
psychology they see that

180
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,210
a are result I wanna things that changed
a lot right so

181
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,130
so we we at least an idea of what we
wanted from security we weren't

182
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,350
like super good at it but we we we at
least new

183
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,420
a where we want to go so we had things
like

184
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,720
miss security built into the software
development life cycle

185
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,130
we had antivirus course by then and I
was working

186
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,440
you know the sales people tell you it
works very well

187
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,000
in the world of them it's okay on

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,010
and then exploitation have really moved
on to a point where

189
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,190
you didn't see a lot of places and
things like a

190
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,590
you know the you'd

191
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:50,300
so so you may be three years before this
like all the acts with you it you when

192
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,450
you hear my time I would be like

193
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,740
and on you know the web browsers out say
but

194
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,980
those had a gotten significantly harder

195
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,520
recently in this time period to to do
that and saliva explodes

196
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,100
you were seeing at this point we're in
like that by playing like Java class or

197
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,840
something like that

198
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,850
and 1298 that everything had

199
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,980
I is lined up and things like that
wheelies knew what they were and we're

200
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,330
putting them in a lot of products

201
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,270
I'm so we had actually negations even if
the worker

202
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:25,510
that so those going into any idea who he
meant the other day it was released

203
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,190
so well security improved movies

204
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,090
burglars with so is the one that sees it
as a

205
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,530
today as a as they say when you know
what we call smartphones a

206
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,580
you know I was like all smartphone came
out so they had a

207
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,470
on that I guess you got your smile but
for me it was

208
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:49,140
it was when i punti came out and the
Android a phone book came up in 2008 so

209
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,440
if you think about

210
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,730
yeah so how come I'm not by my iphone 1
so I'm an old guy

211
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,370
for you guys might not have have been
around when I for one was out

212
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,880
ivan was like a totally different
creature that happen to you iPhone 1

213
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,430
there was no App Store there was no STK

214
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,270
is was designed to be a basic like a web
browser

215
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,810
and which is cool back then but um

216
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,840
you know when when people would bug
Steve Jobs say I

217
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,250
yeah we really want to download absinthe
up use like now now

218
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,000
what you want to do is you wanna write
web pages that look exactly like taps

219
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,310
and then you can set that what well
after

220
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,540
the year I guess you decided that was
kinda Stephen because it is

221
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,620
and so they changed

222
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,880
when I think you came out that's when a
may include the App Store

223
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,780
and I i should say an eyeful when there
was based on a security

224
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,280
so your web browser and Andrew there was
no

225
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,660
explanation that was very very he
actually

226
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,110
on my iphone to he

227
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,400
the cavalry designed it to make it to
where

228
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,700
you know you could download lapse in
order to do that and protect themselves

229
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,600
at a budget stuff that

230
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,610
on was really to protect their

231
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,040
their app ecosystem but as I back to
make the device a lot more secure

232
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,710
so anyway i so that this is in 2008 went
on schema

233
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,860
and you know I claim that one of the
reasons that

234
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,990
its smartphones as a inherently more
secure than

235
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,020
like your your computer is because the
fact that

236
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,990
when they were developed like we had
learned a lot more about security we

237
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,060
thought about security

238
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,220
you know maybe not as a primary

239
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,760
name but at least we knew about it and
so there were some design that went into

240
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,680
it that made it better

241
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,770
so I ask that wheelies knew that

242
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,910
someone sunday was gonna try to write on
malware and make better

243
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:47,170
bill that into beginning on both these
devices had some

244
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,090
some actually mediations got them from
the beginning and there are you thinking

245
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,760
down the road

246
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,910
at and I'm I think bothers by that is
that

247
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,230
at up me you know

248
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,220
I think they both had on

249
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,430
may be able to get up and I S large to
make that many wait now they

250
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,060
portable that on you can

251
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,490
and for both those devices they were
really ever intended as downloads

252
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,880
opinion and run them

253
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,220
so they're always developed in mind you
know it might be possible

254
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,430
as it was developed in mind where you're
supposed to go to a particular place a

255
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,350
Gap store

256
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,640
down and that this you know these app
serves special in some way

257
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,810
you can download them around them but
you're not with this guy goes around

258
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,390
website

259
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,850
on and every application

260
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,040
is you know has the runs are some sort
of them much though

261
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,860
so they're already thinking about the
many things as well so the totally

262
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,160
different experience than

263
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:51,160
and your typical PC the expectation is
higher in a lot of ways to him

264
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,590
and you know again from these are maybe
accidental or at

265
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,160
companies are arguing over tyre or
something that made it this way but

266
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,910
the end result is that it's the tires so
a

267
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,810
that tax services mall are you don't
have Java running on your

268
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,260
your mobile browser you don't have class
and stuff like that and so

269
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,520
others there is less so that we know how
to

270
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,010
went to look for bugs right experts and
ice at heart

271
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,350
we have an ass alarmed up built into

272
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,700
a you know the phones now and

273
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,850
since the ass on a sandbox you're going
to need more

274
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,330
you most like splits the to get out of
there anyone to get the initial code

275
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,120
execution right million other one to a

276
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,339
whiskey so the wild not

277
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:40,720
I mean obviously since I've done before
it's not possible it's higher

278
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,910
so

279
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,810
up I specifically talk about somehow I
OS and Android are

280
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:53,420
a bill and I will help us figure out why
why it's hard to do these things

281
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,720
and in particular will compare so I was
and Ryan

282
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,290
lie one maybe are using up

283
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,010
me with the this quote I have here is
sort of about

284
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,449
the difference but also did well that it
was a blast

285
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:12,730
the so a Apple as so very

286
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,510
very much once they control everything
on your device on

287
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,580
and serve as a side effect they get
security from that

288
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,800
where who'll want to have a very open
device

289
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,990
and the use the communities are police
themselves

290
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,220
and the you know one maybe isn't better
or worse than the other

291
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,280
but it is different and there design yes

292
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,540
on so the main difference people

293
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,910
is a good sign so

294
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,800
and and of higher than that but anyway
and I left at least

295
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,770
everything so all all binaries all
libraries

296
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,090
had to be signed by some person party
which %uh the box

297
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,000
the only person parties up and you can
add other cuz

298
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,580
ours enterprise you want but

299
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,260
a box everything I said basically the
same

300
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:09,000
on and the sex and even further than
just the things that you

301
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,160
you load and I'm binaries in Lima raise
I K

302
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,280
actually gets the point where every page

303
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,820
a memory has to be signed with a few

304
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,290
caveats but a for the most part every
page ST sign

305
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,380
what this means is that and you have

306
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,840
the actually download they have to come
from the App Store or someplace that

307
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,910
place

308
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,420
a and not only that but when you
download that they can do things that

309
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,630
that they weren't doing not for everyone
says night

310
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,520
where i download something it's going to
be a one way and when you done lately

311
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,220
have a different way

312
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,840
and they can't change what they do and
apply he the static

313
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,340
analyzed them you'll see everything that
they can do making at

314
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,340
making Alki pages right go to it and run
because the whole court thing

315
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,950
on so that means that if you

316
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,980
you could say exploit I

317
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,070
Mobile Safari air are some other program

318
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,350
as I tackle you might wanna download
your tools or whatever to the device and

319
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,380
and run them

320
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,060
well because they're not sign the Napa
that they will be on the run

321
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,970
so you can download year novels to your
phone

322
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,380
actor I owe us expect it so to

323
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,990
to work on and likewise you're not going
to be able to without doing some more

324
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,300
work survive remove

325
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,500
because you won't feel the love any coat
around if you have any good around and

326
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,770
then you try to actually

327
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,280
run it when it backup it would run
business

328
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,880
it has a lot of consequences for

329
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,540
on and so up

330
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,960
so you know at some point you can
imagine

331
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,560
came together some sorta exploits wanna
get code running

332
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,720
and you have maybe a second when the
brakes are the same box

333
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,540
maybe if they're going to get through
you need all that work

334
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,980
we saw nothing will survive a review
because no you kurt is going to be

335
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,140
signed

336
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm so you have to actually do more work
than even that

337
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,250
to the

338
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,250
T is about that yet basically all turn
off because I

339
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,630
he was a battery with an outboard

340
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,050
so you can see like that's that's a lot
of work

341
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,800
so on what about the app so can you
maybe

342
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,980
says as since exploitation soundly hard
maybe we should focus

343
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,169
as an attacker on I'm our a game

344
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:34,240
that people run badass

345
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,300
so the weather protection you after well
if the run is your mobile

346
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,659
they run a sandbox a

347
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,520
or or something like contact the photos
they have to ask the user

348
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,640
permission that we signed the course
making games

349
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,700
so oslo restrictions on what here
happens again we'll do

350
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,919
even if you can get something the App
Store it's gonna be limited and

351
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,960
thing you on

352
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,840
and and so gaming's into the App Store
as have a painting

353
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,800
so you have to have an account and the
App Store and that's gonna cost like 100

354
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,630
bucks

355
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,260
and also they have this thing where you
have to verify who you are

356
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,179
the a credit card and then you also need

357
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:22,590
in some cases you can see this when the

358
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,679
sometimes that you need something else
and they're not really clear on what

359
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,650
that is

360
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,190
I maybe you have to I call them or
something I don't know but

361
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,110
it the the fact that they don't tell you
exactly what you need to their house

362
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,200
officer scary

363
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,730
your attacker and then um once you have
an account you have to upload your app

364
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,030
the binary only you apple and a a chance
to run it

365
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:49,560
and play with it and see if they think
it's malicious II if it passes that goes

366
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,840
into the App Store

367
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,850
and so even at uses a pose as a matter
of their

368
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:00,679
you get to meet the App Store that's the
an hour

369
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:03,929
eventually someone going to figure that
out and when they do

370
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:07,540
Apple of course remove it from the App
Store

371
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,370
an afterthought love you nominee Mitt
which is sorta

372
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,380
you know that's pretty different than
what happens in the winners world so

373
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:19,429
are other PC world if you have I write
some hour and I put out on some random

374
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:20,530
website

375
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:25,550
and people start downloading it a how
it's gonna be there

376
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,380
and I thought I have it some website

377
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,830
and so no one knows for sure but most
people

378
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,610
think that Apple can actually Molly Moo
perhaps from your device

379
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:41,130
only anyone i knows about that but it is
another thing that you have was

380
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,000
basically works as an antivirus for your
phone so it looks all absent for you can

381
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,490
run it

382
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,630
and then it can again asleep

383
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,940
so what really I was an hour as a

384
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,970
well there really is is almost nine
there's been a handful things that

385
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,240
a wall maybe grab your contacts or
something like that

386
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,870
the elderly then any we're on our

387
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:09,000
on so if you wanted to up

388
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,760
you wonder I'm aware that would grab
your address book and set up the same

389
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,560
server

390
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,169
and you're okay with you have to click
OK you can't do that

391
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:22,270
you only something more time again that
you have to build an expert in here at

392
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,370
I but the problem with the is that

393
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,970
you know if you have a exploit for new I
last device

394
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,110
and you build into an apt you have to
give it to Apple to review before

395
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,960
its yes and you know miss you have just
five or six

396
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,050
explicitly around you probably don't
want to do that as you don't want

397
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:44,650
Apple the they probably won't catch it
but if they do a

398
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,929
there you know that I don't like an
expected and urs

399
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:52,800
so back so um

400
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,950
so this is %uh the story about me
encanta estar

401
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,720
I so this is what I had to do to

402
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,070
up to do it and it and it is so that's
that's a real pain

403
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,400
as an attacker so if you've done an
attacker what I'm not

404
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,240
a at the end a ITRI Mina App Store cow

405
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,370
I did that as a hundred bucks I then I

406
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,800
IIIA so that I can make

407
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,220
I wanna make an app that was a I could
do something like this

408
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,470
and so I had to find a a vulnerability
that love me do that so I found upon

409
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,380
ability

410
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,169
that allowed my program to download you
going right that was inside

411
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,380
which you should be on the sat on a Mon
ability

412
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,810
that I wrote a nap that have that

413
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,380
exploit that one really built into it

414
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,659
a blow to the you up a review to Apple

415
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:47,929
this is that was scary right because I'm
giving Apple

416
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:53,060
a information about or a vulnerability
in their system that I don't really want

417
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,550
them to know that

418
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,790
exists or that I know that exists so a

419
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:01,659
I did that it past review

420
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:06,610
so so that that of 1000 maybe the review
process isn't that good

421
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,550
so then I Roco that it would download
and run and unsigned code

422
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,620
and and that work and then like if I was
a bad guy I guess that

423
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,179
some point I could try to make money was
like I don't

424
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:22,470
and I'm not a bad guy but then
eventually they figure it out

425
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,500
a and they removed it from the App Store
an A removed me from

426
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,600
from the they they take away Mac Mac how

427
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,800
so I lost ninety nine dollars from that

428
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,540
with and I'm Dana right so

429
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,679
as an attacker I'm I'm terrible I love
I'm a terrible attacker

430
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,850
as I just lose money so

431
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,890
so it just shows that like yet but i
wanna do the same thing against

432
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,320
you know some desktop computer would've
been a lot easier I would have lost nine

433
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,169
dollars and

434
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:55,480
a satire so if

435
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,340
you know it's again if I'm just
contrasting it to

436
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,460
by WED have you downloaded I'm hour and
run it and you're running

437
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,280
say windows or something that they got
Windows because

438
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,130
other Systems Inc but I have to get you
to download my executors ball

439
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:16,000
I you might have a BMI to bypass that a
big deal

440
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,300
on and one side done that I'm there
forever like I'm never going to go away

441
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,820
I could you ever online anti

442
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,880
on where I last had a that have a cow

443
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,200
unless I'm I'm all I want is like a
contact or something

444
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,220
I'm gonna have to build an exponent

445
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,580
any to bypass the absolutely be
processed

446
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,840
on and then depending on if you're
talking about

447
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,640
exploitation and I have to actually
break because I mean in order to

448
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,710
to persist either way it's the time is a
much harder to

449
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:54,950
to do that really is our I'm it's like

450
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:59,890
so what about Android iOS Android a you
know hard to you

451
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,870
this is a quote about up open societies
are good

452
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,280
on so so

453
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,770
inter has like pretty similar security
the biggest difference is again they

454
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,010
don't have their coats and requirements

455
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,570
they have some cuts are required but
it's not really a

456
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,480
it's not meant it is meant for like
record if that meant

457
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,690
um so

458
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,720
they have some similar restrictions on
the haps

459
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,630
you they run a sandbox the difference is
that and I was

460
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,090
all that happened in the same sandbox up
to a

461
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:38,630
if you include the whole like you have
to group sex things

462
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,610
where and Android all the requirements
that

463
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:47,690
absent me to ask about prime and you
have to agree on a

464
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,320
so up I also the another huge difference
P

465
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,800
because the I have code signing is that
an Android app skin on the new cut and

466
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,370
run them

467
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,960
runtime: and that's okay so you can
imagine ap

468
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,440
that is a you know totally innocent

469
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,310
doesn't do anything bad others a
download code and run it and that could

470
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,750
download sometimes good and sometimes as
bad

471
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,879
Leslie different you can't do that

472
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:17,759
like as you can imagine Co that may be
downloaded exploit

473
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,749
that exploits you know that the brakes
on the same bat or something

474
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:26,080
and Android and then you get you got to
change that

475
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,980
to you as new versions and it matters
I'm what a fucking absence in the Google

476
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,840
Play Store

477
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,549
so again there's this is there's a
chance for

478
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,139
for you know for Google like that and
your malicious ass

479
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:44,590
here on but it's actually a

480
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,639
much easier ABZ through this I main
difference is cheaper

481
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:52,369
twenty-five dollars you can also
register someone anonymously

482
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:55,499
so here is in this picture a John Doe

483
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:59,129
an override that talks about I V you get
these like

484
00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:03,139
temporary credit cards and talked about
and Mike

485
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:06,350
their way phones that using your phone
number two register

486
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,309
it's very easy to get more or less
anonymous accounts on

487
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:14,210
ago place or and then the way that they
do that

488
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:18,009
the check in at the absolute fully
automated so

489
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:22,070
use a system called bouncing the to do
that where an apple they don't

490
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,539
it is a mystery so they actually do you
do

491
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:28,559
I they do

492
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,820
I'll automated announces the Apple as
well

493
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,820
and and people talked about that but
there's also some

494
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,220
some mysterious you know potential and

495
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:44,989
a but that

496
00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:48,269
monkeys yes yeah they have they have

497
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:52,309
humans involved and so there's a there's
always a chance that humans can actually

498
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:52,970
be smart

499
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,119
number but probably not so

500
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:00,259
at Dino and I talk I wrote a paper about
how to bypass bouncer

501
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:03,950
it's pretty easy because its automated
system and you can you value it was

502
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:04,909
doing and

503
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:08,940
it differently you know you're inside a
bouncer

504
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,289
you think ira on but a

505
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:15,340
so if they do you ever catchy though
they can remove your app from

506
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,289
from their store and they can definitely
remotely remove at st. they've done it

507
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:19,769
before

508
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:24,789
I am so so you have a city choices

509
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:28,789
if you enter and win our you can and
just hope the user's

510
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:32,299
David and as you know a lot let you do
things that you want to do

511
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:36,889
on which is probably a pretty good good
bet that they'll be that

512
00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:40,980
so here like a after asked for Kansas up
and the permission that it probably

513
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,720
doesn't need

514
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,379
user says yes and you're gone as an
attack are you

515
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:50,649
you 1 and the other way to do it if you
actually turkey is you don't ask for any

516
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:54,409
missions we have built and sorry gonna
believe they get your router something

517
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:54,730
on

518
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,190
on the phone that then lets you do
things that didn't have permission

519
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,989
that I was a lot higher on

520
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:06,730
so if you want to do the same trick up
getting

521
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,499
I now where onto a Android devices it's
a

522
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:14,309
it easier than I was and you get ideas
by fast bouncer

523
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:19,099
which is again pretty easy on generate
some girl recounts

524
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:23,330
a maybe you don't may be right next play
or maybe just that the user

525
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:27,379
you know hope user clicks yes on

526
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:33,230
and so I have a abused him and so i i
recall mess up the high standards

527
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:38,480
when it comes to a you numbers and and
houses and so this is the chart I came

528
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,009
up with

529
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:42,349
very sophisticated and houses here

530
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:46,450
so up how hard is it to write malware
like this is

531
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:51,639
this is my my takeaway is it pretty easy
he just going if that's not

532
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:55,609
and great attire I it's much harder

533
00:31:55,609 --> 00:32:00,379
so so and it and it took crews the case

534
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:04,099
when you look at how much power again
these numbers are disorder made up but I

535
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:05,529
give me some actual numbers as I

536
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:10,159
on you don't really see I mean attackers
are totally stupid

537
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,159
they're gonna do with what where they
want to do

538
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:16,239
the in there for whatever reason they
want to do it

539
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:20,230
but usually they're not good you
something that's hard on purpose

540
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,389
only guys like me that

541
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:26,609
because we don't really wanna you

542
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:32,089
doing things saw so a so so you so that
you know there's been much more in

543
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:33,849
cynicism our windows has been

544
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:39,629
more and more than i OS it has been
almost no there's some actual numbers

545
00:32:39,629 --> 00:32:43,279
a the

546
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,019
came out Maccabi so this is how much

547
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:50,259
mobile now where there was through

548
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,299
the year so is you can see there's been
there's almost none

549
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:57,269
and so it doesn't while with the last
year then you saw

550
00:32:57,269 --> 00:33:00,899
something like your 40,000

551
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:04,499
uses them our or something and the

552
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:09,480
and the other 13 you around the same
amount this is from a antivirus vendor

553
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,799
and so they always

554
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,889
say way more than there really is so
this is like they would probably tell

555
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:15,950
you there is this many

556
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,490
and you know and windows and making our
side

557
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:23,330
so I read it as it's not that much if
you compare

558
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,429
like winners and if you look at what I a

559
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:29,669
now where they're seeing again this is a
McAfee a

560
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:34,330
almost all videos and read so I was
doesn't even get a mention

561
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:39,179
and and the tighter it's a small doesn't
get a price

562
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,619
the most an hour this is Andrea maybe
that's because that's all they're

563
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:42,869
looking for something

564
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:47,200
probably this is I realistic

565
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,369
on so that malware what about
explication

566
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:54,690
so I you don't see a lotta mobile acts
like

567
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:58,549
either and and there's there's reasons
why so this is the chart

568
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:01,769
that shows I how much

569
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:05,779
people are using their computer's web
browser ever since he's in there

570
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:09,690
mobile web browser the moves are the
blue line there is

571
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:13,950
the as the on the computer's web browser

572
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:18,970
you can see I could still you know it
started back in

573
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,260
the type size in 2009 and

574
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,510
back then I was like I never said is
your computer

575
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,679
and by the and and you know now its at

576
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,040
and the like you know eighty-five
percent or something still

577
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,079
eighty-five percent in traffic is gonna
nappy from mobile only like 15 percent

578
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,889
is going to be for mobile browser and so
if you go to trial writing a mobile

579
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,669
exploit

580
00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:46,409
the ads are like the people visiting
your website are not going to be on

581
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:48,649
mobile devices you not to be like split

582
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:51,980
so make sense if you're a bad guy who
see this I why am I gonna

583
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,490
write a mobile exploit I'm a writer no
actually our web browser

584
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,839
PC on

585
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:02,579
another thing is that most and in real
life

586
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:05,579
most things that are displayed are are
plugins

587
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:11,359
if there's a a graph /a a USMC these I
came out and

588
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,220
what percent to browsers have that
plugin

589
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:19,089
and you can see that the most things
that are being exploited things like

590
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:23,160
class in Java and that and stuff like
that well known these things are even on

591
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,240
a mobile platform

592
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:31,029
so it eliminates times %uh the farm boys
that we see in real life

593
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:34,960
another thing is that up

594
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,750
it's hard if I want to exploit your web
browser it's hard for me to

595
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,880
get you to come to my website and why
would you come to my website

596
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,130
and so wanna tracks that a bad guys do
the paper advertisement on

597
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:51,880
and website you would really go to you
and then they build explained to the

598
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,260
advertisement

599
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,529
but it turns out that it's hard to get
advertisers

600
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:00,710
show up on mobile devices that's why
like every time you visit the webpage

601
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:04,260
on your computer is like at all over the
place Ryanair

602
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,579
on your mobile browser your nose is
usually not peninsula and like that

603
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:11,109
sometimes and this is reflected in this
chart

604
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:16,140
shows a how much cheaper it is to get
advertisements

605
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,660
on a mobile devices because

606
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:24,240
which switzer shows that it's hard to
get these mobile devices to actually

607
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,069
show your at

608
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:28,329
so it's it's cheaper to the to the
advertisers

609
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:31,829
because no one no one sees
advertisements and

610
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:37,339
level so that's that's another thing you
can do is an attacker

611
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:41,589
so up so but but explain to do exist

612
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:45,829
right so so with wanted them the only
well-liked like the

613
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,140
ever really been made public is Joe
break me to come to

614
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,140
3 him and he doesn't let them buy comics

615
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,630
so basically let me tell you how that
worked and then you can see you like why

616
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,700
it was hard

617
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,420
the fact I had said identity it a about
a year before that we would never see

618
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,480
actually

619
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,079
on but I was wrong so they got my mind

620
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,819
everything I say today so a anyway the
way it worked was there was a bug

621
00:37:11,819 --> 00:37:15,460
and the parser and that with you then
the

622
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:20,359
and the web browser and it was them for
name I was that was not only allowed you

623
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:21,930
to override a buffer

624
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,119
allowed you to read about her as well so

625
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,589
it was a memory leak and I memory
corruption on one buck

626
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:32,299
know you're probably going to bobs that
and then

627
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:36,660
the ones he was able to figure out where
he was and crop memory

628
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:42,060
then immediately return I am programming
inside the program because the DUP

629
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,109
a so that he had he had code running and
the web browser

630
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:50,349
that's not enough so then he

631
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:54,259
he knew another vulnerability I in the
kernel

632
00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:57,930
that he exploited from within the return
or and programming

633
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:01,880
payload to turn out good time

634
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,009
2010 up road sign you downloaded Ubuntu
stop and ran it

635
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:09,759
and so this was not an exploit and the
stanza

636
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:14,319
you know it was bad like people visit
the site on purpose I visit that site

637
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:17,950
it was the jailbreak your phone but
obviously if you can jailbreak your

638
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:18,630
phone

639
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,109
they can do anything so this could have
been bad

640
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:26,619
but it was a will show you how hard it
was to do so required

641
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:31,009
a in this case to vulnerabilities
usually right revitalized

642
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:34,299
a required Ryan exploit inside over

643
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:38,180
another act very difficult

644
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:43,759
so up so this is a wrap that up

645
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:47,270
say you everyone actually a dust-up
system there's tons a

646
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:50,819
under them out there got lot supply and

647
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:55,400
on you're gonna have to bypass I
actually mitigation

648
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,440
may be the heaviest tamoxifen on the web
browser like you've been cromer

649
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,779
something is amiss and maps

650
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:04,230
but then you're done you get to be there
forever on the mobile device

651
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:07,230
it's harder because they're probably not
going to be

652
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:11,279
me the average person going to website
is gonna be a dust-up system

653
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:14,849
power like smart access

654
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:18,420
same thing you're gonna buy passes
you're going on your end up at this game

655
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,779
is hamas

656
00:39:19,779 --> 00:39:23,480
you have to base it turned out good sign
in or something I was at least

657
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,710
to persist and really not sure about
that they way said I was in my car

658
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,490
you expectation among the less than this

659
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:35,359
but you might say a Charlie a what about
all the things that

660
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,950
you know that their there's more tax
service on mobile devices because

661
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,680
you have things like you know text
messages that you don't have one

662
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,950
investor

663
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:47,339
you have in a basement attacks and you
have Near Field Communication

664
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:50,880
lotsa things that most and that that PC
dull

665
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,500
so maybe that makes up for niceee

666
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,500
now that matter so I I had a

667
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,759
there's been like to SMS a attacks I can
they go

668
00:40:00,759 --> 00:40:04,609
on never always by researchers never in
real life

669
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:08,579
there's been a few baseband tax nothing
as many rely for that either

670
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:12,190
and back is only a couple researchers
who really know how to do that

671
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,160
I'm not gonna and see again there's been
maybe

672
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,380
theory explains in real life a

673
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,470
I to their explains all written by
researchers not by

674
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:26,500
actual people who were recounted so

675
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,180
so either is more taxers again we
haven't seen attacks

676
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,270
against

677
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,750
I'm so it's not do some more digging
into this to see whether I'm this fall

678
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:41,509
said or not so but you can't really read
that but this is the worst a

679
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:44,690
all the exploit that that we've seen
inside

680
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:48,490
everything as this talk etc all black
hole which is something like

681
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,859
Black Cats use frequently to yet like
browsers

682
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:57,290
a man so you know if these are all TVs
and things like

683
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,470
a you know PF renders our Java

684
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:03,660
or are

685
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,710
no other complications but the point is
not have these explains that are in this

686
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,790
this no one and took it work against
mobile devices they're all for

687
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:15,210
for PCs one must play

688
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,069
well mostly with the exception of a
couple things that working at like

689
00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:18,950
iPhone 1

690
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,640
there are no exploits or mobile device

691
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,290
um you know is very well known operation
or other happened a few years ago

692
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:33,400
that work that was a exploit thing as
web browsers but it was a

693
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,500
against mobile devices were brothers

694
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,650
on what what other mobile us like that
their bed well

695
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:45,569
I mean I've done a few others wanna have
XLR sale

696
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:50,540
you like the year two ago I was the
phone owners live exploits

697
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,549
government not coming I talked about let
I you don't seem

698
00:41:54,549 --> 00:41:58,009
there's really been no cases a malicious

699
00:41:58,009 --> 00:42:01,069
a more mobile I

700
00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:05,809
exploits amor so it's I mean to be
worried about this is

701
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:08,960
to be very paranoid I think

702
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,740
what about in real life like real
attacks it happened you got mine on

703
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,059
that nobody's as much and they're all in
the US that I know about

704
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:20,619
but Mike earlier this year I think New
York Times got hacked

705
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:25,130
on so Facebook got hacked and I much as
I pass on

706
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:29,549
Apple an act buyers of that Act all on
the same attack

707
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:32,579
I and Twitter good to you but we're not
talking about that

708
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:37,009
so up so these are back right so so im

709
00:42:37,009 --> 00:42:40,220
how did the attacker you did today
attacked the you know their mobile

710
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,160
devices

711
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,529
now it was a mobile it was just your
standard it was exploits against web

712
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:48,200
browsers and that stops

713
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,210
so a in real life as far as I know

714
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:55,150
there's never been an attack that's the
traced back to a mobile

715
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,150
I'm export

716
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,799
so so or you know why are we so we're

717
00:43:01,799 --> 00:43:05,720
right is as there's a max I'm I'm trying
to tie is nothing really to worry about

718
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,619
now but are there some things we should
be worried about

719
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:12,920
and Isaiah Bay City problems I wanted

720
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,500
I users are are not so smart and the
other is

721
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,109
in our prime location which is like a
pretty bad this

722
00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:24,400
so the biggest problem with users is not
that they're going to visit

723
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,880
a bad site that they're gonna download
malware which is the problem

724
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:33,670
and dust-up world the problem with it on
phones that there is no these are

725
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:38,240
so up as I you can stop them from doing
that or protecting them would like

726
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:43,290
and we appreciate also uses are gonna do
things like your break their phones

727
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,299
because they want to have you know like
Hello Kitty

728
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:49,529
that stuff or something on

729
00:43:49,529 --> 00:43:53,849
and I'm listening to hear the
translation

730
00:43:53,849 --> 00:43:56,900
um I'm a and I think that you know how

731
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,799
but a the so what happens when you
jailbreak your phone

732
00:44:00,799 --> 00:44:03,940
what time they basically turned up all
the security think this is turning up

733
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,420
some

734
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,670
little bit but it time's up every

735
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:12,099
terms of a much limitations and I was
like to download

736
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:16,730
go from anywhere that's what it's the
Pacific it also the code to download no

737
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,680
longer runs in Samarra

738
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,020
and it might run it through that and the

739
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,040
the code you download now can
dynamically change itself

740
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,230
witty sobil you add more attacks
sommersby anymore code

741
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:33,540
and they can actually break what little
security software

742
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,900
is that are you there

743
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:41,180
so anyway when when you did you ever get
on their good turn up on their security

744
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,420
so again this is this is my last the
user promises and apples

745
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,839
all that people do this

746
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,520
um so yes I you jailbreak your phone you
basically go back to

747
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,099
that's up security or worse

748
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:58,579
so the the biggest issue really and
mobile in my opinion is this

749
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:01,609
this problem up fragmentation

750
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:05,759
the problem is with Android up you don't
as by

751
00:45:05,759 --> 00:45:08,849
phone and and you're done right so up

752
00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:11,849
you by phone within the US

753
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:16,509
it's made by some companies like Samsung
so they physically make the device

754
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:21,069
and then you get your your carrier I
AT&T or whoever you guys have done here

755
00:45:21,069 --> 00:45:25,520
they add software to it because they can

756
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,980
and then Upper School has the has
provided you with times a

757
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,089
occurred in the operation you got the
three parties

758
00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:35,790
involved anytime that there is a problem

759
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,589
and they want to update it all the
parties have to be involved in that

760
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:41,920
process

761
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,049
and and the biggest problem with that is
that to the party's

762
00:45:46,049 --> 00:45:50,259
the manufacture and repair they don't
actually want you to upgrade

763
00:45:50,259 --> 00:45:54,230
they want you to buy me a call so
they're really not motivated

764
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:57,839
to to provide you an update who was the
only one that actually has a

765
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:02,330
interest in you opinion advice and so
yet three people that we get along

766
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:06,349
they don't like each other and they
don't actually want to upgrade

767
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:09,369
and so that's why we don't see upgrades

768
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:12,779
iPhone is a different story Apple
controls everything

769
00:46:12,779 --> 00:46:16,540
very easy to break your phone make it
happen over-the-air

770
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:21,290
and the people people one up

771
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:24,290
so I could hear some numbers are just so
the case

772
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:28,040
for prime locations this is a a graphic
get from Google

773
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:35,040
so the adoption above the new a person's
as they come out

774
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:40,609
a you can see the these lines they don't
go out very fast

775
00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:45,080
so Ice Cream Sandwich which came out a
long time ago as though on this chart

776
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,609
less than 30 percent

777
00:46:46,609 --> 00:46:50,700
use so here's some more numbers on

778
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,810
on Android and house how slow it is to
upgrade

779
00:46:53,810 --> 00:47:00,410
so on the left the the date that the
various versions came out

780
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:03,930
in on the right is the adoption those
versions you can see

781
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,980
that a so for

782
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,410
came out almost a year ago

783
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,650
but is only eight percent adoption I

784
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:18,029
likewise a like 4.0 came out

785
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:23,219
two years ago and you know that and they
were is that why

786
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:28,089
you know 50 percent so 30 percent phones
are

787
00:47:28,089 --> 00:47:34,619
rain and rain are running a virgin more
than two years old

788
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:39,160
I O S it's like a totally different
story so I ask you but very very quickly

789
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,400
the the graph I took a

790
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:48,440
months ago and value guy I seven members
on the next slide

791
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,719
but here so virgin sixty-mile

792
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:56,380
about a year ago and ninety percent
abuses are on

793
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,500
virgin sex when this came out

794
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,900
that's a big difference I and II
southern

795
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,330
the obviously that just came out a you
know two weeks they are something

796
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:12,230
you can see that already

797
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:15,290
over sixty percent users II 7

798
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:18,790
so in two weeks you got thinkers and
people are you upgraded to the new

799
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:19,980
version

800
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:25,650
I'll so that a very different Andrew

801
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:29,540
and you know for the few pieces the
malware that have

802
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:34,099
have involves a exploits the gingerbread
was one that

803
00:48:34,099 --> 00:48:37,790
that allowed you get root as that
affected up to 234

804
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:43,719
Android but it still packed somewhere
between 22 and 33 percent devices

805
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:47,700
even on the socks place two years old

806
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,859
yes we're talking about earlier
jailbreak mean I have three

807
00:48:50,859 --> 00:48:53,890
effects I was that the 433 on

808
00:48:53,890 --> 00:49:00,890
its you know it came out around the same
time and it only takes 3 percent lace

809
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:05,779
so up so it's only you probably believe
my now

810
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:09,430
but that's a problem you probably
believe hopefully that

811
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:14,029
that mobile devices you don't have to
worry too much about

812
00:49:14,029 --> 00:49:18,880
exploitation an hour at this point what
what did things you can do

813
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,430
that you know help protect your device a
year you you really want to do that

814
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:28,739
it's your job to I'm William I guess are
you can't change

815
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:32,829
you know how secure the average system
is that's not that's not under control

816
00:49:32,829 --> 00:49:35,940
you can't change how hard it is to get
them review

817
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:39,750
on you can change the sam i've seen you
can't change

818
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:43,930
up you know that a flying the DUP

819
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:47,730
you can change whether your devices have
hardware encryption more than anything

820
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,839
like that

821
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,369
and you can't really even install
antivirus on phones

822
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:57,500
because %uh the whole fam oxen model
hope this doesn't work

823
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:01,680
you just have to trust the operating
system is gonna do things like that

824
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,859
the beatings you can do are things I can
force Pasco's

825
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:09,299
to help users when they they lose their
homes began forcing the encryption and

826
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:11,020
you can use remote white

827
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,770
amal I'll okay

828
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:19,250
and things like and are you can limit
where the app's can be downloaded from

829
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:22,859
on but again these things are things you
can do but users can still

830
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:29,859
a change you they can they can get
around it if they really wanted

831
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:34,109
lows or so so who are we worried about
what were the attackers we care about

832
00:50:34,109 --> 00:50:38,299
so you got your your teenagers and and
you know

833
00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:42,440
you that are just trying to show off
their friends and they're just

834
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:47,079
doing it for fun so neck is what are
they gonna choose to do

835
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:50,839
well it if your teenager and and you
just wanna impressive runs by

836
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:55,210
I'm in a little but that or something
nothing about them all is it harder

837
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:58,319
and we're gonna pension and PCs reveres

838
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:03,029
fire come I'll and that case a you're
gonna want to try to make money

839
00:51:03,029 --> 00:51:06,380
and you want to do that easily and as
quickly as possible

840
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,109
so again you're gonna you're going to go
up the pieces because it's so much

841
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:13,319
easier and you probably are you got a
buncha codes and around a bit

842
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:18,190
so really if you're smart criminal
you're not going to worry about

843
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:22,869
a mole because it's harder what if your
are like the Chinese government or

844
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:23,569
something

845
00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:27,000
you're going after the president Brazil
a

846
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,410
then and it's certainly a possible

847
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:34,339
right they have a lot of money and they
have very to go target their own after

848
00:51:34,339 --> 00:51:37,520
so nekesa they might like them all but

849
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,640
most people in this room probably I the
target

850
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,469
other or so on if that's the people you
worry about than you probably have

851
00:51:46,469 --> 00:51:50,489
a real fear to story but I'm not worried
about that

852
00:51:50,489 --> 00:51:54,180
on so severe someone who has to decide

853
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,680
how to focus your energy or focus your
money

854
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,040
um what you gonna do about mobile so I
went completely ignore it

855
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,509
but it's probably not worth it to spend
a lot of money because

856
00:52:05,509 --> 00:52:09,210
I guess that your really you're not
gonna see attacks against it

857
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,119
and there's not really any evidence that
there's ever been an attack against that

858
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:12,599
cause

859
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,880
a problem

860
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,349
so what might change in the future use
so like maybe

861
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:22,569
maybe something a change and use on
their mobile will be a problem so what

862
00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:25,259
would have changed for that to happen

863
00:52:25,259 --> 00:52:28,690
like the mobile OS's are gonna get any
any worse

864
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:33,640
right you like I see I I can remove it
are not remove a symptom

865
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,790
but what what's gonna what one might
change though is that

866
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:41,560
might not get easier for mobile attack
to make it harder

867
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,029
the PC attacks so a

868
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:48,150
like this OSX there have been App Store

869
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:51,890
other anymore there's more so much and
brothers already they might be lesser I

870
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:52,940
can't

871
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,029
and so while it's always going to be
very hard to the mobile tax

872
00:52:56,029 --> 00:52:59,500
like and that's something I figure I
commence lead at that time attacks get

873
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,540
up to here

874
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:04,569
then may be fair game for everybody

875
00:53:04,569 --> 00:53:08,869
also I the the Tigers are trying to make
money they need to file the data

876
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:12,480
so if all the data then she ends up on
your phone that eventually the

877
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,920
the bad guys I think about your but for
now that's not

878
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,250
surroundings up up you know I think I'm

879
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:24,430
you know we've also known as researchers
at North Texas and the possible

880
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:30,150
on but but %um in real life we don't see
them

881
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:33,219
and if there's going to be a mobile
attack against a platform

882
00:53:33,219 --> 00:53:36,430
it probably be it and make it easier

883
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:39,489
you might see if I like a super
sophisticated

884
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:42,930
um a attack but

885
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:46,020
not just your normal kinda you know
attack

886
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,319
on attackers ice-t_ will do what's
what's the easiest

887
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:54,960
for them to accomplish their goals and
right now that's not normal

888
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,299
and here's my side resources that
tobacco price a

889
00:53:59,299 --> 00:54:06,299
and at that you have any questions

890
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:14,089
well be around if you have questions
come up to me and we can we can chat

891
00:54:14,089 --> 00:54:15,599
thanks %ah
