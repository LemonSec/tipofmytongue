from all sides agree on something for

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,160

using a few meet the mood but is it
worth think the key

18
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:05,359
was the your

19
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,090

how small my niggas I am that

23
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,640
now I'm and

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,689
the one big story really go actually
invited me to give this keynote here why

25
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,350
the 20 buzzword sitting on a panel on a
different conference

26
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,280
a words I found very stylish and

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,210
I'm when I later learned are do what
would

28
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,880
road and an impressive lineup he
collected here

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,320
I pursued my parents and then I realized
wait a minute

30
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,380
this is why you gave the keynote to me
because he wanted all the other people

31
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,210
to actually talk about their research

32
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,270
in so late I was the least Lawson

33
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,610
I'm so I had to do the keynoter okay

34
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,409
up so I'm what is this about mmm

35
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,890
so a little background

36
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,720
from while being primarily a hacker I

37
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,720
stumbled into a hobby a which is in the
national cyber policy

38
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,720
I'm and so today I would like to

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,069
I'm talk about the political aspect

40
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,709
all all the security research that we
are all doing

41
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:32,300
because this is very often overlooked
and I think it's very important to talk

42
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,940
about

43
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,950
so welcome to my politics

44
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,129
arm this is what's happening around the
world

45
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:44,140
their way when you talk to hackers about
politics and especially fiber politics

46
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,140
I'm with you wouldn't

47
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,239
would you get out there and play well
yeah for politics I'm lead

48
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,349
well that's good you know the hackers
don't care about politics

49
00:02:55,349 --> 00:03:00,489
is what I often hear but then you don't
talk to five people but full disclosure

50
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,900
were no disclosure or no more reeboks
like how is that not a political

51
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,760
discussion

52
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,480
in a hearty is the very major a
political discussion

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,080
rate then some people say well I'm
already voting pirate party or a Green

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,209
Party or whatever the

55
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,590
a term to everything is in your country
I would use a very valid statement if

56
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,140
you also just update your system every
five years

57
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,610
I'm wage you know I'm as an attacker

58
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,709
I would like you to good orbit on on a
different bike that's not really a smart

59
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,610
idea

60
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,370
I'm dan I mean a common thing probably
also for you here in this country

61
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,549
is politicians are empty or corrupt and
so

62
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:44,400
they all suck it Harry Monkey Ball

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,489
base up I'm bed you know I'm

64
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:50,620
just because they suck it doesn't mean
you have to want to

65
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,069
I'm the it's still your life in it still
you know our internet they're playing

66
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:55,519
with

67
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,189
and serve anyone is bored already in
things I can we talk about exploits RT

68
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:01,670
in fact we do you

69
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,209
because this is what this is about arm

70
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:09,519
the last point in being yeah you know
politics or is only for all pet parts

71
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,180
that's why I'm on they did

72
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,239
so I'm if that's the way you look at
politics then congratulations you

73
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,250
already lost

74
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,540
begins I we'll really

75
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,630
a need to take care all there's politics
thing hours up

76
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,020
mean because impact

77
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,290
you know I'm this reality thing is
reality is we're doing tonight comes

78
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:35,660
from

79
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,500
right late every time you have work in
and when it rings and you open the door

80
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,000
where you come from that's reality
everything else is in your computer

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,620
good

82
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,520
I let's talk about lee with wood right
even mean with fiber politics very

83
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,360
I'm them I'm politics comes from the
Greek word

84
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,650
politicos and that means all

85
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,979
we're twirling relating to use it isn't

86
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:06,220
the price that all of us where citizens

87
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,860
well never mind to 12 million that right
now don't have a citizenship in this

88
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,539
world

89
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:14,550
ahead minor details measuring failure

90
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,100
I'm in in when you when you look at
prince balls in politics

91
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,270
I'm you will find great people like
mister Cicero

92
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,970
was considered like D Grandmaster all
politics

93
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,150
and he essentially said there are no
true friends in politics

94
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,340
well if yeah on she said dad

95
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,940
a then that's that's very interesting
because Lee

96
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,509
amongst people like friendship and
friendship is mostly by yielding

97
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:45,120
the you know you're not putting your
will through but you'd like your friend

98
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,460
have to go first in an you know later
your were

99
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:54,729
same time home in in you know if people
are really pushing really hard

100
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:59,530
um against this then apparently politics
is really important to

101
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,090
a lot of people on this point I'm well
then there's the aspect of the

102
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,470
aspect of cyber and honestly

103
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,630
I'm of the opinion that there is only
one person in the world that conveys

104
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,440
labor without looking stupid

105
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,810
and adds mister gibson who invented this
term

106
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,560
I'm anyone else well Britain the matter
of defectors when you talk to

107
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,509
politicians were diplomats

108
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:26,630
you have to say cyber didn't the same
way that the word Heckert got

109
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,400
from in our misused and changed its
meaning

110
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,169
from you know call people like us it to
you

111
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:37,590
are Russian I'm cybercrime people

112
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,180
um who occasionally are also cool

113
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,979
home ok unit and come on like the
Russian bought my

114
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:51,630
our dear are weird the the cloud
computing people want to be interviewed

115
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:57,380
in I'm

116
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,740
them um yet but when you talk to
politicians actually have to use the

117
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,000
terms I would a lot

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,620
I'm it sounds silly but this is what you
have a call for you

119
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,639
youth didn't drink more and then you
know

120
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,870
you can move would is that the problem
in politics

121
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,009
um is mostly dads it so far

122
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:20,870
like this is not a new problem but so
far nobody has really understood

123
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,069
at what it is what would make the the
quality of a good politician

124
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,830
or what makes the quality of good
politics right so

125
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,430
most politicians most diplomats are a

126
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,560
good takers you know do they win
popularity contest

127
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,259
they're not necessarily smart in our its

128
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,630
nice beautiful smart truth two of them

129
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,039
arm and you know a smart is usually not
a quality that gives you both

130
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,660
so own you know they they tend to be
nice and beautiful

131
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,340
I'm or less and even plateau already
asked the question with the nature of

132
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,280
the expertise required in politics is

133
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,590
basically it's not steal in am

134
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,440
which means dead a you things we have
brooms their

135
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,479
didn't do their job but that ap Sydney
lot of consultation

136
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,759
so um this is what i'm advocating

137
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,860
when I'm also advocating is avoid two
months

138
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,009
from and Northbridge Bahama acting when

139
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:28,030
so white playing a we people that are
only there to be

140
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,560
self-important rate because does not

141
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,779
activism is what we call civilization

142
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,750
politics is actually about are how
everyone deals with everyone else

143
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,700
and so um you run into interesting
situations

144
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,000
and them this is do something my mother
told me

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,589
its lead you never know what the fuck it
is good for did you did

146
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,140
so yours a thought experiment imagine
you

147
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,970
your hopes to create something secure
and back to usable

148
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,459
you know like I'm that's a trip to Kenya

149
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:08,130
at home you didn't receive any financial
benefits from it

150
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,899
so far and then you figure out that the
only people that up to you dude

151
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,250
our politicians and the wrong ones

152
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,510
on top of that I'm actually I have a
case

153
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,700
premier was actually only one begins
League when

154
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,540
Obama first got voted into office I got
an email from

155
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,089
American friend I knew and worked with
the government and use like

156
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:35,360
you have blackberry a ride so imagine
you would need to be built release your

157
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,330
BlackBerry Enterprise Server system for
signal the mice

158
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,720
and I sentiment really long email how to
do that theoretically in two weeks later

159
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,880
the news as Omar can keep his Blackberry

160
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,230
would mean certainly he runs my system
architecture

161
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,130
I'm the question is have you made a
mistake

162
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,680
like have you have you help the wrong
people we have yet to be created

163
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,089
a political option a political option
because

164
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:05,260
you know who politicians are not owns
more

165
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm but but they're essentially says
players and

166
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,820
if you think your system word you show
weakness in a system

167
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,630
you out two possible options of deer

168
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,040
moves on their choices it's almost like
you put it not the peas

169
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,089
on their chessboard I'm so

170
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,890
in that respect the the word up spender
and Apax team

171
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:32,089
I'm is pretty much lately Johannes
Kepler Zafar computer security days

172
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,570
because they created options yeah you
can

173
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:42,570
disagree but I have the microphone maybe
ok

174
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,190
poem I mean okay their standards others
that the

175
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,459
like to portray themselves as the deli
near Gunnedah basin

176
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:55,959
and get on stage and whine about dating
arrest when across borders

177
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,630
particular the really don't add too much
work to this

178
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,320
I'm said is enjoying

179
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,560
I'm where what happens the lawn in
Europe I don't know how it is here in

180
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,100
South America for and you often have
people that essentially

181
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,120
a like to you on ethics would

182
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,870
a hacker's supposed to do and what not
I'm on the piano

183
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,019
the more the back to you on that makes
the more than violate them themselves

184
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,399
so we have to do a human rights
activists who

185
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,630
also run companies in cell to the right
model and military

186
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,440
a we have people that bad Microsoft warm

187
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,019
online while actually sitting on a
campus been a problem

188
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,089
I'm we also have people that consider
themselves

189
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:47,690
problems and left-wing activists and
then right myself for it

190
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,910
and sell it I'm yup there's many aspects
to consider

191
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,889
when you think about your ethics as a
hatter idea being a bother people

192
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:59,180
is really non wanted I begins late

193
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,959
this is real life and to all the people
that like to run

194
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,010
on ethics arwood rowly asked them to
shut the fuck

195
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:11,220
up until they live up to their own
standards thank you

196
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,560
now and I'm want the ethical questions
that in the

197
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,740
in the last year's became more and more
problems

198
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,740
is the question I'm you know

199
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,940
shall I sell we're not exploits to you

200
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,209
other parties because potentially they
end up in and all

201
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:32,970
even military's where the aliens were
mmm

202
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,290
Obama I don't know I'm the first
question is is this like selling

203
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,779
weapons now when you look at the
definition of a weapon

204
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:44,870
I'm in the definition of a weapon that
is used in

205
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,209
in international on wall is it's a tool
to damage in other living beings

206
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:52,480
physical or mental capacity to act into
work

207
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,370
where to get now in my own your computer

208
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,740
in your web browser shows different news
than everyone else's web browser does

209
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,550
I'm certainly a limit your mental
capacity to act because I'm just

210
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,470
bullshitting you

211
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,089
in that respect it is relatively clear
in international all that an exploit a

212
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:15,000
button is next week is not you want

213
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,430
now does that change anything about the
a good question

214
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,000
all to sell or not not truly actually

215
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,029
say I do you think it should be illegal

216
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,060
some people do those I'm not doing
anything regulating

217
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,310
exploit uses a good idea maybe maybe not

218
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,600
and an interesting question is a

219
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,329
do you think it's better to me stop to
WikiLeaks were 27 exploit

220
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:45,570
I'm funny enough many hackers think that
leading to WikiLeaks is worse than

221
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,149
something and exported

222
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:50,209
home Wed do you know how to put it best

223
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:53,240
are he actually wrote in a in a blog
post are

224
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,320
do whatever you want trust your gut your
humanly feeling

225
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,600
you're very limited knowledge this is
fucking best afford

226
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,790
sup I'm this is an open question

227
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,870
and your top now ahead

228
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,970
do is the other side you know that the
ethics preaching people

229
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,430
I'm that I didn't call back from the gym
ray

230
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:22,660
to are if you how worked for the York
operations were 40 evil government

231
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,240
it actually doesn't get you into a
hacker hell begins

232
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,589
strictly speaking we're still in
original grassy I'm

233
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:33,470
and your would get you into a hundred
dollars and you fucked up

234
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,990
like let's be honest if you wrote stocks
that you're cool you wrote part

235
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,500
something for sure you're not

236
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,300
that's pretty much all we care about but
I'm

237
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,670
also running my cute couple of I bernard
Morneau

238
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,440
a doesn't make you a political activist
especially not

239
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,720
if your idea is to put them into UC two
min and you're my hand pretty much the

240
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,800
entire door network to the Amazon Cloud

241
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,339
and to Amazon that just parking stupid

242
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,070
I'm unless of course they're all exit
nodes and you do have to be caps

243
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,380
I'm in in which case your dad is a ahead

244
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,410
a I'm I interesting fight mood

245
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:16,019
from and the are the international media
entries on where toward comes from the

246
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,000
history

247
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,519
is in interesting violation to things
that

248
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,540
riding a bike party told me in person
I'm

249
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,630
and you know I just had to notice that
the United States Naval Research

250
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,860
Laboratory

251
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,639
sounds a lot like the German booms
center for feminist art is that weird a

252
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,720
essentially means a communications
statistics

253
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,310
a who happened to be a signal
intelligence part of the secret service

254
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm them you know we can talk about
ethics

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,110
all day long but don't you have work to
do way

256
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:54,040
you know we can we can a damn picture
out but we can still not buy computers

257
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,100
that are secure

258
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,870
no matter how much money we invest in
them and

259
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,230
I with all that first so

260
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,910
I'm the worst approach you can do is a
all talk and no action

261
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,009
um which is

262
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:15,240
they are no action talk only is actually
the probably want me to stand for

263
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,420
I'm so there's also hackers I'm that
dude I'm you know they run big box and

264
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,149
they held

265
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:25,380
because opinions of course lee unless
you're your body of that happened in

266
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,550
you know nobody is gonna public opinion
a and they say well we don't talk to

267
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,759
politicians begins

268
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:34,230
as long as they don't know what we now
dan you know

269
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,380
they come to you you posted on the
internet

270
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,380
a hello I don't they already do it
thoroughly

271
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,209
even if they don't know anything you're
still gonna do it begins like

272
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:44,970
politicians

273
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,089
have to act because otherwise they don't
get reelected

274
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:51,639
or promoted orwell so um

275
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,730
you know that's that AB showcase &
colored eyes and the data demonstrates

276
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,399
that you

277
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,089
that you have the attitude of
considering yourself bob

278
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:04,449
everyone else about this society and in
society is yes

279
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:08,559
it's those people that bring you to pick
it up I'm

280
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,150
I'll if you think that's you like to
all-powerful have good

281
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,260
I'm on I have something that I love to
show you

282
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,900
I'm every time someone who's the better
not to let me on stage

283
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,829
I'm which is this so this is able

284
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,850
exploited this is actually a cool
exploited to be precise a hyper was a

285
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,160
breakout

286
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,330
I'm written for prime because back in
the days people were still manned and

287
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,429
men right export-import run

288
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:40,429
I'm this is the entire wat in stores and

289
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:45,130
this was written by someone from the use
of force in 1972

290
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,340
so review thing your to chant

291
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:55,340
actually a but more like it rated

292
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,110
well sup

293
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,470
I'm how and looking and I would a little
bit more

294
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,539
abstract a banks to murder them

295
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:09,070
hatter's mmm um years this notion all

296
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,570
you can you describe will prescribe and
you can choose

297
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,919
in Ann Arbor Terry Graham rarity so is
Angeline

298
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,350
when you propose an exploit you describe
a problem

299
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:25,289
apparently you also providing approved
by construction but that's completely

300
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:26,669
second problem

301
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:31,429
I'm in not mine

302
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:35,720
um on the other hand if you participate
in back from the program's

303
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,230
and the band were prescribed your hobby

304
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:43,110
your spare time to you in under which
conditions

305
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,130
you word actually pays all I'm it is
your choice

306
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,929
whether the do you do it or not um but
this is the difference between

307
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:55,150
a description in a prescription ride so

308
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,490
when explains the rules the other one
sets the rules

309
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,130
there's also the possibility of that on
over a 50-year are

310
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:08,830
their days forcing a platform I happen
to know when a German who does that

311
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,720
which is produced with words a min I'm
and that's gotten laid

312
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,400
the neutrality a working of it

313
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,480
does that sound mad that Batman no it
isn't happening guess

314
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,890
this is what we can choose from right

315
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,110
so Alltel a

316
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,679
you know if you do defense you don't
have a bigger problems mom

317
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,280
so that the really good motivation to
actually go into different

318
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,280
arm because you don't have the fucking
disgusted

319
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:46,280
why all a bed

320
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,320
why we are concerning ourselves I
wouldn't like that

321
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,070
a the world what a dumb and your arm

322
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,580
um people go like a look I

323
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,380
how evil a I'm now I'm

324
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,909
let the so good mission and this is the
official statement

325
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:12,210
a is to organize the world's information
and make it universally accessible and

326
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,059
useful

327
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:17,620
there yet I'm raise your hand if you
believe that

328
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,210
good yeah it's funny because every time
I look in their annual report

329
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,120
I don't find the point where they
actually make money on information

330
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,299
access

331
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,270
they do make a lot money badly I don't
find a point

332
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,820
with interesting is when you look at the
end as a um

333
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,070
leaks the we're facing recently

334
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,780
arm and I'm come to that end bit more
detail

335
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:45,549
is you will see that I'm essentially in
general alexander who's

336
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:50,770
you have then as they um is quoted with
the Met the strategy

337
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,580
use Google I need to get all the data on

338
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,950
interesting you know own they even
measure themselves

339
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,270
ends in measures its help against Google

340
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:06,850
a by there now really proud to say well
we actually have 50 percent larger

341
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,669
information processing part in Google
has am

342
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:14,320
do you notice something the run the same
thing the

343
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,210
the algorithms primarily MapReduce where
developed by Google they're paid into by

344
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,289
Google

345
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:23,640
in anything in the only one not been
paid the I'm

346
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,140
there you know there's two
infrastructures one run by the N is a

347
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,220
when run by this do no evil corporation

348
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,539
home didn't in I'm everyone things then
is a is the one who goes good

349
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:41,390
you know what Dennis any the results of
all their

350
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:45,539
analytics at the end of the day go to
one guy

351
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:49,500
the black guy in White House Latino to
recipient

352
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,210
rated with Google every idiot can walk
up to them give them money and

353
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,600
impersonating

354
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,250
now I'm you know ahead

355
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,450
years

356
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,989
this gets better and better I'm that you
know

357
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:08,190
would really pisses me off about good
ass hackers

358
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,769
home years by would with the speaker
email from Rodrigo sadly

359
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:17,979
we have a Facebook page and a Twitter
account and hello

360
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:21,659
I'm okay and sell

361
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:25,909
account in my in my inbox I counted over
the last three years

362
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:29,039
the amount of hackers to communicate
with me

363
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,609
um that uses de mayo or as I call them
to email address

364
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:37,179
raised to 11 percent are you fucking
kidding me

365
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:41,159
in I mean the if consumers it's free

366
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,959
you are the product right I'm also known
as the victor in

367
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:49,969
a Google ninety-five percent of all the
income is more information axes

368
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,539
it selling your profile and your hours
pooping

369
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:57,369
$43 billion a year Maybin

370
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:01,159
just maybe you should set up a man so
I'm your own

371
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:04,320
make-ups over move how about that I'm

372
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,919
if you're too lazy to read code if
you're too lazy to set up a vent server

373
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,269
at least reader and your reports and see
how much money they make a few

374
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:16,519
time in case

375
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:23,519
up

376
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,659
in case you're too young and you think
wow

377
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:34,059
now there's magic with wooden you may
own SMTP only good and there aren't

378
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:40,409
am so years how old fart boy the idea
that way when it wouldn't send an email

379
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:41,500
to really go

380
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,169
death is as NDP at that all you need to
do it right

381
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:49,179
it did I'm

382
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:53,519
I'm I'm happy to explain it in more
detail what we're going to do to you

383
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,759
a mounting document called an arson I'm
that actually gives you even more

384
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:58,909
information on this

385
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:02,100
said also PDP mother fuckers

386
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,309
didn't quite different from one of my
key rings and I just

387
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:10,820
counted in which year DP's in the
hearing where

388
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,710
created there are still valid do you
notice something

389
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,750
that's the Facebook time braided

390
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,850
late when everyone's which to base book
and Twitter they forgot about the GB

391
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,590
sent do yourself a favor creditors have
BD BD

392
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,039
published sticky in parking using it
thing here

393
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:36,039
I'm well if you're too stupid to use pgp
there and you better go to

394
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:43,559
get our different are event and as red

395
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,580
I'm in the people say wow oh my god and
as a

396
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,830
reads all my data on who were in place
but you know who helps

397
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,179
everyone else and you know

398
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,929
buying at the end as a people actually
get fired when they do what's called

399
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:58,440
love

400
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,529
Ind so there'd be watching you know the
ex girlfriend and whatsoever

401
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:06,419
and the road from the gym security
officer at Google

402
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:10,620
is nobody does that at our company shore

403
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,700
nobody has ex-girlfriend Google not not
cannot imagine that

404
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,870
am also people growing well

405
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,870
at least my home he is really sick
you're

406
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,870
I'm because I hate Apple a lot so I can
only download the shit that they allow

407
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,559
home

408
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,929
I'm and I cannot have ornament I'm

409
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:32,990
because that even home up

410
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,289
being that you need to understand here
is use the concept in Scopus in

411
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:38,639
colonization

412
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:42,320
so essentially the company doesn't have
to be evil

413
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,799
any company that masses in not control

414
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,929
over devices like your party and
overpriced

415
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:53,429
a computers like my phone and I'm

416
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:57,009
over control mines on the Internet
override the infrastructure

417
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:02,179
in thereby ultimately over people well
actually helps them government entity at

418
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:03,389
some point in time

419
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:06,919
the walkin the give me to act it's good
for me

420
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:11,279
it's interesting guess would present yes
prison is nothing else than using an

421
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,659
existing API

422
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:15,779
in exploiting the fact that everyone

423
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:19,119
is happily bringing all the information
to go home

424
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,360
and so the end as agents goes my state
do our work

425
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,330
why I'm I'm just fuckin go out that the
end is a didn't set up with webmail

426
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,029
in the Dropbox overs because then people
will act a blue da ba should directly to

427
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:33,070
the annotated

428
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,799
men lead United

429
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,980
back in the days we were happy if we had
a internet connection to day late a

430
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,480
virtues over on the internet posted next
to nothing but everyone move their shit

431
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,539
into good glad how stupid is that

432
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,669
and then ahead

433
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:54,679
you know there's a there is the issue
I'm

434
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,970
all the you know I'm questioned the
information you act upon

435
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:03,190
and the information you believe you know
just because greenwald say that moment

436
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,869
said

437
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:07,919
something must be true and that is just
mean

438
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,240
it doesn't really mean you have seen
real documents Ryan

439
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,669
so I'm it probably it's true

440
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:18,350
but what the fuck Lake can we stop
believing shit don't like

441
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:22,919
third-hand read we did to us we are a
key question

442
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:27,230
upon the men who truth that is sold to
us in little pieces and BS

443
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,889
this didn't work with stocks that in I
don't think it works better with and

444
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:31,419
it's a

445
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:34,500
7

446
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,200
meanwhile in this year's award or min a

447
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,049
would we also call from government
politics righted

448
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:45,879
the up

449
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:49,049
what happens here is because nobody has
a clue

450
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:53,429
nobody has a fucking clue like parking
park new I'm because they're too old for

451
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:53,889
sex

452
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:59,690
um the all-encompassing mentary
identification for online services

453
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:05,169
is coming and politicians all around the
world have wet dreams about you

454
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:10,080
having to use your government issue I DM
on your home router in order to get a

455
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,539
party may be addressed

456
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:15,010
induces you up by the actually not funny

457
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,019
they're going that route unfortunately
in its

458
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:21,190
really ashamed to be german because mmm
actually a

459
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,840
yeah a a German company that brings our

460
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,480
passports in our money they're the ones
trying to three others

461
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,850
I'm all over the internet I'm but what
what I ask you to

462
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,700
is keep your eyes open to things like
that when you get new government issue

463
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,090
ID's and your country's

464
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,830
ended suddenly have an electronic
features a

465
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,840
question how this is Bill read the
standards understand weird collection

466
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,779
points are

467
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:51,109
understand who certifies what where you
get the keys in

468
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:55,289
because once the control infrastructure
is in place it's gonna be misused talk

469
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:56,590
to anyone who lived

470
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,679
on the east side of the wall when they
won't they exist

471
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,320
ride third yep we note and

472
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,889

everything exploitable nine-point

473
00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:11,590
didn't walk up to their government
certificate authority and they all come

474
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,679
up with a complaint

475
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,000
and up I'm so their

476

477
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,250
trust me this is Google am young shit

478
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,619
so to give you an example all the the
level

479
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:32,539

483
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:48,580
the countries that Walt like when you
think who will protect our privacy in DP

is on the internet the most

485
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:53,450
the countries that immediately come to
mind China

486
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,609
russia and Tajikistan and Uzbekistan
ride

487
00:29:56,609 --> 00:30:00,320
those are the ones that are really nice
on the internet trading

488
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,889
am so they actually submitted um

489
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:08,570
a a code of conduct that was supposed to
become a United Nations resolution

490
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:12,679
and you know it says things like do not
use ITT's

491
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:17,580
I city including networks to carry out
hostile activities active aggressor

492
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,320
imposed grads international peace
security blah blah blah I'm

493
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,869
from you know do not proliferate
information weapons

494
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:29,690
see they're already talking about
information weapons I'm

495
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:33,129
and related stuff or you know we have to
combine

496
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:37,279
terrorists and activities and sure to
supply chain security

497
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,960
very funny China I'm respect the rights
and freedom of searching

498
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,779
for information very funny China I'm

499
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:50,619
in we establish my time national
transparent and democratic

500
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:53,990
very funny China international
management of the Internet

501
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,179
isn't the word is that as we took over
died you know give the internet without

502
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:58,609
you please

503
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:03,509
and when partisan I'm our stupid
politicians that includes the germans

504
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:06,259
that also includes american politicians

505
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:11,409
were about to think well cool I'm Europe
they promised to no longer had our stuff

506
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:12,549
and you are poor

507
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:16,970
my flying in i'm too old too little
wondering was discovered

508
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:21,929
um actually buy American guidance then
well there's there's disappointed

509
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:26,710
isley occurring and is an and
dissemination of information which

510
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:30,500
undermines the country's political
economic and social stability

511
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,220
as well as spiritual and cultural
environment

512
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,179
what that means is we promised no longer
had you if you delete every YouTube you

513
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:42,539
that we don't like in hand as the gene
outcomes a party but any inference

514
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:46,220
so this is already happening this is
2011

515
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,480
right sewed related pack and when did we
get involved here

516
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,840
yeah no let me finish it gets worse

517
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,049
I'm them didn't mean yes writing

518
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:02,820
at home the Washington DC used a harvard
is

519
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,389
a desire a policy that arm

520
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:10,379
well we just back in you by dp4
addresses I'd if someone attacks as long

521
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:10,830
enough

522
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,389
pool good that not the American Way of
life

523
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:17,460
writing I'm we don't like you

524
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,750
look evolve there's a drone coming for
you so

525
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,859
I'm woman managing to completely change
directions in

526
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:29,000
and wind international arms control for
exploits in bonn abilities

527
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,230
as if they were nukes right so

528
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,750
think about that what they are to you
earn 10

529
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,109
kill in this is it. initiated by
companies by lobbyists

530
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:43,270
what you want to do is they want your
full disclosure

531
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:46,539
so full disclosure came when the what
does it come from

532
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:49,599
because companies didn't fix their wagon
security vulnerabilities

533
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:52,929
so the only way to get them to fix the
Barton security what about these what

534
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:53,889
wants to send em

535
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:57,200
in public this is where food is good
looking from right

536
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,289
so the the problem in you know this

537
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:04,200
really costs money writing patches then
people

538
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,869
cost money because they said incorporate
networks and have to patch although

539
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:12,820
servers all the time they have to patch
already go all the time

540
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,679
a and then again and you know the
install Java and reinstalled alibi

541
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,830
in all that I'm if we

542
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:24,049
if they could say well you know writing
Google

543
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:27,159
writing ability we poured writing an
exploit is

544
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:32,519
really like hobbling let's say Iran
build a new comp

545
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:38,109
add calls would go away that would be
really really good for all the companies

546
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:42,109
from yes involved in secret services
because the benefit is

547
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:45,589
you don't want to have to hunt down the
evil haggadah posted on the internet

548
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:46,019
because

549
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:49,019
everything comfrey dead roads

550
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:52,849
um that I'm a broad international arms
control treaties

551
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:56,970
will be required to address that evil
person that posted the next one ability

552
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,359
in job on for this group

553
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:03,970
I'm that's really weird things are going
already because the

554
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:09,460
you know how much money Apple won't save
in no longer having to issue patches

555
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,629
instill to argue for the Knicks were
small group so-called

556
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:16,779
operating system I'm you're considered
the fallout

557
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:21,260
a you you travel somewhere and you don't
get rejected because a visa issues you

558
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,129
did

559
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:25,659
collected because you had weapons of
mass destruction

560
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:28,669
also called me nice point on your laptop

561
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:34,290
add this is already possible in Germany
we already have that legislation

562
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,409
now the problem is this is all

563
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:41,560
phone sanitizers right so I'm if you say
the word fiber

564
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,830
anywhere in ARCA de noe government are
money pours on you

565
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,980
essentially well you didn't say it loud
enough

566
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,970
in of menongue and you and you and you
have a technical information doubts

567
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:58,779
missed a right said said to give you an
example I

568
00:34:58,779 --> 00:35:02,299
where where politicians and diplomats
gather information from

569
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:06,470
I so depends against anything you will
come from the internet

570
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,950
I is the advisers come from Symantec

571
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:14,000
so essentially it is by more yellow
boxes and we're all secure

572
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,380
lead I'm the the advice on incident
handling

573
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,220
actually comes from HB Gary government
because like who

574
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,369
nope can tell you better how to handle
an incident and the people that watched

575
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:28,040
8 hours

576
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,510
I was texting your goal downloaded all
their emails and put them on the

577
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,160
internet

578
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,930
the advice for network security comes
from academia and shut me up when I'm

579
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,290
drunk I tell you stories that made you

580
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,359
wanna blow up University and

581
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:47,040
but but the crowning touch is used like
this in your government people that

582
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,040
the despite everything suddenly very
senior person from

583
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,029
a European Island that article on to the
United States more less

584
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:59,180
am the explained work

585
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,099
you know and the only thing we need to
do is we need to talk to the four

586
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:04,279
companies that run the Internet

587
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:07,329
and I'm excuse me can you explain

588
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:10,430
new look certainly goes like my hand I
is debated

589
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,240
it clear my kids that makes the
operating system who makes surged

590
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,779
Facebook makes social and semantic make
securing

591
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:22,319
that's the people they do international
policy for you okay

592
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:26,920
the people at hack into other four
networks never participate in those four

593
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,319
so the out to open to people tease or
I'm

594
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:35,770
now the real problem actually when

595
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,890
is we never get what we paid for because
way

596
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:41,960
the the computer in a stream and

597
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,400
drug cartels on the only tomb

598
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,910
big industries in the world that have no
product liability

599
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,920
no matter how much you pay if it shipped
you don't get your money back

600
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,670
it's also the two industries that call
their customers users

601
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:03,670
I'm you have the bottom Mike

602
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,900
now if you happen to join me in this fun

603
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,720
as board of a talking to you to
government and and two more people

604
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,910
you will note is that a.m. you know some
of the

605
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,210
them to produce is we have about
military and police

606
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:28,529
many that they're stupid at turn out to
be often very true

607
00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:31,900
so things you hear from law enforcement
agencies your

608
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,460
but we need yes to catch criminals
course because

609
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,460
some einon's has always helped catching
criminals

610
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,210
there's like no use for statistics
anywhere in the world which remains

611
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:42,720
active

612
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,270
prevented crime or helped pointing more
of the people

613
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:52,410
privacy is less important and security
up what impact they're the same

614
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,920
I'm nobody will have access to data and

615
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,420
of course because like the companies are
gonna make so much money on maintaining

616
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,529
your connection databases

617
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:06,710
that you know they make no money on that
day set up the database and forget about

618
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,569
it

619
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:12,000
the Chinese broke into Google in 2009
and use the N is a interface because it

620
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,359
had no authentication

621
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:19,829
why will that and you know we only ask
for day-to-day disconnect anyway

622
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:23,299
and now so the the military is even
better

623
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:26,599
you know this is this a secret this is
secured some tangible

624
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:30,279
my boring you maxine I'm

625
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:35,049
so politically this is not possible I

626
00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:38,089
in yeah all kindsa said so hidden

627
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:41,279
if you talk to politicians if the other
side feels like an arrogant

628
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:44,589
idiot it most probably is an arrogant
India

629
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:47,680
its Lake you don't eat yellow snow red

630
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,970
if they're arrogant and do mean don't
talk to them talk to the next guy

631
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,440
dribbling elder

632
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,500
you know they're like storm troopers
there they're expendable

633
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,230
ago am and also

634
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:04,420
expect in graded a your did not happy
about you and you can eating them

635
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,819
because if they are not knowing
something they're not doing something is

636
00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:08,990
totally fine

637
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:12,160
if they know about a problem because you
told them

638
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,560
and they're not doing something
violating due diligence so they're

639
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,720
really not happy about you telling them
anything

640
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,190
sup what now what can we do red

641
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:27,599
warm now imagine you go back to go when
Jane shit

642
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,130
and entered to have been akers didn't
realize that

643
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:34,960
I'm on board in only one of them does
recently drowned

644
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,859
I'm in a next to New Zealand

645
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:41,990
which is a big loss and

646
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:45,410
then being Lake this is the real with I

647
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:49,619
layers right berries on top all though
web 2.0

648
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:53,400
do the financial layers and there's the
political leaders and

649
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,819
it's all about you know going to all
mine layers not the whole nine yards

650
00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:01,029
um said what many of us are

651
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:04,140
relatively settled summer yeah families

652
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,270
most of us have jobs a make money in

653
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:11,960
I'm were made a lot of money like will
be good

654
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,170
there my however little bit
responsibility to go without and

655
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:16,740
actually

656
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,220
you know get involved in the higher
layers

657
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,250
the because Liam you know even if we
have kinda figured out how it works

658
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,660
I'm because by a

659
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,119
maintain growth poppin anything in my
mind is that

660
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,489
successive preparate smashed in five
years pile

661
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:37,940
raid I'm in we pay you to do

662
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:42,440
said in politics then at some point I'm
our windows gonna be four and we're back

663
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,910
in with Russian sir

664
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:49,940
I would you do practically writing I'm

665
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:54,560
full disclosure again begins every time
you find them on a goatee

666
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,859
and you publish desirability completely
full disclosure

667
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:02,380
someone's then there is some secret
service %uh military stands there with a

668
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:02,759
weapon

669
00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:05,799
in a button does boo and Don because

670
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:10,660
suddenly desirability dispatched so
every time you publish about TT

671
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,540
you might handed out to less talented
people but you're taking it away

672
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,310
for more talented people I'm beers's

673
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:23,279
research um in a defense sector that
makes a lot of things like doing tests

674
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:26,400
during tests a great couple suck monkey
balls

675
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,890
I'm actually if the if it goes by
captains I feel more touring Testament

676
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:31,509
house

677
00:41:31,509 --> 00:41:35,299
which means either I'm really bad
computer program word you really badly

678
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:36,850
implement Ryan

679
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:41,750
I'm bed you know at some point we have
we have to play in the way

680
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:47,130
to prove that we didn't do something
improve absence is really really hard

681
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,330
so we actually need technology that can
tell whether

682
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:54,600
someone ok made our mobile phone a you
know

683
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,100
exploit the next move my phone or
whether we have to press the button to

684
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,560
do that

685
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,160
this is gonna be important because
otherwise you get arrested for something

686
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,000
someone else did on your device

687
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,910
on your behold also if you design shit
if you design interfaces

688
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:14,210
enduring not you closely following and
watching the ones they

689
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:17,799
Kamal um called um

690
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:21,270
as we call it no parking die in a fire

691
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:24,359
inner like you weren't less

692
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:28,160
I'm another thing if you build
architectures

693
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,369
but the web applications clouds whatever
else

694
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:35,410
warm porn sites in

695
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,819
the only people that need for ID on you
are the people you don't want

696
00:42:39,819 --> 00:42:44,630
to help whole idea view most Alba
relations teams work perfectly well

697
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,970
if you recognize the same person coming
back again no matter if it's cold

698
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:52,830
dick 75 were little affects right

699
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,770
played you don't need government
approved I the four most somethings

700
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:01,489
so don't start when you build the new
web 3.0 whatever penis enlargement fight

701
00:43:01,489 --> 00:43:03,279
you working on

702
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:08,190
don't how be go out all things
especially not the size of my dick

703
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:12,750
I'm in Alton we really really need some

704
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,529
I get the mir back to research
incompetence that actually can recover

705
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:17,890
from compromised

706
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:21,279
you know when your mom's PC start
showing

707
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:25,020
take pictures to her although she really
doesn't like pics

708
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:29,220
I'm of tense I'm band you know you say
well you have a virus

709
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,960
um and and you delete your entire
machine and you we set it up right

710
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,170
now if you have the Chinese and your
call trade as a BU

711
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:43,259
that option doesn't really exist go to
UCF owns a modem I'm gonna

712
00:43:43,259 --> 00:43:46,480
new the entire SAP installation and redo
it

713
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,970
in you know we just resume running the
company in five years

714
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:55,210
so we actually need recoverable he's

715
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,220
all-time driving around in a previous

716
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,580
on TV is really not helping

717
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,480
I'm I'm I'm not saying that because we
figured out remote

718
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,960
attacks on cars by aap I'm in 2003 and
feel it grow up

719
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,910
I'm actually say now begins work just
because the network

720
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:18,000
you're connecting to you I'm has wheels

721
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,069
and you're using the existing services
on the network

722
00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:25,349
really does make your hundred sorry

723
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:30,489
I'm when you look at politics late
elders really take your hats

724
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:35,460
I am politics home years to grow through
three growth politics are

725
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,779
almost as exciting as war importers
dangerous

726
00:44:38,779 --> 00:44:42,380
in were you can only be killed ones but
in politics many times

727
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,330
some familiar ever played counterstrike
so white

728
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:50,460
a it's nothing ok then we already do
with our spare time right

729
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,170
we use with lease you did other people
and then see you you know if we die if

730
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,540
we click a button and then we try again

731
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,200
I'm I mean it doesn't really matter if
you do that in

732
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,440
your local government were Paul
McCartney prancer

733
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,230
so what do you have to lose um in India
it has been said the democrats he is the

734
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:09,869
worst form of government

735
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:13,390
accept all the other forms that we have
tried before

736
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:17,220
so you know it sucks that that's what
we're stuck with

737
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,839
very similar to in the platform

738
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:23,890
I'm said you know a when

739
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:27,310
when haters are speechless the it takes
them

740
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:31,150
reblog post or apartment would oppose a
you know to express their speech

741
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,029
