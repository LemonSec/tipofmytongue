1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:05,100
alright well the thank you so much for
calling at all

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,220
my name is given a and that he did
anything on automated expertise will be

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:09,929
in silence

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,049
crystal I like to think what we go for
agree with %uh here

5
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:18,670
and the holidays to AC a crew for making
it happen thank you very much

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,560
I am sorry my timing but delivery time I
come so

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,060
watching you know to me he takes with
the children times

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,300
We Heart you know some

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,829
Academy research in the past few years
regarding the topic of go to make an

10
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,910
expectation you we've got plenty of very
strong cruel

11
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,059
saying that you're such a problem
tractable

12
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:44,140
that you know him and

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,370
Canada theoretical model involving all

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,440
the protection that he acted a new
operating systems

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,809
the are possible a.m.

16
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:57,750
and you know generator exploded
dramatically he's now

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,010
a reality the goldenthal used to

18
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,199
rudy Gay is the lead and try to read to
me

19
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,500
of automated expertise will fact we had
a

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,619
a released I'll outstanding problems are
you still

21
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,750
often problem that we still need to
resolve not to call you today

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:21,610
and that's what we're talking about
before I'd like to have to make you

23
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,990
good amount of people that I've been
working with in the past that you had to

24
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,500
do with the fact that so many of them

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,610
a told me what I know today I'm

26
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,610
and I probably forgot lot of people but
these are the most important people in

27
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,229
my life

28
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:39,680
knocking at my wife and I keep agreement

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,700
a but no

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,180
all these people so I had to leave the
inspiration for such a challenge that

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,850
said

32
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,140
I'm you to make the expertise with all
times and

33
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:56,990
like to accolades only contributions
what

34
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,420
what you go to me he txt I like to call
it

35
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,619
I no utility to generate you know

36
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,710
streamlined way so automatically Hui

37
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,349
weed out all week few human being to the
ability to generate a computer attack

38
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,660
want to talk about exploits a

39
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,780
eat know there are many the main event
you could make a quick bite but where it

40
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,290
goes

41
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,640
growing to keep a low profile or expose
application-level expert eat

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,800
huge topic both further we thought we
gonna focus on the software Park

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,860
software security loop articular the

44
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,489
all the application level security
memory safety

45
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:43,140
Carol exploit so I'm not talking about
gonna talk about

46
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,940
things that cause i speaking about it
even though you know that the wedding

47
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,700
Jackson

48
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,170
think that even though thanks that's the
backtesting also be very amazing

49
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,030
sometimes

50
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,440
a I'm not going to talk much about that
today

51
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,459
I'm gonna talk about with machine today
either

52
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,080
but it's important just eat writing for
writing's kansai

53
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,569
a hand and say iraqi disapproval a

54
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:13,159
and he's he's who upstate and

55
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,489
have actually worked very hard the last
few years in defining what do we know he

56
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:17,950
will

57
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,640
and in beginner easy

58
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,280
screeching I like to come up with the
the following me in the line

59
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,510
past year the program to perform
runtime: location that escape

60
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,390
the program PCP let

61
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,590
distinguished renew to crossing the
weekend he'll

62
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,970
I'm one he's wearing are

63
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:45,290
quotation actually a violates this
occasion that case we can talk

64
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,870
we can see the week national security
expert on with people to think unique by

65
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,790
the Municipal

66
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,170
and sometimes as well the corporation

67
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,510
you know I'm not intended but they are
the

68
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,340
they are compatible we the specification
on the program this is slightly

69
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:01,819
different

70
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:06,799
a lucky more like a covert execution of
the program recycling program

71
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,810
doing something you know we supposed to
do but there's no

72
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,470
grew up the just something happens on
top

73
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,459
over whether pro-growth n

74
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,250
I believe in the future we gonna we
gonna talk a lot more but we must move

75
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,810
through today we got what we what he
knew who

76
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,270
barry format we got what we must loopy
to

77
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,389
are

78
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,409
such the 29th man to

79
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:35,259
and today I'm going to focus mostly on
you know the

80
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:38,889
exploit part of that so trying to only
thing

81
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:43,620
well we present next week when you look
at the program from this triple for

82
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:50,490
you open them and for today he spoke to
a group

83
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,940
are youth as a matter of fact people
will have to expose my

84
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,360
we've got regulates both mostly using
the group

85
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,419
at the Tesco do you think the United
always we

86
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:07,310
returning to DC now we bring the region
oriented programming after people who

87
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:07,949
with

88
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:12,139
so on a solid designers are designing we
will post them back to

89
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,669
I'm but that's cool everybody who to to
having

90
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:20,289
a n you know this has been

91
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:24,819
major major a attacked a group thing the
last

92
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:30,340
in the last Daniel I want to because we
have all these rudy Gay sentence

93
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,680
getting stronger and stronger such as a
yes there are 8 respected

94
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,469
address space layout randomization and
people who eat more you're watching porn

95
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:41,819
we will meet in Crozet information
disclosures

96
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,779
the no he's a result of the ability of
an attack you

97
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,860
to re called all

98
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,180
remote target for maybe

99
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,699
valuable that process or addresses

100
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,560
or I'll bibles all code so that you can
for example crack

101
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,830
things like Iraq payload redoing it grew
payload

102
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,699
and people usually or the

103
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,090
force people with you because you you
can have lost the title company closures

104
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,099
I know the pact will talk to you about a

105
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:19,150
it started partying things like that we

106
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,029
we had a really a never you are what
information call you can apply

107
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:26,150
you can also force who police enquiries

108
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,539
not like they are we program but you can
generate

109
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:33,469
information closure from are there
rather than for example one can turn it

110
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:35,840
before overflowing to implement an
exposure

111
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,550
we've seen in the past things that we do
need to print that form a track where

112
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,099
you

113
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,229
you'd actually returning to you function
between output some

114
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:48,039
internal program information for you to
use on a second stage exploit into your

115
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,330
weekend oriented programming based on
the guest

116
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,669
I just in more recently maybe like three
years ago

117
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:58,930
people start to come come up with things
like just in time for paragraph

118
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:04,110
and is gonna tag you bathe in fact that
it's possible to generate new coat on

119
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,770
the fly

120
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,000
a and therefore the new code is not the
issue

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,729
randomized address oh you possible to
get the address of the code

122
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:18,599
that you doing on the car then went back
to you although needed information you

123
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,610
provide you any more because you can

124
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,310
who crowd gathered at the mall so that's
another kind of attack

125
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,149
that that people come up with like down
radically from me

126
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:31,839
ronny help relieve a flash and many
others

127
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:38,289
as well I'm when you talk about an
exploit I'm

128
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:41,699
expose some very complicated objects

129
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:46,990
however I'm by the way people are trying
to see who really big pokey

130
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,940
East you too obtain a ride right pinkie
formal right pinkie

131
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,190
just like you think by phone but let you
know being picky to

132
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,899
get the message back you have a general
form where

133
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:02,339
you have a big party person of that that
that means we have a

134
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,509
you return a value and you go to the
reference happening so maybe you'd like

135
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:07,899
to write that the thing will be

136
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:11,099
like baby scaled out with the things
like that

137
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:14,779
I don't feel the pain here but basically

138
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:19,319
a a pretty the people try to achieve by
a police to control

139
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,709
a 33 P sets we know each other

140
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:27,729
educational program the county to we've
got make a sometimes unit is not to

141
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:28,860
control the baby

142
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,310
for some time because we are obsessed
with them to control the value menu the

143
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,029
same time or not at all

144
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:37,490
and the is very important for a quote

145
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,760
a he flow control the babies born 03
March

146
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,069
anymore between that you know somebody
can I tell you right

147
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:48,300
everywhere that Walmart the sometimes
the controlling too far so

148
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,170
so don't think my don't think he's a
lengthy in bed you to control the

149
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,459
baseball writer or the

150
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:57,520
of that with such continually as an
attacking you in a pretty good position

151
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,760
if you get control on you that

152
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,010
know the story because usually you call
tried every way you want them just right

153
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,220
what you will a sometimes you know

154
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,350
really where k you came here

155
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,420
value no a and of course the

156
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,329
if somebody think you know come to talk
with him

157
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:27,220
we'd like to get excellent exposed
mediation

158
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,300
I was talking about a you know have
people

159
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,209
thing we can write or generates both
domestically

160
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:40,390
in fact when they do such thing we
always do he know what we call

161
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,790
restricted model restricted model Easton
Academy think this I

162
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,740
where mitigation that ignored so you can
read from the poor

163
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,959
generators not be buffer overflow
exploit ignoring the fact that you have

164
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,100
quadrupled very

165
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,610
or ignoring the fact that you've got
that a good prevention

166
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,620
and ok with people according

167
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,170
yep sorry I work for myself for many
years but in fact all the credit goes to

168
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:06,550
you

169
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:12,380
the packs to came up with Paige a second
segment on Canada Day

170
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,380
you last 15 years a is

171
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,529
you know also a real pleasure to take
these the fax

172
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:22,089
packs will a security

173
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:26,199
extensions to the cato in the past 15
years I think a

174
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:30,689
I I've been a bit early adapter packed
with people who are you to use

175
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:33,790
you the twins who you you

176
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,890
retiring today so

177
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,939
me making love exposed to the nation
that are supposed to protect a mix

178
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:41,300
between

179
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,470
do pretty good job in practice that you
know

180
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,829
at cuz I Co is more and more capability
then

181
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:51,449
know that key by putting things and then
east on other

182
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:54,819
kathleen has gone way everybody's trying
to cover the other one

183
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:58,050
so we've got the not they take the
action prevention at the stately

184
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,500
organization but people are coming up
with

185
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,910
new mediation ago ones who talk we bury
them bring to you

186
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,589
the final bit more second another one
he's called in primaries statement

187
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:10,630
invasion

188
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:15,150
and I'm gonna talk about you as well

189
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,620
opposite to the receipt models um

190
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,300
I like to call that before multiple to
make it look Asian

191
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,170
a model where in fact your your

192
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,390
Heer grew them actually take into
account all these

193
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,029
protection that you bring to them rise
to you

194
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:36,740
these is of course much much harder
problem and be a

195
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,880
and nobody today in the world have

196
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,850
the car tackle these problems people are
trying but

197
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,959
is clearly another problem today in you
talk with people

198
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:53,170
expert exploration models

199
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,329
Court of integrity and Cooper Point Rd

200
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,829
a he not in musical

201
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:04,360
something that has been will researched
and also implemented in the past

202
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,990
people point to people the very early
implementation of quadrupling Katie that

203
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,790
I know of

204
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:15,589
the was done by by a company called it a
ruler

205
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:19,829
or at the time to call the program
setting a

206
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:23,020
more more work was done by marking the
body to

207
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,100
to formalize the movie gardening way own

208
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,350
plenty of people out are trying t to
come up with a more practical approaches

209
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,370
you go to Pinkberry and

210
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,689
what do I mean by a quarter point mary
I'm

211
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:41,429
Google for integrity rules that if you
have a program

212
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:44,730
grew ever have the control flow graph
recall where

213
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,640
maybe it's not possible to make the
program divert from the

214
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,250
execution for for example you perform to
a

215
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,260
people to only call from can be then
undersea it by

216
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,660
process you've got to be possible for
people to eight people total

217
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,110
similar likewise you can't we possible
for

218
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,380
Fulton be to return from anything as a a

219
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,180
going a cosby in people's a your
relationship you have a corporate

220
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,740
will be will be then the

221
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,100
Avery allowed to to call CEO from

222
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,720
won't be able to be allowed to return to
anything out for example

223
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,079
I'm you also have a strong aversion a
proprietary where we've been a problem

224
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,199
within a function the you will allow

225
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:35,410
I'm example

226
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,209
who great for example that goes from one
job to another without

227
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:43,880
without having to a respecting the
regional flow

228
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,209
even though the from what I so motor the

229
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:52,120
a most of the you know implementation
tractable will go to the one that can

230
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,870
work

231
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,949
with them enough them me more
performance overhead the

232
00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:01,440
the work at the Corporal level which
will people

233
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,550
the consequence that that I'm we don't
we don't really have a quarter-point 18k

234
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,940
that people are working really hard to
get these done you know that in the next

235
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,350
few years with them

236
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,209
and see if I got me the mainstream art

237
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:18,449
in the cortical into that ease that if
somebody will

238
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:21,870
for example want to you are to erase the
function pointer

239
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,220
in 2.2 cue we're ok payload

240
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,899
a or even if the am over right we can
address you gonna be hard to BK

241
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:35,129
protection a real place maybe even
hardly supported protection

242
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:39,500
to actually you know and forth strict
conditions on the phone for all

243
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,290
program this is going to be a big
problem points for trying to

244
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:51,110
another a another mediation

245
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,110
that mack pinnacle just lemme guy in
myself a

246
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,290
come up with to you and

247
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,579
also inspired by many other people
search

248
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:05,759
eat something cool a I DR if you moved
from whether the space we can do

249
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,529
anything

250
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:11,209
the core idea I Dr leave the fact that

251
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:14,230
we need to have a renovation to we the
models

252
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,040
with kato between models so when we say
a cell tower

253
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,540
you think Oh I'm going to end the mines
the base addresses all

254
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,259
or allows for example the library that
are being loaded

255
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:30,810
and but mean that you have one
information disclosure we will be small

256
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,110
then be the means to do so what is the
actual address

257
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,810
the model you going to be able to
predict a

258
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,519
the address on oh yeah it's a vote
instruction that you might want to Euro

259
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,560
payload week in that model

260
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,759
because he's gonna probably between that
more information grocery the game over

261
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,040
put that thing for you to know the ideal

262
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,220
I DR to check some kind of random ass
we've been a model for example between

263
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,810
cultural

264
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,389
I'm you prove that if you have any
information disclosure

265
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:05,550
that is targeted to a specific function
you have no idea about the exact address

266
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,720
or some other function within that model
so that we can

267
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,220
at some padding at runtime in the
function and the padding depends on some

268
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,430
you know %uh random parameter that you
choose accurate patient I for example

269
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:24,410
and we have been you know they are they
are prototypes above these protection

270
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,250
already even though again passing

271
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,410
PB the mainstream market

272
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,850
people have been working on that really
hard to make it happen to make we're

273
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,220
going to cause a heart again

274
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,290
you know the word you know if you see
this guy

275
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:47,120
the reitman Party City school you over
don't worry about it

276
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,790
week you anyway

277
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,899
which would you trust nobody

278
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:57,149
and I know a you know

279
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,199
wheels protecting become extremely hard

280
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:04,669
to generate it's already very high with
APA style

281
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:08,129
but we CA by Italy ID or

282
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:11,270
becoming another new level of up %uh

283
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,379
you know silence

284
00:17:14,379 --> 00:17:18,339
however I'm we I'm

285
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:23,290
we have a few tools I'm we worked on a
few different tools and I'm going to put

286
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:23,760
in some

287
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,169
them and I'm going to do some maybe new
way the pool about this problem

288
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:32,550
no that can help a

289
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,120
offensive researchers akers to

290
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,889
stocking up how you can actually buy
other things and the kind of new

291
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:41,350
technique the pic botha

292
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,669
the going to show up that already
existing

293
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:49,399
by that we're going to become mainstream
the next three to five years

294
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:54,340
what came up schools I do people a do
people use today to you

295
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,530
to do the durability

296
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,040
automation or announced that the movie
with you you

297
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,300
you like some some people use compile

298
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,158
the mediator 30 cool

299
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:13,560
he's a girl a dad it is very important
even the people

300
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,770
I'm the up to have a little bit that's
okay you without

301
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:21,840
to thing that's why this is a real great

302
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,080
like that we thank you

303
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,330
people you compile a list will suit
transformation

304
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,550
babies I so that the two for

305
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:37,040
begin to do use I'm what the program
does all the cooking for some check from

306
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,730
the program

307
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:43,240
by directly you know motif I know how
the compiler

308
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,919
you I'm this mean that you can write
checks

309
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,030
know that are going to be gonna
assertion that are going to take your

310
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,700
own time

311
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,820
or you can look at a situation that our
giving you feedback on some articulate

312
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,490
your permission impact that be some
other tools

313
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:01,179
I'm and will for example processes

314
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:05,090
a spender a I had done some

315
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,740
summit with word that I i'm and the
people what do you understand the law on

316
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,480
on on will to pay through accessories
compiler

317
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,629
compare transformational you like some
teeth always

318
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:20,850
a SMT solvers a talk about it will be

319
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,960
to not too long because I could buy the
whole day

320
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,690
talking about that but SMT solvers
having a really popular to

321
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,379
the past few years you too 3 compassion
power

322
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:36,659
all we see that rule I think it's a
little different resolve some problem

323
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:40,030
not every problem but some problem can
actually be

324
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,560
a result you move

325
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:48,010
and model checkers model checkers even
know they can afford to

326
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,389
for Whitney that relies upon a
state-space

327
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:54,929
exploration so faith faith rule

328
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:58,929
you know when you say if they have a
program moon all the value of the viable

329
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:00,629
about up a program

330
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:04,040
so you got it a huge IRA I'll all

331
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,659
you know it memory card called me that
condition between that memory caulking

332
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:12,090
all you know memory model

333
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,399
I'm and and I think the but the thing
about you

334
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:19,559
at the buffet %uh these program

335
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,110
most likely realize a on X making

336
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,510
the state's Basin explicit weeks will

337
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,970
a very very memory

338
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:35,730
a considerable I doesn't case only well
usually because you got it

339
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,870
go there or space based on the program
they face for buried out programs such

340
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,379
as operating system

341
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:46,780
any extremely large group at the start
implantable to be made to 43

342
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:52,190
so people in her we will try to into
dudes who came up to

343
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,730
for example seem like the people people
have worked

344
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,120
are things like a a.g.o like

345
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:06,120
something that they called me and Liza

346
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,360
it so these came up to us out by the
clear smart

347
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,360
a mark father's that contract will
formation that gone on with their you

348
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,120
eighty

349
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,399
value viable but also the symbolic value
about

350
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:25,129
for example you can we find a domain for
viable that he's not

351
00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:28,230
in the program that the teeth in america
level the mall

352
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:33,210
where you track a only use our own rooms
or only North

353
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:37,550
with the people in selecting to grow you
that but I will actually use in control

354
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:41,300
you gotta be you know what I can make
that be call you battle said oh yeah

355
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,820
this is painted oh it's not

356
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,119
people the is gonna have loopholes

357
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,520
on the bubble in because I will not
differ from other top-level violent

358
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,010
crime is a potent

359
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,250
with very very the revivals

360
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,800
the within the program operating system

361
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,240
anything you've got other things
emulators people wouldn't write you

362
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,089
later

363
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:06,129
you be so kind and knowledge that
box/boxes pretty good you

364
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:10,359
any later and and also of trying to
break a tie

365
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,580
a Cano from I was the age-related at
work

366
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,389
we an abstract immoral though the
abstract from the whole program

367
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:23,659
and create a spade a spade that he
abstract or nearly

368
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:28,429
retain loop article a property that the
program that matters for the party for

369
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:32,050
you know think you want to check nikka
I'm it has been

370
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,649
I need by at because though will call a
massive failure in Paris

371
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:40,070
for thirty years already more than that

372
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:44,159
getting old anyway all these two groups
out to

373
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,800
corrupted ruled that people are gonna
try of stock will be used for

374
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,020
exploration

375
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,820
no their religion obvious in I are going
to have a %uh beyond bigger role in the

376
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,440
future

377
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,800
if the white one such one such to SMT

378
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,290
Saugus a very and so just not so

379
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:06,659
I think lou that society people you know
series

380
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:10,480
with that we'll see that you have a four
wheeler you have a naughty

381
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,480
all-america pathology for me usually

382
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,560
and you try to give a value of via both
for weekly for me know it's true

383
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:24,240
the said a valuable believe the formulas
to use also called the mall

384
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,220
when I talk about him although whole
forming a true you know the value of the

385
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,339
Bible

386
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:33,310
legal lovely reliable so they can only
be 2004

387
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:37,210
where they are way to encode convicting
you will need to complete with people

388
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:37,540
who

389
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,389
you can do input/output XP than that

390
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:45,330
each other than we very quickly theory
for example

391
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,040
to example that the Eve the police to
add Aquino

392
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,540
you have I am you have a an example

393
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,169
you know bebu or equal to a and a

394
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:59,619
for a week or two be this is a
certifiable

395
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:02,730
former while you're at it battle BK

396
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:07,099
in the case able to be then the formula
is true

397
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:10,550
right both both constraints are possible

398
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,859
at the same time in the second example

399
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:18,429
he said an example very simple both of
both former

400
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:21,760
for that when you say a few NB to

401
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,330
and also ANP is not true

402
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,040
this is clearly in 35 all good ace 2 nd
through than

403
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,080
a NB you so EQ

404
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,460
if you have such a formula you know if
infanticide for example

405
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,040
you and I analyzing a program a

406
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,790
a you try to find hi people and collect
all the great occasion or

407
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:47,760
other even powerful collect them as you
go you're either program

408
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,830
any you come to call a bill thing

409
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,929
any party tonight and we thought we had
you 0

410
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:56,980
thanks I will improve the path with
people always not

411
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,990
seidl okay that's cool people because
people

412
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,960
with no an example or some people over
you

413
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,990
3 that might not be searched the

414
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:12,559
you he a he's on it the most people saw
this today

415
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,510
if the very powerful over a an

416
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,030
the reason why so powerful it because
the fact that new theory

417
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,110
that where the more mobile you call
probable that

418
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,760
2005b over two weeks you can add

419
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,360
new waiver or regal about four minutes

420
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,559
for example you can add are at home you
cannot be directed

421
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:39,270
so if not just you know julia Ann

422
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:43,970
thing the roulette with that though we
also woody informers out together

423
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:49,179
he thought so it's also a very powerful
tool 2003 we've about programs and

424
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:50,270
people in general

425
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,100
there is a very nice very nice %um

426
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,800
on I'm online site where you can't I'm
be tried people without

427
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,190
and I'm having a open good

428
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:06,790
with ample a very PeopleSmart example
insisted example

429
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:10,600
the following a when you have a
c:\program

430
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,240
a from the net a you just don't nothing
Ruth Willie

431
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,080
just the see small group and then read
who were on our way

432
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,890
grateful to way the way they gonna be
translate well to

433
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,179
star formula it and people mad at you by

434
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:30,130
he by Ruth pullover hoodie super

435
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:37,130
got be the

436
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,169
and then lucky all that piece of code
being

437
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:45,530
Cody the weather you'll

438
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:49,280
like

439
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,860
I'm what the first time in a movie

440
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,409
0 EC so you got it is israel's
participation which will

441
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:01,909
fact you should you should quit you know
the $30,000

442
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:05,340
lubrication raise no equal or be here if
the nucleation

443
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,900
logical implication because if you want
to be your equal

444
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,230
you gotta with people with the other
side with them gonna

445
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,049
into the Spurs a third mean

446
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:20,110
0 EC ease be going

447
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:24,309
equal to 10 then rate equal to 2

448
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,880
okay he doesn't say that this is true

449
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,280
say a relationship between the viable
the program right

450
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:39,070
it will oval you know I you for because
I translated is programmed to the center

451
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,909
for Middle Earth

452
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:43,000
I'm I can actually say all

453
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,700
you see is the leak was impaired then I
know that raise gonna be too

454
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,710
always away and lucy's mother in pain I
know that we're going you're

455
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,799
and the third one is like a check

456
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:58,330
let's say you know at the end of the
phone can I wanna check if it's possible

457
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:04,080
that rate equal one what are the values
are viable for which is possible

458
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,220
to have a ready for one you know these
constraints right so you we model the

459
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,750
PRU anything for middle-earth

460
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,900
and we have so much adding to our
solutions we want to check in a program

461
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,100
that will militate in the program we
will my one saying that

462
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,700
amra never accessed out a parent or
whatever I'll decide on a ballot

463
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,210
never 0 a all appointees I was validated
before

464
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:29,730
the reference to think like that %um
foods as well

465
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,120
a lot to to photo/the other

466
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,710
other soldier checks tactic they don't
know yet

467
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,909
the thirty people only not even more
youth

468
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:45,809
35 about and get model he's giving is a
valuable so we see through

469
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:49,280
E it is true net pay the result gonna be

470
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,450
yep back that is true all these

471
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:56,760
old collegians can beat you at the same
time and Louise Commission

472
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,360
in the truth in time get model as me
okay

473
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,600
when sequel or getting ready for war
then

474
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,679
everything is fine you know a rare all
these assertions are

475
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,220
operable the same time I'm so let me see

476
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:18,220
I can actually I'm on

477
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:26,179
I'm who believe maximum beyond you

478
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,679
alright so if you go to rifle da Costa
30 you can this be

479
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:35,679
the point right I'm not coming king you
can't do that

480
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,010
on I'm a

481
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:46,429
1

482
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:53,120
home do I would be able to show you that
you've got a small bottle and that

483
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,789
actually only four minutes for you and
you tomorrow and

484
00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:03,789
I'm year

485
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:15,270
doesn't even know her you both you know
who with them

486
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,610
al-qaida

487
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,130
hope you'll a okay so

488
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:26,330
you've got you've got you know the thing
when you click on OK

489
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:29,500
I leak under real play button

490
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,900
any you tomorrow for the format for
example if they are going to have

491
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,160
rate equal to at a rate equal warning my
you know

492
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,930
a ice fishing tackle I do think I think
okay

493
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:44,590
even either model for Wii you know all
these problems on through

494
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,920
at its finest and I were critical to II

495
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,270
became and yeah I see all now you know
you

496
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,810
equal time rate call to and give me one
mold

497
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:58,450
doesn't mean halal war all week

498
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:02,720
with or without possibly to all
altogether are you

499
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,590
such a thing on for too long before the
wheel a

500
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,970
you the a eat the very will

501
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:15,660
a growth when the when you have so much
to obviously I did you done

502
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,430
W you know that you get all the way to
you tomorrow

503
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:25,410
but I think the 32 very nice way are we
thinking whether logically programs

504
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,160
without

505
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,490
if they're slowly

506
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:33,190
so I had 48 causing Hui

507
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:36,200
96 the RAM all noted to

508
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,610
in order to analyze 40 with longer code

509
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:43,290
he takes about 10 hours of Temple and

510
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:48,320
and you if you want to add law firms as
I had which means propagating from

511
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,250
state between on okay took me about 20
hours

512
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,440
sowie though Heathrow

513
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,060
but he set up to very is much slower
than a compiler court

514
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,970
I don't

515
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:08,890
oh yeah oh yeah you know it like I had a
record baby round cake you know I don't

516
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,110
buy now that's when I go to sleep and
then in the morning I'm like well and I

517
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,800
admire

518
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:19,800
purple oh that too few days to the
anything

519
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,129
I'm

520
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:42,350
okay a the tool that I've been working a
lot when I was at my

521
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:47,450
so a I let myself when you go through I
don't work a little more but I welcome

522
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:53,029
four years and and and used to call have
a look at the very 540 asleep at those

523
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:53,700
programs

524
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,230
its for a call back from the way it
works it translates to particulate

525
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,950
multimedia presentations

526
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:03,629
reached then translate to the former to
the S&P 500

527
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:08,519
I just so and and then D three gives you
you know who who

528
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,159
models which will let you know if you
wanna Jerry Liu for example

529
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,940
to to to reach you at church and then
anything

530
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,100
so they can actually help you do that
and

531
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,830
we found that mother hundred-degree
velvety that with the

532
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,960
will we do it in a car opened its power
as well as we were that the case will go

533
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,409
many people probably check the three or
four months ago I presented in Article

534
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:33,909
II

535
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:38,269
Oakland will like this your privacy
conference will will call please go over

536
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:39,049
them

537
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:43,090
you do me because howard's practical

538
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,320
reactive security audit you look
stunning but check with

539
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,759
that describe the whole experiment on 15
pages a

540
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,470
if you want to take a look please do I'm
not gonna do that right now

541
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,080
because we lack of time before the party
so different today but

542
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,169
that was certainly nice experiment to
see what people what up before I go

543
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:03,100
forward you have any question on that

544
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,490
no

545
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:11,079
I'm sure we'll late so so we gonna go

546
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:14,159
or a okay so

547
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,389
the problem all Sat solvers SMT solvers
a

548
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:23,349
you the fact that the model very
deterministic

549
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:27,010
a deterministic behavior

550
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,290
program is not possible using only

551
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:33,609
very hard thought natural to out to be
model

552
00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:37,750
known deterministic me a visa programs
using anything to solve

553
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,300
an example of nondeterministic

554
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,629
behavioral program he the he

555
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:48,849
especially blue presence upkeep anything
a

556
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:52,889
lost Windows 8 who someone you hate me
i've seen that

557
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:56,679
you gotta move even a mediation tactics
example except

558
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,369
sub-segment and movies and things like
that where you've got a certain you

559
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:01,049
pregnant

560
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:04,520
and you say oh yeah thats think mckee's
eighty percent

561
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,250
cool then automatically I'm going to
appear in a segment on a subsequent

562
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,869
instead of trying to cool

563
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:13,690
to feel as much as I can and I think
when by doing that

564
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:18,510
you ensure that an attacker does not
have the ability to hunt for some time

565
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,170
to have to be

566
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:22,190
feel an entire segment and sub-segment

567
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,420
the heat which you you see more ability
to add to be aligned itself properly to

568
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:26,900
get

569
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,040
cell phone from point A to be raised for
people be the you both know

570
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,910
of something like that so because you
have these no deterministic behavior of

571
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,829
the heap

572
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:40,150
sometimes you have to cases like that
all

573
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:45,150
no in even without thanking people went
I'm ninety percent of the case you know

574
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,849
I would have stayed gone a statement
that he beauty doll first-term

575
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:52,460
and then second Champions to churn a.m.

576
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,829
know that a just a warning 28 coup and

577
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:58,950
side with 123 and I some cool

578
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,130
you people keep everybody we we can only
stay

579
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,130
and a collar on below let him play with
Colin

580
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,980
he won't be all Morris was born

581
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,589
some KB but I had the chance to live
like that

582
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:17,130
we some other katie is because you know
them out ok of weed or whatever quality

583
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:17,549
thing

584
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:21,780
operations didn't happen if a motor a
when you want how do you think that

585
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,520
a so if you had they

586
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,630
a and the focal point in time number two

587
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:32,180
to a rave and you also want him some
time alone

588
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,339
in the second gate waiting ten percent
of the KV

589
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:38,660
you have different alignment then use
but he's not going to work because you

590
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,049
got erased in three

591
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:43,880
and then began only Tennessee of the
heap you explode is going to be an

592
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,480
unreliable for this is the kind of
program that I think he thought was a

593
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,640
pretty cool with that

594
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,650
a eating disorders are not enough to
resolve it

595
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,780
an idea a

596
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,940
easy to use room what probabilistic
modeling

597
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:03,299
of programs a you have something that
Markov chain rule 32

598
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:08,099
are the idea the core aber market for
home across the seas

599
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:11,549
America network general me that my

600
00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:14,960
look very random charity for

601
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,920
to you at the program from very near UCF
answer ID will let you know this that's

602
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,160
random you know like there is no pattern
in there is no structuring

603
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,799
but if you look from the back you think
that back then you start to see some

604
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:29,140
kind of structure

605
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,310
even though you know he's not
deterministic structure

606
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:36,319
you can have no need to Mystic struck
you have a program so

607
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:39,520
a let's talk about that with this give
you an example

608
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,990
I'm you know I had given up two states

609
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:47,990
the you have you have stable state to
have the ps3 chance and I will be from

610
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,049
the way for each state

611
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:53,520
and and you have to in the nation for
example a new he prima ke you see the

612
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,369
key in a manner

613
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:57,940
happens and if we happen to think that
bad which Wildey

614
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,950
so state will with a certain probability

615
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:05,819
so let's start by I whatever state as
for all we know that he's probably

616
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:09,650
your ignore all goes to a few in the
republic in Europe won't go two and

617
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,250
three

618
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,680
and then you got another hebrew TV-movie

619
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,170
you to be named goes to another state or
not I'm if possible to actually compute

620
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,220
is a multi-step probability or

621
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:27,250
a a stately to believe he say I say all
what is my property are reaching state

622
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,500
for because I know state with an
exportable

623
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:34,089
I competed problem the I say the crowd
will therefore be no

624
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:38,650
the very first time I'm the probability
overreaching yes for prom

625
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,109
s1 Eve the property or base for

626
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:45,410
reaching be a reach promise to knowing
as to which will

627
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:49,109
like coming from to multiplied by the
probability

628
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:52,839
all reaching into coming from s1 and

629
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:56,430
in that case just one path to reach at
four so that the only probably p

630
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:59,430
you have computer which will you think
I'm here and I'm

631
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:03,920
with you about 55 difference in some
regions party with

632
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,359
you have say a fight you know that 85
you know is another 80 2003

633
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,369
of course he in 30 different the
differently tho

634
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:16,060
be premature you gotta do differently
really so

635
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,799
my local free even all the evil reason
that I deeper not a 3GS

636
00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:23,589
espy when you have to do you need to
reach its full

637
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:28,619
example you can do isolated as to if I O
U H 1835

638
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:32,030
what is the probability overreaching
espy permits for

639
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:36,140
we can compete again only probably kill
which will probably be the probability

640
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,299
of a BTL

641
00:39:37,299 --> 00:39:40,480
85 knowing if you time the property

642
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,010
I'll a to the from Aswan

643
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,400
and you also have another that you have
the right number

644
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,609
youth you gotta add the probability this
time

645
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:53,940
I'm 80 is the probability of his five
eager from

646
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:58,000
it three times probably give a
three-term the I'm

647
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,030
time the property other three knowing or
for

648
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,299
a but you do much producing operation
you 9.0

649
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:08,400
time 04 plus with the united by

650
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,829
50 when the I this all together

651
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:15,599
you want 45 by which he 45 percent

652
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,030
so if you had the choice if you had to
explode and you were trying to maximize

653
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,020
the probability original mix potable
heat state

654
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,530
you know that you've got to be the
better for you to try to eat before

655
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,920
even though you know you've got more
have to be justified in fact the

656
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,099
the property ok taking the past that
reach

657
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:37,470
s for he be here then the problem he

658
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:40,960
or you executing a pact that we
testified

659
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,310
and by probably I mean you know the
amount of the input the counter the

660
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,690
combination agreement with the car are
you

661
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:50,859
allow you to eat better that if a the
you might have a couple

662
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:56,460
a 50-44 out to 54 you can call me
nationhood on the program

663
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,480
that allows you to eat at four why do
you only have

664
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,640
45 combination that beat I

665
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,010
if I Emanuel that you have on in
combination in that case

666
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,369
so needs to get everything we need to
put into the

667
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:16,040
into work now to be able to work with
exploding on it and we'll see

668
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,540
we do have tools to do that yet

669
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,849
but very simple I'm

670
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:26,640
this is questionable whether such a dick
we can be purely that

671
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,910
he's very very hard to do for is getting
out

672
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:33,900
keeping these models will appear static
Manning

673
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,660
you can do you can around the program in
a burger instrument

674
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,210
he proved he and gather information

675
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:45,540
on you know the status take on the
correlation between woohoo

676
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,140
an execution of the primitive
unreachable it either party you

677
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,140
you can do that a and then

678
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:58,060
depending on your monetary sampling you
can choose the probabilistic

679
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,670
a you know who put that gonna

680
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,369
who each apart with the reason most

681
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:09,529
the we haven't resolved today there is
no gary told to do that but

682
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:12,230
I believe it's something that people
either working or not in the next few

683
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,279
years ago

684
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:18,410
alright a this is the last article

685
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:25,410
home comes from home on from you have
left

686
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,699
I'm not here ok

687
00:42:30,699 --> 00:42:34,019
I'm are am gonna go forward and then

688
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:37,859
if I don't have enough time to let you
know 'cause I importantly Inc

689
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:41,659
time so are committed to set up time t

690
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:45,130
that I believe are describing very
important problems

691
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:50,049
for the problem people for the you know
going to get with the program times

692
00:42:50,049 --> 00:42:56,729
and we'll talk about the evening we we
speak us out on the food marv Levy said

693
00:42:56,729 --> 00:42:58,259
we want to take into account

694
00:42:58,259 --> 00:43:03,729
those those will be able a we've got
some weeeeeed workers abortion heeey

695
00:43:03,729 --> 00:43:07,449
creating a master the teeth on on
restricting model

696
00:43:07,449 --> 00:43:11,799
go to make a point exploration we want
the drama at Carnegie Mellon

697
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:15,650
here at work to Syria paperback today to

698
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:19,219
that can actually generates both who in
restricted model

699
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:23,390
we got a clue any mitigating to account
it's mostly Academy

700
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:27,789
you know it's more getting anything out
the I don't think you only ever able to

701
00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:30,209
use those tools is very very real I
think both

702
00:43:30,209 --> 00:43:33,900
but you know the time to dig into a new
research area to live

703
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:39,699
even talk ready for okay the big
inspiration of these challenges the

704
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:43,099
really hear its program Hewitt a

705
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:49,069
he a.m. German mathematician and who
more than a hundred years

706
00:43:49,069 --> 00:43:52,299
ago he came up with the release of 23

707
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:55,819
heart mathematical problem that's what
what we're really talking

708
00:43:55,819 --> 00:43:59,699
the foundations of mathematics to the
day

709
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:03,289
at five these problems are still &
Resort a

710
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:06,579
of course I think my problems are gonna
be with ultimate

711
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:10,479
met earlier than that also I hope a.m.

712
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:14,890
but if you wanna know you more but he
was program I refer you to the 3p

713
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:18,869
use that a great move from I'm

714
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:24,039
disarms the perimeter so

715
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:28,529
when you do a grain silos a we gotta
love it because

716
00:44:28,529 --> 00:44:31,859
Rio expectation you got some

717
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:35,039
some are measures

718
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,880
whale measuring a solution that you have
to take into account for example

719
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,949
how thoroughly my solution he's at peace
I D does he have

720
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:48,179
the a good people rehear primal force
polity immediately

721
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:51,669
do I we set a solution a if we talking
about

722
00:44:51,669 --> 00:44:55,409
undecidable problems here so be
inevitable

723
00:44:55,409 --> 00:44:58,709
to have song for spunky at least this
one out

724
00:44:58,709 --> 00:45:01,839
you can also choose to have no posts but
if an open look back you don't have a

725
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,039
lot of course maybe

726
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:08,019
you do that you gonna move stuff about a
because you want to focus on the mall

727
00:45:08,019 --> 00:45:12,009
certain birds you gonna move stuff about
or if you really want to find all the

728
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:15,069
back then you have to accept that some
about going to report

729
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:18,729
actually a pause about large group

730
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:22,390
I'm don't think same goes for export
gonna generate

731
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:25,829
who could that are not reaching your
pocket with a

732
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:29,749
the rebels state but you know because
the week love the way you actually came

733
00:45:29,749 --> 00:45:32,699
up with will be the first base in Iraq
said the fact that

734
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:35,959
in a strategy approximate I'm

735
00:45:35,959 --> 00:45:39,299
the expressivity a of a solution with

736
00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:42,939
whether a solution is parametrized a
crime in trouble

737
00:45:42,939 --> 00:45:48,429
the which will old you got a hot but the
solution to happen this particular case

738
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:52,219
or doesn't work for the whole family of
cases

739
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:55,359
that induced by by by the generator

740
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,019
for example quality example of problem

741
00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:02,499
risky maybe he's also very important
though it does your solution work

742
00:46:02,499 --> 00:46:05,949
only on can I have called on the Iraqi
welcoming in the bangor

743
00:46:05,949 --> 00:46:10,299
so it's important to come up with cable
solutions

744
00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:13,839
so that you don't resort problem in
isolation which

745
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:18,769
might look great on the paper or quote
Academy publication batting practice we

746
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:19,619
not need you

747
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:23,169
a very fall the completeness

748
00:46:23,169 --> 00:46:26,529
a related to cooperate so

749
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:30,589
a if you have you have the path only
import

750
00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:34,609
or contact that use people in the
program are you gonna be able to reach

751
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:35,159
that

752
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:39,589
I do you have not cooperates and even
this capability

753
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:42,709
the people who you could be a you could
you know

754
00:46:42,709 --> 00:46:46,689
be able to and I so much code but not
have not have much problems

755
00:46:46,689 --> 00:46:49,919
maybe your tactics make you that that
you know

756
00:46:49,919 --> 00:46:53,069
your you to explore some particle the

757
00:46:53,069 --> 00:46:56,469
state space on the program also subset
of the state based on the program

758
00:46:56,469 --> 00:46:57,130
because

759
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:00,269
on your choices I'm unreasoning

760
00:47:00,269 --> 00:47:03,839
the BC Canada is not very a

761
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:07,309
I aspect on that

762
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:10,719
when challenge because we got like power
generation ease

763
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:14,549
easy solution resilient resistance to

764
00:47:14,549 --> 00:47:17,900
a to environment to mitigating

765
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:23,029
at youth is you that only by passing one
key gauge in on creation for

766
00:47:23,029 --> 00:47:27,949
already have to be taken into account
when paul got a problem okay

767
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:31,919
I'm we pro a

768
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:35,659
I'm I think we find the concert upstate

769
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:38,929
I'm even more simple

770
00:47:38,929 --> 00:47:42,219
problem you can have you misstate

771
00:47:42,219 --> 00:47:46,459
a what does it take what he did you put
that he takes to see

772
00:47:46,459 --> 00:47:50,089
to reach a party a surgical program I'm
gonna give you an example the stuff that

773
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:50,709
you get any

774
00:47:50,709 --> 00:47:54,489
earlier complicated totally understand
just by speaking on the problem

775
00:47:54,489 --> 00:47:57,809
I will be very critical second problem
name

776
00:47:57,809 --> 00:48:02,109
and you got a nation-state a program you
got an official someone in the program

777
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:06,359
watching that you but I have to craft in
order to reach the station in order to

778
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:06,900
you

779
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,619
45 you think that's a very hard problem

780
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:14,319
people like pat good why we do see each
project myself he said

781
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:18,829
I have been working very hard on that in
the only reach about booth at the very

782
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,630
maximum ninety percent coverage

783
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:26,109
so they would be like okay he in a
certain amount paid they won't be able

784
00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:26,849
to reach

785
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:31,409
even we there constraint starting out
with them they had

786
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:35,079
so still coming up in a problem even
though you certainly the last

787
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:39,309
up in the most the most tractable of our
problem in prison today

788
00:48:39,309 --> 00:48:42,369
an example of that he you got a function

789
00:48:42,369 --> 00:48:47,179
okay and you want to know you know what
the poop I have to you to the program to

790
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:49,559
acting at age 10 to satisfy 02

791
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:53,349
yu55 professional do they know that you
flew taxis

792
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:56,679
easy be identified on the occasion %uh
the ARI

793
00:48:56,679 --> 00:48:59,880
then I'm gonna start having arafat
activities are ice

794
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,109
I'm gonna be able to write your about
%um

795
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:06,819
so what is the value X&Y nete be noted
be able to

796
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,849
245 is assessing to make before

797
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:13,289
so that programming people who don't
think you this is a very

798
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:16,979
to be gone both more example but then ok
you think about you in terms of

799
00:49:16,979 --> 00:49:18,449
capability ago

800
00:49:18,449 --> 00:49:21,689
you gonna huge program a huge
choreographed

801
00:49:21,689 --> 00:49:25,429
we left 20 2014 be call graph

802
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:29,089
only see you can become a very heart
problem to do that properly because you

803
00:49:29,089 --> 00:49:30,709
got a track two articles

804
00:49:30,709 --> 00:49:33,759
really well this is the first problem

805
00:49:33,759 --> 00:49:37,189
like old exploit b2b

806
00:49:37,189 --> 00:49:40,429
second problem x-pro derive ability

807
00:49:40,429 --> 00:49:44,429
if almost the same accept that

808
00:49:44,429 --> 00:49:48,089
even for example you had a father you
have a fast texter

809
00:49:48,089 --> 00:49:52,869
uuuu generator crashes and we found out
that you know

810
00:49:52,869 --> 00:49:56,650
new eighty percent a few crashes are not
going to happen

811
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:00,029
ol either way you can take these

812
00:50:00,029 --> 00:50:03,069
Tracy goes back to rate is the stack
traces

813
00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:06,889
and try to mutate early to be these
traces

814
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:09,929
will now try to reach him once but a
look unusual

815
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:13,009
than you know ok with your not at
gunpoint and you haven't either

816
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:17,890
always been accountable by the way but
within the hour

817
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,470
and so I'm is

818
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:24,630
you have a program and you have to stay

819
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:28,650
let's not lose the state that some state
of the program where you have a crash

820
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:32,700
you have the back to rate you have
attacked a police crash you wanna know

821
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,760
was the prefix are the factory

822
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,400
that you have to pay in order to build
another both peaks of you feat

823
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,300
on the tree in reach another more like
but he will call me

824
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,030
so the I think we'll see the different
than probably

825
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:51,660
example of that you the following a you
have

826
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:56,060
I am you have a fountain and

827
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:59,070
with a certain combination of mexico y

828
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:02,400
a for example if X&Y

829
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,850
a small a week or two side of Loch you
gonna be able to write

830
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:09,340
cool too a into an array all the way

831
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,730
just redial okay on the way he just
three love

832
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:16,300
at the Swalec complex with white clearly
can't the

833
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:20,060
eat experts why he equal 2012 lock

834
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:24,250
year you have no one one up by what
happens to the

835
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:27,900
to the eye they just one with allows you
to have the right thing

836
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,950
for every other group would you you
might have a really creepy

837
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:35,270
going to be able to read something but
obviously politics from the spoke with

838
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:37,080
back to be better to write things

839
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:43,280
than three so almost a decade even worry
out about it not very helpful for

840
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,100
unexploded

841
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,270
but in some very popular K you gonna be
able to write

842
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:51,480
so let's assume you take ninety-nine
percent of the time you pay

843
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:57,330
the path that not and the governor and
the EU n you crash I had to react

844
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:01,270
you got these tax rate or you know you
know you have to leave them from

845
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:02,010
communicating

846
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:05,140
what he the prefix that you can take
that

847
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:10,010
if the instruction so that you can
divert from the original crash just a

848
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:10,670
little be

849
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:15,270
so that you U-turn these crash into a
more expert able to

850
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:19,250
for example the 1i rice a out about

851
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:23,570
that's another problem of course again
that's a very small example imagine that

852
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:26,280
very very big program which is what we
were gonna

853
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,370
third party rules

854
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:34,700
when I called market rate expertise
sometimes

855
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:41,410
EGU the next boat is now in most of the
time what you think an expert not not

856
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:42,580
just 2013

857
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:46,680
you have to repeat one thing corrupt the
program

858
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,990
and then there is the corrupted state
some well I'm in the program but

859
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:55,040
is not an ex broke you know you've just
that some Bible have somebody to have

860
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,920
but no it's not going to go

861
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,990
I'm and then reason all the way

862
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:03,630
are executing other traits of the
programs that are not going to be that

863
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,880
he's going to make you know he's
corrected Bible

864
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,050
and then figure a real and expert

865
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:12,380
equitation vector for example a ride

866
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:15,380
the right people to give a sample and

867
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,450
you let me the examples freeway

868
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:21,460
be case if not always easy to YouTube a
week my

869
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:24,960
formalization these problems I'm with
the hat

870
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,080
to photograph acting like the one
function

871
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,350
dies radical malapit with what you know

872
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:36,570
Eve you do you think now the phone to my
phone turn will definitely

873
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,570
you never ever going to figure out that
there is a problem that

874
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:43,940
a because who doing man I think that's
why I'm

875
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:47,840
you know if he's not necessarily a bad
at all you know it could be that there

876
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,170
is some constraint

877
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:52,810
at the precondition I did you know that
you could have at that makes

878
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:57,350
eat less way never never overflow or he
never 0

879
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:01,900
the so it could be that you know there's
nobody at all

880
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,100
when I from the aluminum panels I ever

881
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,660
each you able to craft in an exploit
that cool capital

882
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:11,660
an execution of that own execution 0

883
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:17,060
other team you can see that 0 if I have
an interview overflow-x: with y.o.u

884
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,520
expressways actually

885
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:24,010
the 0 then when I the PD later on I'm
gonna be able to write a review of

886
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:24,710
someplace

887
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:28,480
out above the independently agrees with
that

888
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,340
local and I wasn't to confirm that you
gotta act any not even trade

889
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:37,490
you know what even ed gordon Gee if it
was like that would you

890
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:40,870
winter procedural for you do that you
could like past 80

891
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:44,780
from a potent to the other and then
track this information can move

892
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:48,310
with here is like to totally different
execution places

893
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:52,350
a couple that wants his temple mcconnell
going to grow up to state that the

894
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:53,130
kernel

895
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:57,020
and then another system call is going to
be reused to internal value of the

896
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:57,910
kernel

897
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:01,390
and unit to you to you reference the
part

898
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:05,500
you need to know what are the two people
that are related via it's hard to do

899
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,150
that because

900
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:09,940
leaks pollution possibility that I
really huge

901
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:14,620
that's another problem that people have
to resolving the peace and quiet as well

902
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:18,450
the fourth problems

903
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:22,280
eat something I call quickly through
various there has been some workers

904
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,270
while we say

905
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:27,410
or you probably the following

906
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:31,490
min researching the program a what

907
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:34,550
even necessary and sufficient condition

908
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:38,630
at the beginning of the function or
ideally at the beginning of the program

909
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:42,670
that he's going to make is these the
cessation

910
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:45,930
force so at the very problem if you
remember

911
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:49,860
we had a very forward cannot be nothing
where we say okay

912
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:53,470
I thought maybe we thought they I go
down to the program I'm gonna try to

913
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:54,900
explore the program like that

914
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,910
here we continue firms

915
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:02,660
easy cleaning up that backward so you
can research in

916
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:06,600
and you want to know you know what are
you put other proven that I needed

917
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,390
unitary decision-making cool

918
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:13,090
an example of that is the following you
gotten a search in

919
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:16,820
index is more than four eighty say 00
but

920
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,930
you know what other condition at the
beginning of F in order to make the

921
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,520
sufficient force

922
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,630
ol you relied on by the United do that

923
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:28,300
unity to know what is the post condition
of D

924
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:33,230
okay what other coalition at the energy
united to have index mobile

925
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:36,810
so you won't be 30 just all that we do
know you RT

926
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:40,590
have to be fun for and then even that
was pretty slutty

927
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:44,890
watching the pre community because we
know at collège for you caught in a lie

928
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:48,750
a flippin awesome the doing real we got
a problem

929
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:51,810
when you come back you see all of course
in fact

930
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:56,180
I need you had a for example XP given
what

931
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:59,810
you fix it be and why they're not going
to return 0 which will see you with more

932
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:02,120
info everything's fine

933
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:06,130
a so they become the precondition
necessary precondition up G

934
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:10,180
when you come back to FB say okay you
not become somebody what would become

935
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:14,420
up that I wanted to have the Seas

936
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:19,460
will only people can do this forward we
very simple template for pimples from

937
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,560
the song

938
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:26,310
but do need for any assertion he's a big
problem

939
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:33,310
backward backward movement that that's
another problem

940
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:37,850
another problem with looking very
important my dear friend atomic billion

941
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:40,570
last year gave a small problem recently
that

942
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:45,170
and a I gave a solution that was not
entirely automated

943
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:49,150
that solution that allows you to a to
basically

944
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:52,970
and I who in every situation absolutely
guarantee that loop

945
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:56,890
doing something right a review to 1888
the cue from

946
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:00,230
other you lou an assertion

947
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:04,070
a 81 a inside the loop or after the loop

948
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:07,860
and what you looking very a to the loop
invariant wills

949
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:11,260
what he the condition of the loop that
has to be true

950
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:14,950
II every between the two Asian United
for these

951
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:18,570
her decision 81 to be too of course

952
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:21,600
a to in a case so again

953
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,670
a heart problems it is practically I

954
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:28,580
maybe can do economically even though I
have a reason to think not possible to

955
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,770
dynamically

956
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:33,590
for export writers a the example the
full

957
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:36,620
I'm you got a functional you are in
session

958
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:40,040
you say all what does it take for the
new

959
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,970
a to you to have a you know who have II

960
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:48,320
month ever you know why I the Corporal

961
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:52,550
happy when I you know it to to make this
happen you see that the lou has

962
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:56,050
a next and on Hulu

963
00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:00,980
you know the movies SAT silent about but
then somebody to the rule changes

964
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:04,880
you know if you this is the Hulu be just
me radio the buffer

965
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,550
for every character he tested beaten up
in bracket or closing bracket

966
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:13,200
it's not new bracket just increase movie
with a clean record book reasonable

967
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,270
so clear you can see Eve a Eve

968
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:20,430
somebody put it up lot of opening
bracket from that buffer

969
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:27,390
a you gonna have I be getting the new
which will prob be getting sad about

970
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:30,810
how do you for my time that as as

971
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:35,450
automatically wow how do you for the
loop invariant

972
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:38,760
for the loop invariant you would be all

973
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,870
but your YouTube and then upload rocket
and

974
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:46,000
but 10 between up in bracket and it's
the greater

975
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,350
release the Coalition for everything ok
after the buffer

976
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:52,420
I'm that had in you have to say all

977
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:56,830
in fact what has to happen to be a that
every single character on the buffer

978
00:59:56,830 --> 01:00:00,210
he's different than an open bracket or

979
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:05,370
the even better with Ang Lee youth all
the number of opening bracket

980
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:09,050
he is smaller than the number of
clothing rack

981
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:12,640
if you have this condition then you can
guarantee that I I was gonna be smaller

982
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,070
than thought about

983
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:17,980
a decision but but is hard to actually
think that I

984
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:21,370
it is gonna condition automatically you

985
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:24,870
if you have an expert guiding you know
the SMT solver

986
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:29,410
example a to to understand what kind of
condition has to happen

987
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:36,410
it's not the media you can go to my TP
three hot

988
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:40,160
one more problem and we almost there

989
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,950
we could have coffee here

990
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:48,250
I'm heap likelihood look for example we
pass on this one because I've talked

991
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,630
about it already with the matter

992
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:52,650
he model and you in a program T

993
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:56,720
the brew impugning developing a let's
say you have the right pinkie

994
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,860
you know a you know you know you have a
child that you know you can overflow

995
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:05,740
the what is the most exposed people
random or

996
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:10,040
for for the heap right committee my rent
a motel room

997
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:14,330
wide the you know what he's a sequence
of keeping

998
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:17,790
key that you have to execute would give
you the most probably

999
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:23,420
govt will both be exactly what I said
when I was talking about changing our

1000
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:27,170
you can't read either statically I have
my doubts on-the-spot feasibility

1001
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:30,640
O'Donnell and if you do we got any clue

1002
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,860
a I guess there is a chance that people
are going to come up with that

1003
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:38,640
gone out in the future

1004
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,610
we don't have to do that I'm another
problem he had

1005
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:46,600
the a the ability to

1006
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,740
for IBC's I'm

1007
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:55,290
or even valued all sizes all battles
based on timing measurements

1008
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:58,490
people have tried doing that in the
d-pad example

1009
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:02,840
a whole package either really really
really nice go to some economists fear

1010
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:06,030
room your any showing how

1011
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:10,530
he majored a Firefox executions

1012
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:15,560
united to to to did use that value of
particle appointees

1013
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:19,460
just be on the time to to actually
execute a doubt be

1014
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:22,590
good pp I'm you

1015
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:27,390
it was relying on a very popular party
in all-black shows and hyperinflation

1016
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:30,890
a elements on the fact that I have
people who

1017
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:33,930
you know a hold both

1018
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:37,340
you the final word in also will help out
with the program

1019
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:40,350
so that was a very popular in the
solution to that problem

1020
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:44,940
but badly what other Commission the
problem what are the conditions are a

1021
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:45,700
few

1022
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:49,220
to the who for to final

1023
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:53,820
to measure who directly get back time
measurement what yet another pointer

1024
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:57,190
or address the revival the sizeof a
buffer

1025
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,850
a crave the mapping out a dynamic
allocated buffer what the side

1026
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:04,030
site man allow you to get the address
for the network for

1027
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,600
of the book we sell you have more police

1028
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,710
of I'll up terms obviously will not be
management

1029
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:15,840
so you might we were having a week the
gonna we see you 10 people have this

1030
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,980
idea that

1031
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:21,530
I'm these these apply eighth to

1032
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:26,150
lot of people data structures a became
you can a useful he channels for stock

1033
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:27,220
rainfall

1034
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:31,410
rather rivals and all I think so if you
measure the programming

1035
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:34,540
gonna be the program you can just make
it I love the program

1036
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:38,210
what can you do can you get you the
address the instructions we did you the

1037
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:39,250
address in a function

1038
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:42,590
or a metal detector for purely time be

1039
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:45,780
we are you about to have a new
formations closure we w want to really a

1040
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,140
spate of the program

1041
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:50,380
just measuring the time a what are the
mystery

1042
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:57,110
you permission to be cruel the address
of resource

1043
01:03:57,110 --> 01:04:00,440
another one concurrent program now

1044
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,930
the big problem in computer programming
are is very similar to the one mile

1045
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:04,710
checking

1046
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:08,480
either state space exploration
especially

1047
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:14,910
you

1048
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:21,910
you have any questions before before
that

1049
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:29,690
Konkan program now is what he's a good
way all

1050
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:33,780
factoring is a state-space other program
we have not what's right

1051
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:37,250
if you just you have to threaten you
have more state and you have two

1052
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:38,330
possibilities

1053
01:04:38,330 --> 01:04:42,130
of scheduling you know who had sweets
credit going to

1054
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:45,560
you have one instruction in the penal
incredible

1055
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:49,200
and then important to spread your own
and then of schedule 2 threat to

1056
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,130
and then on that one component with red
one skill to threat to

1057
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:56,950
so you got a new exponential state space
explosion

1058
01:04:56,950 --> 01:05:01,030
eyes I you have threats many people have
thread

1059
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:05,300
I thought everything was getting point
you gonna have any possibility

1060
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:09,250
of scattering so and pound and pound

1061
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:12,450
and everything going instruction a which

1062
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,780
he massively exponential a

1063
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:19,380
either way to argue with people in the
state space have a caulking program in a

1064
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:22,480
way that is tractable for now this
without being limited to like and I'm

1065
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,230
the code

1066
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:27,450
me some people came up with things like
partial order reduction to help

1067
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:30,770
the even though the problem far from
being a result

1068
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:33,840
so that's a big problem how to resolve
the

1069
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:38,170
factoring of concurrent programs
faith-based

1070

but no other rate I'll you know things
I'm

1106
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:57,790

1114
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,670
between rule necessary all everybody is
going to do it in the future

1115
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:30,600

01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:14,280
the youth thing about frame-up

1146
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,940
out the cool to have to be a to actually

1147
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:22,610
the do you think that we collect about
that's a new way of thinking of how to

1148
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:23,520
write a personal

1149
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,650
to conclude the with the

1150
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:30,870
we they could pose a problem automated
expertise will set up Taliban problems

1151
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:35,310
and those from time to time you is all
anytime soon especially because the

1152
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:38,770
the general public and undecidable
problem if not only possible to do we

1153
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:43,160
every time but people can actually try
to do it sometimes what are the

1154
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:43,790
conditions

1155
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:46,830
watching the perimeter up the domain
owner

1156
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:50,820
possibility and and

1157
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:53,930
with this I just a question thank you
very much for you

1158
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:55,820
%ah
