1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,260
okay series and that was about half full

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,600
well winning want to meet up read it
wasn't doing something

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,590
and wardens woohoo

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,670
this low versus what is clear is that
lives with me

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,279
what I was always nice for Muslims other
hikers the main wouldn't

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,510
western region of them who believe my
eyes will also work incorporates a

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,320
bronze

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,760
you all my calls me my own business
porky well

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,609
I a plethora based real momentum energy
E

10
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:34,940
King lost with the idea me however he
wants another software

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,350
it wasn't much but I think we will see
move long hard look

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:45,350
emmett was has been a consultant
violence what led

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,800
how DL we're going to be in good

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,079
iight is said

15
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:03,079
and then you need a shot good

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,159
as a man could bring me an apple power
supply to the handy

17
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,350
I'll I as it today I'll be telling you
about the southern appalachians Space

18
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,130
Agency Inc

19
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,439
which happened when I was drunk I need a

20
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:23,100
and purchase a satellite dish that was
their place in the United States Navy

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,700
I ahead is delivered to my farming in
Tennessee in

22
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,880
which is where Jack Daniels is made mom

23
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,150
which coincidentally enough was what I
was drinking

24
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:42,189
when I but the satellite dish and then
my friend in I

25
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,259
repurposed this satellite dish to be
able to track

26
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:48,299
satellites that are lower orbit

27
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,590
most satellite hacking is done against
satellites in geostationary orbit

28
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,619
because they're study target

29
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:00,939
so if I A take a ham radio and I a man
in tennis I'll

30
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:03,939
from Tennessee I will hear Portuguese

31
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:08,099
over the radio because Brazilian truck
drivers by reusing

32
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,730
the american satellites the nineteen
seventies in order to

33
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,220
bounce traffic and across the truck
driving routes

34
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,300
but I wanted to track the satellites
they're moving very

35
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,849
close to the ground the satellites that
are moving very fast in the sky

36
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:26,450
and that moved to this guy so quickly
that you can't

37
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,690
leave an antenna pointed at them because
the movie the entire sky in 15 minutes

38
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,200
and examples would be the International
Space Station

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,660
were some the

40
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,989
telephone satellites Azumi radioman
Globalstar

41
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:45,290
these moved to this guy very quickly and
you need custom hardware and software to

42
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,099
track them

43
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,769
the software that is available for
tracking them isn't very good

44
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,640
so I had to rewrite my own from scratch
I'm

45
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,400
and my friend Collin Mulliner demands
did with a bet going as you can but were

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,940
dinosaurs on stage

47
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,360
so I score one point

48
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,849
and I I did this work thanks to the help

49
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:11,840
the that the end and skating two friends
9 from Berlin

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,659
and and it's already built up on work
from Adam Lori engines you have any

51
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:20,659
who did the earlier work in
geostationary satellites the ones that

52
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,860
are so high

53
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,510
that they stay in one space and relative
to the air

54
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,209
and and also to the good neighbors
apartment

55
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,129
I'm who were I'm around for a lovely
conversations involving this

56
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:38,379
now you can't have a space agency in my
case the southern appalachians space

57
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:39,090
agency

58
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,510
without a mission patch and this is my
mission patch

59
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,379
it's based upon my peoples native
culture and

60
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,090
we have lots um and

61
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,290
like cinder blocks in cars and cinder
blocks and its traditional that you'll

62
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,400
have many

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,860
on used cars in your yard in Tennessee
so do I have here is in a box beneath my

64
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,730
satellite dish

65
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,489
and and this is back to all this really
is sitting on cinder blocks

66
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,310
and on the right you have an alien

67
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,099
I there is little green men about this
tall we call them burgers

68
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:18,840
head in the background it's kinda hard
to see

69
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,650
there that many shine still

70
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,190
because it's traditional to make with
you at home where I come from

71
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,580
and good in this guy

72
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,680
you can see some space garbage and the
International Space Station and there's

73
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,370
a glove

74
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,470
and a banana yah

75
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,560
and because you know they they have to
ship their garbage downward

76
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,639
weight stays in the same way with their
end and it's not a big get cluttered his

77
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,790
pieces break off

78
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:52,199
I and then on the left there's a man
with a neck beard and a shotgun

79
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,389
and has the shotgun to defend himself
from the book or on the right

80
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,550
would

81
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,280
so at at Berlin sides last year again a
lecture in reverse engineering

82
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,550
the spot protocol mmm

83
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,330
and anything that mean where the guy was
hiking

84
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,320
and the rock fell on his arm and he had
to cut his arm off to get away

85
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,669
I'm he really would like to have some
cell phone reception

86
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:24,460
with spot does is it allows you to send
a message

87
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,000
from your cell phone up to a satellite

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,060
and the satellite redirects the signal
to the Internet

89
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,949
so even if you don't have a cell phone
signal you can still transmit a message

90
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,479
from the middle of the desert

91
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:40,900
or from the middle of the ocean and

92
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,199
so I reverse engineered this protocol
and first a reverse engineered the

93
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:45,910
Bluetooth

94
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,100
that's used to allow the phone to talk
to the spot

95
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,150
and then I reverse engineer the
satellite link which runs at one point

96
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,860
six figure hurts

97
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,030
it is completely clear text it is
uninterrupted

98
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,199
and if the entire recording and the
signal is very easy to parse it

99
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,470
into interpreted I contains the serial
number GPS coordinates

100
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,389
and would ever text messages and up as
if you say they came I'm alright

101
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:18,530
I'll get that if he say oh dear god the
rock is pressing my arm please and help

102
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,639
I'll get that and this is the

103
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,979
photograph the device it's about that
bed

104
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:30,090
and these are really easy to program
their Bluetooth protocol is very simple

105
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,690
and and their easy to reverse engineer

106
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,750
up

107
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,310
to reverse engineer the home

108
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,270
coffee is complicated at your residence
near the Android application that

109
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,090
initially

110
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,199
control this and and raid at least the
site engine

111
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,810
my drums contains a tool called ABC i
dont

112
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,300
which will dump a log of all the
Bluetooth traffic

113
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,680
that that particular devices had this is
important because his

114
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,470
and which is terribly difficult to sniff
external im

115
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,819
but he's defeated from one in the device
is that supposed to be in the

116
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:08,729
conversation

117
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,710
you can get a very good recording and on
the right is a screenshot

118
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,870
although what the output looks like
sitting at Google Map

119
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:21,039
results everywhere in this case I was in
philadelphia walking west across the

120
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,069
Schuylkill River

121
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,720
when you have the recording what happens
internally

122
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,090
is that the spot sends a long series

123
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,050
in a siddur and code

124
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,060
for either is 0 or 1 but when it
switches between these

125
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,780
is little pop on the radio sinew when
you look at the recording

126
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,979
a which goes down we didn't miss
recording your number zeros first

127
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:52,430
and then whenever there's a switch from
the 02 01

128
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,720
you have a pop was a little circles and
the circles

129
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,139
happen between that the circle is not a
bit itself

130
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,699
and the status was that I know the
protocol and I can sniff yep thanks

131
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,199
I'm what I want Downing's

132
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,710
I'm I don't want to see people in Mason
City talking to the satellite

133
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,069
I want to see people on nice n Clinton
and talking to the satellite

134
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:21,490
and the way to do that is to sniff the
downlink

135
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,050
but that requires a satellite dish and
and it requires a moving satellite dish

136
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,830
because

137
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,770
the satellite moved to this guy very
very quickly

138
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,029
to a take a look Adam raises tools for

139
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:38,269
playing with your station satellites
which he published in 2008

140
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:41,500
and in 2010 he is

141
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,260
a KU band receiver with HDTVs

142
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,300
television part this is the same sort of
setup that you used for receiving

143
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,399
satellite TV

144
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,430
in the next and and then

145
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,790
he made me the television is moved by
AntiSec motor

146
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:01,959
and I think motor can only move left and
right it's not be able to move up and

147
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,630
down

148
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,519
and his tool is available at spots at
now it's at this URL

149
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,940
this is the photograph and his the
scanner and with this tool is doing

150
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,320
is its I'm it's trying every frequency

151
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,649
on the current satellite you know teach
you look

152
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:23,060
for videoing and the this

153
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,620
may be playing on the left is coming
down from that to be silent

154
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,339
and you can also make maps this way I
made this map by moving

155
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:35,399
one of my dishes left and right and then
recording which frequencies are being

156
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,570
used to the x-axis

157
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,860
is the acid in and the y-axis is the
frequency

158
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,570
and wherever you see a dot there's a
transmitter

159
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,970
you can see that satellite which are
next to each other try not to use the

160
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,160
same vacancies

161
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,050
and he moved from left to right their
gas

162
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,260
and you'll also see the something can
seize

163
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,579
are just like a little pinprick that's
the way from the others

164
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:06,019
I'm there is a I think are physically
separate satellites that are just

165
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:10,640
near each other and and it is stepped in
as admin

166
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,290
and sing about three degrees in this guy
in with you

167
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,600
and if I go much further east or west
this diagram

168
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,250
my dishes misaligned and because the
geostationary satellites

169
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,920
four missing bring in this guy I'm this
is called the clock bell

170
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,100
after a sick like and because it's

171
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,820
curved shape and I can only move left
and right with this dash

172
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,959
I can't like see things that are in the
wrong position this guy

173
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,310
to the bench is a bit are that there is
cheap hardware available you can just

174
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,720
buy

175
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,930
kid to run Adams tools and

176
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,890
you'll pay about 200 250 US dollars

177
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,190
the and the particles were talking to
these motors are standardized

178
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,170
zoo your machine doesn't really care
what brand of motor you have

179
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,860
you you don't have to do much more than
and simple rewiring

180
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,720
and you get TV signals video feeds so
it's really easy to point

181
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,029
at an incoming signal and say hey I got
that and you'll also find you

182
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:14,519
weirding signals Lake I'm

183
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,310
on the news when the interview people
very often the interviews are bounced

184
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,540
over this network and see you can
actually watch the interviews

185
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,850
live and you can sometimes the
embarrassing footage where people say

186
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,370
things when they think they're up camera

187
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,730
and and they're also it is the IP
packets going across this network

188
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,720
and said he's dead by this or you can
actually catch internet downlink traffic

189
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,130
and which is certainly sniffing have a
wifi connection

190
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,250
you see what the access point says the
user

191
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,820
what you do not see what the user says
back to the access point

192
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,230
but their disadvantages the only works
with

193
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,459
geostationary satellites so in essence
24,000 miles in this guy

194
00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:00,050
exactly and staying in the same place
orbiting

195
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,410
one Spurrier said the real day exactly

196
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,760
you're not going to be able to receive
it and it's very

197
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,240
slow very inaccurate tracking and this
is my guy 24 was measured in pics

198
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,200
and not degrees on the acceptance that's
because my mother isn't

199
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,560
accurate enough to properly tell me how
many degrees and

200
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,130
I would like to be able to move a
fraction of a degree

201
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,470
perfectly accurately in repeatedly and
you can't do that

202
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,579
with the dissect motors

203
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:35,380
you also limited to standardize signals
you'll find his VIP

204
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,680
you will find the video and that said

205
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,139
and a lot of that is encrypt data and
becoming more infected

206
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,920
and the general rule a catastrophe is
dead

207
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,459
and satellite TV providers the only one
to do it right

208
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:55,389
this there is a helluva lot of money
whenever anyone can make

209
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:58,630
think receiver cards as they've invested
a fortune

210
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,529
in preventing you from receiving using
captain signals

211
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:07,540
so I but a satellite dish and this is my
a dish being removed from the

212
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,860
Navy warship it is a billion deathbed

213
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:17,550
the and the ship have to have also
written communication methods

214
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,959
see you might also be able to find when
the same dishes come say hi and got

215
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:26,070
were and cruise ship

216
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,959
and my dishes FL come 81 its when needed
ish

217
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:33,440
intended for use with Inmarsat

218
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,860
and it has stepper motors for azimuth
elevation and

219
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,339
till and because the Disney this dish
would be plated

220
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,550
at the top of the ship's mast and his
ship rocks

221
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,940
this dish incorrect for the rocking

222
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,560
I paid 200 I'll between fifty dollars to
the sunny day

223
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,820
um is cost me two hundred dollars for
delivery bed

224
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,910
likely the guy I bought it from one and
an excuse to

225
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,639
drive near I was and if not

226
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,290
I would have had to pay a king's ransom
in airfare to have it delivered

227
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,820
and so I'd recommend that if you want to
repeat this work you find a port city

228
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,050
and

229
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,889
someone who repairs yachts and try to
buy addition and cheaply

230
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:21,310
and and it has spinning gyroscopes
visibility

231
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,329
see the way that this thing can tell how
the ship is rocking many that

232
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,470
these this was designed before the
iPhone

233
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,620
this is designed to be poor man's was

234
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,370
available said he couldn't just have an
electronic accelerometer

235
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,529
you had to have gyroscopes and the sky
was gives had to have

236
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:42,920
spinning wheels in now after these
wheels been up

237
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,970
the distance to know exactly how far
they've turned

238
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,970
but a gyroscope doesn't tell you that it
just tells you that you're too far to

239
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,750
the left it too far to the right

240
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,389
so actually has motors that move just
the gyroscopes

241
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:58,550
so that they can measure the difference
between the gyroscope and the dish

242
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:04,480
in order to be able to turn in specific
unknown number degrees

243
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,389
and unfortunately the software that it
ran was closed doors

244
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:13,720
and anti this runs on an 80 286 chip
internally

245
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,959
it can't even run and windows
ninety-five

246
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,820
up and so I A

247
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,160
built my own software to run on it which
I call the pasa framework

248
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,089
were southern Appalachian space agency
it's designed for tracking low-earth

249
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:29,410
orbit satellites

250
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,670
and and it produces the as a validation
and

251
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,720
I'm until values that

252
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,120
the dish needs but there is no reason
why

253
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,370
its limited to tracking the things that
are moving so

254
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,079
may suffer also track stars I contracted
space probes

255
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,100
strikes which one in Voyager 2 I'm

256
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,709
and I threw in a software-defined radio
to

257
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:59,139
I can record as strange signal and then
the modulated later

258
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:02,730
not really caring what is the time that
I recorded

259
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,029
this is very important because it allows
me to separate the problem

260
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:10,769
a finding the signal from the problem
the decoding the signal

261
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:15,610
and I can give a copy to my cousin is
better at doing some predefined radio

262
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,600
than I am

263
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,160
and he doesn't need to have his own dish
in order to

264
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,350
get the recording or in order to build
is and receiving software

265
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,230
and this is particularly useful when
identifying

266
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,550
unknown and I meant

267
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,130
and and I run the entire thing through

268
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:42,820
Linux machines that are spread around
the house that holds the satellite dish

269
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,459
so I have the BeagleBone the inside a
over the raid on

270
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:50,980
this is physically strapped to the dish
and these moves with the dish

271
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,670
this has the something fine radio this
has the motor controllers

272
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,410
but its night powerful enough to do this
often defined radio person

273
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,540
soon it sends all that data in the role
of

274
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,030
over Ethernet to a server inside the
house

275
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,919
and it's the server that actually does
the some predefined really cutting

276
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,199
and recorded because the server can have
as much towards I care to plug into it

277
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,760
but anything inside the Reno man has to
move with the debt

278
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,199
I is too much weight and is the way gets
above a threshold

279
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,020
the dish will become an actor and and I
run the entire thing through

280
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,880
post-crescent

281
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,210
so if you were able to do a single
injection exploit against

282
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,870
sassa you could physically move this
dead

283
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,280
and by doing the right relations at the
statement you can cause it to

284
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,039
rapid similar quarter round and said
hang it up

285
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:48,559
um and the the simple framework makes it
really easy to give the thing orders

286
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,320
and see if you want to know where your
my dishes pointed

287
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,410
you can select as El azimuth and
elevation

288
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,090
from position table and that tells you
where you are

289
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,320
and if you want to 18 min at say which
one

290
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,190
UN updates the and update targets at
nichols' Voyager 1

291
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,520
and then the targeting the men will
begin tracking that object

292
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,020
and at the moment I'm using a real tech
STR for the something if I radio

293
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,090
but I hope to move that over to hack
arrests in

294
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,390
use and I but word for motor control and
I have an inertial measurement unit

295
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:31,600
from back turn up and because today

296
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,750
the them to be back as

297
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,840
I'm today you can afford to have

298
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,250
an inertial measurement unit whereas
when this dish was designed

299
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,669
and I and you is the sort of thing that
you would only have in say a cruise

300
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:45,410
missile

301
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:50,610
now we all have them in ourselves and
this is the dish itself being worked on

302
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,539
I'm this is their rearview you can see
that there's this

303
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:58,870
central stop here and that their motor
is based around

304
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,669
as if in this position I could have the
entire dish turn left the entire dish

305
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:03,770
turn right

306
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,799
or had the dish raise up were fall down

307
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,590
or could have it till and

308
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,450
on the central stock I have followed the
devices wired up

309
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,370
and they're connected to each other by
USB and then connected to you

310
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:23,160
the household network by a 100 megabit
internet

311
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,940
the read more downside is not a
controller the green bernie is the

312
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,100
standard commercial USB hub the
whiteboard

313
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,150
is BeagleBone which is an alarm

314
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,750
system-on-chip computer that's it

315
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:42,520
you know about that'd

316
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,309
the stepper motors are undocumented but
there are only so many different types a

317
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:48,299
stepper motors

318
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,059
there are 6 pins the promoters and
therefore pins that matters

319
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:55,929
these are six but if you ignore the
inner 2 pins

320
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:59,059
then it's easy to connect them to the
I'm

321
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:04,270
the separate controller December
controller is and I but bored

322
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,220
and I is German for Ag and

323
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,580
the two all the

324
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,990
the Paris and connectors in the top the
apims in total

325
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,309
those are for motor one in motor to

326
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:21,679
and this is what the board was
originally designed for this is

327
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,610
a way that he needs Easter eggs using a
pen and moving

328
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,210
the eg around I'm but this same motor
controller

329
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,659
is powerful enough to move that large
satellited

330
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:37,840
because the reduction the the dish
itself

331
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,530
has small motors that are connected to
you polly's

332
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,230
the police's reduce the movement but
increase the port

333
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,510
so that the small motors and satellite
dish are enough

334
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,770
to you in the dash

335
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,169
as a backup in case I forget where my
dishes

336
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:00,440
I have a webcam on the back and

337
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:06,610
and this white thing here is the radium
at my brother's lovely car in the lapd

338
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,549
that's my father's lovely trapping
writing I'm

339
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:14,650
so that is made it home had his like a
white insight

340
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,929
and the Sun night comes through it just
a little bit because this is fiberglass

341
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:22,960
to we painted the rate home so that the
webcam to look out at the rate on

342
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,039
and then if there's a software bug you
or if you know what if you were to be a

343
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,960
jerk in to run a single injection
exploit to make my district where it is

344
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,549
I can repair its positioning remotely
and this is important because

345
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:41,070
I built this in Tennessee and tennessee
is a long way away from

346
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:45,539
anyplace good airport

347
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:49,610
see you you know it takes me a long time
to get to Tennessee and it takes me a

348
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,679
long time to leave

349
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,510
by a painting the way to make this I can
remotely repair it when simple

350
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,470
things break these software

351
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,549
also runs through this post test
framework and so this is

352
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:07,270
photograph the sassa commander which is
the

353
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,159
lying commanding control utility

354
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:14,250
all these read entries always satellites

355
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,130
andy green when is the satellite that's
being targeted

356
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,760
the crosshairs show at which point
misguided the

357
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,230
dishes Inc and as the satellite moved to
this guy which everyone is being

358
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,610
targeted will be followed

359
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,690
by a the she goes three

360
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,940
sorta hovers in the same region this guy
I'm but it moves up and down a lot

361
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,159
and I can just leave this alone for
hours to follow

362
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,860
that target and

363
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,070
a comedian the lights in the front just
a bit

364
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,530
is a screenshot so hard to see these

365
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:54,450
whiting pieces in the background and
those are stars

366
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,860
and I can actually project missing star
Matt onto the Sasa view

367
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,470
as you would see in the night sky said
he is in is at night you can look up in

368
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,130
the sky and actually

369
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:09,830
visibly see by constellations which
party this guy you're targeting

370
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,270
it's a bit better thank you and

371
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,010
now is to bosnia polar view and seeing
this case you seeing like

372
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,289
a top-down view on the main satellite
dish

373
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:25,520
with here you see a first-person view
IQ's if you're looking out from the dead

374
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,690
and by comparing the two you can start
appalling things that are harder to

375
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,730
track

376
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,900
for example dolores is the Northstar

377
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,210
its Justin Center directly up

378
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,429
from the centre circle and that's either
the extreme left in extreme right below

379
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:44,610
the standard you

380
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:49,000
the policy allows me to see that and
there's nothing going on cell phones

381
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,049
so this is my Nokia N 900 controlling
the says addition

382
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:58,340
and and in this game China and connected
over wifi

383
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,860
but in cases where there is the 3G
service

384
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,409
I can actually develop the dishes
software

385
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:09,710
on public transportation and so
significant portion this development I

386
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,260
did

387
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,710
from the subway in Berlin

388
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,730
they have good and networking activity
there so

389
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,230
I would just you knowing SSH over to the
server

390
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,289
open up in accession and began hacking
away

391
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:26,909
and I can do that motherhood by peddling
the post-test process

392
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:31,900
than mice implanted could run Isles is
running on my Nokia 900

393
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,190
which is terrible for development
because the as I'm a Nokia n9

394
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,620
this is terrible for development because
it doesn't have a keyboard

395
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,809
but it's really cool to be able to just
pull out a cell phone and

396
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:48,880
ordered the dish to do something

397
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,390
and this is a a program called
viewpoints from nasa

398
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,760
this is particularly handy if you're
trying to find

399
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,429
a satellite but you don't exactly know
who

400
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:02,799
where it is so you do is you program the
dish

401
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,760
to use think this guy I'm and to look
around the frequency that you know the

402
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,370
transmission will be made on

403
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:11,900
I and then whenever you see a pop-up you
can record those

404
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,960
hines and this software allows you to
deal with large datasets

405
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,779
so you can

406
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:23,799
in a call in this spot recordings the
you know

407
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:27,490
this pregnancy was in use with the
strength at this time I'm

408
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,679
week for months and you can take all the
data for this month

409
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:34,659
and sorting work with it until you've
identified how to select the satellite

410
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:35,850
you're looking for

411
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:39,120
and then run it backward to log from the
protection anyways

412
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,340
to figure out which satellite was not
who's this guy at that time

413
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,480
and now I I told you there and
everything

414
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,210
through a Postgres database but they
didn't really tell you how the post test

415
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:51,970
database

416
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,830
hood do all these things make is
normally

417
00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:00,480
when you do an update statement that
doesn't keep changing teacher

418
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,679
things inside the database so I built
this

419
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,350
all around multiple UNIX demons which
Ryan

420
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:12,799
throughout May home network I'm 20 min
that does nothing but orbit predictions

421
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,830
and two it will predict where the
satellites are

422
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,279
and then it will make an UPDATE
statement you the database table

423
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,669
for every thing that it's tracking

424
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:26,740
and I have another team in the grads
norad Tulane

425
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,279
entry and elements I the motor control
demand

426
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,360
this is the thing that actually gives
commands to the white

427
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,120
circuit board to tell it how far and in
which direction to move the motors

428
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,429
I have an inertial measurement unit in
play which takes an accelerometer input

429
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:47,070
to tell you know how high a my dishes
tilted

430
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:52,370
and also and integrated accelerometer to
tell how far it move left and right

431
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,860
and its sanity checks the motor control
demand

432
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,850
the motor control even remembers how far
it is moved

433
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,840
sometimes this is inaccurate the
inertial measurement unit can compensate

434
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,059
for that

435
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:11,159
and I also have the radium I'm a couple
different radio demons because I want to

436
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,440
the different things with the radio

437
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,929
and for example I might want to do a
spectrum analysis just to tell which

438
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,640
frequencies are in use

439
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,899
or I might want to record an individual
downing

440
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:25,470
and this allows me to do that and

441
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,809
also because certain other signals is a
strong

442
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:32,529
I'm sometimes I get home said for my
peoples native culture

443
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:36,240
so I can actually download the local FM
radio stations

444
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,490
and listen to them through this I like
this

445
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:45,010
for all the predictions I initially used
program called predicted

446
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,020
on this is a ily applications you have
to the started inside him

447
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,120
the new screen were something else will
keep the

448
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,590
graphical window open and it allows you
to query the positions

449
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:04,299
other ads satellites over you TP but
it's limited to 20

450
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:08,020
birds and you can predict the some
planets

451
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,529
like to the moon or the Sun but it can't
predict others

452
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:16,120
so it won't tell me where jupiter is or
where Mars's

453
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,279
so they switched to a library called

454
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,370
high FM pie from a lousy team

455
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,600
predicted the positions have hundreds of
different satellites

456
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,610
and it doesn't require any weird EP
tracking

457
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,770
it's just a Python library that you can
directly

458
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,260
use in a demand that also talks
post-crescent

459
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,850
I'm and i cant read more than 500
satellites that difficulty this way

460
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,929
I'm it also has planets and stars

461
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:48,460
and this is I N a test in which I
haven't predicting every single object

462
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,649
that is in geostationary orbit

463
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:55,200
and also everyone in the GPS satellites
these more than 500

464
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,309
satellites in total and it's able to
protect them without

465
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:03,710
any performance trouble what are the
checks that uses I prioritizes

466
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,870
the satellites based upon their velocity
and whether they are being tracked

467
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,870
to if and

468
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:17,870
if I were to you click on one in the
satellites in order to follow it

469
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,010
after the computers time will be spent
tracking just that satellites that I had

470
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:26,130
it as accurate as I possibly could

471
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,490
but I you also need to know who what the
orbits are

472
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,010
because these orbits change we're really
old satellites things that are you sort

473
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,370
of drifting up there

474
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,919
the orbits are consistent Voyager 1 has
no fuel left

475
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,240
so I don't have to worry about going to
one changing environment

476
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,980
a paper published before you won once
every decade

477
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,510
and by I need to be able to track

478
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:53,990
moving satellites and I need to be able
to track ones that change

479
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,399
orbit rather often the International
Space Station has a lot of fuel

480
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,590
and it very frequently moved to avoid
stay strong

481
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,750
and to its orbit is very unpredictable
if you were to attempt to do with pen

482
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,270
and paper you would never

483
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:13,620
be able to keep up suit norad runs this
project consultants track

484
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:18,090
and so this track is list everything in
orbit

485
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:22,190
and they also provide smaller lists
based upon and

486
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,220
particular types is that elects if you
want to list every television satellite

487
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,679
were every GPS satellite or every
amateurs Adelaide

488
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,380
you can download is this and then
looking directly into your predictions

489
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,190
are

490
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,909
so I have a demand that automatically
grabs these files the sales rack server

491
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:41,960
and then feeds them in my purse
guesstimates were

492
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,510
protectionism tracking things

493
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,730
the motor control the men was
surprisingly easy to write

494
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:52,620
the I but word shows up as a thick
serial port

495
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,270
this ice dance class TTY ACN 0

496
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,890
and you can just give it commands in
asking so if I wanted to move

497
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,789
and 500 steps up and four hundred steps
left

498
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:08,390
and I wanted to do this in 3,000
milliseconds

499
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,669
I would just runs first manned SN 3,000

500
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,690
500 -0400 and then using a carriage
return

501
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,750
and then removed it sends an okay back
to you at the end

502
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,820
and so by waiting on the issue
consortium I'm

503
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:27,179
big things what you need to know both
where your target is and where your

504
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,559
target will be

505
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,269
and in order to track accurately

506
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:36,320
to moving in 3 second bursts becomes a
little bit unpredictable because you

507
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,250
wind up

508
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,890
moving too wary the satellite was three
seconds ago

509
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:46,100
which were very fast-moving satellite
can be off by more than half a degree

510
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,529
you can also enable and disable the
motors and they have different stepping

511
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:50,019
motors

512
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:53,409
to these are stepper motors which have

513
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:57,850
many different magnets and then and you
can move a fraction is dat

514
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,480
but if you want to freely move the death
to push it around

515
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,649
you need to disable the motors so when
everything is this Steven will do is it

516
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:07,220
will turn off the motors

517
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:11,010
if I order it till so that I can
physically reposition the dish

518
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:15,570
when and and debugging things

519
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,980
and this is the close up on rewiring the
motors

520
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,450
the he said big grey box on the right

521
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:27,299
that is a 250 watt microwave
transmission

522
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:30,710
I'm up

523
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:35,679
this is when the stepper motor is is
always something the the gear assemblies

524
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,149
so this is the motor on the bottom right
and you can see that is running a few

525
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:40,549
different gears and pulleys

526
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:44,269
in order to increase the motor string
and decrease its

527
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:47,809
the decreasing in speed also increases

528
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:51,470
its accuracy which is useful for me when
I'm trying to

529
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:57,019
track objects now I'll is also an
inertial measurement unit demand

530
00:32:57,019 --> 00:33:00,529
which is giving me all sorts of trouble
if I were to build another one in these

531
00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:04,779
I might leave the I am new album this is
the most expensive part in the dish

532
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:10,700
cost about five hundred dollars and I
used an actor now being 100% which has

533
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,399
men's accelerometer it has a gyroscope

534
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,039
and it has a compass now it

535
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:22,380
its easy with modern men's technology to
tell

536
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,860
how the hell did you are because you
just a teenager

537
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,190
the direction of gravity and gravity is
very strong

538
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,890
it's a lot harder to measure and your

539
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:36,100
as and your asthma like how far left and
right you've moved

540
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,279
because the magnetic field of the earth
is very inconsistent

541
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:43,519
not only does it move but it's several
degrees of frontier North

542
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,409
and it's very difficult to work this
into your math

543
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:51,630
and also it it drifts based upon
magnetic interference

544
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:56,340
from the motors and I made a mistake
amounting is too close to one of the

545
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,019
motors

546
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:00,559
soon the I'm the compass is the last
season's

547
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,760
at the turn of the heritage and then we
and our

548
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,809
for that it has been recently I

549
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:10,579
I needed another reason is like in love

550
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:15,429
so he and his giving you an actor
instead it was all about turning

551
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:20,000
the I'm the amazing and you can use it
went straight up

552
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,489
just like you know generating 80
training is free to your

553
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:27,760
lol believe this guy and I'm saying I
agree

554
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,909
and then you turn bills been very very
thing

555
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:33,970
and that's because we knew move your
mouse let anything

556
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:37,240
review telling your character to

557
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,859
rosy to his left and he went straight up

558
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:43,889
it in his saw

559
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:49,440
no position the company is ACE elevation
to the inertial measurement unit even

560
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,040
and he hasn't from another team

561
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,369
and the miller also help millions on
television and this allows me to send a

562
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:02,619
check to make sure that my mother is a
nice to earn any bells

563
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:08,210
and because when the retail stuff coming
in the linden trees

564
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,300
and messing around wish is

565
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,310
you always hours not especially if
you're trying to not let me know that i

566
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,700
won

567
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,119
and at night using aluminum to you know
English

568
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,570
in the left and right I A don't have an
immediate need for that

569
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:31,280
design easy and on solid ground into a
shed

570
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,099
I have made a difference which run
myself in Miami

571
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,460
radio there's a spectrum analyzer the

572
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,660
desert where is every single takes the
best

573
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,960
reagents for and then a tragic figure
out

574
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,760
how strong the signal isn't releasing
and also

575
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,930
how that strength the race movie ever in
position

576
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,089
and in with your router it is just a
little bit

577
00:35:57,089 --> 00:36:00,760
off to the left to the right and even
too high and low

578
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,510
and so that I can read these things out
for also telling

579
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,950
we're anticipating the raw almonds are
defined radio

580
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,170
and raise it directly into yes

581
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:16,099
right grab it later be the state's
several megabytes per second

582
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:20,410
so it's not usually mean I have to
download it to you live recording

583
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,460
which is difficult to do bill

584
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:29,470
on the a slow him in an action in a
small town

585
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,609
and i actually considering a 20 and a
buncha

586
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:37,420
I guess into trap so they can drive a
truck for the nearest big city

587
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,750
issues and yeah you know

588
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,070
and these crazy people in the Nativity
where

589
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:50,349
cyl is a spectrum didn't think the
decision on the

590
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:55,810
the %eh I salesman the frequency and the
name on this island I was targeting

591
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,000
and this is another figure out whether

592
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,890
a blessing only is various think even if
just

593
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:06,560
came on a little bit where exactly
consistent right to ask

594
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,220
%uh that's sad

595
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:15,650
this is when I you with a few months

596
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:21,660
I'm and the point presents all is
there's a Giants got it I'll using only

597
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,140
go and then Israel color the flames

598
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:30,490
by Ian different axes and then selecting
the lies that you find interesting

599
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:35,640
and see how the background ways find
jessica lynn you're interested in

600
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,890
me to my issue

601
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:43,020
a strong signal weak signal this is a
things

602
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,490
and then you can view different Las see
you might wanna see

603
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:50,970
I'm PVC you really see how the
diversions changes

604
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,010
is let you determine when it is I'll a
tracking was

605
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,250
listens to the air and you might also
lose

606
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:01,480
word ABC single-stranded regions in
order to television channels and yes

607
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,890
when the masses bank in order to find
local NHS

608
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,880
so not only can I listen to the radio
this but I and also has been left to

609
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,440
right and tell exactly in which
direction the organization s

610
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,300
and the plant billy is my

611
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,900
City easily do you single very

612
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,700
sure there is almost no I mean another
any the satellite logic in sight

613
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,500
the gigli does not understand this is an
elitist

614
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,869
doesn't understand it is moving to the
owners all eight

615
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:36,960
is doing is showing the results a

616
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,650
lesley Anne and apply it is I'll as an
artist

617
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:46,820
you can just as easily is million dollar
JavaScript to run

618
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:51,500
retired tools on these days and this
summer is all they had the lead

619
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,250
which is why it's not a problem for me
to run as on my cell phone on another on

620
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,660
because all I was doing is showing the
available data

621
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,950
like it

622
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:07,940
I'm I as i said im bored as either an
all-new

623
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,790
over and I'm Upolu

624
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:15,589
to the lead and accurate tracking and
Silas

625
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:19,720
I have is operating 24 hours a day for
months at a time

626
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,210
a we are now the decisions that a as in
all this time

627
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:28,040
things and trying to unify successfully
I have

628
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,210
something finally when he's working

629
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:35,320
I'm but I don't wanna the next to the

630
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,770
were scanned the entire sky

631
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:42,240
a every group has over Tennessee

632
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,329
I'm certain restricted idiot he said
last night and you basically my position

633
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:51,839
he has an interesting movies and less I
can get a life

634
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,369
such as eligible for themselves law when
they're in the wrong position this time

635
00:39:56,369 --> 00:40:00,089
for example russian television
satellites are adamant on an all nighter

636
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:04,130
they find very high in the northern
hemisphere very low in the southern

637
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,180
hemisphere

638
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:10,170
and the only transmit know the answer so
I didn't see you cannot see them and

639
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:10,790
reserve

640
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:14,040
I'm an excess

641
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,740
it is the intent wasn't to be seen by
Russia

642
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:22,609
I just can't see the satellites this day
still on the far side of the year

643
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:27,420
so many things that is a are over Asia I
will never see his the number and a nice

644
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,109
guy

645
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:32,190
but I'm getting us and I can take some
time to find me weddings and everything

646
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:32,960
else

647
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,380
by first identifying to see that he is
and then taking reporting on that

648
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,609
and the result is a visa to terrorize
incised

649
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:44,710
by you really wanna know that is a

650
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:48,670
play I don't like to build other
presentations

651
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:52,040
so this offer should be portable to your
hardware

652
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,780
and install model to having won the
lines were

653
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,800
and I have a rather large yard and I and

654
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,680
I'm wearing these things 7 I'll with it
and as a different frequencies

655
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,410
and Alyssa array8 satellite dishes like

656
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:11,810
sky I'm

657
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:16,150
is a another I the sadly I don't even
play where

658
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,470
this is an amateur radio

659
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:23,630
I'm satellite receiver this is for lower
taxes

660
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,800
the EU agencies

661
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,800
but it also requires less accurate
weighing

662
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,420
be his using in a direction and a
stylish

663
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:38,359
and I like to look at these you compare
it to my age

664
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:41,450
and president fears

665
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:45,710
and isolation and never let me have a
picture

666
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:51,550
I'm say this is Brad it turns out I was
pregnant when we took this photo

667
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,760
so if anyone would like it is let me
know

668
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:01,760
think tank

669
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,960
does is the way we're at it sells
whether or not I have time for questions

670
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:16,960
okay you have time either team as light

671
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,480

672
