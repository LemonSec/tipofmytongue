1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:13,830
I arrived from New York City yesterday

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:17,220
morning at 625 and tried to stay awake

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,920
all day and did a good job walking

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:24,330
around Moscow to China and the guide

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,240
walked us around and it reminded me as I

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:31,560
was putting this together that there is

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,260
a lot of history in Moscow hundreds of

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,690
years thousands you know and I started

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,540
thinking about how does that relate to

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:43,250
dev set comps how can we relate that to

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:47,070
dev suck-ups and what I came up with is

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:49,950
a very brief history so that we can lay

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,780
the groundwork for DevOps and Deb

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,210
suck-ups so that you can see where we're

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,629
going to be going with it for the the

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:04,580
next couple years how many people here

17
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:15,840
our developers very few operations

18
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:20,490
security ok the I use before DevOps and

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:24,600
after DevOps as my queue here so what we

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,970
have before DevOps it started in Japan

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,809
how many people know Deming I need to

22
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,450
know where we are here so right this is

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,200
like the god of DevOps right he started

24
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:40,799
conceptually the idea of DevOps what

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,340
Deming did is he got called to Japan

26
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:49,380
after World War Two to help build a new

27
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:52,409
process for the census in Japan and when

28
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:59,039
he was there he gave a talk and that

29
00:01:52,409 --> 00:02:02,159
talk talked about how to get a process

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,759
flow how to do a manufacturing flow and

31
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,970
get it to work properly and the the

32
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,980
companies in Japan really picked up on

33
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:15,650
the idea like Sony and Mitsubishi they

34
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,859
Toyota specifically you hear a lot about

35
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:24,340
Toyota when you study Deming and what he

36
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:30,970
did is he talked about this alright

37
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:35,180
the idea that you need to start building

38
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:38,900
the quality of the product at the very

39
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:42,319
beginning so that you don't have to go

40
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:45,830
back and redo what you did before at

41
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:49,640
more expense than you started with do

42
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:53,330
you recognize that quality starts at the

43
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,130
beginning and that includes security

44
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,989
he wasn't specifically talking about

45
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:00,799
security here but every time you see

46
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:03,830
quality in these slides I'd like you to

47
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:05,600
change the word to security in your mind

48
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,580
because it would start to make sense I

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,799
see people taking pictures which is

50
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,690
great you can have this slide deck when

51
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,549
I'm done I've got an email addressing

52
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,620
and sent me I'll send you the deck but

53
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:18,980
if they're powerful please take them and

54
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,140
tweet them out is there a hashtag to

55
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:26,570
turn to China for the conferences or

56
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:35,328
hashtag no okay so improving quality

57
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:37,519
reduces expenses well there we go that

58
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,400
sounds familiar if you're in security

59
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:45,010
this should sound familiar by now in

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:49,870
this time in history the idea of manual

61
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:53,420
mass inspection by a security team is

62
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:57,890
outdated at this point if your company

63
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:00,980
if your team is doing manual processing

64
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:05,268
for security processes you're already at

65
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:07,970
a loss because the systems are too

66
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:10,880
complex things are changing too quickly

67
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:14,350
and there's too much that can be missed

68
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,350
by a manual process

69
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:21,578
so we've got here supply chain

70
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,720
management there's three things I'd like

71
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,390
you to think about when we're talking

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,630
about supply chain management first one

73
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:32,080
is and Deming actually was much more

74
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:35,770
succinct than this Deming said find one

75
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,440
supplier but in the software industry if

76
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,570
we're looking at open source and whether

77
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,620
you know it or not you are using open

78
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,190
source when you're building your

79
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:48,070
applications 80% of the modern

80
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:51,040
application is built from open source

81
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,780
components what the source code is doing

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,470
is actually gluing those components

83
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,580
together

84
00:04:53,470 --> 00:05:00,850
so what Deming is saying is find the

85
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,460
best source of your open source

86
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:06,100
components don't just grab them in

87
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,219
general figure out who's doing the best

88
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:12,460
job and align yourself with that

89
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,820
provider not only do you choose the

90
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:20,409
minimum number of suppliers you take the

91
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:22,150
best parts from those suppliers so how

92
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,180
do you do that how do you find out what

93
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:29,799
the best parts are there are tools on

94
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:33,130
the market that will allow you to see if

95
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:37,479
a component is vulnerable and if it is

96
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:40,840
what version is available that is has is

97
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:43,360
relatively secure so we've got that then

98
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,729
we've got you've got to track and

99
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,250
monitor those this is the interesting

100
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:51,070
part that the industry is just catching

101
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:54,729
on to it doesn't matter that you've got

102
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,950
one supplier with the best parts if you

103
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:00,340
put those parts into production and you

104
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:05,440
don't know where they are and a

105
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:07,750
vulnerability is announced you lose it

106
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:13,419
is a game that we're playing here but it

107
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:16,330
is a critical game so minimum number of

108
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:18,310
suppliers the best parts from those

109
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,050
suppliers and once you put them into

110
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,600
your applications make sure that you

111
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,099
track and monitor you know where they

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,580
are in your application

113
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:31,650
how many people

114
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:34,990
remember heartbleed remember heartbleed

115
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:37,270
do you remember struts to multiple times

116
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:41,170
yeah the open-source guys know what I'm

117
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:43,599
talking about most people did not know

118
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:46,240
where struts to or if they even had

119
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,910
struts to in their application because

120
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,620
before there was automated security that

121
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,590
was actually tracking and monitor

122
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,150
components if you were doing it at all

123
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,690
you were doing it in an Excel

124
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:00,789
spreadsheet and so somebody had to go

125
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,770
and sit for six weeks to find out

126
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:05,410
through all of the applications in the

127
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:08,560
enterprise whether or not they were

128
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:11,170
using struts or not and from what we

129
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,360
have heard anecdotally they probably

130
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,910
missed a significant number of those

131
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,210
because it was a manual process as a

132
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:21,490
security professional I highly recommend

133
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,710
that you figure out a way so that you

134
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:27,700
can automate the process of tracking and

135
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,349
monitoring monitoring because the next

136
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,920
time this is going to happen and I'm

137
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,870
saying it is going to happen you'll have

138
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,980
a wait to get to the components that

139
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:42,310
were affected so how many people know

140
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:45,400
this book please put this on your list

141
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:48,760
this is a critical book it's called the

142
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,739
goal from Eli Goldratt Eli Cole read and

143
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,969
created the Theory of Constraints which

144
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,440
were going to run through real quickly

145
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,230
here so that you can see what he was

146
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,890
talking about this came out in 1984 I

147
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:02,220
read that book in it immediately in 1984

148
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:10,330
changed the way that I do business

149
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:15,780
so why every complex system and software

150
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:18,760
is as complex as you can get has a

151
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:22,030
bottleneck somewhere it has a problem

152
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:26,950
that is slowing the entire system down

153
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:29,979
and what Goldratt found out is most

154
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:34,860
people and I hope this word translates

155
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:38,440
properly but most people are optimizing

156
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,229
every single piece of their supply chain

157
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,190
and that is a complete waste of your

158
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,730
resources

159
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:48,069
that's what Goldratt was talking about

160
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:51,610
because the speed of your system is

161
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:53,529
dependent upon the slowest part and when

162
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:59,680
you hear that you go yeah that's that's

163
00:08:53,529 --> 00:09:02,379
right so if I've got simple chain I've

164
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,029
got five pieces in my chain and this is

165
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:06,189
running at a hundred percent 100 percent

166
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:10,060
forty percent 100 percent hundred

167
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:12,129
percent the forty percent part is the

168
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,550
one that is defining what your final

169
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:17,439
output is and that was something that

170
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,870
Goldratt did for the manufacturing

171
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:22,540
industry and we've taken that into the

172
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:25,689
DevOps processes and you'll see that

173
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,810
when Jean Kim comes up here here's gold

174
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:30,849
rats theory right here and I don't need

175
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,279
to read that for you but it probably

176
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,680
makes sense as you look at it that

177
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,470
you've got to find out where that

178
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,160
bottleneck is and you analyze your

179
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:45,220
system to say this is what's slowing me

180
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,189
down right here and then what you do is

181
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,589
you put your resources and focus them on

182
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:55,170
that part of the system because that's

183
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:55,170
the one that is driving your output

184
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:01,060
subordinate everything else that means

185
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:03,310
take the resources from everything else

186
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:07,089
and focus on that bottleneck because

187
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:10,359
that's what the real problem is then

188
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:12,790
once that constraint is alleviated it

189
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,990
opens up the bottleneck and now you've

190
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:20,709
got 80 100 100 100 100 you need to go to

191
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:24,040
the part that's got 80% capacity running

192
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:28,888
80% so this is the cycle that Goldratt

193
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,889
created and in his Theory of Constraints

194
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:40,240
in his book the goal he talks about a

195
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:45,009
Boy Scout Troop it's a camping they go

196
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,589
out camping and he realizes that as the

197
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:49,630
people as the boys are marching through

198
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:51,030
the mountains they're getting farther

199
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:55,380
and farther and far

200
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:57,839
apart and what happens is he realizes

201
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:01,380
that the fastest guy is always going to

202
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,480
be at the front and the slowest guy is

203
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,880
always going to be at the back that

204
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,910
makes sense right and so the whole

205
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:12,600
system itself of those people going

206
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:15,300
through that the camping trip is it gets

207
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,670
wider wider he stops the boys in the

208
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:21,420
middle of the March and he reverses the

209
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:24,030
line and he puts the slowest boy in the

210
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,209
front and goes all the way back to the

211
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:30,839
fastest guy so the slowest boy is in the

212
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:32,970
front determining the entire speed that

213
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,040
they're walking and that's what he's

214
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:38,460
talking about you want to place your

215
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,230
constraint as far upfront as you can so

216
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,360
that when you alleviate that constraint

217
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:46,980
the rest of the team can march much

218
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,230
faster behind you find this interesting

219
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,780
is are you finding something interesting

220
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:55,020
here I hope I'm not the good stuff yet

221
00:11:51,780 --> 00:12:03,180
but this is getting swarmed up so this

222
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:05,250
is ad after DevOps right in today's

223
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,959
world ten years later this doesn't sound

224
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,270
like much because when we have a hundred

225
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,100
thousand deploys a day at Amazon this

226
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,110
doesn't sound like much this was

227
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,150
unbelievable when John and Paul started

228
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:18,360
talking about it people at velocity

229
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,770
gasped and when you get the deck there's

230
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,020
a link in there so you can actually see

231
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:24,930
the presentation when these guys stepped

232
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,939
onstage and said we are deploying into

233
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:30,780
production ten times a day

234
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,110
heads snapped back this is unbelievable

235
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,110
right

236
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:39,510
so the presentation is in the deck there

237
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:42,480
so that you can see that then what we've

238
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,370
got is deficit cop state hasn't anybody

239
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,710
been to DevOps days before have you been

240
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,630
to DevOps neighs so is there one here in

241
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:55,890
Moscow does anybody do a DevOps day here

242
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:59,460
in Moscow this is regionally organized

243
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:01,260
events where speakers come and talk

244
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:04,620
about DevOps I mean I traveled around

245
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,330
the world doing this right so

246
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,310
that was the first time Patrick Dubois

247
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,060
and Chris bite are put that together

248
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,420
again

249
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:15,719
they had 77 and zero people show up that

250
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,189
first time and again it's like wow there

251
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,220
are people that recognize what we're

252
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,990
trying to do then jazz and Dave actually

253
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,450
created the continuous delivery book

254
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,460
again looking back on a historical

255
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,860
perspective you can start to see the

256
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,690
flow here well we've got then is John

257
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,210
Willis and Damon Edwards brings the

258
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:37,290
concept of DevOps days to the United

259
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:39,900
States and it starts to blow up then how

260
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:43,140
many people have read this again this is

261
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,939
an absolute critical book if you get one

262
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,890
book from this presentation this is the

263
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,950
book that you want again it's the

264
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:54,270
Phoenix project and what Jean did is he

265
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:57,120
took Eli gold rats book the goal that we

266
00:13:54,270 --> 00:14:00,360
just saw and turned it into a story

267
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,040
about an Operations team and a

268
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,940
development team working in an

269
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,699
enterprise and he uses the Theory of

270
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,710
Constraints

271
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:16,470
to move through the software supply

272
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:19,470
chain this is again this is critical

273
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,840
it's said in a different way by Jean but

274
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:24,240
it's the same thing it's the same thing

275
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,270
that go right the rat said you cannot

276
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,820
look at the entire system to determine

277
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:32,550
the speed you have to find out what your

278
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,640
constraints are and then optimize for

279
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,079
those constraints optimizing locally is

280
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,300
not going to do you any good

281
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,250
in fact that's what the manufacturing

282
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,650
problem was that gold rat was trying to

283
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:46,110
solve he went to the manufacturing

284
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:48,569
plants and he saw stacks and stacks of

285
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:53,010
pallets because they had made too much

286
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,780
stuff at different locations that were

287
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:57,390
piling into this one bottle neck and

288
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,550
this bottleneck was just surrounded by

289
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,860
piles of pallets waiting for work to get

290
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:04,530
done and we see that in the software

291
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,930
industry too because there's somebody

292
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,990
probably in your company he's the go-to

293
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:12,750
guy this guy knows everything right and

294
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:15,540
everybody goes to him for the answer if

295
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:17,730
you look closely that's probably your

296
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,620
bottleneck because he or his team are

297
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,860
over

298
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:24,620
and that's where you have to emphasize

299
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,760
we have to optimize that location within

300
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,040
this structure I see people nodding

301
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,319
their head yes that's good that you

302
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:35,240
recognize that you're even laughing it's

303
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:37,279
so recognizable that's great in 2014 the

304
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,360
first annual DevOps Enterprise Summit

305
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:45,290
gene who wrote this book started the dev

306
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:48,380
ops Enterprise Summit this was the first

307
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,969
time that all of the major enterprises

308
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,100
that we're using DevOps came together

309
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:58,100
under one roof and told their story to

310
00:15:52,100 --> 00:16:00,649
each other it's an absolute i opening

311
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,779
experience to see how the major banks

312
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:05,180
are using DevOps how the healthcare

313
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:11,480
system is using devops how target how

314
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:15,140
Nike how Starbucks is using DevOps then

315
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,480
in 2016 my partner dead weight Derek

316
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,029
weeks did the first annual state of the

317
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,250
software supply chain report that's when

318
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:24,560
it launched and it started looking at

319
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:28,010
the industry as a whole what patterns

320
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,529
are we seeing so in that supply chain

321
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,709
report I want you to keep these numbers

322
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:35,930
in mind as we're moving forward here 131

323
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:38,510
billion downloads at the time we looked

324
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:41,149
at that we said oh Jesus that that's

325
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:44,089
incredible there's 31 billion downloads

326
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:46,810
of open-source components annually being

327
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:50,240
called from the maven central repository

328
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:54,018
then we started looking at it there's a

329
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,750
problem because one in every 16 of those

330
00:16:54,019 --> 00:17:00,110
downloads had a known vulnerability in

331
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:02,269
it when developers are just grabbing

332
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:06,049
what they need I need a logging

333
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:08,419
framework and they're not actually

334
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:11,119
analyzing whether it's vulnerable not or

335
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:12,549
not or has an announced vulnerable

336
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,649
that's even worse

337
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:18,139
it has an announced vulnerability

338
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,809
there's a real problem there and we can

339
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,160
go through this I'm keep those numbers

340
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:24,500
in mind because I'm gonna walk through

341
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,660
it yearly as we go here then the first

342
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,780
annual all-day DevOps conference how

343
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,580
many people have heard of all-day DevOps

344
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:35,330
good I'm the co-founder of that

345
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:37,580
so thanks for being here

346
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:40,490
this was an interesting concept because

347
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:43,129
we do it all live online there's no

348
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:46,160
physical location Derek and I came up

349
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:49,190
with the idea in ninety days later nine

350
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,200
zero days later we had thirteen thousand

351
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,020
four hundred people globally signed up

352
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,930
and that's when we realized okay this is

353
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,870
now a global phenomena DevOps is here

354
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:02,930
it's huge

355
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,699
so we did fifteen time zone 15 hours 54

356
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,050
sessions

357
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,300
everybody was delivering live from their

358
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:10,399
desktop wherever they were so we were

359
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,830
able to get some of the best DevOps

360
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,340
stories in the world in front of the

361
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:18,740
rest of the world then the state of the

362
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:22,490
software supply chain report in 2017 was

363
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:27,290
released we're looking at this 52

364
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:30,260
billion downloads the next year that's

365
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:34,490
how fast this growth of open source in

366
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:36,110
using open source is going there's a lot

367
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,940
of data in here you can download those

368
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,550
reports the links are in the slide deck

369
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,490
just look at that just to kind of get a

370
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:46,399
glimpse of what's going on it's it's

371
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:48,710
really really impressive when you look

372
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,070
at the numbers that way second annual

373
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:56,870
dips all day DevOps conference we had

374
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:59,450
30,000 people register so from 13400 to

375
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:01,879
the next year 30,000 we had doubled in

376
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,680
audience again DevOps was permeating

377
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:08,300
throughout the culture as far as

378
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:10,550
software supply chain was concerned what

379
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,970
I notice it's because I'm the one that

380
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:16,700
that helps look at the figures after the

381
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,410
event is over I looked at it before what

382
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,830
the speakers were we had a call for

383
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:23,870
papers out and I looked and said what do

384
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,520
people want to talk about and this was

385
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:28,550
the first year we had actually seen this

386
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,460
and I cannot stress this enough if you

387
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:33,770
are starting a DevOps initiative or a

388
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,650
dev psych ops initiative you do not

389
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:41,510
start with the tools you start with the

390
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:44,480
culture you have to get a buy-in from

391
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,320
the company from the developers all the

392
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,740
way up to the sea

393
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:52,460
sweet in order to get a DevOps

394
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:54,110
initiative started and if anybody in

395
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,639
here you're sitting next to anybody that

396
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,830
has done DevOps I think they will

397
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:59,959
confirm that because if you don't get

398
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,269
buy-in by the time you get halfway down

399
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,070
the track there's an there's nothing

400
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:07,220
left because you don't have the support

401
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:10,519
you need to make it happen then gene

402
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:12,529
jazz patent and in John did the DevOps

403
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,870
handbook another thing that was huge

404
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:19,759
software supply tanking report comes out

405
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:22,209
again breaches increased fifty five

406
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:25,610
percent in one year

407
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:28,429
what has happened is the adversaries

408
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,830
that are actually hacking into the

409
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:32,840
systems breaking into the systems have

410
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,759
found something that most people aren't

411
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,928
aware of and I'm going to show you that

412
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:41,179
in a second here if you take nothing

413
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:43,399
away from the slides with all the

414
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:45,139
research on it this is the one right

415
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:48,918
here that will make a difference in how

416
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:52,479
you do things the exploit time has

417
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:54,860
decreased by ninety three percent

418
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,659
meaning where it used to be you had

419
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:02,350
forty five days to fix a vulnerability

420
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:09,740
that you had found that has been Deacon

421
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:11,320
decompressed by 93% third annual DevOps

422
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,750
all-day DevOps

423
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:18,860
it just keeps growing this is the tenth

424
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:24,200
anniversary year of Patrick and Chris in

425
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:26,059
Kent for DevOps days then again if you

426
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,980
are a company here in Moscow and

427
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:32,000
somebody has not produced the DevOps

428
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:34,279
days jump in because what we need is

429
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,850
these are local organizers producing

430
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:40,580
these events and bringing in regional

431
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:42,289
speakers plus you can usually get an

432
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,178
international speaker or two to come to

433
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:45,620
something especially in Moscow everybody

434
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:53,720
wants to come to Moscow this is great

435
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:56,750
it's been fine so this is how quickly

436
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,720
DevOps days spread around the world the

437
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:03,040
first year they did it

438
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:06,370
there was one event next year there was

439
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:09,520
for six and five and then all the way up

440
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:12,629
to this year there are 72 of these

441
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:16,300
events around the world all run locally

442
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:22,240
I'd love to see one here I'd love to see

443
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:28,389
one here it looks like dev SEC ops days

444
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:31,960
is on track to do that too so why do we

445
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:36,220
need security as a part of DevOps what

446
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:39,160
is dev SEC ops and why have we put that

447
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:42,100
SEC in the middle of the word here if

448
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,050
you don't know Shannon you want to put

449
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,730
her on your radar this is somebody that

450
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:49,389
you want to know I call her the

451
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:54,070
godmother of dev SEC ops she actually

452
00:22:49,390 --> 00:23:00,520
wrote the dev SEC ops manifesto right as

453
00:22:54,070 --> 00:23:04,480
she defined why we need it and it's

454
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,940
important to realize this that it's no

455
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:11,410
longer just the security team's

456
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:14,110
responsibility to do security everyone

457
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:17,670
in that software development lifecycle

458
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,870
in that supply chain has to be

459
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:23,410
responsible for the security at their

460
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:24,959
point of contact this is an arguable you

461
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:28,180
we can't argue about this anymore

462
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,520
because the security team can't do it

463
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,920
not only can't they do it they can't

464
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,200
stand on the outside of the process and

465
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,610
let you develop your software and then

466
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,820
now you at the end before it's supposed

467
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:46,449
to go into production this is what

468
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:49,389
Shannon had in the manifesto but

469
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:51,070
basically the main thing that she's

470
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:55,840
trying to get at in which we all picked

471
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:58,929
up on is that security must be apart

472
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,810
from the very beginning must be part of

473
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:05,250
the system that's building the software

474
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:05,250
not something that's tacked on

475
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:12,720
how many people are on a security team

476
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:15,840
that actually works daily with the

477
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:20,909
developers oh that's great that's very

478
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:25,529
good that's very good okay

479
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:27,929
I produced the DEF set cops day of the

480
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:29,850
workshop at RSA Conference in San

481
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:33,659
Francisco and Singapore every year and

482
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:37,559
so as we were producing that we built up

483
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:40,470
the audience now we have it is actually

484
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:45,360
a confirmed part of every one of the RSA

485
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:49,559
conferences you guys know John yeah John

486
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:53,120
Willis is a good guy he's he wrote

487
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:55,799
something because the dev ops people

488
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,379
were saying why in the hell are you

489
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,110
putting the word sack into dev ops

490
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:04,140
you're just confusing everybody

491
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:07,020
and John's response was hey get over it

492
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,909
it's just the name but what John learned

493
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,350
and you can take this back to your team

494
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:14,880
with you if you really want to sell the

495
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:17,668
idea of dev seconds when John would go

496
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:22,610
in to talk to executives and he talked

497
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:26,250
about DevOps their eyes would glaze over

498
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:29,070
bored them silly with that but when he

499
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:31,010
said dev SEC ups he put the security in

500
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:34,230
there they lit up because they

501
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:36,779
understand what security means in a

502
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:40,620
general sense nothing a level you guys

503
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:43,500
do but when you say that this process is

504
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:45,149
going to help security that's when the

505
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:50,100
checkbooks start coming out and you can

506
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:54,389
get your project done so John and I went

507
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:56,340
to London with Chris and Aubrey was

508
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:59,700
there and we actually did the first

509
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,918
depths a cop stays in London and then we

510
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:06,299
did one in San Francisco and one in

511
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:08,130
Singapore that first year epic failures

512
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:11,340
and dev said cops I was sitting at a bar

513
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:13,320
in Singapore and we had just finished an

514
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,330
event and all the speakers were sitting

515
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,689
there telling war stories saying oh I

516
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:19,139
completely destroyed a system by doing

517
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,720
some

518
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:24,179
and we all started laughing and said why

519
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,080
don't we write a book about this so this

520
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:29,760
book is actually telling you how

521
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,428
professionals failed themselves and

522
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:37,950
saying this is how I completely hosed a

523
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:39,090
system we're gonna actually be signing

524
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,070
some of these today go up to the

525
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,770
swordfish booth after this is over I've

526
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,700
gotten you know some copies I can sign

527
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,549
and give out to people that are

528
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,840
interested in that so second year of dev

529
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:50,879
set cops days we did pretty good

530
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,709
remember I I'm looking at Patrick since

531
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,010
then okay he only had four the first

532
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:59,370
year and look I've got eight so maybe I

533
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:01,740
can have a hundred and forty two of

534
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,719
these things going on in ten years from

535
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:09,419
now that would be great

536
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:11,940
now that's laying the groundwork what I

537
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,679
want to do now is start to show you some

538
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,500
data that we've got from the research

539
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,140
from the software supply chain can I

540
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,929
just I want to take a breath here and

541
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:25,080
ask was there anything new in there for

542
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:26,580
you that we just went through you were

543
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,990
laughing half the time so I knew you

544
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,659
recognized what we were talking about

545
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,940
I'm hoping that there was something new

546
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:36,030
that to get you to think about DevOps

547
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,260
and dev say cops and how it can actually

548
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,629
make a difference when you're building

549
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:43,590
software and now I want to show you some

550
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:46,440
statistics on why we've proven that it's

551
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:48,689
the way to go how many people have heard

552
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:53,549
of Equifax everybody raise your hand

553
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:54,620
because they've got your data right this

554
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:59,250
is interesting

555
00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:01,790
three days in March sounds like a John

556
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:07,110
Clancy spy novel three days in March

557
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:10,889
what happened is struts the struts team

558
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:14,010
at Apache announced through the the

559
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:18,169
channels that there was a problem with

560
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:20,850
struts to and within three days the

561
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:26,760
adversaries had hacked into the Equifax

562
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:30,719
system using that exact exploit Equifax

563
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,740
did not know of the breach for five more

564
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,929
months

565
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:37,360
so the adversaries were in their system

566
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:39,669
that long before they recognized that

567
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,219
they had struts and they need to do

568
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:44,289
something about it

569
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:48,220
and what you've got is everybody is

570
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:52,299
pounding on beating up Equifax it wasn't

571
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:58,120
just Equifax there were major major

572
00:28:52,299 --> 00:29:03,970
systems around the world that were

573
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:05,709
broken into using that exploit I want to

574
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:08,799
make sure that we can see this I don't

575
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:11,769
know if it's big enough 65 percent of

576
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:16,990
the Fortune 100 download vulnerable

577
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:21,639
versions of struts right now that's

578
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:24,070
scary right so here's the way it works

579
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:27,070
here's the stats that you can take back

580
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:31,590
with you here's the struts vulnerability

581
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:34,629
announced Equifax announces the breach

582
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:37,418
this is the thing that I just go I can't

583
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:41,350
believe this because you have more

584
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:43,870
downloads of struts to after the breach

585
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:53,379
is announced then you have before it was

586
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:58,000
announced so we used to have in 2006 we

587
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:59,289
had 45 days to fix the breach before the

588
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,980
adversaries have figured out a way to

589
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:05,019
get into your system now that time has

590
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,809
been condensed down to three days

591
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:09,610
actually it's only a matter of hours but

592
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:12,158
this is more believable right if

593
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:14,529
somebody knows what the exploit is and

594
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:18,429
they know that you're using that

595
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:22,120
component this is what happens very very

596
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:24,700
quickly fifty nine thousand data

597
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:28,320
breaches have been reported to the GDP

598
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:33,120
our regulators since May 20 eighteen

599
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,120
fifty nine thousand data breaches

600
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:39,339
most people don't know this when I put

601
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:41,289
this up here or when we talk to

602
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:43,928
companies about how much open-source are

603
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:45,849
you using most of them think very little

604
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:51,819
we have so many developers we're writing

605
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:55,089
all the code no that's not the way it

606
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:58,599
works anymore whether you you're using

607
00:30:55,089 --> 00:31:00,908
the NPM repository for JavaScript where

608
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:02,158
the using the maven central repository

609
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:04,809
for Java

610
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,899
whether you use in the nougat repository

611
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:10,569
for dotnet components it doesn't matter

612
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:13,299
everyone is using open-source every

613
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:18,219
major financial system in the world is

614
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:21,189
using open-source and that's where we

615
00:31:18,219 --> 00:31:23,019
need to be much more vigilant in the

616
00:31:21,189 --> 00:31:24,519
lifecycle so that when things are

617
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:28,059
deployed when things are in production

618
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:30,609
we need to know number one is what

619
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:34,959
components are we using and number two

620
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:37,269
where are they located and once you have

621
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:41,769
that you have to be a way to be

622
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:45,069
automatically notified if that component

623
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:46,719
is announced as known vulnerable if you

624
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,739
don't have if you have tracking and

625
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:51,359
monitoring but you don't have

626
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,359
notification you don't have anything

627
00:31:54,029 --> 00:32:01,629
this is the trajectory of the download

628
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:07,259
of open source java components from the

629
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:07,259
central repository when you look at this

630
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:16,499
it's it's unbelievable at 2014 you're

631
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:19,959
looking at 17 billion here we are

632
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:24,459
five six years later and we're at 146

633
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:26,979
billion and at that pace we're looking

634
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:28,989
at over a quarter of a trillion

635
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:32,589
downloads just from the central

636
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:34,629
repository next year if you don't think

637
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:36,789
you're using open source in your systems

638
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:41,759
you're mistaken and there's a security

639
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:44,439
professional it's odd to me personally

640
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:47,079
that security professionals don't

641
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:48,190
realize that they're putting 90% of

642
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:53,350
their by

643
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:56,140
around defense parameter and maybe 10%

644
00:32:53,350 --> 00:33:00,040
maybe if we're lucky 10% towards the

645
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:02,020
application layer when the application

646
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,980
layer is the biggest thing that we're

647
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,889
dealing with here

648
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:08,680
as open source protecting the open

649
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:10,750
source components is that bottleneck

650
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:15,730
that we talked about with goal ratna

651
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:20,470
with jean kim problem is not all parts

652
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:22,720
are created equal again find a source

653
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:24,940
find a supplier that you trust it's

654
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,320
writing good components and use that

655
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:30,850
supplier and choose their best

656
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:33,879
components well we've found through the

657
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:36,790
software supply chain report is people

658
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,950
are not building quality in at the

659
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:42,790
beginning and they're paying for it

660
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:45,460
exponentially at the end I want you to

661
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:48,460
do a quick calculation in your head if

662
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:50,650
there is a vulnerability that is found

663
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,450
at the very beginning of your lifecycle

664
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:55,870
your development lifecycle and you can

665
00:33:52,450 --> 00:34:00,070
fix it there how much money have you

666
00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:02,500
saved if you waited until that

667
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:06,100
vulnerability got into production this

668
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,720
is happening daily and then you get

669
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,330
caught and you have to go back and fix

670
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,440
it there's not even a comparison in

671
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:18,969
money if you fix it at the beginning

672
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,290
it's it's I can't even say how much more

673
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:24,219
efficient it is to fix it at the

674
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:26,949
beginning not building quality in ten

675
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:30,810
point three percent of those hundred and

676
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:35,620
thirty billion downloads had known

677
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:39,100
vulnerabilities in them ten percent of

678
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:41,580
the components downloaded from the

679
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:45,310
central repository had known

680
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:47,860
vulnerabilities that means that those

681
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:51,489
vulnerabilities were put into production

682
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:57,790
they're actually being used and the

683
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:59,870
problem is this there's 75 security

684
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:03,380
people in this room

685
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:07,759
I would guess that the 75 security

686
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:10,400
people are probably you know if you're

687
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,220
outnumbered a hundred to one that means

688
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,690
what are you doing you've got 7500

689
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:18,649
people that you're trying to serve us

690
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:22,310
7,500 items that you're trying to deal

691
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:25,400
with as a security person you cannot do

692
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:27,470
this alone and that's what I want you to

693
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:31,000
take away from this presentation is that

694
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:36,200
and you shouldn't have to do it alone

695
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:38,600
what we need what we need is the ability

696
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,419
for everybody within that software

697
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:44,270
supply chain development lifecycle to be

698
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:47,060
a part of working with you

699
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:50,660
not that you're mandating anything what

700
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:54,049
we found is if as security people we go

701
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:56,930
in and we actually give guidelines and

702
00:35:54,050 --> 00:36:01,880
say stay within this area here and

703
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:04,730
you'll be ok or you know let's work on

704
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,010
the most critical things there's that

705
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:09,560
bottleneck you can work on the most

706
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:12,410
critical thing is the most important

707
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,420
things with the team don't try to do

708
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,339
everything I know when I first started

709
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:20,870
doing this and you you old timers have

710
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:22,880
seen it too you'd run a report and you

711
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:24,680
get a 600 page document and it's

712
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,620
slamming on the developers desk and say

713
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:30,529
here's the problems you got to deal with

714
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:33,589
right that that happens that and

715
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:43,250
hopefully not anymore so here's the

716
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:46,540
problem what that says is that if you're

717
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:51,220
used to doing something a specific way

718
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:56,150
you will continue to do it that way

719
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:57,980
despite knowing that it's the not the

720
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,900
right way to do it it's because this is

721
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,050
what the system has been set up to

722
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:08,060
support you to do and you really have to

723
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:10,960
go against the system to make this whole

724
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,960
process work

725
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:25,200
there you go 2014 to 2019 so breaches

726
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:27,509
increased 71% why is that it's a

727
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,759
combination of things but if you look

728
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:32,849
back at what we did here as far as

729
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:38,640
analyzing what the attack interface is

730
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:41,190
and the time to exploit versus the time

731
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:50,160
to remediate you can see where that

732
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:52,680
comes from there it is there's that

733
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,259
speed again I keep repeating myself on

734
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:58,230
this because it's so important you don't

735
00:37:55,259 --> 00:38:01,400
have as a security professional you

736
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:04,980
don't have the time anymore

737
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,769
to manually go through a process for 45

738
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,359
days when the people that are exploiting

739
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:11,700
your system are within the system within

740
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:14,730
three days it's just a losing game

741
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,950
there's no way you can win you've got to

742
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,769
find a way to build automation and

743
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:23,038
security gates into the software itself

744
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:25,169
into the process itself if you want to

745
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:31,410
be able to remediate at the speed of

746
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:39,299
exploit where does this all take us here

747
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:41,009
where is this all take us I usually get

748
00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:46,309
a laugh on that one come on

749
00:38:41,009 --> 00:38:50,670
does it not translate you cannot inspect

750
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:56,480
quality into a product product has to be

751
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:56,480
built safe you don't inspect it safe

752
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:07,980
one of the things that the industry has

753
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,300
started to realize through research and

754
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,869
Nicole fours grant

755
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:14,910
Jezz humble jean kim derek weeks the

756
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:18,390
people that are analyzing on how all

757
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:22,200
this stuff works what they've actually

758
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:26,879
found is that people that deploy more

759
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:30,660
often or more secure when you think that

760
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:36,570
through it makes a ton of sense if you

761
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:38,730
are only deploying once a week and the

762
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:41,450
typical exploit is done within three

763
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:44,010
days you've already lost four days and

764
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:47,569
most people when you look at it

765
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:50,430
you can see they're they're not

766
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:56,400
deploying at the speed with which is

767
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:58,470
going to be the safest way to do it so

768
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,980
when you look at this how many people

769
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:05,160
know what a software bill of materials

770
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,839
is and yeah this is one that we're just

771
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,930
starting to work on in depth in the

772
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:13,080
united states here to is that a software

773
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:16,529
bill of materials means that you provide

774
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:18,000
a list of all of the components that are

775
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:21,330
within your application and that

776
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,520
application carries that around with it

777
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:25,830
it's when you go to a grocery store

778
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,800
there's a list of ingredients on every

779
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:32,480
item so you know what's in those why

780
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:36,150
aren't we doing that with software a

781
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,830
software bill of materials tells me we

782
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:39,859
can do it with containers I'm sure

783
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:42,690
everybody here is using containers

784
00:40:39,859 --> 00:40:44,848
what's in that container and how do you

785
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,609
find out why do we have to go and

786
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:49,230
actually pull that container to find out

787
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:51,180
what's in it why doesn't it carry a

788
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:53,700
software bill of materials around with

789
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:56,250
it well I don't your applications do

790
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,368
that and now you've got something that's

791
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,830
tangible when something gets announced

792
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:06,000
so mature

793
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:08,460
DevOps practices my 50% of those are

794
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,250
using software bill and materials like

795
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,800
that the other thing we want to take

796
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:17,670
with us again I'm reiterating with gold

797
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:20,850
with Deming no Jean Kim said is please

798
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:23,700
look at the entire system not just the

799
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:27,450
local pieces you want to look at the

800
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:32,399
flow of the entire system and never pass

801
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:34,140
a defect downstream this is getting

802
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,510
massaged a little bit

803
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:39,089
I know DJ chalene brought it up two

804
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:40,470
years ago at RSA he said one of the

805
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:45,120
things that we can do is security

806
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:47,370
experts is we cannot slow down the

807
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:50,910
system as security experts because it's

808
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:51,240
the business to put out software all

809
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,640
right

810
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:57,299
banks aren't in the business of money

811
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:59,850
right now banks are in the process of

812
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:05,130
being technology companies that happen

813
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:07,380
to be in the finance industry right so

814
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:11,880
when we're looking at this what DJ said

815
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:14,400
is we can take a defect and allow it to

816
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,520
move through the system but it has to be

817
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,170
tagged to say this is an exploit here

818
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:24,030
that's gonna have to be taken care of

819
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:26,400
before it goes into production so the

820
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:28,770
component can move along the venerable

821
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,200
component but the people that are

822
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:33,150
working the system understand that

823
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,589
that's never gonna make it into

824
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,750
production but it gives people time to

825
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:40,500
fix it while the entire system keeps

826
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:41,250
moving so here's the takeaways I want to

827
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,000
do with you here

828
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:47,310
number one is everyone is responsible I

829
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,430
know user security people in here but

830
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:53,670
let's start thinking about being part of

831
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:57,149
the entire team and having the team

832
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:59,850
working with you on security the next

833
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:04,890
one is local optimization does not

834
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:06,750
increase the speed of the system just

835
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:09,990
because you get everything except this

836
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:12,150
single piece working fast this is the

837
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:15,209
slow parts what's defining the output of

838
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:18,720
the system and the big one here in this

839
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:21,660
room is it is literally impossible today

840
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,209
in the security industry to manually do

841
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:26,160
security you cannot do it there's too

842
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:27,420
much stuff going on if there's a hundred

843
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,500
and thirty nine B

844
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:33,779
in Downloads going on there has to be

845
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,559
some kind of management as part of that

846
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:38,880
system so first thank you I hope there

847
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:40,440
was something here that you could take

848
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,180
