1
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:09,780
good afternoon my name is Alex attorney

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,240
and I'm the leading specialist in the

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,790
Arras telecom today we'll be speaking

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,900
about leaks all kinds of leaks not only

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,448
leaks from databases but all the way to

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:24,570
the leaks of the shadow resources now

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:28,560
different online stores and yes leaks

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,119
are usually happened in all kinds of

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,030
companies and the small business and

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:36,780
even the common developers sometimes

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,550
allow this to happen sometimes we hear

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,890
about different cases and today we'll

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,709
consider several cases of how to

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,230
identify these inside cases what do you

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,030
do with this we will also look at the

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,489
leaks from the logs credentials

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,050
configuration files and will try to find

18
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,849
the best word from the database without

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,620
even approach into a database and simply

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,410
without collecting the whole bunch of

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,369
leaks in addition to cases we'll discuss

22
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,950
what can be found why things are looking

23
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,750
away and where you can find it right

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,700
here in right now and how should I look

25
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,040
I'm afraid in the future we'll be

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,530
discussing the right monitoring process

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,049
and the process of finding the link so

28
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,060
I'll be speaking about the matrix

29
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:23,130
because the domani tor attack and attack

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,140
is simply impossible now during the

31
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,289
attack but we can model certain threats

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,180
and to avert these threats prior to

33
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,560
attack let's begin by saying that before

34
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,850
a looking for something you have to

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,650
understand that what you're looking for

36
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,970
for a company these could be a corporate

37
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:41,369
documents original files tech

38
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,710
information contracts you name it each

39
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,140
company has its own list you simply have

40
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,850
to build to lease number one would be

41
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,909
the files you would like to find and the

42
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,589
second one is the text data because you

43
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,420
will be looking for these two things

44
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,829
differently in terms of the text

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,200
information you have to look for your

46
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,059
search option how of the big flow of

47
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,450
data you'll find what any this could be

48
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,329
a regular expressions keywords seem mean

49
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,840
hash or the flexible search and you

50
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,549
don't have to take into account that the

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,900
attackers are smart and if they'll be

52
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,380
writing something about you at the

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,450
former

54
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,670
social media there will be you know

55
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,440
using their own pronunciation slang

56
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,700
abbreviations of your company you name

57
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,390
it so that you would never be able to

58
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,549
find them also minded that we are going

59
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,709
to be using a lot of different search

60
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,600
engines so web search engines or our

61
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,540
search functions and different resources

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:39,810
the search algorithms are different and

63
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:42,410
one phrase one word could be decided in

64
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,030
two words each word will be normalized

65
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,320
in the nominative nominative case and

66
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,020
then all the documents will be found

67
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,530
which have the same word or expression

68
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:56,220
so it would be sensible to make two sets

69
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,080
of or two cents for search with one we

70
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,580
are finding in search engines what we

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,890
like and secondly we will verify that

72
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,600
this information is right in addition to

73
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,269
that for files we also can find several

74
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,769
approaches that is so you have two files

75
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,790
for example I want to compare them the

76
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:16,620
classical approach would be I can try

77
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:19,320
and everywhere to to count md5 then say

78
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,090
one ash a 256 hashes they will be

79
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,620
different for different files its

80
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,750
aggravated by situation if you'll just

81
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,340
open the document in Word the world can

82
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,570
add some information and the document

83
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,300
will be different even though you did

84
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,820
not change anything in a document the

85
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,460
md5 hash does not suit for this goal

86
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,870
also it's a cryptographic hash function

87
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,790
for 100 documents there'll be no

88
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,010
difference quick calculation but if they

89
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,700
have they're like a million documents it

90
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:47,370
will create some additional challenges

91
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,799
and I would recommend to look towards a

92
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,140
city hash it's quite fast it's good for

93
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:56,070
these kind of tasks also there's the SS

94
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:59,190
deep hash just for searching for malware

95
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,260
when it's been reconfigured when there

96
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,320
are certain changes in a file it works

97
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,899
just great but it's also quite slow you

98
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,060
can use a low profiles by yarra rules

99
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,209
but the yarra rules we first have to

100
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,220
write which means the manual task which

101
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:17,399
we would like to avoid another approach

102
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,110
is way of their text data we can extract

103
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,459
all the text and to make a comparison

104
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,890
[Music]

105
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,510
like I described for the text file for

106
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,729
example you can use the same hash and

107
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,940
mean hash algorithms which enable you to

108
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:32,760
compare just how how different two texts

109
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,310
are but you should not use them just

110
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,960
everywhere because if the particular

111
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,780
warden on the structure of the text will

112
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,090
be changed the same hash will show you a

113
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,549
big differences in the text they would

114
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,020
be good to use for deleting the

115
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,520
duplicates if one a leak has been

116
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,400
published in the forum somebody just

117
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,770
let's say quoted it in social media okay

118
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,169
we understand what we are going to look

119
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,640
for we've built a list of files the Dex

120
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,280
we have the list of signatures and

121
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,830
search methods but next we have to

122
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,380
understand why these get likk at all I

123
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,030
will be very brief away at many these

124
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,909
discussions about that and the main

125
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:11,640
reasons are insiders we decided to make

126
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,860
money to leak data of yours or your

127
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,870
clients so simply to cause harm to your

128
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,280
to your company including the ciphering

129
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,960
also there is a low qualification a

130
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,250
leaks and biggest of the lack of

131
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,640
knowledge many people do not know that

132
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:29,520
that you know to upload corporate files

133
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,620
some could be a bad idea because some

134
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,380
people can get access to them we are

135
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,690
humans and to to err is human we may

136
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,780
forget things oftentimes admins they

137
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,880
forget to delete backups which they

138
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,090
installed in there in the core of their

139
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,590
web service sometimes they upload some

140
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,280
data on the gate and then forget to

141
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,469
clean up

142
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,190
and of course compromising you should

143
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:56,250
not forget about it if the email of your

144
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,870
top manager has been compromised and

145
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,180
then all or the whole database has been

146
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,580
stolen published on the forum knowing

147
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,320
what we're looking for and what are the

148
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,599
reasons we can assume of where we could

149
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,610
find this information and how it's a

150
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,850
it's a green field let's begin with web

151
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:14,220
resources and classic a classic case

152
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,210
would be when somebody a forgot a file

153
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,360
on the web server will be the

154
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:21,060
configuration files or setting files or

155
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,820
their database dumps you name it this

156
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,820
can be identified by search engines and

157
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:29,880
darks and by at the facing or menial

158
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:32,370
scaling but there are some tricks here

159
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,360
in case we're using the search engine in

160
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,789
dorks

161
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,229
then we have the problem because the

162
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:39,810
search engines they do not like baths

163
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:41,729
and they are defending themselves there

164
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,360
are some additional limitations and more

165
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:46,620
often than not you will run into that it

166
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,020
is not the difficult you can solve this

167
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:53,310
problem but you use the dark 4000 darks

168
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:55,948
like in the HDP this could be a certain

169
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,110
mean certain differences difficult it's

170
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:00,270
so many resources for example there s mm

171
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,000
and advertisement it's a problem they

172
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,219
always need to monitor just how popular

173
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,479
their website is in terms of the search

174
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:12,590
engine optimization see RPI is resource

175
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:15,539
it makes inquiries to Google and then

176
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,789
gives you a Jason it's not a cheap

177
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:20,938
solution but this is also an option or

178
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:23,310
we can just do it by hand do the capture

179
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,990
and the but this are over 4000 captures

180
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,539
I don't want to do it I will go to the

181
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,610
inter capture services which solve this

182
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:32,120
kind of capture or we can do it

183
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,650
differently we cannot allow the captures

184
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,779
you have to change IP addresses to

185
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,669
employees and different times of change

186
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:41,099
cookies change your titles and hats

187
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,900
imitate your users behavior and many

188
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:44,819
many other problems of which you have to

189
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,979
solve which is so which is very dubious

190
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,900
another option I would like to offer you

191
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:52,969
is basically if you go like through the

192
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:55,109
face as an example on the Left it's

193
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:59,250
example fund of the case when internal

194
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,990
documentation of one government was sir

195
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,300
if it became available is simply because

196
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,180
they forgot to limit access to one

197
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,400
folder you can identify it with with

198
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,689
with facing you have to identify what

199
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,250
kind of files you want to find on the

200
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,779
web server you can go to the countries

201
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,389
and ask them to give the interesting

202
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:17,939
files go to pentesters to get something

203
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:20,310
from them or from item number first with

204
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,139
the files we can add also of them to the

205
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,060
dictionary then take your posture both

206
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,099
fast and go to the server and to look

207
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,949
for these files but if you do it not

208
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:31,469
once each quarter but every week or

209
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:37,229
every day because attackers are doing it

210
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:39,510
always also if the website is a web you

211
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,550
you have to bypass it somehow you have

212
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,860
to switch it off at the protection it's

213
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:46,260
not a best idea the next thing would be

214
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,130
the file service leaks I mean not only

215
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,350
FTP server

216
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:53,910
but also see files next cloud or Amazon

217
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,800
will consider only those or what the

218
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,480
authorization is switched off at this

219
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,189
kind of service oftentimes you can find

220
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:04,410
documents and files contracts very often

221
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,360
if you see that usually it is happening

222
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,030
because somebody from the regional

223
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,340
department let's say open partners had

224
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,199
to be you know handed documents so they

225
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,750
open access to everyone you can find it

226
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,150
with search engines they're scanning

227
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,870
internet and indexing files such as the

228
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:25,350
search FTPS ORS or gray head for buckets

229
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,910
but there is also a problem when here

230
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,510
today I was double checking all of that

231
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:33,000
I think Megan and search FCPS it did not

232
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,590
work very well they're unstable we do

233
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,510
not know how often they do the scan in

234
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,040
it and to look for that it's very

235
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,650
difficult because if I'll find some

236
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,730
links via them then this Alex I will I

237
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:48,770
will highlight to them so I want to come

238
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:52,560
myself and begin to scan internet with a

239
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:54,240
mask an as it maps all sensors much has

240
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,189
been mentioned about that many articles

241
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,350
have been published I did not want to

242
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,720
dig deep into vent about one aspect

243
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:04,860
these are very few programs enabling you

244
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,690
to index and FTP are the very few of

245
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,030
them are published on the open source or

246
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,620
github but at the FTP you can find a lot

247
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,510
of interesting things for example if you

248
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,120
look at the right slide you can see a

249
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,400
lot of videos and strange things but

250
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,880
also you can find some collections of

251
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,470
the leaks its own exploits and legs and

252
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,570
then some company documentation which

253
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,720
has been found in one of the FTPS in

254
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:30,510
Russia next the class of leaks so which

255
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,280
are becoming more popular its databases

256
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:35,760
leaks without authorizations we've heard

257
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:38,189
about the database by elastic click

258
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,370
house and many other databases you can

259
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,500
look for them also through the by skinny

260
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,360
Internet yourself or using external

261
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,160
services but but I couldn't find any

262
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,520
good services so you have to do it

263
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,650
yourself you can do yourself mask on and

264
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,530
a census and show them what you use

265
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:58,350
there memcached dead or click down

266
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,699
programs and convenience is the discount

267
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,810
programs which will be indexed and

268
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,650
databases there

269
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:06,109
which you can choose anything those will

270
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,270
be more convenient

271
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:12,630
the next topic very painful is the

272
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:14,460
original get a repository oftentimes in

273
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,100
addition to their original files you can

274
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:21,630
find configuration files logs forgot

275
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,880
backups and dumps or create to look for

276
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,050
this kind of leaks we can find the

277
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,620
search engine which is built-in

278
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:30,150
intergate for example you get hard and

279
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,029
doorto written for it but also for the

280
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:35,310
github there's also events IPM FTP I

281
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:36,960
which enables you in a real time to

282
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,339
collect all the public even public

283
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,440
events which are helping in on the

284
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,330
github each commit each push merge

285
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,570
request everything you can collect it

286
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,850
and in real time you can trace it what

287
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:51,600
are the challenges one of them is

288
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:54,180
writing dorks it sounds it sounds easy

289
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,760
but it's a huge problem because open

290
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,910
dorks there are awful as an example that

291
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,370
could the domain domain password it's a

292
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:04,350
classical door it there's a huge number

293
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,640
of cases it means us if your testers

294
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:10,560
they're usually going to 4i ipv4 ipv6

295
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,910
they use domain very rarely or if the

296
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,530
internal server of the companies being

297
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,329
tested you cannot use the public domain

298
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:18,360
you'll use an internal domain for

299
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:20,670
example my comp my company does logo or

300
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,490
if you're in Active Directory you my dot

301
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:26,040
company will be DC my DC company and

302
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,080
your domain simply will not don't not be

303
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,969
any other words and also in other case

304
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,280
like gdb see where you can pass the

305
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,770
passwords in a URL but the key word

306
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,170
password will not be there and now let's

307
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,939
consider also that for each language

308
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,910
there are their own databases and

309
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:45,230
syntaxes of description for example for

310
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:47,610
python I've built a a list of libraries

311
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,530
libraries which could be used for

312
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,000
working with different databases and I

313
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,520
describe different dogs for them it was

314
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,459
an experiment of mine and here you can

315
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,410
see a lot of libraries you cannot find

316
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:01,770
any like password or talk in words only

317
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:04,560
authorization in one place unfortunately

318
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:07,589
the the output of these dorks are quite

319
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,900
arguable but for lxl 100 it works very

320
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:12,400
well and you can find Alex with a big

321
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,680
biggest companies at least

322
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,930
the next will be past Whannell for them

323
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,910
admins are very evil they own they load

324
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,250
up the logins it's a problem still

325
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,719
persists is very irrelevant problem to

326
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,990
look for these kind of links as possible

327
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,440
if you do a web search engines at Google

328
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:31,990
Yandex ping or using built-in built-in

329
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,450
search engine which is very rare or the

330
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,740
most popular way in real time you

331
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,589
collect all the documents from the

332
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,110
resource until look to look for any new

333
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:43,000
lines at excellent text lines or files

334
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,970
coming in to them there's a huge number

335
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,210
of programs and services be it Elfa min

336
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:51,070
for a paste hunter or a PW bin also a

337
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:55,150
lot of companies provided as their brain

338
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:56,950
protection service but one detail

339
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,350
important detail almost all of them are

340
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:02,350
monitoring only the popular pasted and

341
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,690
testable gist github and many people do

342
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,900
not monitor anything other but the

343
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:10,390
problem is that for example in our case

344
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:12,400
do you when we speak about the company's

345
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,260
subsidiaries posted even could be a

346
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,550
block but the admins used to working

347
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,980
with them but they are blocked right now

348
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,779
they will not it'll just open the Google

349
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,120
and find a different past and we'll be

350
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:24,550
posting in Tibet most of this programs

351
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,230
and framework and brand protection it's

352
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,300
very difficult for them to get Li add

353
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,010
any new resource even though it is an

354
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,510
open source it's simple incredibly

355
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:36,370
difficult sometimes to end it's just a

356
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:39,060
new resource you know governor court

357
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:43,240
whatever the boss into these frameworks

358
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:44,920
next be a for a you to topic for several

359
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,560
hours we can be easily talking for hours

360
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,079
about that we are interested not only in

361
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,760
about the not dork forum but also about

362
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,740
legitimate forms sometimes in one forum

363
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,450
the guys are discussing you electric car

364
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,150
it's a pure it's electric car it's a

365
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:01,720
super you know the but in the other

366
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:03,850
branch the they are they are discussing

367
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,010
of how to get the money from the next

368
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,990
ATM or still the money from ATM it's a

369
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,660
problem we need to get this info from

370
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,820
the huge number of the forum threads but

371
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,680
it's not the difficulty money toward it

372
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,540
because the forum sometimes are so dark

373
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,520
there and greatly indexed by the web

374
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,939
searches for example many of you have

375
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,920
heard about Freaker forum or lumps ET bh

376
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,080
if it's simply to the top of the iceberg

377
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,779
even that is index

378
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,670
but if you did down you can find much

379
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:33,029
more interesting in even absurd things

380
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:35,550
it all forms so you can see a mare RSS

381
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:37,890
or atom a thread you can collect the

382
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,660
news or you can write your own parser

383
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:43,140
because all the forms are using three

384
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,360
engines except for web luteum ballot in

385
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,630
I don't know how to read it correctly or

386
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,910
panel board but here we also have a huge

387
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:53,880
number of complexities because in our

388
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,500
forums for example was the F 10 or 20 to

389
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,820
register account and to pump it through

390
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,769
to have a good reputation and to get

391
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,709
access to the closed sections is not

392
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:03,149
that easy for 10-20 it may be ok but

393
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:05,640
let's say we're monitoring about 80

394
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:07,110
forms right now and to keep 80 accounts

395
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,790
and pumped-up accounts would be very

396
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,450
very difficult that kills a lot of time

397
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:14,610
and sometimes it's even easier just to

398
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:16,829
neglect some of them on a separate note

399
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:19,680
all the forms are using those protect

400
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:21,209
our cloud fair or custom gents the

401
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,060
screws because oftentimes one form is

402
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:26,189
attacking the other it's an internal

403
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:29,699
problem we cannot parse point and

404
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:31,320
request we have to use the the Tsarina

405
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,779
which will render JavaScript Oracle use

406
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,390
the census to bypass CloudFlare and to

407
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:38,730
find a real IP address basically all the

408
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:41,040
forms are attuned up incorrectly also

409
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,350
the forms sometimes entry bar is coming

410
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,540
back different systems at all the forms

411
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,660
you can see a page with a recent user

412
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,910
activity if one user at 2:00 a.m. is

413
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,250
coming in to you the recent messages

414
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,680
section you know it's suspicious sounds

415
00:16:53,250 --> 00:17:00,810
funny but we've been kicked out from the

416
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:02,010
three forms also do not use the search

417
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,959
engine for the forms to look for

418
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:06,059
information about your company because

419
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:07,740
any inquiries any search inquires in the

420
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:10,079
search line on the forms are the

421
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,000
interests traced and tracked and then

422
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,889
you can see the separate topic about

423
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,400
your company it was it will be done just

424
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:19,559
for you usually three ancients are used

425
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,050
in different versions one party of our

426
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:24,119
support team for one forum but you can

427
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:26,668
parse at ten forints but the huge

428
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,979
advertisement but it first made us so

429
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:30,540
much it simply kills the structure of

430
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,059
the page and the browser it smart is

431
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,830
correcting mistakes and in case if you

432
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,899
if your person on the Python you can

433
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,669
also find it a leak which will correct

434
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,910
it or correct it with your hands

435
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:44,520
which is not very convenient the next

436
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,760
would be file-share licks and touring

437
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:51,960
checker lakes with file shares I'm means

438
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,750
like Yandex Omega male sin space and

439
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,420
others they're mostly take care of the

440
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,680
security and privacy of their users so

441
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,450
it's simpler to take all the files which

442
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,090
have been added it the you can not do it

443
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:06,000
or it is very difficult or it is illegal

444
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:08,820
so we have to monitor it social media or

445
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,010
to monitor forums and pad paste and to

446
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,169
look for this kind of links after that

447
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,850
you can download the files and see what

448
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,670
you have I would have committed to

449
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:20,219
consider if you'll be doing this you can

450
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,750
older simple loader J loader and payload

451
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,150
they give them the link and they upload

452
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,710
the file sounds like a simple task but

453
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:28,800
if you have several thousands of links

454
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,030
believe me it's not an easy task on a

455
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,629
separate note we could speak about

456
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:35,639
torrents for towing trekkers torrents

457
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,860
can be monitored in different ways via

458
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,440
torrent trackers for example you have a

459
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,699
framework tools a checker which enables

460
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,470
a jacket which enables you to do the

461
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,260
search and indexation of a huge number

462
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,820
of tone trackers part of the trackers

463
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,530
are open and you can instantly see

464
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,540
what's available what's a new things and

465
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,520
find some information but the other part

466
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,399
of forms usually is closed you have to

467
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,230
look for invites and simply to search

468
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,850
for them on the internet or simply the

469
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,120
palm of your reputation to give away

470
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:05,219
something to get up the access on a

471
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,320
separate note a - tag network it's a

472
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,960
distribution of the hash table when you

473
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:13,050
are getting this kind of link you get

474
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,700
you get a hash your client will be

475
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,620
looking for this session and among the

476
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,510
different network clients your computer

477
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,949
will go to the other will ask do you

478
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:23,460
have this kind of file with this kind of

479
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:25,470
hash if not then who has it as a result

480
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,480
this is an open network we can connect

481
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,600
to this our own agents which will be

482
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,670
listening to all these inquiries and to

483
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,320
collect this information index it for

484
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:39,060
our purposes UK you can use one of the

485
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:42,270
open one of the open towards name for

486
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,850
example tour sniff or one of them open

487
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:47,639
projects and to keep the local base or

488
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,050
to use the existing services which will

489
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,670
be index and everything for you and

490
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,440
we'll be doing giving you the search

491
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:55,500
opportunities one of the most part

492
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,090
was better deep but about a month or two

493
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,670
months ago for some reason it quit

494
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:01,260
working but fortunately there are a lot

495
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:04,140
of Chinese mirrors then you can find

496
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:07,980
what a good quite a good licks you know

497
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:11,000
600 gigs boys the data may not get

498
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,410
relevant but all the data is correct a

499
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,960
virus total and the hybrid analyzers

500
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:18,810
these services many have heard about

501
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,190
them you may upload the file and the

502
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,919
service will tell you just how a

503
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,990
malignant this file is how to would you

504
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,880
do send boxes or do something else to

505
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,100
look for leaks at this kind of resources

506
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,680
you'll have to use either these search

507
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,290
engines or to use built-in functionality

508
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,370
or the custom parsers for example on RS

509
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,770
total you can build up for the

510
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,120
monitoring certain garage-y rules as

511
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,070
soon as it all work you will get your

512
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,600
alert as for the good programs which

513
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,250
will be enabled to search there are not

514
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,050
that many even those that you can see

515
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:50,010
they're not very good they're not very

516
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:52,440
convenient the shops and auctions

517
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,850
actually there are a lot of problems

518
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,320
with them because there is shadow

519
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,520
they're so shattered that almost all of

520
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,429
them did not indexed by the search

521
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,170
engines which is surprising main problem

522
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,120
with these is to find them you'll have

523
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,100
to go out to different forums and

524
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,449
different resources to look for them but

525
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,669
eventually it's not that difficult to

526
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:11,100
find them then you have to register and

527
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,390
you get access to a shop all the old

528
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,310
shops have their pages with that

529
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,560
recently added merchandise it increases

530
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,120
loyalty people see that you can buy

531
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,220
right away things which were not

532
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,739
available before and shops could be

533
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,050
different in the auctions here I shown

534
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,690
you a account selling shops often times

535
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:30,930
on the Left the shops has never been

536
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:33,720
developed air for the shadow tasks and

537
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:35,640
it sells a lot of good things but there

538
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,530
is a separate you know section for

539
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,860
accounts like the banking survey they

540
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,750
sell whatever you name it it's easy to

541
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,120
parse them the main problem is to find

542
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,520
and to get in vail invite there are a

543
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,750
lot of automated programs you know not

544
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,040
automated programs you have to do

545
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:55,080
everything manually social media social

546
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:58,649
networks I'm not very enthusiastic there

547
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,689
are a lot of articles about SMM a lot of

548
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,060
articles from the safety security guys I

549
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,530
gave you on the right the list of the

550
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,580
programs which are being used to analyze

551
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,119
Twitter for example

552
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,879
you can look through the web searches do

553
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,439
the real-time monitoring for example

554
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:15,600
streaming to IP you can you can give the

555
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,549
keywords and you can get all the notions

556
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,879
about these keywords at these resources

557
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:23,369
we can monitor specific users the groups

558
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:25,230
and pages and channels one of the main

559
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:27,389
problems like in the forums also you

560
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:29,489
have to have a good accounts which are

561
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:31,590
in the closed groups to manotaur the

562
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:34,409
data from these groups you also have to

563
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,580
you have to look different information

564
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:38,159
like documents and notions about

565
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:42,090
documents pictures from office from the

566
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,009
corporate party you name it News News

567
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:46,379
would be the last thing or you can look

568
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:47,759
for information they're very archival

569
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:49,439
because usually the news resources that

570
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,850
journalists are publishing something if

571
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,649
they've found something like the

572
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:55,320
blackmail for your boss or something

573
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:56,879
else but the question is why do we need

574
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,070
to monitor them because a scandal is

575
00:22:56,879 --> 00:23:02,519
just about to erupt

576
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:04,379
all very often many many news resources

577
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,299
and scandals they break out with a small

578
00:23:04,379 --> 00:23:08,100
publication in the newspaper in magazine

579
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:10,350
or any other publications and a couple

580
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,029
of hours later it begins to be cited in

581
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:15,090
all the journal journals and magazines

582
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:16,470
if you find the source number one at

583
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,269
least you'll have like two hours before

584
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,799
everyone else to make the press release

585
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:23,100
to delete materials from the internet

586
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:24,539
and to get any kind of report or

587
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,820
response to the press or minimize

588
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:29,609
mitigate a possible reputation damage

589
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,859
but another in the aspect of the news is

590
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:35,129
very easy to monitor the news a lot of

591
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:37,158
news aggregators searching machines and

592
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:40,459
it almost all of them have their atom

593
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:44,309
and SS it's very simple and convenient

594
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,749
knowing how all of this can be a link in

595
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:46,200
a way what it may be like and what are

596
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:48,450
the reasons

597
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,220
let's consider some cases and hopefully

598
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:53,190
we'll be able to do it today case number

599
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:56,220
one the attackers created the phishing

600
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,840
page or the mulignan site to collect a

601
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,019
different kind of data by users like

602
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,299
email passwords date of birth sex age

603
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,609
then this data is stored on the web

604
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:07,859
server it's a very difficult to use the

605
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:09,239
external database so simply they put it

606
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:11,549
in the text files for example I can the

607
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:13,980
screenshot sometimes not even limiting

608
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:16,010
access to the folder with logs which you

609
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,740
can upload and keep using

610
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:21,200
after they've collected these database

611
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,100
they use it for their own purposes it's

612
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,140
official website

613
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,659
they're trying to go go to the users

614
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,280
accounts if it's a fraudsters they're

615
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,320
trying to do the frauds though they get

616
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,750
what they want but they still get the

617
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,659
database which they do not need anymore

618
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:38,720
usually event is simply now upload it at

619
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,280
the different forums like like like a

620
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,290
private information for others to be

621
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,480
able to take advantage of it after that

622
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:47,139
another category of the mulligan

623
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,830
actresses playing in the game they're

624
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:51,049
downloading these licks and

625
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:53,149
double-checking them for example for the

626
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:54,980
unique factor they want to know can I

627
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:57,230
use it for myself or not is there any

628
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,850
like a Publix and other programs to

629
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:01,040
double-check this database verified

630
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,659
database if this link is unique they

631
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,639
immediately run it into a checker

632
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,929
so the to double-check the login and

633
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,360
password at different websites and

634
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:09,950
usually if they want to know this kind

635
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:14,389
of services where you can take the money

636
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:17,000
gaming sometimes VPN form hub VPS and

637
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:19,100
different other things they can get

638
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,250
their hands on after they get account

639
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:25,850
they sell it in different shops another

640
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:28,610
category its repackaging somebody else's

641
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:31,309
databases they're taking closed leaks

642
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:33,649
the repackage them combine them and then

643
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:35,870
to reload them two different forms to

644
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,280
get the reputation because sometimes you

645
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,260
know one day one the group somebody's

646
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,860
publishing a leak this leak is quite

647
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:44,720
fresh nobody has this this this league

648
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,610
this makes sense to give it to everybody

649
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,460
so the first group is taken the leaked

650
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:51,199
are loading it to them file-sharing if

651
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,720
it's a small file they use the same

652
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,710
space they use dev file-sharing services

653
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,330
with a very short file life size if it's

654
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,290
a big one in the usage antics mail if

655
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:04,460
globally it's usually me agar and the

656
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:07,129
link is published on the forum with

657
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,200
limited access if you have 500 plus

658
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,910
messages or something like that and this

659
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,130
groups are usually do not even use

660
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,720
encryption so it's not done and all the

661
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:17,360
files are not encrypted

662
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,320
it's simply easy to get the link and if

663
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,740
you get the link you get the whole

664
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,720
league the next group would be of the

665
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,340
fraudsters they're collecting and their

666
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,049
licks for a long time until they get a

667
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,659
critical mass of these leaks for example

668
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:31,129
it's one point four billion leaks

669
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,110
and it's the same thing they've

670
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,840
collected a huge number of different

671
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,790
leaks throughout one or one I half years

672
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,230
and published it on a forum on the next

673
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:42,290
day in all the media there was a scandal

674
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:47,030
you know like huge lid but it's nothing

675
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:50,180
new the separate groups very bad ones of

676
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:53,960
their of their violators they're looking

677
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:56,690
for email addresses domains or user

678
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,330
names and their goal is that they have

679
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:02,390
done some reconnaissance and tell em

680
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:04,429
that your your company using this kind

681
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,320
of email and they're looking for this in

682
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,760
the leaks as soon as it ends up in the

683
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,250
league they go to your email address

684
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,500
upload all of your mail and very often

685
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,720
upload it to the auctions for the

686
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:18,620
incredible amounts of money to sell the

687
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,480
whole contents of the mailboxes on a

688
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:24,219
separate note the next case would be

689
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:28,370
insiders just imagine this picture

690
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:31,280
original Department of a bank or the

691
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:34,729
mobile network operator it's an employee

692
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,590
looking to make more money is at the

693
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:39,920
Forum in one of the pages so the forum

694
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:41,629
is offering a quick money quick revenue

695
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,760
but you have to be an employee of a

696
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:45,800
particular company and fortunately this

697
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,810
guy is actually employee of this very

698
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,750
company and he is just the right faith

699
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:53,360
after about 10-15 minutes of the chat he

700
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:55,010
knows that he'll be given their phone

701
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,229
numbers and his goal is to give a

702
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:59,180
passports and the names of each passport

703
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:03,710
holders in the company he agrees to that

704
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:05,920
after a while he gets imprisoned usually

705
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:09,590
initially this kind of services are

706
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:12,350
published at the forums for four-car

707
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,720
Dean's for finding different sets of

708
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:17,090
information from the users and quite

709
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:22,400
often the market changes very fast

710
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:25,669
because the first control by and they'll

711
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,130
be jailed so the prices are quite low

712
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:30,830
and the demand is very high a separate

713
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:34,850
case which is quite funny actually we

714
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:38,679
all know how online stores work so the

715
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:41,668
market needs to be grown so you need to

716
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,969
increase sales and so on

717
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:48,299
one of the online stores to provide

718
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:51,059
controlled substances decided to go

719
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:53,099
online so but they problem is that they

720
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:56,399
have a developer for the children bought

721
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:58,229
so they go out so to the market and

722
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,899
after several days they found the

723
00:28:58,229 --> 00:29:03,719
candidates after a small interview is

724
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:08,728
fun to be good fits and a deal with them

725
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:10,739
is done over the grant system so the

726
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:15,450
candidates doesn't seem to be baffled

727
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:17,579
they write about abort but the owner of

728
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:21,629
the store does know how to set up the

729
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:25,499
path words about words and tokens so

730
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:28,349
they go to freelancer but they need to

731
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:29,729
arrange with the collaboration of the

732
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:33,989
finalizer so that they shouldn't their

733
00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:39,119
houses so the full answer you know sis

734
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:41,039
up the bots and loads it to github with

735
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,769
an instruction to their owner lower to

736
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:46,019
your server and run so what happens the

737
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:49,109
owner of the store is happier they have

738
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:50,849
a bought the developer is happy that

739
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:53,249
they have the money and we're also quite

740
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:57,649
happy because we have the entire client

741
00:29:53,249 --> 00:30:00,119
base a separate case is about testers

742
00:29:57,649 --> 00:30:02,579
when an order comes for testing quite

743
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:04,439
often you have to quickly test some

744
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:12,739
product or service so test it like I

745
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:15,989
write some scripts programs usually lab

746
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:19,259
and because the script is being written

747
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:21,989
very fast and it's quite and so one time

748
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:25,709
or so they don't fear to lose

749
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:29,190
credentials so the testimon run they I

750
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:31,559
didn't if I detect a lot of bugs so if

751
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:34,559
they choose to use this script looking

752
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:38,039
looking forward then colleagues get

753
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,349
interest to this scripts and because our

754
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:43,829
employees quite right so they share the

755
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:45,718
script forgetting to delete the latest

756
00:30:43,829 --> 00:30:49,019
tests and credentials and there are lots

757
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:50,789
of mistakes like that both in banks and

758
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:53,639
government organization and large

759
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:54,780
corporations so this is my favorite case

760
00:30:53,639 --> 00:31:01,620
and perhaps yours as well

761
00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:03,930
so when an admin uploads logs to github

762
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,629
I know what I can add here

763
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:09,120
well that's very bad a bad thing to do

764
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,800
too much critical information he's

765
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,429
leaking through some logs and quite

766
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:16,740
often that happens because the employee

767
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:18,420
is on a vacation that goes home so you

768
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,440
can't look through the log files from a

769
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:26,010
phone or from a tablet or copying logs

770
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,720
to a messenger is not a personal

771
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,320
experience so what they decide is a

772
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:34,170
better position if he bins pasiphae's

773
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:37,980
bins and then to take a look at those

774
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:40,410
logs at leisure so and they sent a link

775
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,840
to a security professional or

776
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:46,200
administrator for them to take a look a

777
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,980
separate case it's been existing for

778
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,240
quite a long time

779
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:52,920
it's about exciters so in forum there

780
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,750
are a separate topic so to discuss

781
00:31:52,920 --> 00:32:00,990
databases such as database of private

782
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:03,410
individuals legal entities and all sorts

783
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:06,930
of companies customers like that

784
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:10,320
so the peculiar analogy here is that you

785
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:13,110
need to have a reputation to get access

786
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,340
to the information that's a very

787
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,070
interesting and maybe make a

788
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:20,580
contribution

789
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:22,500
add some database so lot of users come

790
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,110
to the workplace and start looking at

791
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:31,560
what they can grab there it happens

792
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:33,510
because quite a lot of things like that

793
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,129
happen in regional branches where for

794
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:38,670
instance you have an XLS document that's

795
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:40,740
used to build a report of course we can

796
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:43,110
control the request to the database but

797
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,750
who's used this file it's absolutely

798
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:49,139
impossible and such file ali quite often

799
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:54,150
and there was quite a funny case here a

800
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:56,460
group of researchers who like you know

801
00:32:54,150 --> 00:33:00,920
trying to explore new technologies doing

802
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:04,050
forensics such like you can't blame that

803
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:06,210
until they've encountered a transport

804
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,649
mam transport card for their own city

805
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,760
where you can talk which you could to

806
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,730
pop top

807
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:15,180
so one evening they decided to explore

808
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:17,850
the content of this card it turned out

809
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:20,160
to be one of the latest versions was

810
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:23,480
protective as per most attacks but one

811
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:31,260
of the key turned out to be a card quite

812
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:35,190
brute forcible so in the evening one of

813
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:39,210
the members of a group remember the

814
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:42,360
recent vulnerability that allowed using

815
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:45,120
one key to break all other keys and he

816
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:49,290
decided to test this card so he did that

817
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:53,070
back home so he broke a lot of keys but

818
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:55,950
not all of them so he just wrote his

819
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:59,909
friends on the forum so saying look this

820
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:03,030
is the way I broke these keys try to do

821
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:06,230
better I'm I would only hope that they

822
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:08,190
try not to break the passport database

823
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:11,880
or internal passes

824
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:15,120
so let's now consider how aware things

825
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:17,370
can leak well lots of services programs

826
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,980
sources and for instance if we want to

827
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:25,130
monitor all of these we need to have a

828
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:29,310
huge zoo of programs that would crawl

829
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:31,590
and go keep going through your systems

830
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,659
are looking for leaks but having such a

831
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:37,260
zoo consisting of more than 50 services

832
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:39,740
absolutely inconvenient also a lot of

833
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:44,010
resources are not more at all and leaks

834
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:46,350
some leaks are skipped so let's start

835
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:49,169
from the source we have a huge number of

836
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:52,770
sources so for each source we need our

837
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:55,440
own worker process so that will come to

838
00:34:52,770 --> 00:35:01,860
the source get the information and bring

839
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:04,200
it to a to some unified form that's

840
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:06,750
where we could analyze it could be

841
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:10,140
regular expression of keywords or file

842
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:15,280
hashes whatever in addition to that

843
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:19,410
because we have huge influx so events

844
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:22,690
take it help the event flow there is

845
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:26,770
more or less homogeneous in time but

846
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:31,410
it's huge in other forum the

847
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:31,410
distribution of messages can be very

848
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:40,120
inhomogeneous so you can use the workers

849
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:43,210
who would look each source also you need

850
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:46,509
to access access you need to pass access

851
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:49,480
tokens to many resources or to pass

852
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:52,630
proxies for resources that some reason

853
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:55,240
are not available also you need to store

854
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:58,510
earliest so keywords regular Spanish and

855
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:00,580
so on so it database like q-value for

856
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:02,710
instance would be a good fit good tool

857
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,660
for that in addition to that so we can

858
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:07,330
collect all this information bring it to

859
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:10,420
the common form and look for what we

860
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:11,470
need so it makes sense now to think that

861
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,170
we need to start there

862
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:16,000
I chose elasticsearch because it's most

863
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:18,910
so popular and a good fit for these

864
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,490
purposes it has UI Cubana de baño i to

865
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:25,240
analyze information and illest alerts

866
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:28,120
for alerting when new leaks are found so

867
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:32,049
a prototype of the service was developed

868
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:35,100
it was a development python 37 nights

869
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:38,800
dreaming i was used as a cue message and

870
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:43,120
console was used so that later on all

871
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,550
workers and processes will turn to met a

872
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:48,720
service architecture microsoft's

873
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:50,920
architecture so each work and processor

874
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,859
were running in a separate isolated

875
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,500
docker container so it's not 50 each

876
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,930
other because every worker who works in

877
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:02,080
a different way and uses different

878
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:05,850
resources so container rising was deemed

879
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:08,290
to become to be the best way also

880
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:09,850
information updating is happening in

881
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,980
lots of different ways in one case we

882
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:13,600
can go to the surface and request all

883
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,210
the information that appeared in the

884
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:19,720
past 30 years and 30 minutes and go

885
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:23,620
there every 30 minutes so in another

886
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:26,980
case we can expect of a server service

887
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:29,970
so that they will will themselves send

888
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:36,100
us the information that appeared as

889
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:40,000
scheduler or by some

890
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:43,509
subscription so we did like that we ran

891
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,700
chess for three months we go to all the

892
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:48,340
public message flow from github several

893
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:52,779
online stores and auctions and we were

894
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:54,430
getting more than a million messages

895
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,180
every day and the system was coping

896
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,819
hooray

897
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:01,899
but that was a prototype POC that were

898
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:04,630
testing and then we got an idea why it

899
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,160
reminded us something this approach is

900
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:08,860
actually a good fit to collect any

901
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,100
information network so why shouldn't we

902
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:15,820
collect not only leaks but also all VPNs

903
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:18,970
proxies open or closed look for

904
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:24,160
publication posted in about credentials

905
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:25,600
for different people or gets

906
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,810
informational ciemins

907
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:31,540
anti-fraud so by monitoring all foam

908
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:33,670
form cell we can also collect

909
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,259
information about several passwords and

910
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:37,360
then collect them in a database to check

911
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:40,330
this passwords in Active Directory or

912
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:42,430
another resources so this service here

913
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:44,850
their product above this service will be

914
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:51,910
prototype within a week or two from now

915
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:54,400
at and we will inform you about this

916
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:58,810
either in my Twitter or in the company

917
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:01,840
Twitter stream ethic well there are

918
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:04,420
still a lot of pitfalls how you can

919
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,520
register cancer can bypass

920
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,930
constraints limits and so on so forth

921
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,520
but I'm hoping that this this

922
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,310
presentation you've got the

923
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,410
understanding of what how and why can be

924
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:15,220
monitored in terms of leaks and why it

925
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,920
is important

926
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:20,500
I'll be happy to continue communication

927
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,800
of during the conference and after it

928
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,800
thank you

929
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,340
you
