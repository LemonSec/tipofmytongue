1
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:12,059
hi everyone today we will talk about

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,519
product security and we'll have a look

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,640
at how our product security can be

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:21,210
viewed under new angle we will define

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:26,759
what is product security understand why

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:30,140
it is important and it is I will build

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:34,920
the process for product security and

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:39,809
understand we sure all exist in this

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,309
process who plays what and in the end I

10
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,539
will be talking about the results will

11
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:48,539
be received in our company Reich while

12
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,320
building the product security and draw

13
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:56,280
some conclusions let's go

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:01:00,359
my name is Prasad cough I am I've

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:04,080
started my career in IIT as as a

16
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:07,920
developer and Java developer in 2009 I

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,700
joined application security industry

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,380
where I started to analyze source code

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:17,340
work with developers on the trainings

20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,580
and in 2014 I joined Reich and I

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,380
journeyed in exactly the moment when

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:27,479
there was no special person for

23
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,339
information security and I'm the person

24
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:34,470
who was building different types of

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:37,470
security and Reich these the whole

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,600
security issue for us is information

27
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:44,479
security now I'm a firm in Security

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,649
Director for right it has quite a lot of

29
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:51,020
organizations we have a product we sell

30
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,020
it have different offices and

31
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:59,789
different countries Europe Japan

32
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:04,979
Australia we are opening an office in

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,970
Czech Republic and that's not a

34
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,550
coincidence

35
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:12,740
information security has planted a huge

36
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:18,540
role here we are currently ISO certified

37
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:23,400
we are re-examined for compliance with

38
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:25,769
sock - typed requirements yearly GDP our

39
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,840
audience if you can call it an audit of

40
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:32,940
course we check how the functionality is

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,550
realized simple and then the

42
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:40,200
organization in our product and a lot of

43
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:44,240
other questionnaire is that everyone can

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,239
feel like CSA call security

45
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:53,430
with product security is what types of

46
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,490
security takes it on the market we know

47
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:59,459
that system security and network

48
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:02,670
security infrastructure security def say

49
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:10,440
cops very much loved by everyone and

50
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:13,049
usually talked about risk management and

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,870
application security and the question is

52
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:19,230
do we need anything else do we need some

53
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,600
specific product security area in all

54
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:25,049
segments of the internet product

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:28,049
security is equaled to application

56
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:32,070
security but it's not correct it's

57
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:36,570
different words application product are

58
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:39,030
different things let's define or look at

59
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:43,730
the definitions that are given by

60
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,730
different companies or regulators

61
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,739
example in one big company application

62
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:54,548
security was defined as a 90 discipline

63
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:57,319
that has to do with security or

64
00:03:54,549 --> 00:04:00,260
regulatory compliance as part of

65
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:05,268
specific application projects

66
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:07,760
I saw defines it as a process everyone

67
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:12,590
pretty much everyone knows how to build

68
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:18,798
it most conferences nightly security the

69
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:20,510
process is shown as DLC security LC is

70
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,599
that you need to do that happen you will

71
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:27,820
have your ab security at the highest

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:31,789
level and it's true it works if you

73
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:34,219
application security certain way your

74
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:36,139
application will quietly quite secure at

75
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:41,840
least you will have good practices in

76
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:44,960
your product lifecycle you will have the

77
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:50,780
practices in development your developers

78
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:56,659
will analyze the source code you will

79
00:04:50,780 --> 00:05:02,388
have serious process on deployment and

80
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:04,250
in support of your application so this

81
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:06,020
is this is about an application and

82
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,919
everything that is connected with a

83
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,719
threat modeling vulnerabilities exploits

84
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,698
all the measures you can take on the

85
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:22,630
application level to reduce the risk of

86
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:25,370
these or that vulnerability the main

87
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,860
goal of vacation security is

88
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:31,690
establishing the process whoever says

89
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:35,240
differently it's not right pen testing

90
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:38,479
it's a process that has its rules and

91
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,690
the security plays a significant role

92
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,010
here from the application point of view

93
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:47,690
the application security process goal is

94
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:51,310
to make all the applications secure

95
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:56,530
which means that they don't have known

96
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:59,740
vulnerabilities as top 10 some others

97
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,859
at least they don't have any vocal and

98
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,440
vivid issues with the security as a

99
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,780
result there's some security

100
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,440
requirements that application needs to

101
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:15,900
comply to this is risk management risk

102
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,700
estimation it's good when you attach

103
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,760
different security feature development

104
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:25,180
here why I say it's good because it's

105
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:29,320
not always the case and the application

106
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:32,080
security team can dictate some specific

107
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,419
requirements to the business they often

108
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,849
cannot say let's not do these there's

109
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:41,229
the multi-factor authentication or

110
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:46,169
encryption and this is wrong this is not

111
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:50,680
good unfortunately I guess it doesn't

112
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:53,289
have this luxury let's see who delivers

113
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,200
application security which players are

114
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,700
there on the market Avenue it's sourcing

115
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:05,229
companies these are service providers

116
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:08,380
and the product companies here present

117
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:14,490
that develops software for security and

118
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:18,520
security software companies yes I agree

119
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:22,360
suggest we consider them not as as in

120
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:25,630
this scope but separately as their first

121
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,360
goal is to monetize security product

122
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:32,140
security has a lot to do with this

123
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:35,590
because they have a product security

124
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:38,979
product and it's well connected then I

125
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:43,419
will show you how being an ordinary

126
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:47,440
product company like I work for to come

127
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:51,099
to security in terms of monetization how

128
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:54,540
I can build the business based on the

129
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:59,280
security as part of your business model

130
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,280
ok let's come back to the companies

131
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:07,910
what good of bad arises service

132
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:11,990
providers they had a lot of projects

133
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:14,400
different applications they need to

134
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,720
cover specific application security

135
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,049
requirements they're gonna have enough

136
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,360
resources and they look like a boat in

137
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:24,270
one board they have security team and in

138
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,990
the other board they have in both teams

139
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:30,710
of both ports have a ball that travels

140
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:33,229
between one board and another and

141
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:35,699
represents different vulnerabilities

142
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,950
issues connected with application

143
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,669
security or risks for more non formal

144
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:45,600
risks security team sets it to the

145
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:50,310
business accepts them or not so they

146
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,680
play something in product company they

147
00:08:50,310 --> 00:09:00,079
have one board and the whole team sits

148
00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:03,870
in that rows all they have is with them

149
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:09,230
it's inside the ball you cannot drop it

150
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:14,040
pass it to somewhere and in fact it's

151
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:18,290
also it is a measure allowing them to

152
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,280
deliver the quality to the users and it

153
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:26,400
effectiveness of your product and it's

154
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:28,290
great because you are not alone here if

155
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,660
you're not rolling then someone I also

156
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:37,319
draw instead of you and good

157
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:40,350
organization of this whole security in

158
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,330
general to develop the product well and

159
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,010
so we tell to this picture where the

160
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:49,220
product security is some extra layer

161
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:52,250
above applications

162
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,500
that includes not only the processes

163
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:58,640
we've been talking about but also

164
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:01,570
business logic how do the company's

165
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,460
selling application security who is

166
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:07,730
understanding the business logic of the

167
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,440
application they analyze it's not often

168
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:13,220
how'd it happen sometimes I know

169
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,530
examples but it's a rare occasion even

170
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:20,690
based on the service we are purchasing

171
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:23,600
yearly with pen testing it's pretty much

172
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:26,620
never they find the vulnerabilities and

173
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,110
issues we know about well we know

174
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:36,020
product our business logic and it says

175
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:39,590
waste every day and of course the

176
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:43,790
communications are also included here

177
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:48,220
the way one system calls another

178
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:57,469
application also have a mail processing

179
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:59,330
this whole his territory grows when we

180
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:03,920
look at the application from different

181
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:05,630
angles as Mark was mentioning today

182
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,880
there was an interesting thought that I

183
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:11,150
would like to repeat and it has to do

184
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,240
with the customers are really worried

185
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:16,490
about security if I buy the product I

186
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,420
want to know what happens within it I

187
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:24,200
know I need to know what dating has how

188
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,160
its managed and what happens I usually

189
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,590
want to buy a product

190
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,380
it's like person for marketing says I

191
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:32,570
want to buy this software security team

192
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:37,640
says ok here's a question area let them

193
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:39,500
fill it in and send it to us sell us

194
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,319
some security artifacts penetration

195
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,900
testing results or - I saw certificates

196
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,110
etc and then the security forgets about

197
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:52,670
the product and that's bad current trend

198
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:54,020
is the monetary offender in some way or

199
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:58,099
another but

200
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:02,650
not to assess the vendor once but

201
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:07,910
constantly keep receiving the alerts and

202
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:11,329
keep monitoring tasks for the product is

203
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:14,209
to be ready to the enterprise ERP system

204
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:18,850
and it's a very serious task application

205
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:22,990
security cannot solve it and of course

206
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:25,550
user behavior plays a significant role

207
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:28,400
education security situation with

208
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:31,400
two-factor authentication you check that

209
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:36,110
everything is fine there's no bypass

210
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:38,780
options that one uses it did you did you

211
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:41,380
make it well no one knows the product

212
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:44,600
security would also address this issue

213
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:49,760
like hum as the security functionality

214
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:53,860
you've implemented used so here we get a

215
00:12:49,760 --> 00:13:00,319
goal for the product security team

216
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:05,770
that's organizing organization meaning

217
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:08,420
everyone in here information security

218
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:13,040
engineers developers testers they need

219
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:14,810
to be on one page to understand their

220
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,000
product they need to have the same

221
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,890
onboarding trainings to understand which

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,540
components are there they need to be

223
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:27,860
together

224
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:30,680
of course product security includes

225
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,170
application security would inherit all

226
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,900
the goals of application security but

227
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:39,050
with the limitation it says that it not

228
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:41,360
only builds the processes pert also

229
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:44,920
defines the correct communication

230
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,880
between the security and engineering

231
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:53,920
right communication of inside the

232
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,920
informational security it is hard

233
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,810
information security when the

234
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:02,170
infrastructure security guys are not

235
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:09,099
talking to them when they just look at

236
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:12,729
the SOC and see some problems access and

237
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:15,970
then don't important and if they

238
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:19,240
reported it the product security team

239
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:22,200
would fix it the metrics play an

240
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:27,130
important role what are the metrics for

241
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:30,280
security the amount of parks risks cases

242
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:37,689
past and it's good case but no one is

243
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:41,880
looking at the way the product works and

244
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:45,340
it's to monitor the products health

245
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:48,340
understand how tightly the engineering

246
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:54,880
and security are integrated the amount

247
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:59,290
of open and close defects and bugs is a

248
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,900
good metric okay so if the amount of

249
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:06,400
open bugs decreases then the product is

250
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:10,230
getting healthier they need to avoid the

251
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:17,290
issues leads to interesting stories like

252
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:20,560
guys having a requirement to make a

253
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:25,900
release without a fuss defects so what

254
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:30,369
the developers were doing a enter in

255
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:39,130
JIRA removing the defects from there and

256
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:43,660
making their release we'll say we need

257
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:46,990
to suppress those shadow development

258
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:51,640
would continue it's not good of course

259
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:53,920
and of course we also mean an improved

260
00:15:51,640 --> 00:16:07,550
security features

261
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:11,329
all the features need to be security WS

262
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:14,269
top 10 the information security function

263
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:17,239
here is to say hey the astrologers have

264
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:21,350
announced the year of authentication of

265
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:24,949
CM integration EADS to be done it

266
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:34,000
monitors the market there are a lot of

267
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:37,459
interesting moments it's a bigger thing

268
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,350
another layer of the top of the security

269
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:46,008
features it's the specific features that

270
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:47,930
the customer the user understand what's

271
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:58,279
happening with the security of the

272
00:16:47,930 --> 00:17:02,630
product and what I work as an owner of

273
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:04,880
this product what a Tom distend what is

274
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:08,119
it what is the data what is the levels

275
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:12,799
of access this product and to ensure

276
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:15,109
this I not only need the convenient

277
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,099
access control but I need to provide the

278
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:22,549
user with the capability to monitor

279
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:24,668
their success and to trigger some some

280
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:31,220
behavior when someone for example has

281
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:36,140
received access good idea might be to

282
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:38,270
enable logging know all the events so

283
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,280
the customers would not know it so they

284
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,820
would want to integrate with their own

285
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:46,490
cm so the product needs to be integrated

286
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:49,520
with the enterprise ecosystem and this

287
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:52,159
is one of the important points of my

288
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,230
presentation encryption everyone says we

289
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:58,520
have everything encrypted no one has

290
00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:01,700
access to it we store them securely we

291
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,799
say we have encryption at rest if you

292
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,560
ask what it means they say yeah the file

293
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:09,720
system is encrypted

294
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:14,379
okay so once you mount the disk it's

295
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:17,700
it's encrypted then you just wait till

296
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:22,650
until it's neither till the other large

297
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:24,820
so all the enterprises would want to

298
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:26,590
purchase some long-term solutions

299
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,770
instead of working with SAS because they

300
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:35,740
understand what happens on their own

301
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:39,280
infrastructure and this I highlight this

302
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:42,010
moment features for security as an

303
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,290
important player it's not just features

304
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:49,150
that are dictated by the market as a

305
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:51,280
brand FX was hacked everyone all the

306
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:56,440
data was lost everything is hackable you

307
00:18:51,280 --> 00:19:01,950
need to install some software this is a

308
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:06,100
trend if that is dictated by dictates by

309
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:08,670
which waste lines you need to have and

310
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:12,909
those baselines

311
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:15,220
your customer a user you will not enter

312
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:18,790
the market without specific security

313
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,530
functionality implemented on the

314
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:24,820
enterprise level you will not be able to

315
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:28,780
play with how main security features

316
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:32,139
like who did the encryption two-factor

317
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:35,230
authentication logging etc etc at the

318
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,870
same time two-factor authentication is

319
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:40,270
not needed by the enterprise to a phrase

320
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:43,120
used by 1% of enterprise according to

321
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:46,320
our analytics they require it but they

322
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:53,860
don't need it they don't use it so now

323
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:55,780
the accent is main focuses on adding

324
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,429
this functionality not only enterprise

325
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,129
but also small medium business is

326
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,810
looking for this functionality so we

327
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,660
talked a lot about application and

328
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:07,000
product security will have other layers

329
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:11,100
of security though socks are being built

330
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:17,340
other stuff is going on here is sad

331
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:19,850
of the main business and security that

332
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:23,850
product security has to address and

333
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:27,360
first of all it is business strategy you

334
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:30,090
cannot create product security if you

335
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,580
don't know where the product is moving

336
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:35,959
you cannot say this needs to be done it

337
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:39,480
is just a waste of time and resources to

338
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:43,159
implement such functionality and of

339
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:47,870
course the security culture is here and

340
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,870
how well you work with the person

341
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:59,779
trainings beautiful an ice-fishing text

342
00:20:52,019 --> 00:21:05,879
so the users as your own betray here

343
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:08,669
network and everything that has to do

344
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:11,009
with internal corporate network because

345
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:14,129
your product can be hacked through your

346
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:16,470
admins through your accountants it's

347
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:19,439
also here product security looks

348
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:22,409
attentively at this and understands what

349
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,539
it needs to be developed or not the

350
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:25,679
risks that are not only connected with

351
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:29,940
the product itself

352
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:35,279
why here also additional moments with

353
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:38,789
Brother deployment dev cycles is it

354
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:44,179
application security are not from my

355
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:50,370
point of view but from something extra

356
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:54,029
compliance customers purchase without

357
00:21:50,370 --> 00:22:00,209
certifications Americans say we need

358
00:21:54,029 --> 00:22:08,159
talk to Europeans say ISO 27001 and

359
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:11,070
still they said their surveys here at

360
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:15,220
the level of the product security and

361
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:17,750
girls when the sales team

362
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:20,480
starts to talk correctly with the

363
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:23,630
enterprise they say we have that

364
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:28,490
functionality needs to be implemented in

365
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:32,090
this way sign the deals because of the

366
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:35,120
security as an important factor of an

367
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:39,350
overall sales cycle and the marketing

368
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:44,090
can sell it can advertise it as use it

369
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:46,070
as a value and so product companies are

370
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:49,040
well known on the market they are

371
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:54,500
integrated with other security products

372
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:58,389
even bounty SAS shows to the market that

373
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:01,780
the company is investing into security

374
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:06,170
whoever finds the right we're gonna pay

375
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:09,610
so there's a pyramid here as a base for

376
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:12,770
the whole product security there is

377
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:17,750
usual security baseline just fix this

378
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:22,150
try not to put a password infrastructure

379
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:24,580
security management structural level

380
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:28,390
application security processes

381
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:32,540
communications between engineering

382
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:35,270
product security you add things

383
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,570
connected with logic and how the product

384
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:40,280
develops and the market develops

385
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,710
forecasting and strategy discussions

386
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:47,300
with business and relationships with the

387
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:52,010
sales marketing people are edit here so

388
00:23:47,300 --> 00:24:00,040
we can define product security has a

389
00:23:52,010 --> 00:24:00,040
combination different domains or areas

390
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:09,280
field that includes application security

391
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:13,429
system security network security and

392
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:17,360
compliance but an important part here is

393
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:21,500
played by the product product managers

394
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:23,149
who to build develop or improve the

395
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:28,740
security functionality

396
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:32,250
security for French it's a mixed

397
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:35,840
definition but I hope it's very useful

398
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:39,630
so I understand you know feel better

399
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:43,500
product securities so when anyone tells

400
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:45,299
you that building a process

401
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,940
tell them know you've listened to Dima

402
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:49,830
and he said otherwise

403
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:54,450
look we should always we have here who

404
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:57,418
is responsible for impotence well so we

405
00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:00,389
have some lines of business external

406
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:07,740
people internal stakeholders internal

407
00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:10,500
security specialists operations all the

408
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:13,409
stakeholders external stakeholders here

409
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:17,100
our customers our customers the market

410
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:19,860
market dictates specific requirements or

411
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,439
conditions if the market says this

412
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,658
company was hacked because didn't have

413
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:29,580
five factors indications everyone will

414
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:32,399
go so don't stakeholders external

415
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:34,139
stakeholders like pushing the

416
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:36,899
requirements to the internal

417
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:44,370
stakeholders business owners responsible

418
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:47,699
for the product development analyze and

419
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:50,489
define whether they need to go into

420
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,840
production then the internal

421
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,000
stakeholders based on their

422
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,379
understanding of the product to create

423
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,320
the tasks stories whatever process you

424
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:09,269
follow the implementation for

425
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:12,000
engineering teams related to the

426
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:16,309
external stakeholders they feel the

427
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,549
questionnaire is understand which big

428
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:19,549
humans were

429
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:29,230
it has a backlog of the requests so if

430
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:32,820
there is a requirement for some specific

431
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:37,870
functionality the critical mass is

432
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:42,010
filled and the security team orders the

433
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:45,790
developers to for example implement five

434
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:48,910
factor authentication and the ossicles

435
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:52,240
will say yeah okay let's see how we can

436
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:57,240
make it happen and if the users really

437
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,240
demanded the last error here his

438
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:06,130
application infrastructure system and

439
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:07,420
incident communications between security

440
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:13,180
and engineering

441
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:16,210
here are the roles that exist part of

442
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:19,120
the product security and here's how they

443
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:25,780
affect the business let's see how it all

444
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:29,350
worked out you know company 2015 there

445
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:34,060
was a lot of security as I said for some

446
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:39,870
years we were just fixing owner

447
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:48,330
abilities creating or implementing

448
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:51,699
design during serious education

449
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:56,830
improving the data protection and

450
00:27:51,700 --> 00:28:02,350
storage here is what our first step

451
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:05,939
consisted of bug fixing security

452
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:11,830
requirements authentication new trade

453
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:16,630
implemented SSO should L encryption

454
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:20,080
because the customers were worried about

455
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:22,870
the file security so we decided to creep

456
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,679
them to lower the temperature then the

457
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:28,659
next step is the building of the

458
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,350
information security team communication

459
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,990
inside the department

460
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:38,350
to the external departments security

461
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:38,350
feature creation functionality creation

462
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:45,500
then we had sam'l here we started to

463
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:53,230
address meat market and the customer

464
00:28:45,500 --> 00:29:00,500
said yeah we want sam'l part we also

465
00:28:53,230 --> 00:29:04,009
realized it's not needed because when

466
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:06,710
you have sam'l done into FA because the

467
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:11,169
whole authentication is on the customer

468
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:17,799
side we were mistaken

469
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:23,330
thinking it's useless futile later

470
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:26,629
second part played when enterprises

471
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:29,740
started to hire external vendors to

472
00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:32,539
their workspace they are not in

473
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:38,149
protective directory they cannot his

474
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:39,769
octa on logon they needed to have login

475
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:42,860
and password with two-factor

476
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:46,759
authentication requirement so first it

477
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:48,110
helped us win deals in mid market and

478
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:51,110
smaller enterprise

479
00:29:48,110 --> 00:30:02,840
samo helped us to address enterprise

480
00:29:51,110 --> 00:30:06,889
level and phase just appeared as a big

481
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,779
enterprises understanding that is part

482
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:13,000
of their internal identity management

483
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:17,419
systems they cannot solve the issue of

484
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,129
vendors then the policies password

485
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:21,019
policies and network policies were

486
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:25,039
created a lot of work was done to

487
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:28,850
protect the data we went out away from

488
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:30,830
the certification understood we would

489
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:33,850
like to other work where the payment

490
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:36,689
gateway hereof and create something

491
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:39,549
you know by ourselves and then we were

492
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:42,269
certified on that production then we

493
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:47,440
started to certify our

494
00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:53,139
product security this team had more to

495
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:55,210
do with p.m. organization security but

496
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:57,758
this team had a lot of knowledge about

497
00:30:55,210 --> 00:31:02,379
the product and application security

498
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:05,109
they worked mostly with information

499
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:07,869
security to create the functionality

500
00:31:05,109 --> 00:31:11,649
that the customers needed and things

501
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:13,509
like how do we make it right how to make

502
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:18,279
it blogging right what does the customer

503
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:22,149
needs so the line of the monetization

504
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:26,919
line of business was created to monetize

505
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:29,258
the product security we had a

506
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,929
significant advantage in the fact that

507
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:35,499
all processes information security

508
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:37,239
processes were based on our application

509
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:39,489
vulnerability management application

510
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:42,429
security inventories we had and

511
00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:48,549
compliance also we have never seen out I

512
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:54,849
will show you later during that period

513
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:57,940
we've done a lot to be ready and to dive

514
00:31:54,849 --> 00:32:01,418
into the enterprise security echo system

515
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:04,989
with encryption with security settings

516
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:08,609
at least it was implemented fully but at

517
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:10,850
least it was part of the development

518
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:15,460
process

519
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:19,789
we had cm system integrations for

520
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:28,399
customer and the last step where we are

521
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:30,710
now is we try we are trying to go deeper

522
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:37,789
and to considering security as part of

523
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:41,750
our business model to ensure that we use

524
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:46,700
security as in the business to ensure

525
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:47,950
that security moves from cost center to

526
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,490
a profit Center

527
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:55,909
you remember probably a lot of people

528
00:32:51,490 --> 00:33:00,230
talking about how do we discuss we need

529
00:32:55,909 --> 00:33:05,299
security but here's the answer you need

530
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:07,460
to make your security drive revenue your

531
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:10,940
deals will Cuomo's only and when you

532
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:16,000
have good security we have a line of

533
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:20,840
business to develop applications for

534
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,570
security we used to be a project

535
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:28,158
management system but now we have a

536
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:33,889
security application during this period

537
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:35,809
we added CRM functionality user

538
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:40,600
provision granular permissions

539
00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:43,610
last year it was number one in

540
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:48,168
popularity so granular permissions have

541
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:51,428
grown monitoring and limiting with just

542
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:55,750
monitoring that will good reporting and

543
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:59,509
behavioral analysis and data protection

544
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:04,580
so as a result we have launched

545
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:08,719
encryption at rest to encrypt what we

546
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:11,219
have databases and manage the use the

547
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:17,020
customer encryption keys

548
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:25,889
he has its own had the right to remove

549
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:25,889
its now we have Mike as a cooperation

550
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:38,770
parts and their lot they're safe and

551
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:41,250
this would be that is we are

552
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:44,020
guaranteeing the trusted co-workers were

553
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:49,840
ensuring very safe communications and we

554
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:52,239
also guarantee a safe data storage and

555
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,390
to this end we have a certain

556
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,799
functionality which helps us to solve

557
00:34:55,389 --> 00:35:00,580
the three issues prevention detection

558
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,230
and respond we have their many

559
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,029
functionalities have already mentioned

560
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,770
about about the data protection about

561
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:10,780
the authentification authorization

562
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:14,080
access control and our users can see as

563
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:17,800
a result of what's going on and also to

564
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:20,799
issue monitoring reports activity

565
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:24,280
reports internal monitoring and the

566
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:29,020
access control report well and by doing

567
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:30,910
this we turn right into such a machine

568
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:33,460
which enables you to do everything

569
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:37,450
basically throughout the whole process

570
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:39,460
of of an enterprise we can also consider

571
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:43,419
it as an enterprise and we also want to

572
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:45,510
build GCM related different mechanism we

573
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:49,750
have the Reich which enables us to

574
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:51,580
manage risks to manage incidents to do

575
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,290
owner ability management and it looks

576
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:56,410
pretty good and it looks something like

577
00:35:53,290 --> 00:36:01,540
that way of the functionality which can

578
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:04,750
create different different statuses over

579
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:07,120
a particular task or asylum and here we

580
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:08,360
have an opportunity for example at risk

581
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,359
management

582
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,750
as soon as you generate a risk it has a

583
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:17,150
status and the security team analyzes

584
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:20,150
evil ages and transmitted in a certain

585
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:23,030
status the subtasks enables us to build

586
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,760
a mitigation plans if all the tasks have

587
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:27,860
been closed all the risk is either

588
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:31,610
eliminated or mitigated in a big way

589
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:33,710
next would be the forms as an interface

590
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:35,480
for any communications we even have an

591
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:39,200
external form on our website you can

592
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,940
look at any vulnerability you found and

593
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,859
looking silly if it's not it dublicate

594
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,650
with somebody else if we're speaking

595
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:47,780
about the internal Fornell ability we do

596
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:52,400
this kind of internal bug bounty which

597
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:53,600
will pay we can also map different

598
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,270
requirements and different

599
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:59,089
compliance for internal entities

600
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:02,000
internal framework in the security

601
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:04,910
control which is doing cross mapping

602
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,300
between different certifications is all

603
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:13,970
EXO PCI and different ones different

604
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:15,440
frameworks this is what GDP our GDP our

605
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,750
compliance looks like going through

606
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,730
compliance it's a check everything is

607
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:22,250
cool with all the functionality if

608
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:24,500
something turns out to be not cool we

609
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:28,700
build certain tasks which have to be

610
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:32,540
done to cover this security issue this

611
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:34,430
is what going through out it looks like

612
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:39,650
and you can see requirements within

613
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:41,690
certification is o27

614
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:43,190
double zero one and there is a certain

615
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:46,610
security controls which have to be

616
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:48,830
performed in order to change status like

617
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:53,120
automatically or see me or America

618
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:56,240
either pass or fail on these bases we

619
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:58,700
build reports what risks are available

620
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,779
what the status of these risks and then

621
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:04,819
we do the report to the Senate to the

622
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:08,810
management also only internal inventory

623
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:14,090
is here we can see what kinds you know

624
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:16,400
of vendors we have who of them is like

625
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:18,190
working with what department either

626
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,140
state is if a critical or non-critical

627
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:24,049
and in this way now

628
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:27,140
and using this security track which

629
00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:29,089
covers the following list of processes

630
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,328
such as working with vulnerability

631
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:33,470
incident centers management all the

632
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:35,869
developments software development

633
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:38,930
activities and processes integration

634
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:43,069
with JIT and other systems issuing

635
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:47,538
access control all of this is done via a

636
00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:51,349
form automatically line management who

637
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:53,869
is doing the approval etc and inventory

638
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:56,720
including compliance audit and business

639
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:58,069
continuity it's so in hearing as am i

640
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,529
finishing up I would like to say that

641
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:02,029
these security is product security is

642
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:03,500
very important if you want to go on

643
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:04,099
building your product if you know it

644
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,760
very well

645
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:09,650
so I'll come down study your product

646
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,960
very well in this application you're

647
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:15,950
working with and make the most of it

648
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:21,170
within a simpler task management product

649
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:25,368
security is the very tool which which

650
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:27,829
makes your product a quality one which

651
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:31,309
makes it competitive on the market and

652
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:34,730
this in turn enables you to move away

653
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:36,650
from is security as as from a call

654
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:40,050
center to a profit center thank you

655
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,050
[Applause]
