1
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:20,130
and that concludes most of my Russian I

2
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,230
always like to tell people I have to

3
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,630
apologize I'm from America so I only

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,710
speak one language I'm from Texas so I

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:31,619
don't speak it very well but I make up

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:36,030
for that by speaking really fast and

7
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:38,820
loud so hopefully that helps apologies

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,989
to the translators so thank you for

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,300
coming to my talk

10
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,760
this is also my if you see right here

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,288
this is my legal disclaimer I'm not a

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,440
lawyer though I played one on the

13
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,390
internet before successfully and so I

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,919
want you to understand when I'm talking

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,199
about some of the bad things that I do

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,539
and and how I've broken in hi Rob

17
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,559
someone or or did something really bad

18
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,030
you're gonna go that's really mean

19
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,739
that's horrible why would you do that

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,530
just to remember the kittens I'm

21
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,970
adorable okay I will not try to steal

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,650
from you kill you or ruin you

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,500
financially unless you pay me first

24
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,360
there's always a contract so whenever

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,400
you I get to those parts just remember

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,880
the kittens so that's one of the key

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,310
things the second thing is in this talk

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,100
there's a theme it turned out and it

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,229
wasn't by on fault it wasn't like you're

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,939
on purpose it was just by accident but

31
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,520
there's a theme where it's like I'm

32
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,919
making a lot of fun and a lot of US

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,000
government agencies and I don't I don't

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,520
want you to know it's like I'm not

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,409
trying to pick on them it's just they

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,890
turn out to be really good at giving

37
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,670
good examples of bad security so that's

38
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,659
not my fault

39
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,700
so hashtag sorry not sorry so that's a

40
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,470
that's that's all my disclaimers I got

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,439
to go with let's go to the next part

42
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:59,310
this is a title I poem the I Pony not

43
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,429
basically is two top three things I love

44
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,520
for my victims I'm sorry clients to do

45
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,129
when I'm robbing them and it's also

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,859
because you know why it makes it easier

47
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:14,160
to rob them and also the top three

48
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,230
things I hate for my big clients to do

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,060
because it makes it harder for me to rob

50
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,410
them and then after that we're gonna

51
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,270
talk a little bit about some of the

52
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,980
things you can and can't do to actually

53
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,470
start helping and making more security

54
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,769
awareness for your employees and making

55
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,500
it better protected so a little bit

56
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,510
about me you may have noticed me in the

57
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,300
upper left hand corner I was on national

58
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,640
Geographics Season 2 episode 2 to break

59
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,880
through as you watched as I actually

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,059
robbed a bank in Beirut Lebanon that was

61
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,290
the correct one so that was awesome and

62
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,930
then you may have noticed me in the

63
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,060
press on the on the right different news

64
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,430
agencies I've talked about that but my

65
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,670
favorite the one that I love the most is

66
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,020
the lower left hand corner it's like

67
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,510
yeah so in the lower left hand corner

68
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,310
you see where I'm actually that red

69
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,049
circle they put that there that's me

70
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,450
getting an employee to get up out of his

71
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,490
desk so it's like I could compromise his

72
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,810
machine while he watched me he was

73
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,750
shoulder surfing and everything was very

74
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,400
very uncomfortable that's me

75
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,610
I was stealing that lower left in here

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,950
this right here it's like that's me

77
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,460
actually robbing a hotel in the South of

78
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,350
France

79
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,200
barefoot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle

80
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,970
pajama bottoms and the t-shirt and I

81
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,829
also on that same engagement was able to

82
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,750
get full access to the server all the

83
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,280
hotels master keys and one of their

84
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,470
unlocked workstations in their back off

85
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,960
this area it was a five-star hotel they

86
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,359
provided everything was very nice good

87
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,220
yelp review but my favorite is that one

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,540
right there we see the computer that's

89
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,700
because I literally walked into the bank

90
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,670
walk behind the teller line there was a

91
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,100
teller giving a service to a client

92
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,958
right beside me I didn't even say hello

93
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,370
I was pretty rude on that engagement

94
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,830
that's like I didn't say hello higher

95
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:02,430
now I just unplugged the computer and

96
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:05,459
walked out without even saying anything

97
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,590
so it was like sort of rude but it was

98
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,570
really cool so so that's what I do so

99
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,670
that's what I do it's like I that's

100
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,840
that's the reason why I'm here one of

101
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,940
the other reasons one hears because I'm

102
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,510
talking about certain things that people

103
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,829
were to realize you I'm very intimidated

104
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,358
I'm gonna be straight up with honesty I

105
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,979
don't filter it's like I tell people I

106
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,049
lie for a living I don't do it for free

107
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,090
so I was very intimidated getting on

108
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,550
this stage because there is a lot of

109
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,960
great technical talks here I mean

110
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,000
there's like me they're dropping O'Day

111
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,370
you know them and I'm like I'm like my

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,900
talk is not technical but that's one of

113
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,750
the key things I want to get a point

114
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,669
across is that we talk about the zero

115
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,710
days we talk about how technical those

116
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,330
things are and everybody wants to be

117
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,340
that guy on the left you know it's like

118
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,870
we want to break into the red team it's

119
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,460
like you know be ninjas go through

120
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,770
skylights it's like act like we know

121
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,479
what we're doing it's like and when you

122
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:58,830
do that and you do that advanced attack

123
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,099
sometimes you're employed your employee

124
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:05,849
or your contract your client will go and

125
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,680
say well that's awesome I mean no that's

126
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,620
not awesome look at all what we did say

127
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,520
yeah but you were so advanced you are so

128
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,290
persistent

129
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,130
you were so threatening of course we

130
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:21,210
couldn't you know be defended against

131
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:23,370
you so we're fine no that's not what

132
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,750
you're supposed to get from that we all

133
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,760
talk about old days

134
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,610
do you realize eighty-four six eighty

135
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,620
six percent of companies all the

136
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:36,690
vulnerabilities that they've got

137
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,889
breached with we're over a decade old so

138
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,950
you're worried about these old days

139
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:43,770
dropping why don't you pass that 5433

140
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:46,139
O'Day maybe you should get working on

141
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,280
that one because that's what is that's

142
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,400
what it's about that's what they're

143
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,500
doing I'm the guy on the right I tell

144
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,900
people this stuff's so easy even I can

145
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,669
do it it's like that's one of the things

146
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,280
we need to learn it's like we need to

147
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:01,139
make sure that our clients are protected

148
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,270
against some of the simple threats some

149
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:06,210
of the threats that are like they're

150
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,280
gonna face more readily than you going

151
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,200
in and drop in a zero-day on their

152
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,450
printer that gets into their VoIP lines

153
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:16,349
that goes in and like you know I'm in

154
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:18,210
great it's like you got an employee over

155
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:20,760
there clicking in an email and your

156
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,500
server has MSO 867 vulnerability on it

157
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,770
it's like that's something that you

158
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,220
should have also fixed now another

159
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:30,840
problem that we face in our industry is

160
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,669
this is what your executives expect from

161
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,010
you right it's like what's on the left

162
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,750
that's what they want we're gonna make a

163
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,400
bigger firewall we've got to make the

164
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,050
apts pay for it it's like we're gonna

165
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,849
make secure

166
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:44,000
great again I'm sorry sorry it's like a

167
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:45,560
definite we're expecting right that's

168
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,900
what works that's what they want that's

169
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,629
what they demand from you they want that

170
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,299
kind of defense and you know you're

171
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:56,330
you're like yeah let's do that

172
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,030
let's get that wall in there this is the

173
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:02,120
budget this is what we need to make that

174
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:04,638
happen and executor whoa hold on hold on

175
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,750
let's not get crazy it's like we're

176
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,509
gonna give you the budget for what's on

177
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,520
the right okay it's like we'll give you

178
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:14,900
what's on the right but we want what's

179
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,430
on the left and you're like that doesn't

180
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,500
compute I mean are you gonna at least

181
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,240
give me a guy with binoculars and like

182
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,240
maybe a traffic cone in front of the one

183
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,740
on the right maybe I something it's like

184
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,930
so it's like you you got to understand

185
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,620
that we're we're faced with these kind

186
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,110
of problems

187
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,659
so I'm saying instead of just getting

188
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,219
blinky boxes it's like I mean I'm not

189
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:35,659
trying to I'm not against technology I'm

190
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:37,190
not against blinky boxes some of them

191
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:39,020
are really cool some have blue lights

192
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,490
now instead of red lights I mean they're

193
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,560
very fancy blinky boxes they're

194
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,539
obviously 2.0 with AI and machine

195
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,509
learning on the blockchain so that's

196
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:49,580
awesome but what about we actually start

197
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:52,370
doing something else besides trying to

198
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,930
get technology to solve our people

199
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,509
problem and start getting our people to

200
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,789
solve our technology problem so and

201
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:01,909
let's go write off the first thing one

202
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:05,180
of the things I love I love it to death

203
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:08,210
is employees not empowered or educated

204
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,729
to question the unusual it's like that's

205
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:13,370
one of our biggest failings I think it's

206
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:15,889
like I wasn't a job last month in the

207
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,349
city in the US and I was there to

208
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:20,900
compromise this the secured facility it

209
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:23,120
was like that secured lobby area then I

210
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,620
go up to this the other floor where

211
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,560
there was another secured door and then

212
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:30,740
I was gonna be inside the area spoiler

213
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,339
alert I got in just you know was in it's

214
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,198
like I I send a text message to the

215
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:38,149
person who was hired me and I told them

216
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:40,640
the point of contact that's like so I'm

217
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:43,429
here and they're like where's your

218
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,930
office and they were like oh no we're

219
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:46,849
down this building it's like go down

220
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,459
this area this is where at and I'm like

221
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,050
no I sent him another picture I've sent

222
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:52,489
him a picture of me in their break room

223
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:56,120
and I was like I'm

224
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:58,670
here here where's your office so it's

225
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,500
like so I was trying to go and and when

226
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,780
I do an engagement what I do as a

227
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,410
security awareness engagement it's not

228
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,490
about winning it's like cuz you know why

229
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,069
servers don't get their feelings hurt

230
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,020
when you pop them within my so 867 they

231
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:15,020
don't care it doesn't compete right

232
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,329
it's like humans do humans get upset

233
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,370
when you when you compromise them so I

234
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:22,250
don't do red team engages I do security

235
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:25,070
awareness engagements every time I do an

236
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,530
engagement I get caught I make sure that

237
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:31,580
I do something that trips me up so that

238
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,829
person will catch me well on this one it

239
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,540
was a little bit more difficult so I'd

240
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,950
already compromised the facility it's

241
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,900
like I already got man it's like it so

242
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,840
now I want to get into the the second

243
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,689
part of the educational process so on

244
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,720
the second day of the engagement I go in

245
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,760
with the USB charging cable looks like

246
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,530
an a lightning cable was a USB ninja

247
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,090
it's like so it's like I had a little

248
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,860
Adreno it's like a little mini computer

249
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,080
inside it and it was like so I started

250
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,060
going to people and I had a fake badge

251
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,710
thank you Instagram because an employee

252
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,750
actually took posted a picture of their

253
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,290
badge on Instagram it took my friend

254
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,320
April

255
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,719
exactly less than 15 minutes to create a

256
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,610
new employee badge using the company's

257
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,590
logo because that was what was on top of

258
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,870
the badge I've made once which stills up

259
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:17,570
every once in a while and so I started

260
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,890
walking around and I was telling

261
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,240
employees like because I want to get

262
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,790
counted I want to be obvious

263
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,320
sounds like hey I'm that's it I'm one

264
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,150
with the company it's like I'm doing a

265
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,440
USB rights management check it's like I

266
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,300
want to make sure that you can't charge

267
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,370
your devices through the computer we

268
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,050
only provide these power outlets so you

269
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,070
can charge your devices through there so

270
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,930
I just need to plug this in and do a

271
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,270
test it just it'll be real simple and

272
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,750
you're like okay cool so I plug in a

273
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,270
cable

274
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:45,050
I don't even put the phone to it it's

275
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:48,050
just the cable I plug it in and then I

276
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:49,729
pull out of my pocket a detonator it's

277
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,620
not really a detonator but it sounds

278
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,940
cool what I say detonator it's like it's

279
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,740
a little square little box with

280
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,660
bluetooth and it's got a Lantana and

281
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,580
it's got two buttons on it so it's like

282
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,189
so I pulled out my detonator and I go

283
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,040
Boop it doesn't it doesn't really say

284
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,870
boot but it sounds cool easy boom so

285
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,140
it's like and then

286
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:14,150
all of a sudden on their screen no pad

287
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:15,920
pops up and Auto magically types test

288
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,880
completed successfully thank you for

289
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,709
your cooperation

290
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:24,050
smiley emoji that's legit right of

291
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:26,410
course that would happen when someone

292
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:31,160
plugs in a cable

293
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:35,959
well obviously the answer is yes because

294
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:39,920
I did it six out of six times and every

295
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,100

supposed to get caught and I'm like so I

300

325
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,380
see a lot of your laptops or unattended

326
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,489

327
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,250
cables on them and they're just leaving

328

329
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:57,200

330
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,959
okay well I'm sure someone's gonna

331
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,240

332
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:06,140

370
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,540
part of the job I'm trying to wait till

374
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,410
to me in a dress and this lady ain't

375
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,510

it's like she comes out he's like I

377
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,860

378
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,479

379
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,330
the laptops like okay just don't hurt

380
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,580
because it's I'm pretty sure you could

381
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,290
hurt me right now it's like because she

382
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,420
detected she heard someone was getting

383
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:18,560
locked up and she what was the best part

384
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:20,270
about it was all the other people like

385
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,390
two or three other people and the two

386
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:25,250
guys are trailing behind her you know

387
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:27,050
she created a posse comitatus she like

388
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,550
come with me we're gonna go get him you

389
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,349
know it's like lucky there was no

390
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,479
pitchforks or fires around so it's like

391
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,790
I was safe there but she grabbed there

392
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,980
buddy

393
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,170
they were like coming in mass now she

394
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,980
motivated she got them the impetus the

395
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:43,589
two employees just weren't empowered

396
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:45,240
they knew it was wrong they knew that

397
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,860
was it but they weren't empowered to

398
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,540
make it the action it's like they were

399
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,430
trying to get flag they're trying she

400
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,709
was not trying to be polite she's

401
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:55,410
getting stuff done that's what you need

402
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:58,710
you need your employees to actually say

403
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,969
hey do you have authorization to try to

404
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,940
do anything with my computer

405
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:05,910
do they know are they educated on the

406
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,100
fact that no one should be at their

407
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:11,010
workstation or do anything with their

408
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,350
workstations unless they're aware of it

409
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,640
previously and there's authorization and

410
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:18,180
there's knowledge that it's supposed to

411
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,230
be going on if they don't that's not

412
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,290
their fault

413
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,810
that's yours that's what you're supposed

414
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,010
to be educating your employees on that's

415
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,739
what you're supposed to be telling your

416
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,540
employees so start that education and

417
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,090
process and start empowering employees

418
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:37,589
to act and then enforce it when it

419
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:40,380
doesn't work now the next thing that I

420
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:42,630
really hate but well besides the obvious

421
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,980
it's like God but our public spaces that

422
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,140
are well monitored and highly visible

423
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,900
it's like this money here no if that's

424
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,980
the actual CIA lobby

425
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,490
are they good just checking for feds

426
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,370
okay

427
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:55,260
so I tell people the only way I'm gonna

428
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,970
get into that building is going through

429
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,050
the back door with a bag over my head so

430
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,420
it's like I don't think I'm never going

431
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:03,120
through the lobby it's like so one of

432
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:05,790
the things I really hate are well

433
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,200
monitored lobbies it's like people that

434
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,060
are like you know that are not letting

435
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,410
me go and loiter cuz I like to loiter

436
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,240
who doesn't like to loiter it's like I

437
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,160
used to be homeless so I wondered a lot

438
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,220
it's like so it's like listen hoodoo

439
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,560
doesn't like doing that so I go in and

440
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,329
this this story's actually and this is

441
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,520
not a story that I'm doing tailored to

442
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,780
you directly it's literally a story that

443
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,849
I've told in several different places

444
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,340
because it's a really good example of

445
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:32,879
how to do it right I was in Moscow last

446
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:35,250
year and I was attending off zone and

447
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,350
right before I came over here to zero

448
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,120
nights but it was actually worked out

449
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,219
where it was like aa blur was first then

450
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,750
zero nights so I was in Moscow I said

451
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,520
I'm just gonna hang out and chill out in

452
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,620

453
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,170

454
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,610

458
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,340
it sounds like yeah I'll take a Turkish

459
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,780
barsky's and it's like it I know Eugene

460
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,370
Kaspersky I've hugged him before he's a

461
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,930
really cool guy it's like good sense of

462
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,959
humor so I was like sure I'll go and

463
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:11,360
I'll go and visit so I get there to the

464
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:14,880
lobby and I want you to understand I'm I

465
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,830
can't turn this off trust me I tried

466
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,140
other people have tried it's like I

467
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,240
can't turn this so whenever I go places

468
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,720
wherever I'm going I just can't help

469
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,300
thinking how would I rob this place you

470
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,220
know if I was going to be breaking in

471
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,850
what would I do is just something that I

472
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,380
do everywhere it's like i one time when

473
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,389
we're not being recorded I'll tell you

474
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,220
what I the fun I had at the Tower of

475
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,710
London and watching the crown jewels

476
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,020
it's a it's a really cool story that I

477
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,240
do not want to be recorded on telling so

478
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,490
so I do things like that it's like this

479
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,490
is just the way I am so I get into the

480
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:53,309
lobby of cos first he's headquarters and

481
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,990
there's a guy a big guard over here by

482
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:57,510
the employee things and there's another

483
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:59,370
guard over there by their little Museum

484
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,170
thing and there were such as desk and

485
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,610
then there's this really cool leather

486
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:07,230
couch that blocks the view of the the

487
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:09,059
reception's desk from where I'm at and a

488
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,610
really cool statue of an elephant with

489
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:13,379
really long legs it's really neat and so

490
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,030
I was like I'm gonna go sit down just

491
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,470
you know just take a look take a breath

492
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:20,700
that's I can just maybe have a glass

493
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:24,090
around see what I can see man my butt

494
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:29,610
did not touch leather before i sat down

495
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:30,780
that security guard was excuse me

496
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,428
comfort I don't know I don't do a

497
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,760
Russian accent obviously it's like it's

498
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:37,860
like how can I help you it's like you've

499
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,450
not registered can I take you over there

500
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,750
it's like I need to you need to be

501
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,429
registered let me let me take you over

502
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,130
there extremely polite

503
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:49,230
this guy had a shirt on that was two

504
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,270
sizes too small or muscles four times

505
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,309
too big he can be applied to see effing

506
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,440
wanted right it's like he was looking

507
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:57,780
and I understood no matter how polite

508
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,030
that was I'm effing going to register

509
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,270
right now

510
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:03,920
so he was very helpful walked me over

511
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,690
there and make sure I didn't get lost

512
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,340
because it was a big Lobby you know it's

513
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,990
like I could have gotten lost there he

514
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,840
knew I was gonna go right there

515
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:14,240
it's I and then I registered as soon as

516
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,840
I registered he could give us about me

517
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,300
I was validated I was verified I was no

518
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,310
longer an unknown it's like little did

519
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:25,820
he know but still whatever it's like

520
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:30,560
that process was done stop making your

521
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:33,110
lobbies enjoyable your lobbies should

522
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,810
only be used by a visitor for the first

523
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,909
five minutes before they get verified

524
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:40,429
and then get taken to where they need to

525
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,950
go take you to the meeting don't make it

526
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,480
comfortable for them don't make it

527
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,550
somewhere where I can go I have spent

528
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,250
days in lobbies it's like in ours it's

529
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:52,310
like monitoring where the traffic are

530
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,470
well how it goes through during the

531
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,690
times a day which gets more traffic

532
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,430
which security guards are more attentive

533
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,740
it's like scoping them out trying to

534
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:03,590
figure out what's going on you want the

535
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:09,110
lobbies to be noticeable as someone's

536
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:11,570
standing around hmm oh three people

537
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:14,570
that's noticeable it's like that should

538
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:16,939
be noticeable so make sure your security

539
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:19,240
is actually monitoring those people make

540
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,860
sure they're monitoring what's going on

541
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,940
now I always love making this joke but

542
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,060
it's like I'm still gonna make it here

543
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,990
so is anybody from the TSA here

544
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,399
obviously not this is a security

545
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,850
conference there's never TSA security

546
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,710
conferences so and this is one that me

547
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,929
and the TSA have a definitely hate hate

548
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,490
relationship don't worry because I don't

549
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:40,100
like security theater very much I give

550
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,630
it two thumbs down but this is one of

551
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,580
the biggest things that I love

552
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,850
no egress filtering or internal

553
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,990
monitoring it's like I love that it's

554
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,030
like and you think about like well how

555
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,400
does that relate to anything what was I

556
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,840
am Telling You it doesn't matter how

557
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,250
great your walls are and what you're

558
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,370
building what you're keeping out if

559
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:01,300
you're not monitoring what's going

560
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:06,189
outbound it's like if you remember sony

561
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:09,169
sony lost one point eight three billion

562
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,360
billion no what am I talking about one

563
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,620
point eight three terabytes there we go

564
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,500
I'm having a problem

565
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:20,870
translating it's like a 1.83 terabytes

566
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:23,360
of data from their network how how do

567
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:25,489
you not notice one point something other

568
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,949
I tear by the day that leaving your

569
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,960
network I mean even if you're a network

570
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,220
thing you should be going like oh should

571
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,380
we increase the bandwidth they look like

572
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,480
they're heavy package going someone

573
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,680
should have noticed that it's like I

574
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,660
wonder why all this stuff's going to

575
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,400
Paraguay I guess not my department

576
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,670
you know is like someone should have

577
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,980
noticed that they were losing that data

578
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:49,760
but no one cared one of my payloads on

579
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:52,730
my devices is very simple it opens up a

580
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,059
command prompt it automatically types

581
00:22:52,730 --> 00:23:00,550
two telnet dachau blinky lights died in

582
00:22:56,059 --> 00:23:03,590
hell in telnet what pops up

583
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:05,960
ASCII Star Wars because who doesn't love

584
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,340
Ashley Star Wars it's amazing it's a

585
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,110
great thing you should try it it's like

586
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,020
totally not malicious but I got a

587
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:13,820
question for you wise up is Bob and

588
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:18,800
accounting being able to tell net to the

589
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:20,899
Netherlands why is that necessary you

590
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,820
need to start making sure when your

591
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,400
employees have to certain rights going

592
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,870
outbound it shouldn't just be oh we

593
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,800
trust what's inside let them go anywhere

594
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:32,989
they want no trust me we don't want them

595
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,780
going anywhere they want they go to some

596
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:37,340
really bad places that's even when

597
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,340
you're monitoring it they go to some

598
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,639
really bad places it's like so lock that

599
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:46,520
down lock it by protocol lock it by IP

600
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,160
address locking by a SN number just lock

601
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,320
it down so you have to start doing that

602
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,660
make it harder for the attacker to do

603
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,790
that call back it's like how many people

604
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,020
are doing that you know just oh you're

605
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,700
not even doing this the malicious stuff

606
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,900
doesn't even happen yet you know the

607
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,880
magic doesn't happen yet you're just

608
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,500
sending out just the initial payload it

609
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,840
goes out to the command control

610
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,800
pulls it in well guess what when it does

611
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,750
that pull in its active okay traffic and

612
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,940
that's part of the problem because

613
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,250
that's being allowed and then all the

614
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:19,990
rest of the attack is coming from within

615
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:24,500
the machine coming within the network

616
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:26,850
now one of the things I hate is dual

617
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,700
factor authentication

618
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:32,490
I hate that I hate it when it's properly

619
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,560
implemented I got to put a caveat on

620
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:37,470
this okay because I've robbed a lot of

621
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,690
banks of my time and the executives all

622
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,180
have the same thing they have that key

623
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,850
fob you know that when they're doing a

624
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,880
million-dollar transfer they have to

625
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,899
have a key fob for because it's

626
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,510
two-factor authentication

627
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,990
it's something you know and it's

628
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:57,960
something you have so I'm like cool it's

629
00:24:54,990 --> 00:25:03,030
like who wants to guess how many times

630
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:05,820
out of 10 I find the device plugged into

631
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:07,379
the laptop nine out of ten good answer

632
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,899
good question it's like good answer

633
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,810
there it's like so 9 out of 10 10 times

634
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,790
guess what most of the time do you know

635
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:18,389
where that device is if it's not already

636
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:20,370
in the laptop check the top drawer it's

637
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,630
in the top drawer it's like trust me out

638
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,219
and this job I've gone through a lot of

639
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:25,860
drawers it's usually in the top drawer

640
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,720
it's like and that's where so that's not

641
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,719
really two-factor authentication people

642
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:35,100
that seems like it is I'm sure it meets

643
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,810
PCI compliance but it's not really make

644
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,820
sure you're doing properly implemented

645
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:42,570
dual factor authentication while your

646
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:45,510
RFID badges it's like because RFID is

647
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:47,159
hard to clone right oh wait no no it's

648
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,450
not actually it's like I've got three

649
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,860
different devices that I can do that

650
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,770
with one of them looks like a keychain

651
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:57,090
it's like so RFID is like so start

652
00:25:52,770 --> 00:26:00,120
having the keypads RFID then a keypad

653
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:02,610
and please not a company-wide keypad so

654
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,100
it's that same four-digit number that

655
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,199
gets rubbed in and I'm like oh look

656
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:12,480
those forward numbers are rubbed out two

657
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:14,790
and three and one and four I wonder what

658
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,830
the code is so it doesn't matter it

659
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:19,470
tasted 21 times to get the right code

660
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:20,909
and I have time because I already have

661
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,190
the employees badge that I picked up

662
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:26,880
from off of Starbucks with our proxmark

663
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:28,740
4 card reader so make sure you're doing

664
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,060
dual factor authentication make sure

665
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,920
that you're actually making it a little

666
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:36,030
bit more difficult for people like me to

667
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:38,640
rob you now all this is well and good

668
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:40,740
all this technology all the devices that

669
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,740
we want to put in but let's be

670
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,230
honest if policies and procedures are

671
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,960
not being followed it doesn't matter and

672
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:52,380
this is a great example of poor

673
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,990
procedures this happened just last year

674
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,390
to civilians somehow breached an Air

675
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,800
Force Base and were found only when one

676
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:02,070
of them told the airman she's been

677
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,290
kidnapped wrap that one around the head

678
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:05,850
for a second you know everybody all

679
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:09,240
worried about everybody you know running

680
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:10,980
into area 51 it turns out you could have

681
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,660
just drove in the Civic in and you've

682
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,250
been fine and you would've been able to

683
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,440
have a kidnap victim in the car was he

684
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:20,880
going like help me please and it's still

685
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,770
been okay that's a problem thank didn't

686
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,210
the airman didn't even understand that

687
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,980
their bright their base had been

688
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,230
breached

689
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:30,480
until she escaped and fall off her

690
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,580
attacker escaped out of the vehicle ran

691
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,360
up to the airman is it help me help me

692
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,059
I've been kidnapped

693
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,760
and their first questions like are you

694
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:40,170
supposed to be here okay it's like what

695
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,809
was that guy doing and I've got another

696
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:45,110
great one this is from his dishes shows

697
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:48,450
you how bad US Air Force bases are

698
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:52,409
during the Cold War and Germany it's

699
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:56,490
like a Russian spy walked up onto a US

700
00:27:52,410 --> 00:28:03,179
Air bi-face bill field walked up to a

701
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:06,090
jet fighter took off a missile put it in

702
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:07,620
a wheelbarrow I hope he stole the wheel

703
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,990
barrel it's like it just sounds cooler

704
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:13,520
if he stole the wheel barrel - okay put

705
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:15,720
it in a wheelbarrow willed it to his car

706
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,260
it's like those were Mercedes of course

707
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,600
it's like and put it in the backseat

708
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:24,870
this is the tip of the missile was

709
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,209
sticking out the window so he put the

710
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:29,189
red flag on it cuz German laws are

711
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,830
German laws you don't f with those okay

712
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:35,630
he had the red tag on on on the missile

713
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:39,178
drove it back to his apartment

714
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:42,630
dismantled the missile and shifted piece

715
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:44,220
by piece back to Russia it was a German

716
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:47,790
metal system every single piece got

717
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:50,280
through we can alter that we call

718
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:52,889
understand maybe some procedures weren't

719
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,080
followed on that base maybe some

720
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:56,929
policies weren't

721
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,269
enforced it doesn't matter how good your

722
00:28:56,929 --> 00:29:01,460
technology is if no one's enforcing

723
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:03,409
what's supposed to be there it's like

724
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,480
you can't just keep using policies and

725
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:08,029
procedures as a way to discipline

726
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,460
someone you don't like or get rid of

727
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:12,169
someone you think is making trouble they

728
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,659
have to be there universally for

729
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:15,140
everybody from the CEO to the guy in the

730
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:16,850
mailroom

731
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,039
everybody should follow those procedures

732
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:21,260
there should be no exceptions

733
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,090
there should be no will he owns the

734
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,340
company so he doesn't have to change his

735
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:28,699
password if everybody changes their

736
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:30,769
password he changes their password it's

737
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:35,510
like if you have a policy it has to be

738
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:40,429
enforced by everyone so what was this

739
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:42,559
about it's like I call this my my my

740
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:43,880
dessert and vegetables talk I decided to

741
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,678
try to be somewhat entertaining it's

742
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,419
like I heard a chuckle once so that was

743
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,580
good so I guess I'm doing that in a

744
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:52,490
little bit but it's also to get you to

745
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,379
the vegetables part so now it's like I

746
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,580
showed you what was broken and what

747
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,710
we're doing wrong and what's going

748
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:00,289
happening let's try to learn about some

749
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:01,820
things that we can do to fix so now I'm

750
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:03,260
gonna give you questions that you can

751
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:06,799
take back to your work to your

752
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:09,408
enterprise and ask them hey are we doing

753
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,929
this or should we do this so let's ask

754
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:13,399
some questions one of the things that

755
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:16,220
you're I teaching these to know is like

756
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:17,629
what are insider threats really you know

757
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,970
everybody likes to think that that's the

758
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:22,370
insider threat the guy on the left you

759
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:23,600
know he's like malicious insider there's

760
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,830
like you know that's the malicious guy

761
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,510
that's the guy we got to worry about

762
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,340
that's the guy who's actively trying to

763
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:32,929
do bad whatever

764
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:34,879
look at this incompetence the TSA again

765
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:36,139
it's like I know this is my surprised

766
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,299
face by the way in case you're wondering

767
00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:40,939
it's like they totally screwed up and

768
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:44,090
did this story published in The

769
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:46,370
Washington Post where they displayed and

770
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:47,689
it wasn't related to the keys they were

771
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:52,189
just trying to get some good artwork

772
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:54,320
they displayed all the keys and the

773
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:56,480
ridges on the keys so they can be

774
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,370
totally copied by everybody and when I

775
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,690
mean by everybody I mean you can

776
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:05,600
download those and 3d print them now

777
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:07,940
that was not a malicious insider that

778
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,399
was just pure stupidity

779
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,170
sometimes your threats not going to be

780
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,990
done from malicious you keep looking for

781
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:16,130
malicious and that's all you see and you

782
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,280
don't see the person doing something

783
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:20,750
really stupid beside you it's like I've

784
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,220
broken into a building one time where I

785
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,110
didn't even break in because there was a

786
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,540
Linksys router inside the building I'm

787
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,740
like that's odd

788
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,920
why is links that's coming I haven't

789
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,570
even gotten to the meeting yet I connect

790
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,490
to the Linksys router because who

791
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,659
doesn't connect to Linksys routers open

792
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,160
up I mean that's what you're supposed to

793
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,960
do your hacker that's that's our that's

794
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,960
our given goal right there right

795
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,990
that's like catnip those openly says

796
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,810
router what can we find so I go into the

797
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:50,870
Linksys router there was no internet

798
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:53,870
access they connected the internal

799
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:57,050
network to the Internet port and I'm

800
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:59,149
like that's not that's what we call bad

801
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:01,700
in information security that's called a

802
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:04,280
finding so yeah I was very unhappy about

803
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:07,760
this it turned out an executive had done

804
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:10,000
that not because they were malicious

805
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,080
insider not because they were a threat

806
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,390
but they were trying to be more

807
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,389
productive they were trying to be a

808
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:19,940
better employee got executives noticed

809
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:23,000
how much time he was wasting in

810
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:25,120
conference rooms going to meetings and

811
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,620
not being able to reply to his emails

812
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,209
not being able to respond to find out

813
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,520
what's going on not being able to get

814
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:34,310
status to do business because he had to

815
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,950
be in a conference room so he plugged

816
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:38,870
that Linksys in pleasure so now he could

817
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,910
be more productive now he could be

818
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:43,610
working on his machine while someone's

819
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,210
droning on its I can actually work be

820
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:47,780
working

821
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:49,400
he had that for four months I'm sure

822
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,070
there was a lot of productive people

823
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,240
going on in that Network right there

824
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:55,550
it's like so you have to make sure that

825
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,610
it's not as a user that's trying to do

826
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:00,100
good who fails monitor everything don't

827
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,510
treat everybody like a malicious user

828
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:05,899
but treat everything like a possible

829
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:08,450
vulnerability that could be exploited so

830
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:11,480
your isn't response shouldn't create a

831
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:14,090
bigger incident this is a huge F up on

832
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,550
several levels I mean I don't have time

833
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:18,500
you can almost do a talk about how bad a

834
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:20,750
US border control screwed up on this one

835
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:24,610
but they allowed their

836
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:28,190
to download data from their private yeah

837
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:31,520
private network and put it on to their

838
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:34,700
contractors network and once again shock

839
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:41,510
based that contractors network got

840
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:45,470
popped and then 300 gigs of data from

841
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:48,640
users and travelers were then downloaded

842
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:51,830
and they were they found out when the

843
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,830
attacker contracted the context of the

844
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:56,629
contractors Tolono was going on well

845
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:59,510
border control decided to do some

846
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:02,330
incident response and they tried to make

847
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:03,710
a statement which yes it worked out just

848
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,210
exactly as you're thinking so it's like

849
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:08,810
so they release the statements like

850
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:11,510
don't worry citizens and travelers we've

851
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,409
scoured the dark web that's the way

852
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,060
you're supposed to say it this is the

853
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:16,669
rule so it's like and it's like and we

854
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:19,879
did not find anything your data is safe

855
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:22,129
it's protected it's like the contractor

856
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:24,020
he's been he's been disciplined

857
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:26,270
they've been counseled they know what

858
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,339
they did it's like we're doing all good

859
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:31,429
Incident Response now your stuff is safe

860
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:33,889
Joseph Cox from one of the reporters

861
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:37,460
spent less than I believe 30 minutes or

862
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:38,030
so and Fant and he also scoured the dark

863
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,570
web

864
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:45,260
it's like and found all 300 gigs in

865
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:47,629
around 30 minutes it's like so now guess

866
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,510
what everything that Homeland Security

867
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:53,690
said if it wasn't before it's even more

868
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:55,369
questionable now because I can't even

869
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,690
believe them to tell me the truth about

870
00:34:55,369 --> 00:35:00,349
what happened with an incident when it's

871
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:04,099
documented make sure after a breach

872
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:06,650
you're communicating fact make sure

873
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:09,740
you're communicating exactly processes

874
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:11,839
what went on what happened the better

875
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,729
you communicate that the better your

876
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,130
your clients your better your

877
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:19,430
stockholders and shareholders and the

878
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:22,310
public feel about what you did or what

879
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:24,348
went wrong it's like when you get caught

880
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:25,880
in a lie when you get caught showing

881
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:29,320
that you were extremely incompetent

882
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:32,300
Experian it's like it goes badly for you

883
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,730
it will go bad you will have a bad day

884
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,380
trust me

885
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:37,329
so that is what we need to start doing

886
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,630
making sure that your incident response

887
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:43,690
doesn't make it worse make sure you're

888
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:45,849
communicating properly here's a little

889
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:49,750
bit lighter one it's like who do you ask

890
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:52,060
for identification what's that everyone

891
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:55,060
correct very good your great great

892
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:57,759
participation here I appreciate that you

893
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,320
asked everyone everyone should have an

894
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,119
ID

895
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,579
everyone should be checking everyone

896
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,670
should be questioning if their

897
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:08,470
co-workers have IDs my friend Benton

898
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:11,079
from trusted SEC he actually told me

899
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:14,049
this story where he said he found a

900
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:17,470
company that every quarter every three

901
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:18,970
months they had a competition it's like

902
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:20,799
and I mean this so they had four

903
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:22,810
competitions every every year it's like

904
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,820
once every three months they had this

905
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,290
competition where one of the employees

906
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,990
in the company would have a valid

907
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:32,609
employee badge but they would change the

908
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:35,259
picture of the employees face to Waldo

909
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:38,410
de Bruyne Oh Waldo Where's Waldo and

910
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:40,329
that was a whole game was to question

911
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:43,180
your employees and check to see Where's

912
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:45,430
Waldo it's like and that's awesome

913
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,960
because what for cuz you gotta

914
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:49,118
understand something employees don't

915
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,440
care about your day they're surprised

916
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,839
this is you know it's like they don't

917
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,490
care about your security but they do

918
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:56,890
care about something that's in it for

919
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:59,560
them so by turning that into a

920
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:03,819
competition employees were more aware

921
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:06,970
and more we just just on the lookout for

922
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:09,190
employee badges if I would have tried to

923
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:11,890
go in to that company that was doing

924
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:15,849
that and I had my fake badge on I would

925
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:17,049
also have a bad day is that because they

926
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:18,640
would have spotted that they would have

927
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:22,210
been on to it because they were looking

928
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,089
for things like that so weaponized your

929
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:26,380
workforce it's like they're not part of

930
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:28,210
your problem they're part of your

931
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:32,380
solution they're an asset not a

932
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:34,599
liability so make them that way another

933
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,160
thing is what is your social media

934
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,300
profile really say about you that's

935
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,368
where they've got to be careful about

936
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,349
right it's like first about the rules

937
00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:43,329
are like you know employee probably I'm

938
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:45,099
not saying you can dictate what an

939
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:46,950
employee is publishing or not polishing

940
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:49,440
but make them

941
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,930
where of what they are publishing and

942
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,460
how it can be used against them like I

943
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,770
was able to find I mean if you want to

944
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,720
know why you know hackers drink do a

945
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,670
search on Instagram for hashtag new

946
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,410
badge

947
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:03,450
hashtag new job it makes you sad it's

948
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:05,040
like it's I mean I don't drink alcohol

949
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,839
and every once in a while I'll go

950
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,820
through it's like what does vodka taste

951
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:11,940
like you know it's like it's those kind

952
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:14,040
of days so make sure your employees know

953
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:17,430
I did a job one time where I was showing

954
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,770
an example of bad for a lady on Facebook

955
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:22,200
has it made her cell phone number and

956
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:25,290
home address publicly accessible to

957
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,118
everybody on Facebook not even for

958
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,349
friends cuz trust me we weren't friends

959
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,630
and we were never going to be after I

960
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:32,460
did these slides it's like but it was

961
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:34,109
all the information was just right there

962
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,990
and if you didn't believe me

963
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:39,270
it's like the next slide was a picture

964
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,709
for the front of her house don't give me

965
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,150
those creepy looks it's like I got it

966
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,980
from Google Streetview okay I didn't

967
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,119
actually like I'm not that dedicated I

968
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,010
didn't like go to her house to take the

969
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,300
picture like you know selfie it's like I

970
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,930
just I just got it from Google

971
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,270
Streetview

972
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:53,910
it's like then I showed that and that

973
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:55,680
makes the employees understand that what

974
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:57,480
they think is innocent fun of just

975
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,819
posting stuff like are their vacation

976
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,310
pics or where they're going can be used

977
00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:04,259
for a spear phishing attack can be used

978
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:06,210
for a social engineering attack they

979
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,859
need to know and be careful about what

980
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:10,020
they're posting where they're at what

981
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:11,759
they're doing for things like that show

982
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,740
them why they have to be worried and

983
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,940
they'll usually protect themselves screw

984
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:18,990
the company but they'll protect

985
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,730
themselves which then protects you now

986
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,049
phishing is one of the leading causes of

987
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,910
compromise with your employees really

988
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,560
take it seriously this is from just last

989
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:29,578
week phishing attacks reach the highest

990
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:32,578
level in three years guess what it's not

991
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:36,180
going to go down cuz that's like hacking

992
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:37,829
on the easy mode send an email send a

993
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,480
link I mean thanks to LinkedIn because

994
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:41,819
most of the people that are breached are

995
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,569
using the LinkedIn data dump for the

996
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:44,520
password

997
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:46,619
you send the email what's up the the

998
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,300
LinkedIn old LinkedIn password and tell

999
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:50,849
the person oh I saw you do this and this

1000
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,650
and like give me Bitcoin and that's

1001
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:56,640
effective because people my old that's

1002
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:58,680
my password still after a decade that's

1003
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,490
still my password they got my password

1004
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,960
it's like so you need

1005
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,689
to your employees about things like that

1006
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,250
as well it's like show them that it's

1007
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:09,780
like and we need to make sure that it's

1008
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:12,420
like they understand repercussions if

1009
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:16,510
your delivery driver that you hired

1010
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:19,660
totals your delivery van what happens to

1011
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:22,270
them probably something you know they

1012
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:25,540
get a talking-to right what about the

1013
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:27,210
second time they do it well then they're

1014
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:30,460
gonna have to go see their supervisor

1015
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:34,810
the third time you go maybe you

1016
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:37,750
shouldn't have keys right you do not let

1017
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:40,029
your employee who does delivery who uses

1018
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:43,619
that tool that uses the vehicle which is

1019
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:46,030
what you gave them for the to work with

1020
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:48,010
you don't let them keep totaling the

1021
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:50,830
vehicle and be okay with it

1022
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:55,089
why do we let our users keep totaling

1023
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:57,460
our network and be okay with it I say if

1024
00:40:55,089 --> 00:41:00,279
an employee clicks on a suspicious email

1025
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:02,589
or a phishing link the first time you

1026
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,210
educate them you set them down and you

1027
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:07,359
explain to them what was wrong and what

1028
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:09,160
they did wrong the second time you take

1029
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,310
them to a separate course and you give

1030
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,049
them limited access and you make them go

1031
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:18,580
through some extra steps before they get

1032
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:21,339
their email by the third time there's no

1033
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:25,029
third type get them the out if they

1034
00:41:21,339 --> 00:41:27,190
click that link that their time it's

1035
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:29,349
like we're all upset about a $30,000

1036
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:31,839
vehicle getting totaled but they can

1037
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:35,109
drop target can lose 300 million to an

1038
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,640
email and it's like oh that's bad you

1039
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:39,040
need the employees to know that there

1040
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,560
are repercussions it's not just oh we

1041
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,000
told you not to do that it's like they

1042
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,589
have to understand that they could lose

1043
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,760
their job and guess what then they'll

1044
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:50,770
start taking it seriously how many times

1045
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,380
do we vet our security systems to make

1046
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:54,339
sure their operating is attended do we

1047
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,710
actually bet once we've installed

1048
00:41:54,339 --> 00:41:57,849
everything do we actually then look for

1049
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,470
it in tax to make sure it's still

1050
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,510
working do we test to make sure it's

1051
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:04,029
doing what's supposed to this is a great

1052
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:05,980
story from the NSA improperly over

1053
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:07,869
collected call detail records for a

1054
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,369
second time last year documents show

1055
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:11,380
renewing privacy concerns about the

1056
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:13,180
surveillance program due to expire in

1057
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,839
December say this is my super shocked

1058
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,269
face

1059
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,499
oh they collected even more data I'm

1060
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:19,118
sure they didn't mean to and they feel

1061
00:42:17,499 --> 00:42:21,488
really bad about it it's like have you

1062
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,069
ever noticed just like the NSA the F the

1063
00:42:21,489 --> 00:42:25,479
Facebook whenever they make a mistake on

1064
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:27,339
their account settings or something it's

1065
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:29,198
always to make it more public and gather

1066
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:31,509
more information have you ever gotten a

1067
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:34,779
notice from Facebook that said oh we're

1068
00:42:31,509 --> 00:42:37,239
so sorry it's like we made a change in

1069
00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:39,609
our program and so now we click less

1070
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:41,769
data about you it's like to open this up

1071
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:44,199
to be more public please click here

1072
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:45,788
no you never get that it's always nope

1073
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:47,259
nope we'd love to wide open sorry our

1074
00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:48,759
bad you may want to go back into your

1075
00:42:47,259 --> 00:42:49,809
settings because now your stalkers and

1076
00:42:48,759 --> 00:42:51,489
all the other people that don't like you

1077
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:53,920
and your exes can now see what you've

1078
00:42:51,489 --> 00:42:57,089
said about them on Facebook which is

1079
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:02,680
awkward so yeah you got to work on that

1080
00:42:57,089 --> 00:43:05,828
so who puts in an IDs system and then

1081
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,808
like we're done it's like you testy you

1082
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:10,119
go to the front but what about six

1083
00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:12,759
months from now what about a year from

1084
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:14,859
now do you still test to see if that IDs

1085
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:16,239
is doing what you paid it for are you

1086
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:17,799
still making sure that it's updated are

1087
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:19,689
the firewalls still doing what they're

1088
00:43:17,799 --> 00:43:21,519
supposed to do or they properly passed

1089
00:43:19,689 --> 00:43:24,549
properly maintained properly updated

1090
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:26,169
constantly vet and check your security

1091
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:29,319
sir what happens when you send yourself

1092
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:31,779
a virus into your internal network who

1093
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:33,308
doesn't right I'm not the only one

1094
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:35,469
listens viruses to my internal company

1095
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:37,239
ok whatever it's like so you've got a

1096
00:43:35,469 --> 00:43:39,429
test app but though because you want to

1097
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:41,890
see what the reaction will be you want

1098
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:43,509
to see what if everything's working like

1099
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:45,549
you paid that guy I mean the sales

1100
00:43:43,509 --> 00:43:46,929
engineer was a great guy took you out to

1101
00:43:45,549 --> 00:43:49,119
dinner and everything was a good food

1102
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:51,549
it's like but maybe you want to just

1103
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,939
keep checking it maybe you want to just

1104
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:57,279
you know trust but verify that stuff so

1105
00:43:54,939 --> 00:43:59,529
one of the last notes I want to leave is

1106
00:43:57,279 --> 00:44:02,259
it's like man Jason this vaguely sounds

1107
00:43:59,529 --> 00:44:04,359
familiar it's like yeah I've been

1108
00:44:02,259 --> 00:44:07,420
talking about employee education for

1109
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:10,779
over 10 years I've just tried to figure

1110
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:14,529
out different ways to say it it's like

1111
00:44:10,779 --> 00:44:17,199
and now it's like you're like oh yes now

1112
00:44:14,529 --> 00:44:19,569
I'm just up and confessing to it we need

1113
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,150
to start getting more of our employees

1114
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:24,759
part of our program instead of being

1115
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:26,630
part of the problem we need to start

1116
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:28,489
educating them on that

1117
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,900
we need to start making them work for us

1118
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:31,819
instead of constantly feeling that

1119
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:34,099
they're working against us that is a

1120
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:36,049
constant issue it's like great

1121
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:38,089
technology there's great vulnerabilities

1122
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:40,729
out there but when a user is still going

1123
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:43,249
to click on a link because you said

1124
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:45,200
dancing gerbils and they're like they

1125
00:44:43,249 --> 00:44:46,609
get the warning and the technology pops

1126
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,710
it was like are you sure you want to go

1127
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:51,410
to this website this lights this website

1128
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:54,109
seems mainly compromisable this website

1129
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:57,739
doesn't seem secure click yes or no and

1130
00:44:54,109 --> 00:45:01,549
