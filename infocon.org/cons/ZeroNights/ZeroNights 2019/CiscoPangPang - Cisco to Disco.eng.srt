1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:19,990
oh hello yeah no a spasiba

2
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,300
we are young I'm Hammacher and this is

3
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:25,349
certainly we are given a talk about a

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,350
Cisco to disco

5
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,250
our presentation we're pretending the

6
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:35,260
for another intro and motivation and

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,329
brief brief description about this

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,079
framework which consisting of function

9
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:43,270
tracer developer foster and

10
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,260
demonstration for and they was our first

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:48,579
friend but sorry I the restaurant

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,329
demonstration about Andy has some

13
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:54,969
problem in demo soul some dead issue so

14
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:59,289
it prepared other truth demo what those

15
00:00:54,969 --> 00:01:04,000
demo are not showing on today I was I

16
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:06,220
want to say sorry at first first of all

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,729
let me introduce me and my colleague

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:12,220
Reverend South Korea and Cisco punkin

19
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:14,380
team is working on projects so analytes

20
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,200
is working this is Clara Spooner

21
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,990
abilities this project is currently

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:25,030
underway and still has a long way to go

23
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:27,610
and you can see our names this is my

24
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,789
nickname this is her nickname this is

25
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:35,020
other guys named data unfortunately it

26
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:38,289
wasn't happening name sorry and yeah

27
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:41,890
Cisco's the disco first of all these

28
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:45,340
comments destroys disco and developing

29
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:47,649
Cisco has exploited frame with one day

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,929
will present warning others his

31
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:52,989
methodology using disco frame which we

32
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:56,849
developed framework internal structure

33
00:01:52,989 --> 00:02:01,929
and behavior which aka disco framework

34
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:07,450
second is cancelled I'm sorry ok Cisco's

35
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:10,060
analysis methodology first of all why do

36
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,780
we do this because there is no suitable

37
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:16,180
analysis tool for Cisco IOS analysis

38
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,590
there are about almost 400,000 functions

39
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,050
in Cisco IOS the

40
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,930
and it's hard to find and Ally analyze

41
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:27,320
them all also there is a tip over built

42
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:31,250
by Kaspersky rep for Cisco IOS which is

43
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:33,620
fully implemented and let go features so

44
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,330
recreate a custom debugger based on the

45
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:40,340
original debugger for Cisco IOS

46
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:42,740
allergists then the father has been

47
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,830
publishing on blackhat 2011 by unloading

48
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:48,740
iOS image based on dynamics and pausing

49
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,750
the image however as dynamic support for

50
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,970
the latest iOS image is no longer

51
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,790
available so it's hard to find the

52
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:58,010
charity using dynamics accordingly we

53
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,970
present Mossad for voting the actual

54
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,829
action mod and show the demo this may be

55
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,230
helpful when analyzing or studying

56
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,060
dublin arbitrator detail will be

57
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:16,160
discussed

58
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:22,160
ASAP and function tracer ya function

59
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:24,769
trace function tracer in there's I think

60
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,079
I insert the frontier to disk shown in

61
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,760
script but there's no so I threating

62
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,820
introduce the function trace observe

63
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,470
from the tracer is a you have to trace

64
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:37,239
the function in Cisco IOS

65
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:40,670
for developing the instrument takes some

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:43,400
function trace or coverage or something

67
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:49,250
like that we try to make our own methods

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:53,690
to implement a function tracing yeah we

69
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:57,470
try to make it right why do we make our

70
00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:02,240
own analogic tools there is other one

71
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:04,820
good tools but why it is it may be

72
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,310
because this cost analysis has well no

73
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,590
notorious for its difficulty there are

74
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,140
some reasons for this first it's a

75
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,690
single monolithic operating system so

76
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,820
it's a big very big alpha file

77
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,310
second because of the extensive

78
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,709
diversity of images there are too many

79
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:26,900
difference between versions which may

80
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:27,650
consist cost analysis difficult other

81
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,320
Cisco IOS

82
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,479
presentation like pretends by

83
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,230
Alton kondratenko or Georgia no sink

84
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,690
from embedded but there are great

85
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:42,510
presentation we will run about learn a

86
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,510
lot about them but their transition

87
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,789
focus don't exploit only so we present

88
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:52,099
or differ study of the Swan the analysis

89
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,100
process using reticle tools we made

90
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,750
we're not present our tools and show you

91
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:05,340
how much teachers it cost analysis can

92
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:07,380
be first developer as I said there's all

93
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,750
original iOS only mips tea bubble

94
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:14,159
created by art and kondratenko which is

95
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,960
the Kaspersky Lab researcher which has

96
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,240
clearly had the basic features such as

97
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:23,250
memory read and write and disassemble

98
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,710
using Keystone argue well about why we

99
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,860
had creative over new tubular because

100
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,010
the edge create this original debugger

101
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,930
has developed in the form of sending the

102
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:36,300
origin receiving standing and receiving

103
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,760
data from gdb remoted see your photo you

104
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,620
can read write memory memory

105
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,650
unregistered be able to see your foot

106
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:47,910
call it was something other instruction

107
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:52,799
like continue other break whatever yeah

108
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:55,440
and but this is oh why why we have to do

109
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:03,170
this because it's foreign implemented as

110
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:07,980
I said before so why this which was some

111
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:10,680
we our debugger has which original table

112
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:14,580
some alternative also has some this

113
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,950
features but some of these are foreign

114
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,440
implemented as a style as I said so I

115
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:22,409
thirteen choose myself why we have to

116
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,110
include include this in our debugger

117
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:28,350
first of all step over and step into as

118
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:31,770
you of course you guys already have used

119
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:34,410
other tables like gdb windbg or oddity

120
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,969
which every debugger has a step into and

121
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,220
step over

122
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,300
but this debugger has only GD RSP to

123
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,320
communicate with you

124
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,990
Cisco IOS and stuff so we helped

125
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,250
in front of every feature we have we

126
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:52,310
want and we need to analyze the skies

127
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:55,100
first of all stay over in stir as you

128
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:58,460
know friends like a friend or jump

129
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:02,150
instruction you have to trace the jump

130
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:04,159
or branch instruction for inside or

131
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,140
outside step over and step into step

132
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,230
into is a simple just go inside but step

133
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,900
over have to call liquor Seabury inside

134
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:16,040
the functions we have two alternative

135
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:19,280
power has is that it has that kind of

136
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,970
functions but it's all implemented so we

137
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,940
have to make our own these features a

138
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:29,720
second this is continue that continue in

139
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,969
Horizonte power that continue what we

140
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:37,430
have we need some advanced feature like

141
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:41,180
you have to check what some Cisco IOS

142
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:44,450
feature itself or just continue or

143
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,940
develop more precisely or chip keep

144
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:50,360
debugging or continuing you can check

145
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,700
the continuing message and memory

146
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,690
template there is a memory dump in gdb

147
00:07:52,700 --> 00:08:00,640
RSP but this there is a limit in rennes

148
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:04,070
and it said next 100 parts but origin is

149
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:08,120
199 bytes so we tried to make fix it

150
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:14,150
ourselves so is unlimited now inaudible

151
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:17,590
yeah and also debug mode available since

152
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:21,349
the sky us before it used gdb Conner or

153
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:25,130
boot - Booie an option in Rama mode to

154
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:29,330
debug to enable the debug feature and

155
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:35,200
said without gdb Conner it's precisely

156
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:35,199
or precise or not developer features

157
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:44,150
also actually it's not also its debug

158
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:48,050
feature and Cisco our debugger standard

159
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:51,020
gdb connors string to the discolours and

160
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:54,380
auto in a little debugging feature is

161
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,030
app and you have there's simple but

162
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,100
important thing is you have to

163
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:01,640
there is a steel connection between

164
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:05,660
these choirs and the computer or hosts

165
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,569
whatever when you enable that gdb color

166
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,260
or whenever the debugger feature in

167
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,740
Cisco IOS

168
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:15,980
you helped this color to zero and you

169
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:19,550
have to recollect the serial to the sky

170
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:22,820
us if you want more debugging and Cisco

171
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:26,209
to either either to Cisco yeah this is

172
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:29,240
it can be its January but we usually use

173
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:33,200
using either to analyze these coils and

174
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:37,420
we have to know which addresses which

175
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:40,730
other season correspond with either

176
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:46,939
there is something so called AES error

177
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:49,550
in Cisco IOS but if it's not difficult

178
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:53,060
to calculate we we can use our

179
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,729
calculator or you can use our frame but

180
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,709
I don't want that so we implemented in

181
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:01,430
the developer reserve to crack or to

182
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:05,420
calculate and print type Meru you can

183
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:07,510
think it's like a gdb it's a it's almost

184
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:13,579
cracked spawned with the gdb comment

185
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:19,250
just be enabling me implemented in our

186
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:21,440
debugger and is alive is a it's another

187
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,870
develop debugging feature in our

188
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,320
debugger you can check the Cisco's

189
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:30,530
debugger is keep these processes keep

190
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,020
continuing or it's enabled white is the

191
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:35,990
one feature is enabled or is it that or

192
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:38,210
is it alive it returns that it will

193
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:41,690
arrive or that you can check it on our

194
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:44,180
debug web map is a virtual memory map as

195
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,700
you can see it it's just a passing the

196
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:50,089
show region comment outward from the

197
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:56,570
z-scores its info but it's very powerful

198
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:58,640
if you continuing the research yes and

199
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,640
save the frequency it's little bit

200
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,640
simple of a powerful otherwise you have

201
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:07,730
to save the breakpoints in the operative

202
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,620
over because if you shoot the Devourer

203
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:13,550
how do you continuing

204
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:16,760
research on your Cisco IOS you have to

205
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:19,810
keep the tip breakpoint or a base error

206
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,810
information or other blahblah coverage

207
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:27,650
we try to save all kinds of information

208
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:29,779
toward more analyzed in the fire

209
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:32,540
this is that Titan for final port

210
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:37,100
whatever yeah save the fake points and

211
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:42,010
other valuable information and this is

212
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:49,220
infrastructure we try to control our

213
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:50,300
debugger structure yes so it's like a PC

214
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,580
but it's a router

215
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:59,750
actually it's rattle first router is on

216
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:02,089
the it left without tip over and devour

217
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:08,300
chip collect can interact with rotary

218
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:12,020
stuff and we they exchange their data

219
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:18,949
with a gdb RSP immaterial photo and it's

220
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:21,680
told in pile and needed or wrapper until

221
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:24,050
also interact with either I mean in

222
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,880
Turkey is a little bit misunderstand

223
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:33,680
what interact with either to keep the

224
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:37,790
course two-dimensional data chip to keep

225
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,849
the channels data this is a simple

226
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:44,270
result and our debugger this is the web

227
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:47,300
picture is cisco itself and right is

228
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:49,579
either disassembler we try to keep the

229
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,829
still chance disassembling view in the

230
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:56,660
cisco step over and either disassembler

231
00:12:51,830 --> 00:13:00,800
you can see this is auto calculate in

232
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:04,640
our debugger is successfully working as

233
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:09,079
i hope you can see this is ribbit unseen

234
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:13,310
of oh sorry you know to calculate and

235
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:16,790
debug okay the next one is a function

236
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:19,270
tracer this will adjust by any my

237
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,270
colleague

238
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:29,120
I am Charlie and I introduce our

239
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:35,069
concentrator

240
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:37,950
she's cooperating in Connor his clients

241
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:39,930
is single one all of the ways that

242
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,780
operates on hardware

243
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:46,410
it makes difficult to analyze with

244
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:51,150
counters like Pinterest rains and so on

245
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:54,540
even if you try to use binary defender

246
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:58,650
to perform pathologist with different

247
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:01,380
person of cigarettes the nature of these

248
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:05,430
clients with hundreds of thousands of

249
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:08,430
functions makes it difficult to find dr.

250
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:11,760
cheese to overcome this problem in

251
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:16,020
analyzing these clients we create of

252
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:19,710
infrastructure concentration at first in

253
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:24,390
start with simple idea but it turns out

254
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:27,600
there was wrong with the idea so we used

255
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:31,170
different method to implement on some

256
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:35,730
trees I won't explain step-by-step at

257
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:39,030
the beginning the first thing to do to

258
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:44,850
implement function tracer was to find

259
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:48,060
the way to Road pets is if the meat is

260
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:51,060
talked before loading through this

261
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:55,430
earthly nature validation such as the

262
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:59,189
two nine one one water we have and the

263
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:03,000
pedestal is cannot be loaded into the

264
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:06,620
system however after finding that there

265
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,820
was some Seabees they could hypothesize

266
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:16,020
a nice we studied and otherwise about

267
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:21,590
which is bending by past artist

268
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:28,050
assignments for our attempt to bypass on

269
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:30,210
c29 one water was ferried anyway no

270
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:33,150
further research about this article

271
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,950
nature was carried out and hypothesis

272
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:38,010
making

273
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:43,110
I personally think there must be a way

274
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:46,620
they're honest since then the direction

275
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:50,640
has been changed to dynamic touch throw

276
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:53,190
the ball mode instead of state judge I

277
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:56,189
was thinking about what to do with

278
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:58,940
tracing and I cannot beat on flagship

279
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:04,080
idea and decide to use it

280
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:06,450
the idea was to extract all set off the

281
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:10,170
phone some voters to be changing in

282
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:13,260
either and obtain dynamic addresses of

283
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:15,810
cotton areas through your communication

284
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:19,490
find functional dress of extra memory

285
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:23,880
and write breakpoint at those functions

286
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:27,930
then it will stop a breakpoint when the

287
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:30,300
function is he's cheated and Transtar

288
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:33,949
will continue to receive their

289
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:38,370
communication and monetary receipt

290
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:41,730
referent and if it is confirmed it will

291
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:45,240
be a pareo program counter read store

292
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:50,880
and print topper you and continue to

293
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:54,510
keep the processor on however this

294
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,910
method had many problems some of the

295
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,610
functions did not take point

296
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:03,240
I don't know we start if that survived

297
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:06,559
but he was fished manually by making

298
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,290
playlists through dynamic analysis

299
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:14,059
recognized the concentration is he

300
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:18,109
preparing treats and of program counter

301
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:21,420
recipe and then continuing the process

302
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:24,899
taster label in real-time

303
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:29,910
this program is two fatal for some

304
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:33,540
natural operations needed to be time the

305
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:37,920
number breakpoint is rented a few

306
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:40,830
thousand such as demo video above fine

307
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:44,280
for nature of the thief clients that

308
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:47,300
consist with hundreds of thousands of

309
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,690
functions which are checking your phone

310
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:53,780
the problem is that when we tried to

311
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:56,630
ride more breakpoint she flies does not

312
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:59,440
work properly and developments right

313
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:02,720
proof points a stranger location I

314
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:10,910
really really work hard on this but I

315
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:14,090
fell talking front is tracing the ideas

316
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:18,590
thrown into carpets later instead of

317
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:21,530
using the ball motor functionality dbms

318
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:24,889
thought was adopted using the loop

319
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:27,889
heading area in total station although

320
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,530
the offset of the function to be tracing

321
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:33,530
with the I tau is the same the

322
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:37,250
conditionals tracing function has been

323
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:41,240
increased it first start with technical

324
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:44,780
stuff step follow account after creating

325
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:49,580
state space s prologue next to install

326
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:54,950
some must be stored or root word and the

327
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:59,960
barrier must be stirred in realistic he

328
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:03,080
tried to to effect original control the

329
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,780
original function fetch instruction was

330
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,960
being restored after the instrumentation

331
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:11,450
code has been is Kitty there front is

332
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:16,730
two conditions are structurally

333
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:21,200
intentional my function trees the reason

334
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:24,920
why the two instruction after flow must

335
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,440
be stored on road road is because first

336
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:30,980
of all having thoughts instruction right

337
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:34,480
after step follow me instead they have

338
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:37,940
taken over the arguments from the color

339
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,630
so it is first racing more than any

340
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,610
function there is each cuted without any

341
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,130
arguments

342
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:50,389
dr. thomas of the instruction to be

343
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:53,710
restart as follow is this all such that

344
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:59,030
the different values for each function

345
00:19:53,710 --> 00:20:00,390
the sides of death the typographer you

346
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:03,870
have tell does

347
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:07,919
and whether does instructor is rot or

348
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:11,010
restored structure function tests are

349
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:14,610
designed to recover fetch instruction

350
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:16,879
which this can distinguish it differs

351
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:19,320
from its function

352
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,279
yeah it's really dirty

353
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,279
I know anyway

354
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:33,360
finding fringe of function is very easy

355
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:39,629
so written comment and find straining

356
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:44,428
the either side step tied assigned to

357
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:47,580
function in step four is kept in the t5

358
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:51,149
register and used to allocate instead

359
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:56,668
space before returning to the original

360
00:20:51,149 --> 00:21:00,389
function after attending the function of

361
00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:03,240
there's just years so how do you restore

362
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:08,189
the remaining two pets the instructions

363
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:12,380
as shown in the diagram the Seraph

364
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:18,000
offset in the formal lift his read and

365
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:22,860
mr. draw restored under stir rod word

366
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:26,240
and restore at total functions the

367
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:32,250
function of remotes in code came as you

368
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:38,549
can see this is in proceed and it's just

369
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:42,330
a neat original code and as you can see

370
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:46,230
this is a simple search case we did

371
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:50,760
cruel for most if T we are able to

372
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:53,370
restore instructions and influence DPI

373
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,750
star functions so it's very tall

374
00:21:53,370 --> 00:22:00,840
changing the original flow

375
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:04,529
second is water the previous research

376
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:07,860
has focused on rocker faulting on disk

377
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:11,220
i/os limits improved using dynamic

378
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:13,100
however enemy does not support or it is

379
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:18,480
that is limited

380
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:26,250
there is the reputation in fuzzy forest

381
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:31,200
of our how Cisco IOS of our worst first

417
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:46,149
this is written in Step five is

418

reason comment to clients and that was

421
00:24:52,840 --> 00:25:02,049
incredible the overall structure of

422
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,010
delivery of safety from the Python

423
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:08,590
script to the airports and if info file

424
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:11,470
is not exist yet are various information

425
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:19,510
like memory mapping information

426
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:22,890
latter basic without rest and so on this

427
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,890
is demo debugger

428
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:34,590
we can confirm the extra memory address

429
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:34,590
it's in Dodgers in the Ida

430
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:47,689
and then you get info file you can see

431
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:52,629
the memory memory mapping information

432
00:25:47,690 --> 00:26:01,550
base address and breakpoint are recorded

433
00:25:52,630 --> 00:26:04,270
and this is continued comment and this

434
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,270
is demo

435
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,940
my point

436
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:50,550
in for firehouse various information I

437
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,820
tried to continue process you can see

438
00:26:50,550 --> 00:27:02,629
don't you brought you from the Thompson

439
00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:02,629
and that is also just a demo

440
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,560
almost tracer I could carry various

441
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,890
functions

442
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:48,520
and from some choices is working will

443
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:56,290
you print current functioning

444
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:21,919
and last demo is water we will show you

445
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:25,869
SNMP powders I mean cutie father

446
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,869
it sounds arbitrary as an IP packet on

447
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:28,869


448
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,850
Dizzy's father Dean apiece

449
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:24,619
if crash you're cursed

450
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:26,680
when you see the database you can see

451
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:31,000
data sent by winter there for listening

452
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:32,920
our presentation we are even studying

453
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,470
and we were wrong for this class

454
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:41,070
research these uploads for our speakers

455
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:41,070
thank you thank you
