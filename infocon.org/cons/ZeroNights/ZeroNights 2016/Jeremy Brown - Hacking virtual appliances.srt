<font color="#E5E5E5">and two hours and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to you</font>

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,039
about browser fuzzing so come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back for</font>

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,010
that right now talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you about</font>

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,510
hacking virtual appliances and this is

24
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,339
an area that's really interesting to me

25
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,048
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of got into it because I</font>

26
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,320
didn't see anyone doing security around

27
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,390
these things and when i first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,130
looking them<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of really</font>

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,619
interesting bugs a lot of remote a lot

30
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,360
of remote root bugs so they became

31
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,450
really valuable so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just had to do more</font>

32
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,250
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more research and again I didn't see</font>

33
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,710
many people looking in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this area and</font>

34
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,659
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these bugs are very specific to</font>

35
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,158
virtual appliances if you know what

36
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,570
virtual appliances mean that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

37
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,979
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through all that and</font>

38
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:42,210
hopefully you<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you something new</font>

run<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the agenda look at the</font>

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,979
introduction just kind of talk about

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">what virtual appliances are where they</font>

43
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,840
are you know why this stuff's important

44
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,509
at all always good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know motivation to</font>

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,750
do further research look it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> image</font>

46
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,979
analysis and how I actually went about

47
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,570
looking and finding these

48
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,369
vulnerabilities and virtual appliances

49
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,039
and they look into the vulnerabilities

50
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,479
themselves there's a ton and a few

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,920
different categories I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of group</font>

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,869
them together in the miscellaneous at

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,430
the end because there's so many

54
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">different kinds of bugs you can find in</font>

55
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,439
them and some are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific to</font>

56
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,959
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of virtual appliance</font>

57
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,250
area like password glitter<font color="#E5E5E5"> this pretty</font>

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,230
specific there's some other areas it

59
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,480
gets into two and then go with the

60
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,179
conclusion and you know where to go from

61
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,159
here and how vendors can actually start

62
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,079
making these much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure than they</font>

63
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:35,760
are right now so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my name</font>

72
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,780
engineering things like that so fun

73
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,000
times so to be clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm not</font>

74
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,250
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this area in the in the</font>

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">VA area relatively non critical issues</font>

76
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,049
let me talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> much denial service</font>

77
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:09,298
cross that scripting again these can be

78
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:12,269
critical in other areas but virtual

79
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:13,799
appliances it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge deal and also</font>

80
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,389
not decrypting the VM images school

81
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,709
because that's sometimes necessary as

82
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:21,660
well in order to even start doing a

83
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,750
static analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> images you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

84
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,280
to you know have the keys and<font color="#E5E5E5"> decrypt</font>

85
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,699
them and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of tools that</font>

86
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">will let you do that today so all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

87
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,120
pretty buck hunting stuff this talk is

88
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:35,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">very focused</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on vulnerabilities and so</font>

89
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,699
we're going to be mostly talking about

90
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:42,419
remote shells if you're a fan of remote

91
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:44,400
shells command injection backdoor counts

92
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,510
and then once we get the shell we're

93
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,269
going to be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to escalate</font>

94
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,370
privileges to of course route because

95
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,690
most assistance we look at just at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

96
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,900
of them that looked at our linux-based

97
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:57,329
systems so keep that in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well and</font>

98
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,190
other interesting bugs there's a for

99
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,959
mastering bug in here some kind of

100
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,840
misconfigured services that allow us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

101
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,569
to gain a little bit of ground and again

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,540
the one of my favorite bugs is specific

103
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:13,500
to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> area is you know password litter</font>

104
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you more about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

105
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,459
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the virtual appliance you guys</font>

106
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,159
are probably pretty smart you can figure

107
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,919
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out physical appliance virtual</font>

108
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:24,990
appliance so physical box and then you

109
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,270
have a disk image that you enter into a

110
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,550
hypervisor with all kinds of configure

111
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,190
and run in a data center or run at home

112
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:37,110
where you wish use<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMware all those</font>

113
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:39,509
different kinds of hypervisors and again

114
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,830
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of thing the vendors are</font>

115
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:42,720
saying here okay we have a physical

116
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,030
appliance<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we can ship that to</font>

117
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,379
you just give them basically a little

118
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,780
tiny computer with a bunch of networking

119
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:50,639
ports or we can just take all that

120
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,619
whatever is in on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that flash memory</font>

121
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,520
whatever is on that hard drive dump it

122
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:59,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">on to a virtualized disk in an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISO or a</font>

123
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">vhd or something like that and just ship</font>

124
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,430
it to the customers with their data

125
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:09,120
center wherever they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to install</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

126
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:11,849
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> one interesting article I found and</font>

127
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,229
this is from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMware article that is</font>

128
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:15,810
another reason that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of vendors are</font>

129
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:17,340
doing virtual appliances is physical

130
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,680
appliances no longer need to be shipped

131
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,330
across national borders I never really

132
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought about that before I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never really</font>

133
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,948
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be a reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it is</font>

134
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting when you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at how you you</font>

135
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:30,180
know how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> deliver a customer a</font>

136
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:31,620
device you know you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through</font>

137
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">customs you have to go through import</font>

138
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">next Ford and all that with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> physical</font>

139
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,680
device not so much when you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

140
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,599
virtual device that you can either send

141
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,639
them or drop somewhere or they can

142
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:42,960
download things like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

143
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,639
definitely something that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

144
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,560
make virtual appliances take off<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

145
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,539
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> four physical appliances you</font>

146
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,169

147
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:55,289
power down an important distinction here

148
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:58,340
the bugs that are on virtual appliances

149
00:05:55,289 --> 00:06:00,960
aren't specific to an environment there

150
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,299
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like the the one bug rules</font>

151
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,830
all thing where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not some</font>

152
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,750
specific configuration you got to have

153
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,180
or make<font color="#CCCCCC"> any modifications to the</font>

154
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,610
appliance for it to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerable once</font>

155
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,990
the bug is shipped in this there's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

156
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,680
ton of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different versions that you need</font>

157
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,150
to diff and things like that one bug is

158
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,800
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take care of all of them so</font>

159
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,929
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> an important distinction to make</font>

160
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,639
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and just user regular user</font>

161
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">LAN programs or things you install on</font>

162
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,830
windows and linux virtual appliances are

163
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,630
a little bit different so a lot of

164
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,669
popular vendors pretty much all the

165
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,469
major vendors have virtual appliances

166
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,240
probably not so much knock yourself for

167
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:37,710
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they don't ship a lot of</font>

168
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,740
Windows virtual appliances maybe a

169
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:43,198
couple but most major companies IBM some

170
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,880
antik being more cisco has a ton of

171
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,949
virtual appliances<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMware has a pretty</font>

172
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,380
good lot as well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really look at</font>

173
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:51,150
sa peas oral appliances because they

174
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,159
have cloud only trials so I can't

175
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,289
actually download it and you know do my

176
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,880
analysis on it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're only hosting in</font>

177
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,889
a web page for me that I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

178
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,599
and do all this stuff so thanks a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

179
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:04,830
for that got some free security work but

180
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:06,840
well so some of the pros and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

181
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,240

182
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,310
share pretty much the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

183
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,680
code I mean everything from the physical

184
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,659
device and the virtual<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's pretty much</font>

185
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,990
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just dump everything on the on a</font>

00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:20,630
disk image and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ship to customers so bugs</font>

187
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,830
you find there of course are going to be

188
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably vulnerable on virtual and</font>

189
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">fiscal and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the common mindset that</font>

190
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,130
creates a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these bugs is customers</font>

191
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have root that that's a huge thing</font>

192
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,659
we're okay you know either they don't

193
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">have root or they don't have a shell so</font>

194
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:38,729
there's all these debug interfaces all

195
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,620
these just sensitive information bash

196
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:42,599
history things like that they're just

197
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,639
left on the system and then when you

198
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,710
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at when you start</font>

199
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,870
statically analyzing it even if you

200
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,340
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have root dynamically when you</font>

201
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,740
install and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> running it if you look</font>

202
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,989
at statically you can find all these

203
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,039
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> they they left on there and they</font>

204
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,990
can lead<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some pretty serious</font>

205
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:03,090
vulnerabilities so why go up these

206
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,550
appliances at all now you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

207
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,469
are they're definitely you know

208
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,810
prevalence is one factor as I said

209
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:10,919
they're becoming more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more popular</font>

210
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,389
we'll look at entertainment there's a

211
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,130
few slides I have they're just funny

212
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:16,830
things that happen with they're not

213
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,139
really bugs per se but just really

214
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,729
things that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go I should take</font>

215
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">another look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

216
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:24,419
probably some more serious things going

217
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,549
on and value of course enterprises or

218
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:31,049
using systems so they are the bugs here

219
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:34,709
are valuable and you can know

220
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:36,479
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> from there so here's one it</font>

221
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,968
basically looks like somebody just said

222
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,099
oh here's an image of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my work pc it's a</font>

223
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:43,469
virtual appliance change password if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

224
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,120
want to don't you just left the bass

225
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:49,980
history on here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they left the vim</font>

226
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:52,199
history they left the diocese<font color="#E5E5E5"> H known</font>

227
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,450
hosts file so you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can kind of</font>

228
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">see where this is going where there</font>

229
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,270
sleeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are said okay maybe they</font>

230
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have root they don't have whatever</font>

231
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">privilege uh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Steven look at these files</font>

232
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:05,160
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to worry about removing</font>

233
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:07,020
them this is one where you know they

234
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,120
left just plain text passwords and

235
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:14,550
figuration file the default passwords

236
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,960
secure all this one you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a</font>

237
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,400
bug where they're like okay we can't

238
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,890
leave plaintext passwords in a

239
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,020
configuration file so let's hash them

240
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,990
the only thing here they forgot to salt

241
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,880
the hash so any rainbow table is going

242
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,380
to pick this<font color="#E5E5E5"> up no matter even if it's a</font>

243
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,430
pretty complex password and they're

244
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,150
still going to pick it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> as cluster</font>

245
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:36,030
password this one where they left the

246
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,770
the password and any local user can just

247
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,420
you know log into the database using the

248
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,189
password this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the local system and</font>

249
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,229
you know do whatever they want from

250
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,940
there again not really bug just just

251
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,100
kind of warming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to show you the</font>

252
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,810
things and the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information is</font>

253
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,760
left on these systems that you can

254
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:54,599
further use to to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploit</font>

255
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,340
vulnerabilities and this one this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

256
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,200
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abney</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own virtual</font>

257
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,750
appliance because they're you know

258
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,300
they're SFTP and into internal IBM

259
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,180
systems and downloading looks like a

260
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,890
image file and it's even<font color="#E5E5E5"> funnier here</font>

261
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,410
they try to remove the bash history and

262
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,819
this is the bash history so I didn't

263
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:16,800
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a very good job at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> removing it</font>

264
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:20,450
right so entertainment factor one more

265
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,099
this one they sued<font color="#E5E5E5"> rooted the ID binary</font>

266
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:25,530
why would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever sued root the ID</font>

267
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,420
binary like there had to be some bug

268
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,280
where they're like we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sing when</font>

269
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,069
it when it executes<font color="#CCCCCC"> psyd we need to make</font>

270
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,540
sure it thinks its root so we're just

271
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,280
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave it like that totally</font>

272
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,870
useless you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really use it for if</font>

273
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,959
anyone knows how to exploit a<font color="#E5E5E5"> foodie</font>

274
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:47,460
binary let me know but it's just just a

275
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:48,960
strange thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> occurs so value again</font>

276
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,420
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these virtual finds that I'll</font>

277
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">be talking about our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used in enterprise</font>

278
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,329
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important thing here</font>

279
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,820
customers really want these bugs fixed

280
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,410
because if they're going to trust that a

281
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,480
virtual appliances you know just as

282
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,189
secure as the physical appliance and you

283
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,570
start shipping all these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

284
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,310
start giving people free trials and

285
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,379
download them find these vulnerabilities

286
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,049
and and then don't

287
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:11,429
even maybe pay attention to them then

288
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:12,899
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really not good for customers</font>

289
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:14,249
they definitely want these bugs fixed

290
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,099
because they're putting money into it

291
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:21,029
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as if it was a physical appliance</font>

292
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:23,279
it's the same to them so while security

293
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:25,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">so bad again is the at this point the</font>

294
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,169
vendors are just saying hey here's an

295
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:30,329
image of a computer it's a virtual

296
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:32,339
appliance you know we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

297
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:34,378
this QA that we normally<font color="#CCCCCC"> have on fiscal</font>

298
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,909
appliances it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy just go set</font>

299
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:38,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">it up you know here's the default</font>

302
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:43,949
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really then aren't really</font>

303
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:45,539
taking it seriously at this point i get

304
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:48,238
i know it's recurring theme and just

305
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:50,220
about every in a new new wave of

306
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:55,229
vulnerabilities but<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh yeah that's</font>

307
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:58,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here as well so this is</font>

00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:10,199
income so so you might be asking at this

311
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:12,359
point well how do i get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a virtual</font>

312
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:16,559
appliance to look at well I'll tell you

313
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:17,999
how at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least how I did it so vendor</font>

314
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,959
websites are a good source of these of

315
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:21,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">course you can look for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free trial</font>

request valuation all these Google dorks

317
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:25,169
you got to watch out some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

318
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:26,879
like a mix trial demo stuff you wanna

319
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:28,169
look out for that you can make a

320
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,169
purchase so you can make an<font color="#E5E5E5"> investment</font>

323
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,409
like that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make an investment</font>

324
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:40,199
acquire the virtual appliance and then

325
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:41,339
find bugs and go from there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

326
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:43,589
sometimes they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

327
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:45,389
ran into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple cases where you needed</font>

00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:47,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">a support contract you needed to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

purchase or have some existing support

331
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:54,059
there before you could even acquire one

332
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:55,589
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're willing to pay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

333
00:12:54,059 --> 00:13:00,659
you're in these strange situations like

334
00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:02,189
that when you start degan so you guys

335
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:05,099
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be fully aware of what virtual</font>

336
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:07,949

00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:10,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">I go about looking at them so virtual</font>

339
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,599
you know different systems in this way

340
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:17,630
digitally that ova containers they

341
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,190
usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought a disk image and</font>

342
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,439
like some kind of metadata files to tell

343
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,000
you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set the configuration they</font>

344
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,140
may just<font color="#CCCCCC"> come as a vhd may just kind of</font>

345
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,500
a hard drive you plug into the

346
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:29,449
hypervisor so a couple different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways i</font>

347
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,450
mentioned before dynamic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> static so</font>

348
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:34,490
dynamic boot up the system basically

349
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,230
what you see is what you get you know

350
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not looking at it statically</font>

351
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,070
you're playing with the system you're

352
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:43,250
trying to see if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> root trying to</font>

353
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:45,560
see if you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> shell it's the</font>

354
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,360
trouble here again is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

355
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,040
those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it may be motivation to</font>

356
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,020
find them at the same time you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

357
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,089
use both techniques you need to use a

358
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,520
static approach combined with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

359
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:57,410
because statically you can look at the

360
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,689
file system without ever having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to boot</font>

361
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:02,180
it up you can see you know in the shadow

362
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,830
file if they have undocumented users you

363
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">can check you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have documentation</font>

364
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,940
check the shadow file if the users not

365
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,560
there and then maybe you can crack the

366
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,440
password then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

367
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,910
vulnerability and the procedure here you

368
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,470
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> file system and</font>

369
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,540
convert it using like um<font color="#E5E5E5"> usefully</font>

370
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,670
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and then use some</font>

371
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,939
kind of like imager or forensic tool to

372
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:25,010
browse it I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I use was ftk</font>

373
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,600
imager something like that and it was

374
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,120
pretty good for browsing raw file

375
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,310
systems but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the limitations here that</font>

376
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,960
bit me at least once or twice was some

377
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:36,979
some of them virtual appliances have

378
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:38,390
first boot boot scripts so as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

379
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,800
you boot them they start setting

380
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,110
passwords they start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

381
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,540
things where you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of relied on that</font>

382
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,850
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know maybe it works at first but as</font>

383
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,709
soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you boot you know things start</font>

384
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,600
changing so you gotta kind of again you

385
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:55,090
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> both approaches to to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

386
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:58,160
good picture and confirm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bug cindy's</font>

387
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:00,770
so now the meat<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going on to</font>

388
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,800
the bugs the vulnerabilities that I've

389
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:06,560
discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> into virtual appliances again</font>

390
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,170
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> broad categories a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

391
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,400
undocumented users and then a lot of

392
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:14,240
miscellaneous from there and some

393
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:17,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">passwords litter so the first one look</font>

394
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,060
at Cisco paging server it's a IM for

395
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:24,469
single wire software you know they

396
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:25,760
provide paging you know server stuff if

397
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,490
you ever use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a paging server you</font>

398
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,410
probably haven't is fine so on this one

399
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,459
there's actually three interfaces to

400
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,189
authenticate

401
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:37,099

interface for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first two of these you</font>

403
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,730
know obviously if you know linux pretty

404
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:42,889
well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the web</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> man and and the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">cisco took on this approach is different</font>

410
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,579
it uses a totally different way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> store</font>

passwords<font color="#CCCCCC"> check out medication so what</font>

412
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:02,300
happens when you change the admin

about system at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> point you set up</font>

429
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,619
the paging server the 'pliance is

430
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,350
running fine you know anything to worry

431
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:45,619
about so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could chalk it up as a</font>

432
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,999
documentation bug sure but really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

433
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:48,889
can just say take this and a bunch of

434
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:50,829
paging service because no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ever</font>

435
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:53,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change a password that's</font>

436
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:54,439
technically undocumented<font color="#CCCCCC"> Channing the</font>

437
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,929
passwords with an undocumented

438
00:16:54,439 --> 00:17:02,389
authentication system even so the next

439
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:04,250
one EMC<font color="#E5E5E5"> power path so here's a virtual</font>

440
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:07,250
appliance that I found a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font>

441
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:10,459
undocumented account song EMC update and

442
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:13,640
service user so guess I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

443
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:17,179
with those dictionary attack so load

444
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:20,480
them up and John the Ripper found emcs

445
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:22,880
updates password is password the other

446
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,289
one and took I think I was cracking it

447
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,689
for quite a while probably a week or two

448
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:29,809
and never did find anything so must be

449
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:31,370
you know random<font color="#E5E5E5"> complex whatever but for</font>

450
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:34,220
this one we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just got a remote on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

451
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:36,110
system to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web interface just by an</font>

452
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,809
undocumented password so now we can

453
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:41,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">control things on this appliance by</font>

454
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:43,908
default with an undocumented user

455
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,669
because of this mistake just leaving

456
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:46,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">them on for</font>

457
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,910
you know not either not restricting it

458
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,080
to you know maybe local only or

459
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,750
forgetting to change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password when</font>

460
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,449
it first boots up this is never

461
00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:02,880
documented so therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> a remote on emc</font>

462
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:04,890
for this one so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one's in IBM</font>

463
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:09,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">SmartCloud monitoring virtual appliance</font>

464
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:10,440
so i only<font color="#E5E5E5"> tested the trial so that's the</font>

465
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,270
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I could have available it</font>

466
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,580
looked as if you could upgrade it to the

467
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,889
production so just copy out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

468
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,530
ninety percent sure this still works in

469
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,710
the in the official version but only had

470
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,389
the trial to test on this one just FYI

471
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:27,780
so 26 users with<font color="#E5E5E5"> bash shells on the</font>

472
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:33,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">system two of them are undocumented das</font>

473
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:36,840
user<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 and db2 SDF e1 so we find a</font>

474
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,490
password and now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a remote on IBM</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">SmartCloud monitoring virtual appliance</font>

476
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,560
just by again undocumented accounts

477
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,439
there's no way to change the password

478
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know through the documentation again</font>

479
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,750

of course for managing mobile devices

486
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:07,650
and there's an MMP and documented user

487
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:11,219
on this one so what do you think happens

488
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:13,770
here boom vanitha password is actually

489
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,410
NM p and now we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a remote on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vmware</font>

491
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:22,680
recurring theme at this point but so

492
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,630
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> caveat with this one to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

493
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,730
sent us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vmware but it was end of</font>

494
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,890
life so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found this a few months ago it</font>

495
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,500
was becoming<font color="#CCCCCC"> into life just recently</font>

496
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:33,480
like maybe a week or two ago and should

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,610
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bed this slides actually did they</font>

498
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,930
did confirm this was vulnerable but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

499
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,540
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it because of into</font>

00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:41,610
laughing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the product but if I found this</font>

501
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,570
two years ago it was still been just as

502
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:47,909
good that would just in de la fit today

503
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:50,360
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco mobility services engine</font>

504
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:53,280
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting virtual appliance</font>

505
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,370
there's two user accounts on the

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,510
appliance<font color="#CCCCCC"> route and Oracle so of course</font>

507
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,239
root password is set by the

508
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:02,230
administrator when you

509
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,780
install it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle's untouched so this is</font>

510
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,610
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be interesting so I try the</font>

511
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,860
cracking the password here with for

512
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:11,350
example John the Ripper<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font>

513
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,120
unsuccessful but they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set us</font>

514
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,389
somewhere it has a password it has a

515
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,750
shadow entry in on the system so there

516
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:21,610
must be a password somewhere right<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

517
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,130
took a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time but I finally found the</font>

518
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,020
script that sets the password I don't

519
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,210
know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it yeah so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

520
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:34,510
really huge screen right there to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

521
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:36,130
bottom left ex-mp DBA 123 so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

522
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:38,050
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually could not crack the</font>

523
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,030
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> after i had the shadow file</font>

524
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,290
because they said it complex enough to

525
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,210
not allow for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to happen in a</font>

526
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:46,120
reasonable amount of time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i still</font>

527
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:50,770
found them setting it later on so still

528
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:52,870
a remote on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco MSC appliance but</font>

529
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,360
take this a little bit further so now we

530
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:58,689
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> oracle which has a shell for some</font>

531
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,129
reason and can log in remotely you know

532
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,650
you can stop that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just turn off</font>

533
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,630
in the in configuration file so they

534
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,730
chose not to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so let's see if we</font>

535
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,370
can escalate our privileges a little bit

536
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:12,520
more with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we look at the</font>

537
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:16,570
post install log file they make<font color="#CCCCCC"> suid</font>

538
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,309
copies of Chima and<font color="#E5E5E5"> shown</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I know you</font>

539
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,200
guys know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> those utilities do if</font>

540
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:22,809
you've let you use linux for any amount

541
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,580
of time you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to set the seward</font>

542
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:31,090
route bit on those on those binaries

543
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:32,830
what they did so let's use them to first

544
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,840
change permissions of the sudoers file

545
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,550
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to exploit it there's</font>

546
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,169
a million different ways this is the way

547
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:43,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">I chose that was probably the easiest</font>

548
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:46,410
way to just go ahead and add ourselves

549
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:51,129
to the sudoers file so we can just

550
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:52,720
automatically upgrade to route but we

551
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,340
got to clean up<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that so we make</font>

552
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,320
this really really stealth so if you're

553
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,209
actually hacking systems out there this

554
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,620
is going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clean up after</font>

555
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,090
yourselves assuming it will have some

556
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,199
file system monitoring going on gotta

557
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,080
look out for that but I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you know</font>

558
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,760
now to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anyways what you add</font>

559
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,850
ourselves to us to do is file and now we

560
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:12,169
have root so through one mistake of them

561
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,480
having a complex pass for

562
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:17,720
which wasn't crackable but finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

563
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,899
an install file and I'm also making a

564
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:24,080
silly mistake making a sua drew copies

565
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:25,789
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Challon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into mod you know we were</font>

566
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,529
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add ourselves to sideris file</font>

567
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:32,989
and escalate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> root so this one is</font>

568
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:34,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">Pinocchio on site so if you never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

569
00:22:32,989 --> 00:22:37,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh piya that's fine their support by</font>

571
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:43,549
people you know probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use</font>

572
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,899
them if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ford by cloudflare so</font>

573
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:48,080
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually did a really good job here</font>

574
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:50,149
generating random credentials so default

575
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,158
passwords should not exist and that's

576
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:54,408
just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I go through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a million</font>

577
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">these virtual appliances you there's no</font>

578
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:58,369
reason to have default passwords this is

579
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:01,009
actually the right way to do it the

580
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:04,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">on-site key is essentially the password</font>

581
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:06,019
for this appliance so they generate upon

582
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:10,429
boot generate a random set of

583
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:12,470
credentials great security only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

584
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:14,450
thing here they did wrong which got<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

585
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,989
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to remove the bash history</font>

586
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:22,899
and you see that line after<font color="#CCCCCC"> sue you pan</font>

587
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:25,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">dump um in that long alphanumeric string</font>

588
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:26,418
looks like they made a typo when they

589
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,139
were when they were escalating

590
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:32,570
privileges earlier so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

591
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:34,428
advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that now this is not even</font>

592
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:38,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">the administrator account for the</font>

593
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:40,519
appliance this is the i guess you would

594
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:43,100
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendors administrator account</font>

595
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:44,629
for the appliance the ministry password

596
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,998
i showed you earlier they randomly

597
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:49,580
generated is for the customer this

598
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:51,379
particular vendor Pinocchio apparently

599
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:53,869
has other accounts that are only

600
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:55,309
accessible by the vendor another really

601
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:58,100
interesting thing in the virtual

602
00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:00,019
appliance field a lot of vendors are

603
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,080
making putting a council in a system

604
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:05,090
that the customers don't have access to

605
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,949
so now we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out their master</font>

606
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,149
password for all these virtual

607
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,950
appliances that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're shipping to</font>

608
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:14,199
customers and the customers don't even

609
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,200
know this password so

610
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:22,210
you know it's cooler than a remote user

611
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:25,480
guess what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pinocchio man also has to do</font>

612
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:28,539
privileges so now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a remote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> root</font>

613
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:33,850
on every customer virtual appliance that

614
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:38,710
help you has shipped it's not good not

615
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:40,360
good for them yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again my point of</font>

616
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,480
them keeping static passwords that's

617
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,100
another question needs to be raised to

618
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,510
should vendors be keeping static

619
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,969
passwords the customers aren't even

620
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:54,669
aware about rent into that a few times

621
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:56,380
my research so sev one another one you

622
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:58,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">may not have heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about they are</font>

623
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,370
definitely used by a lot of people a lot

624
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,830
of interesting people verizon comcast

625
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:07,600
HBO that they get a lot of free TV for

626
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:10,480
this but they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a silent patch</font>

627
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,760
recently so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the virtual</font>

628
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,289
appliance a ship I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> an undocumented</font>

629
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:19,480
account<font color="#CCCCCC"> CMC dr with a password of CMC dr</font>

630
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:21,490
ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> great now we have a remote so i'm</font>

631
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking on the system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a su</font>

632
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:26,409
binary sudra binary<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS look up it looks</font>

633
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a custom binary so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

634
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:29,559
playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> around with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it what i usually</font>

635
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:31,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to do with custom binaries that I</font>

636
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:34,600
like to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 or 15 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and</font>

637
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:36,100
actually work much better give them give

638
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,340
the command line arguments a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

639
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,709
characters guess what the nineties

640
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,928
attacked worked again so there's a

641
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:47,460
buffer overflow in the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument of</font>

642
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:51,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Eslick a su binary you get the point</font>

643
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:53,260
so we have not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only a remote but a</font>

644
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,450
possibility to exploit that to get root

645
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:58,270
privileges as well but i did a search

646
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">for CMC dr user and there was actually</font>

647
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:03,220
some release notes where they had

648
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:06,850
released a new version that contained

649
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:09,400
information about the patching but the

650
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:11,260
URL have been removed thankfully<font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font>

651
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:15,460
caches everything for better<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

652
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:18,220
worse and we look at the cash and see

653
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:21,730
that platform remove shell access for

654
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:26,770
CMC dr user ok IES looked up creek

655
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:28,280
corrected an issue yes you did so they

656
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,260
put in the release notes which

657
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,970
now removed and the release<font color="#E5E5E5"> ads were</font>

658
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,570
hosted on a website that wasn't even

659
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:39,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">related as far as I could see to sev one</font>

660
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:41,929
another strange thing so the latest a

661
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:45,050
public download for this virtual

662
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:48,740
appliance was 536 and apparently it was

663
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:50,419
fixed in 538 so they fixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bug but I</font>

664
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,310
don't know you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a customer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

665
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,170
guess I i assume you get an email if

666
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're if you you know pay for support</font>

667
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:58,550
this says hey we fix some interesting

668
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:00,200
things you should upgrade but everyone

669
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:04,760
else downloading the public version is

670
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:08,270
just screwed so that's not great so

671
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:10,040
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into command injection I be a</font>

672
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:12,530
subclass of getting a remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> root or</font>

get this cute little console interface

anything but what they want us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

690
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:58,310
well if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the diagnostic</font>

691
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:00,500
section of this we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that says</font>

pretty interesting but there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

694
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,980
certain set of internal commands we can

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is command injection right boom</font>

698

699
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:24,290
this is a valid command and give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it some</font>

00:28:55,409 --> 00:29:00,630
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to this interface see what</font>

715
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:03,600
else we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> appliance so we</font>

716
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:06,090
look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D compiled code here we can</font>

717
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,149
see we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can run arp our ping daily stool</font>

718
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:11,639
some perl script and it just puts the

719
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:13,470
output in well it takes the output it

720
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,710
prints it to internal command in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

721
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:19,860
temp directory and it puts if any of the

722
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:22,650
commands are on the list it puts sudo in

723
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,120
front of it so from that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

724
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:27,299
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> any of these commands are going to</font>

725
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,799
execute with root privileges so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

726
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:33,260
can execute any of these commands with

727
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,260
root privileges what can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with that</font>

728
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,900
so there happen to be and again we

729
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,629
confirm our options in the suitors file

730
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,640
and we see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can execute all these</font>

731
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:46,020
but I found that ARP will actually read

732
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,049
a file I didn't even know that for I

733
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,490
tried this so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we have to do</font>

734
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:51,990
privileges to risk we don't need to use

735
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:54,659
a console anymore once we break into

736
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:58,860
show we just pass whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> file we want</font>

737
00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:02,250
to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sue do and it will output any</font>

738
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:05,399
file reading as a system on the

739
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:07,409
appliance so definitely I would like

740
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">outlook to the perl script</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I couldn't</font>

741
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:11,340
really found any interesting bugs there

742
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">although it did some bad stuff so the</font>

743
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,760
closest I got on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I didn't</font>

744
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,549
actually escalate route i guess but i

745
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">can read any any file on the system as</font>

746
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:23,549
root so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting point so</font>

747
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,770
there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of confusion</font>

748
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:29,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this one so what is the root and</font>

00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:30,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">Men password it so that there is one in</font>

just you know for example something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

753
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,649

00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:44,250
fix that they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the solution</font>

756
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,850
requires assistance from<font color="#E5E5E5"> EMC 'contact</font>

they know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yet but uh definitely</font>

763
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:04,389
a point for<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion so the next one</font>

764
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:06,789
is SolarWinds log & Event Manager I

765
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:10,689
wanted to highlight this one it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

766
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:14,379
45 hundred dollars and it's a it's

00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SE IM or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SI m and it's easy</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to use logs for security compliance all</font>

769
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:23,649
that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as default creds for CMC</font>

770
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:24,820
password and runs a ssh server on 3 20

771
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:32,258
22 I think this one's actually

772
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:34,090
undocumented<font color="#E5E5E5"> a CMC user as well so once</font>

command injection we use literally the

775
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:42,100
same string we use to exploit the the

776
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:45,820
emc bug for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drop into a</font>

777
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:48,428
shell so manager config is the main

00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:52,960
interface for this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's actually</font>

785
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:14,740
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best idea so if we add</font>

786
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:17,590
something useful to take you can control

<font color="#E5E5E5">lock I don't know give us a shell for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> upgrade for free so that is</font>

790
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:29,139
a very very straight forward command

791
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:32,439
ejection that we use to first break out

792
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:34,539
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shell and then go to and add</font>

ourselves via a local vulnerability to

794
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:40,570
escalate to<font color="#CCCCCC"> root and there's one more</font>

795
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">bug in this appliance as well for</font>

796
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:45,129
mastering bug I don't know if we have

797
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:46,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">any old timers out there for these bugs</font>

798
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,248
but they were super interesting they're

799
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,710
still around a little bit i found them

800
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:53,499
from time to time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again the</font>

801
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:56,259
interface is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> perl so if you you know</font>

802
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:59,080
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> give it % p % and whatever</font>

803
00:32:56,259 --> 00:33:00,580
accepts and then there's a format string

804
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,649
bug there but they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually some</font>

805
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,629
exploitable format string bugs in<font color="#E5E5E5"> perl</font>

806
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:06,758
so there's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting paper</font>

807
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:08,709
back in 2005 if you want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that</font>

808
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:09,170
there's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe an exploit out</font>

809
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,380
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

810
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:13,730
well but sorry I'm a pretty big<font color="#E5E5E5"> fan of</font>

811
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,900
for mastering vulnerabilities and I keep

812
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:21,410
hearing their dead but I keep finding

813
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:22,670
them so that's that was fun so another

814
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,830
thing this was about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the root password</font>

815
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:26,510
people asking about it they're like yeah

816
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,949
you can call support<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can use the</font>

817
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:30,379
root account to get in and reset the

818
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:31,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">password for you like I don't want you</font>

819
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:37,250
to do that if I ever buy this appliance

820
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:39,740
a lot of confusion around that issue so

821
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,630
a time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some crazy suid binaries I</font>

822
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:44,420
know we exploited a bunch of bugs those

823
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:48,290
before let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about one in time</font>

824
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:50,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cisco prime infrastructure so if you</font>

825
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:52,760
have a linux box at home you know that

826
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,889
if you you know take a log of all the

827
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,770
suid files there should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> no where near</font>

828
00:33:54,890 --> 00:34:01,370
67 that's way too much right there's

829
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:05,240
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2025 67 you know there's going</font>

830
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:07,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be some problems here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you just</font>

831
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,668
grip the fault the file for shell the

832
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:15,050
word shell we have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting ones</font>

833
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:18,339
one run shell command one run shell as

834
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:23,770
root what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys think they do</font>

835
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:26,090
probably be helpful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us right so</font>

836
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,918
they're so poorly written actually run

837
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:30,260
shell command if you don't give it an

838
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,960
argument it crashes<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a null point de</font>

839
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:35,330
breff so they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even check if an</font>

840
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,100
argument is given so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

841
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,110
quality of the code there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

842
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,069
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more bugs here I just I just could</font>

843
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,810
not believe they didn't check for an

844
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:45,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">argument that's like did you wrap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

845
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:47,810
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds or what so now saying it</font>

846
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:53,060
was aliens this certainly could have

847
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:55,639
been so the way it works here run shells

848
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">route you put whatever commands you want</font>

849
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:02,960
in a file you pass that file to it it

850
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:05,150
runs on this route ouch what about run

851
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,010
show command well even easier you just

852
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,580
pass the command to it and it rents it

853
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:13,160
as root for you so these are local

854
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:17,350
binaries that are suid that are

855

executable by anyone on the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

856
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:22,610
trivial to get you know privilege

them credit they

859
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:30,390
really stepped up security and they sued

<font color="#CCCCCC">rooted the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user add binary and they made</font>

861
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:38,220

make any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense whatsoever why would you</font>

863
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,129
sued root it and the only let root

864
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:45,450
execute it why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just leave it</font>

00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:47,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">alone but I guess we can't use that to</font>

866
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:50,100
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything right I'll offer out we have</font>

867
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:52,620
run shell command so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just add a</font>

868
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:55,740
route to user with everything we need

00:35:52,620 --> 00:36:00,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">old-school styles you like it and boom</font>

870
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:03,029
we ever now we have crazy suid binaries

871
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:04,020
plus a remote going on so we have I know

872
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,980
there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco virtual</font>

875
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,410
collaboration insurance there's many

876
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:16,410
many more i'll try not to confuse you as

877
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:19,080
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as possible so it's two accounts on</font>

878
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,629
the system quickly there's a corner case

879
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:25,140
with the setup it's not la blaze

880
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:27,720
foldable but it's a noteworthy case

881
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,040
study so we'll go through it quickly the

882
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,680
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> part here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

883
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,270
is with the java debug server if you

884
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,879
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have ever used it but there's</font>

885
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:39,080
interesting suit of binary here firewall

886
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,210
guess what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is controls the firewall</font>

887
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:45,210
so they're running java<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bug server</font>

888
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:49,320
as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rename process called am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sam</font>

889
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:51,090
perfmon engine and it's listening on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

890
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,620
network interface but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> firewalls</font>

891
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:55,440
turned on and they did a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

892
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:57,240
security thing by making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that no</font>

893
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,970
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> can access it from the firewall</font>

894
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,680
although they could just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as easily made</font>

895
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,500
it listen on localhost<font color="#CCCCCC"> knowing had to</font>

896
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,980
worry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i digress so that's</font>

897
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:10,620
javed the bug server and I'll active did

898
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,660
some really cool research<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this they</font>

899
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:16,500
did a you know hacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java debug wire</font>

900
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:19,680
protocol basically any as the TLDR says

901
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:23,660
turn any open java debug server into

902
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:28,259
reliable remote code execution so let's

903
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:30,029
see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works but one thing we have</font>

904
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,440
to access<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we want you know we can do</font>

905
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,620
it locally but we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remote at this</font>

906
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,280
point so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just turn the firewall off</font>

907
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,020
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's suid</font>

908
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,630
and we have privileges to do that so

909
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,370
just turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off so now we can access</font>

910
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:44,130
this remotely so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> X boy the aisle</font>

911
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:46,140
active wrote I just used it and I'll

912
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,300
just hold it and I actually to make it

913
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,339
easier up netcat on the system whatever

914
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,300
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just just to make it easy as</font>

915
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:57,420
possible to explain and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we have a</font>

916
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:59,940
remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> root on the system through job of</font>

917
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,190
the bug server so anytime you see Java

918
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,990
debug server running especially remotely

919
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,180
so if it's local you can get a local

920
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,339
route if it's running remotely anytime

921
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:11,370
you see java de bug sir it's literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

922
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:13,260
think a design flaw<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the server this</font>

923
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:15,299
exploit still works today and I think

924
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,380
it's a year or two old<font color="#CCCCCC"> there I don't</font>

925
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's any patch that you're</font>

926
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,030
literally have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to redesign it or just</font>

927
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,270
don't run it so very important if you're

928
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:29,790
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pen test for that you only live</font>

929
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:31,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">once so I know you guys are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

930
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:37,230
tired of hearing about remote roots

931
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:39,680
right those are so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of them so</font>

932
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:41,670
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to conclude with a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

933
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,100
all you people<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there wanting some</font>

934
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:46,350
defensive stuff don't run away<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font>

935
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:49,470
because i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about that the first</font>

936
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:51,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">bender communication so scare many</font>

937
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:54,569
offended very policy this is actually

938
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:59,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">facebook's first responsible responsible</font>

939
00:38:54,570 --> 00:39:01,320
disclosure policy and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> FY they say</font>

940
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:04,529
they won't sue you if you make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

941
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,790
effort and work with them ouch<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

942
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:08,790
the change by now but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a few</font>

943
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:11,790
years ago so brief disclosure timelines

944
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:14,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">the SolarWinds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> solarwinds bug they took</font>

945
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:15,960
a while to send me their pgp key and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

946
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,850
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if they had to generate it or</font>

947
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,740
if they just forgot where it was I don't

948
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:21,450
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened but they fixed in a</font>

949
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,580
few months but it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the first</font>

950
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:26,669
response was like we'll get you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PGP</font>

951
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">you soon I'm like isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an email</font>

952
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:32,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">I can just send me into it to me through</font>

953
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:34,560
email and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AMC fixed it almost over a</font>

954
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:36,870
month which is really nice and then the

955
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,400
guy was working with amcu left and now

956
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:41,100
I'll probably never get a bug fixed

957
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,270
again so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great Pinocchio noted</font>

958
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:45,900
they patched a potential security

959
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:47,400
vulnerability sure cisco with the

960
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,080
primary structure it released a private

961
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,830
advisory you have to log<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see it</font>

962
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:55,819
not searchable not the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to do it</font>

963
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:58,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">VMware as I said send the Volt so</font>

964
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:00,720
initially<font color="#CCCCCC"> disclose this back in</font>

965
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:03,120
September and they they sent they

966
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,120
contacted<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a couple days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before I</font>

967
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,950
disclosed and said hey can you tell us

968
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:10,020
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like yeah I mean if you're</font>

969
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,009
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contact me about it sure so I</font>

970
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,810
gave him<font color="#E5E5E5"> the full details and they</font>

971
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,360
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to fix it's reasonable</font>

972
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:16,830
because they end alot the product

973
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">SolarWinds they fixed it sep tember</font>

974
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:22,590
cisco fixed it a couple weeks ago and

975
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:24,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">emc the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VRP a that released advisory in</font>

976
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">july if you didn't see it up there it's</font>

977
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:31,230
maybe not fixed so plain defense cleaned

978
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:33,660
up before you ship it I mean you guys

979
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,950
saw the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bash history where you know</font>

980
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:38,790
you're able to get a remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> route just</font>

981
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:42,029
by a typo don't ship bash history to

982
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:44,970
customers that's nonsense all the crazy

983
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:46,980
suid binaries on boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't assume that</font>

984
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:49,680
nobody can get a shell<font color="#CCCCCC"> that nobody can</font>

985
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:52,560
you know do anything a local system so

986
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,859
don't put you know give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me give me root</font>

987
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,170
binaries on the box and then passwords

988
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,990
unknown to customers that just blows my

989

mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if that's the new way</font>

990

of thinking or the or not that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

991
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:09,390
strange fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is definitely a great</font>

993
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:14,220
let me turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> off the firewall of course</font>

994
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:16,859
and like i said before generating random

995
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:18,390
passwords on boot there should never be

996
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,940
another default password like literally

997
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:23,490
it's unnecessary you're just asking for

998
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:25,710
trouble using default passwords when you

999
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:27,930
for virtual appliances set a random

1000
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:29,460
password on boot and be done with it you

1001
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:30,779
never have to ask him to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

1002
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

1003
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,960
local system if they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1004
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:39,509
local system you probably already

1005
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:41,190
screwed so one interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i saw</font>

1006
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:43,140
that this is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco prom</font>

1007
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:45,240
collaboration deployment different from

1008
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:47,790
the other ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> i promise they actually</font>

1009
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">blacklisted users for remote access this</font>

1010
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:52,050
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interesting mitigation but called</font>

1011
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:54,150
I thought at first I had a remote on

1012
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:56,820
this virtual clients I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

1013
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:59,760
other I saw informix and formics done

1014
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:01,410
undocumented have a remote and I tried

1015
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to log in remotely I'm like why can't i</font>

1016
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:04,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remotely</font>

1017
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:07,140
I cannot login anywhere but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the local</font>

1018
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:08,970
system because they mitigated this

1019
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,950
problem somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably saw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

1020
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:12,480
thinks well this guy doesn't need to log

1021
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:14,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">in remotely so let's just you know</font>

1022
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,130
didn't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> them up the dot denialist on</font>

1023
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:19,350
the ssh server very good mitigation is

1024
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:21,120
practically useless now even if there is

1025
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:25,650
a default password because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't log</font>

1026
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:27,660
in remotely for vendors here this is

1027
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:29,340
very Minerva cific but don't make trials

1028
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:33,060
and demos and it's just super confusing

1029
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:35,190
and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only for try to ruin some my</font>

1030
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:37,259
bugs which didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really affect me much</font>

1031
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:38,700
but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the development</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> team in</font>

1032
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">general they're gonna be like oh this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1033
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,669
a demo so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to put in</font>

1034
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:42,900
security and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys shipping it</font>

1035
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,510
like oh no we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to ship it's</font>

1036
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:48,300
actually a trial and then that leads to

1037
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:50,250
a lot of bad assumptions don't ship the

1038
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,740
master development vm us all earlier

1039
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:55,530
shipping bass history shipping all these

1040
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:58,200
other files<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean there should be a</font>

1041
00:42:55,530 --> 00:43:00,180
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> vm and a clean copy that you</font>

1042
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,439
build from that and i know i've heard

1043
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,759
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors all we do all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff</font>

1044
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,470
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay why do you have these</font>

1045
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,510
bugs in why do they exist<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1046
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:10,049
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it we're not doing</font>

1047
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">it for all the appliances and a list a</font>

1048
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:14,400
tick list of must not have this was

1049
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,690
something that every every development

1050
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,080
team should have when they're shipping a

1051
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:21,450
product for these appliances you know I

1052
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:25,230
listed much a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things and i'll</font>

1053
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:26,970
list a bunch more these are things again

1054
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:30,450
for developers don't do this when ship

1055
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:32,490
the device or is for bug hunters to look

1056
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,620
for when they're testing virtual

1057
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:38,279
appliances whatever side you're on you

1058
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:39,810
can use this so default passwords of

1059
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,880
course undocumented one if they're

1060
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:44,549
undocumented document them<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an</font>

00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:48,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">opening my own system remove them simple</font>

1062
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:50,090
files obviously unencrypted passwords or

1063
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:53,310
unsalted passwords i should say on this

1064
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:56,670
any sensitive data all the suid world

1065
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:58,710
writable scripts bit bit was<font color="#CCCCCC"> emc a</font>

1066
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:01,890
minute ago a world writable script able

1067
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:03,570
to get root from that some of the

1068
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:05,819
services if they're meant to be local

1069
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:07,320
make them listen on the local interface

1070
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:11,250
don't listen on the network interface

1071
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:13,020
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> very unnecessary and then using a</font>

1072
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:15,330
different authentication systems that

1073
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,110
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind of a subtle one-off example</font>

1074
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,910
but

1075
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:19,680
I could see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happening in the future</font>

1076
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:22,379
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a pretty interesting</font>

1077
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,180
bug and assumptions again it all comes

1078
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:27,270
down to assumptions in the in this space

1079
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,549
don't assume it's not for production if

1080
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:32,160
your shipping is don't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1081
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:35,370
hide this private key in a file black

1082
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:38,430
Cisco did a while back and got all their

1083
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:40,200
virtual appliances compromised you know

1084
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,819
don't only assume administrators can

1085
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,129
execute the script because somebody's

1086
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,410
going to come on late come later<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and</font>

1087
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:48,180
say huh here's a new feature we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1088
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:49,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to change the way this works maybe</font>

1089
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,089
you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> in have to company anymore</font>

1090
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:55,080
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm looking at this as a very I</font>

1091
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:57,300
guess as a software company view where a

1092
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:59,670
lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen you know people</font>

1093
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,470
leave they come back and then bugs

1094
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,830
happen the cause of some shins being

1095
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:06,390
made and then again with co turn and

1096
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:08,670
updates a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can change so</font>

1097
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:12,629
don't make any assumptions don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume</font>

1098
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:14,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">shit and then esoteric thoughts here</font>

1099
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:16,620
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of helper if you're going</font>

1100
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,360
to go look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these devices I haven't</font>

1101
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:20,970
broke them all I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have</font>

1102
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,830
access to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them now saying I could</font>

1103
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,899
have had would but again if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1104
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:27,630
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at these think about helper</font>

1105
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,360
services all the helpers all the things

1106
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:32,460
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the external facing server is</font>

1107
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:35,190
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an internal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service a lot of</font>

1108
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:37,440
those go unchecked support services

1109
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:39,750
remote access are always juicy fertile

1110
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,550
ground for bugs they have a lot of

1111
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:43,410
backup restore directories so you can

1112
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:44,940
look in those for the installation files

1113
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:47,670
maybe see how they're doing something

1114
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,590
how they're setting a password and then

1115
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:51,060
really read<font color="#CCCCCC"> the documentation coast it</font>

1116
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:55,650
can be the difference between a bug and

1117
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:57,900
technically a feature forensics oh my

1118
00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:00,240
god if I had a million<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars I</font>

1119
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:03,090
wouldn't buy a forensics sweet but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

1120
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,160
had two million dollars or three if I

1121
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:07,110
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a lot extra money I would Bob</font>

1122
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:10,109
forensics fleet and just own a ton of

1123
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:12,270
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual appliances because we</font>

1124
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:14,580
deleted all the sensitive files yeah you

1125
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,950
can guess how forensics works right you

1126
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,790
can undelete things and that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1127
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:22,529
pretty pretty good game changer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1128
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:24,960
so like I mentioned before<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco got bit</font>

1129
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:27,090
by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge bug they ship some private</font>

1130
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,119
keys on a bunch their virtual appliances

1131
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:30,650
so anyone who had<font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

1132
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">two could just get that key and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1133
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:40,279
remote root on all their stuff pretty

1134
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:41,779
big deal so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion as always area</font>

1135
00:46:40,279 --> 00:46:44,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">is still unexplored there's a lot of</font>

1136
00:46:41,779 --> 00:46:46,220
stuff I didn't have access to a lot of

1137
00:46:44,509 --> 00:46:48,950
stuff is really expensive a lot of stuff

1138
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:51,470
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't offer you know to to non</font>

1139
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:53,598
company ended to use or whatever at the

1140
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:55,910
moment and the only going to become more

1141
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,460
prevalent like I said things are moving

1142
00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:00,440
in a way where physical appliances once

1143
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,819
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the data centers are</font>

1144
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,549
getting more more more advanced more

1145
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:06,740
more processing power dis space all that

1146
00:47:04,549 --> 00:47:08,390
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able even if you</font>

1147
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,220
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really high performing device</font>

1148
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:12,259
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be able to make it into bits</font>

1149
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:14,660
and just push it push into hypervisor

1150
00:47:12,259 --> 00:47:17,150
and a cloud somewhere or something like

1151
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,618
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot more work to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1152
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,089
it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said getting access to these</font>

1153
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:22,279
and then getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendors that</font>

1154
00:47:20,089 --> 00:47:25,460
properly fixed some bugs it's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

appliances it's about basic security for

1169
00:48:11,779 --> 00:48:17,930
every software production no matter its

1170
00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:19,519
virtual appliances or whatever else<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1178
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:42,060
probably on slides I got like three here

1179
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:44,220
we go sorry

1180
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:47,670
have you used any special software to

1181
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:49,770
scan about for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the files within</font>

1182
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:52,860
correct permissions or because we have

1183
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:55,110
like UNIX previous checker we have also

1184
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:58,560
windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> purvis chicken around saw those</font>

1185
00:48:55,110 --> 00:49:00,990
things yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I understand correctly</font>

1186
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,640
have already need tools to to automate a

1187
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:04,620
lot of these you know the most not hats

1188
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,569
looking for bad either bad permissions

1189
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,950
or things like that I haven't came up

1190
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:10,230
with the toolset for it I've literally

1191
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:13,140
came up with these slides recently for

1192
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:14,820
the must not have I actually thought a

1193
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:17,069
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> times about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> writing some tools</font>

1194
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:19,650
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but I don't know I got to the</font>

1195
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:21,000
point where I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of you know I had</font>

1196
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,800
certain projects I was kind of done with

1197
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">this one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I didn't want to spend a</font>

1198
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,920
lot more time writing tools for it so I

1199
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">just wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of come up with a</font>

1200
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,900
list but not hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do definitely not</font>

1201
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:32,790
hard to do if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

1202
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,960
automated framework one vendor was

1203
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:36,029
telling me that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were going to take</font>

1204
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,800
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the must not have stuff and kind of</font>

1205
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:41,100
put it into their own tool set they have

1206
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,600
checks for so maybe in a way I kind of

1207
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,069
assumed that there is some framework

1208
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,470
that may be a lot of software vendors

1209
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:48,600
already have to do certain checks that

1210
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:50,939
and you know take those rules and kind

1211
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,440
of put them in there like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but no I</font>

1212
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any tool set to do that but</font>

1213
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:59,580
you totally is totally possible to do

1214
00:49:54,930 --> 00:50:05,910
that thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very thank you any more</font>

1215
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:08,730
questions anymore<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple couple of</font>

1216
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:11,879
good questions once more of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> compliment</font>

1217
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:19,170
I still appreciate it hopefully

1218

compliment no more questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

1219
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:24,030
understood everything really well I hope

1220
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,860
I wrote it when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was riding the slide</font>

1221
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,060
that was like I have to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this simple</font>

1222
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,980
enough for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone to understand but</font>
