1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,440
not so much a slow start

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:31,710
hello everyone I am matter what color
and I am city or you know company I'm

3
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,469
starting in Italian and we do like
offensive physical security among other

4
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:44,180
service this is my Twitter I D if you
wanna get in touch for comments or

5
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,730
whatever feedback from the presentation
and I live now the world to my colleague

6
00:00:49,730 --> 00:01:03,640
matola lol I'm at a local lawyer I'm
student Polytechnic of Tulane University

7
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:12,700
and I'm studying Electronic Engineering
I plan to move maybe to Switzerland next

8
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,530
year and I'm researching

9
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:25,460
fields and we together worked for
several projects and today we're going

10
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:34,979
to speak about Bluetooth so I will
introduce what is just some little

11
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:43,630
details not so boring and some known and
unknown risks so a little bit of history

12
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,110
so let's start

13
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:57,430
bluetooth is a wireless standard and it
was born it has almost 20 years because

14
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:04,290
the first version was in 1994 and it
uses shortwave lend you too high

15
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:13,420
frequency from 2.4 22485 in gigahertz
and 79 channels to allow the

16
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:20,619
communication with an adaptive frequency
hopping procedure so that if there is a

17
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,150
channel with some interference it can
jump to another one and make the

18
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:33,709
communication is the name comes from a
king of Denmark are other Bluetooth so I

19
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:43,070
say that is some Scandinavian those are
some rules for their health but they put

20
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:49,709
together it is a layer protocol
architecture so basically you choose

21
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:57,350
your protocols you pile them you saw you
start from physical layer and the you

22
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:02,750
need a basement and then of course a
link Manager to manage their connections

23
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,299
and then you can do whatever you want

24
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:12,000
applications telephony other kind of
brother goes there are a lot of them

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,330
during those twenty more than 20 years
there has been a lot of updates starting

26
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,590
from the first versions division 1

27
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:29,700
well there are some important about aids
mandatory but the others something like

28
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:36,299
marketers well you may think it is
obvious of course it is

29
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,820
we need a physical address to connect
our devices then I decided to make it a

30
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:51,140
standard in 2002 than other updates
regarding adopting the frequency hopping

31
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:58,959
and some well some of these features
regarding the connection and let's say

32
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:07,310
how to make it easy and resistant to
differences then they made such updates

33
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:15,730
to announce the data rate that was going
to be transferred so faster data

34
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:23,140
transfer with version 2.0 version 2.1
there is a very important update we will

35
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:29,840
discuss about the paving procedure this
update fixed a lot of important winner

36
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,109
abilities I will show you later

37
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:41,800
them from version 3.0 I think the most
important they'd was version 4.0 which

38
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:49,870
included a little too low energy and it
is now commonly used in such aisle te

39
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:56,680
devices wearable technologies they are
you using always the low-energy protocol

40
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,580
because it is better from the point of
view of consumptions because it has

41
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:10,770
lower consumptions and easier to
implement to be implemented so let's

42
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,750
let's speak about some

43
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:19,930
I think this one was one of the most
important well the most important was

44
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,560
the the following one but from here

45
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:30,050
it all started it was discovered in late
2003 and is covered by Goldman and lower

46
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,350
in

47
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:41,160
regarding the implementation on mobile
phones and Pocket palms and this

48
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:53,450
vulnerability exploited the DOB protocol
protocol was used to send files and

49
00:05:53,450 --> 00:06:00,250
request fires in a transfer of data and
they discovered that if you will know

50
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:08,430
exactly where the path of your file was
located was toward if you get requests

51
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:14,070
to that file you were allowed to easily
to download that file to get that file

52
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:20,120
from the other device without any
comment on the other device so n no

53
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:27,280
indication so just you just don't know
where the fire was located at the time

54
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:35,270
on the pocket rocket power with my
lawyers Windows Mobile on it the first

55
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:42,180
versions it was easy to spot for example
the contacts were stored so we were able

56
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:50,630
to download to dump the contacts and
this kind of data this vulnerability ok

57
00:06:50,630 --> 00:07:00,800
this was a simple scheme as you can see
you can bypass this this block or the

58
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,180
security manager the control because you
you were allowed to just to force the

59
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:13,860
request to get your file but this was
the most important I think because the

60
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,070
the year after

61
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:27,710
Martin her Fort joined the military in
and they presented at 112 this big

62
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:35,330
vulnerability it was a security loophole
in which you were able to send proper

63
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:44,780
Commons to certain device through our
place your connection I mean you were

64
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:52,479
able to force the device the victim
device to execute some comments and you

65
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,950
were able for example to make it three
or to send pictures without any prompt

66
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:06,800
on the other side just sending sending
comments through a placing our

67
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,260
connection so I dunno if you remember if
you have a point

68
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:19,950
Symbian OS phone but it was one of the
most say exploited vulnerabilities this

69
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:28,330
one to dump the pictures of your victim
of phone and I played a lot on this and

70
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:37,189
it was very fun and another one very
important was blowjob it was used to

71
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:44,830
disrupt a pic on it so I connection
between multiple devices and actually it

72
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:52,940
worked because if you try to insert
inside the speaker and sending the

73
00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:00,260
Master Quest just a simple request
appointed hey I want to speak on it I'm

74
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,990
here

75
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:06,850
the matter was confused about that
request because you cannot recognize it

76
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:14,420
and the connection was destroyed but
let's analyze now some procedures the

77
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:20,839
paving procedures that were fixed the
just with version 2.1 this was important

78
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,780
because

79
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:29,850
as you can see from this little picture
the procedure is done in this way the

80
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:36,090
first device sends to the second one
which one to pay for the first time

81
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:41,930
random number he was supposed to
generate random number at this point by

82
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:49,229
evaluating with proper algorithm and
taking into account the MAC address of

83
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:57,820
the device was asking them to pay both
the two generated hey you need value

84
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:06,680
with this value they generated a linky
linky used to to pay the two devices but

85
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,780
at this point there is something missing

86
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:22,579
no one is checking if the tooling his
and this is not good and that indication

87
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,030
which was the next phase

88
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:31,380
the next step in order to establish a
connection actually worked like this

89
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:41,400
device generated random number and
saddened to the device to connect to the

90
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:50,670
first 100 indicate then this number of
stress was evaluated with the MAC

91
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:57,599
address of the the claimant advice and
sent back to the verifier at this point

92
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:07,000
the very fire already calculated that
the same as res and if they are at the

93
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,980
bar at this point if they are the same
device are authenticated by version 2.1

94
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:21,240
favoring was improved and there was an
additional check which was missing in

95
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,510
the first in the previous and that way
they run the numbers exchanged them were

96
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:32,480
actually too well the first device to
initiate the initiating one was sending

97
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,139
its own

98
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:39,220
from the number and then or initiating
device was sending its own run them

99
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:46,359
number then those two values were
combined in the evaluation of another

100
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:52,429
factor and after all this procedural
device was working simultaneously and

101
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:58,858
finally they produces a number and that
the number was displayed on the user

102
00:11:58,859 --> 00:12:06,319
side on their mobile or their device at
that point the user decided to compare

103
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:11,059
the two numbers and say okay they are
the same we can start the connection

104
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:17,410
press OK and this was there the update
the essential update for version 2.1

105
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:29,689
regarding the new version so we need to
talk about this one that was encryption

106
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:36,269
bypass and is covered by Mark Ryan the
fact is that if you are working with

107
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:39,440
Bluetooth 4.0 0

108
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,540
they invented a different way to
exchange is a different protocol not for

109
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:53,400
example the elliptic curve most used but
that's strange method starting from

110
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,340
peering they generate a temporary key
from that temporary t generate another

111
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:03,450
key and the final one that is the
long-term key is the one used for the

112
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,900
connection

113
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:12,709
the point is that from temporary key on
the exchanging procedure is done over

114
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:23,730
the air in plain text so if I get the
temporary key I'm actually able to get a

115
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:33,380
long time so let's focus on the
temporary how can we get that weighs in

116
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:39,310
order to make the paving if you are
working with Bluetooth 40 and they are

117
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:46,349
just shown here just works six digit PIN
or out of band ok if it is out of band

118
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:55,260
we are not focusing on that spectrum
band because we we we cannot interests

119
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:01,780
of course but if we are in just works
the temporary key is by the full set to

120
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:11,620
0 so easy and if the recipient a
six-digit been requested we have 182

121
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:23,760
number from 0 to 999 999 by the two 128
bits so if we

122
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:31,110
join those two cases with i7 processor
does one car one second in order to

123
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:37,090
forestall the possibilities and try them
all so it's easy I got a temporary key

124
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:47,690
then the short time he and the longtime
key I can break this procedure is gonna

125
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,540
be computed off-line because I will
evaluate all the possible the possible

126
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:59,060
values for my temporary key and that it
so now I will leave the world to my

127
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:12,760
friend and which are what we actually
did for this research ok let's start

128
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:20,310
introducing what the smart lock unlock
is a feature introduced with Android 5.0

129
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:27,390
and it enables the smartphone to be
unlocked without user interaction

130
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:33,800
the only things that one of these
condition must apply for example we have

131
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,569
the NFC unlock and so if we docked on
attack people disabled in the smartphone

132
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:47,480
is marvin is unlock then we have the
face recognition on dog so common

133
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,420
feature if the camera of the smartphone
recognize the owner then the smartphone

134
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:58,319
unlocked without the pin code of the
passcode then we have the body and log

135
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,250
the smartphone is in contact with the
body have no idea why they implement

136
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,110
this thing because it doesn't recognize
if the bodies of the owner of not of

137
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:15,560
course so and then we have the location
along so we can set a range and if the

138
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,329
smartphone is within his range is martin
is unlock and then we have the

139
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,990
bootloader unlock which is of course
what we are focusing on too late

140
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:30,880
for the Bluetooth unlock we have this
condition new user setup a reader

141
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,310
Bluetooth device so we already paid with
the target device and we said this

142
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:43,079
device trusted and from now on every
time we connect to this device is marvin

143
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:49,480
is automatically unlock so we don't have
to put being cold or whatever so what's

144
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:56,060
the problem the problem is it in Android
version before 5.1 delete keys not check

145
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:03,540
to ratify the Bluetooth device so the
point is that it's basically make a

146
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,459
difference based authentication because
we have the smartphone with allies their

147
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,770
connection to the Bluetooth device or
vice versa

148
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:17,650
and if make mac Address me the address
is known so the smartphone get the

149
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:22,709
device details if he's not known the
application process start but there is

150
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:30,800
no check on the linky well what it means
that we just need to get the MAC address

151
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:37,070
of the target device to unlock is more
fun without it being cold and it is

152
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,960
interesting because in brutal we don't
need the full address we just need for

153
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:49,020
the four byte for byte of the mcalary
the last four by the makers and how can

154
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,929
we get those bites we have a solution

155
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:57,070
the first one is to brute force it but
we can do it offline so we have to

156
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:02,120
insulate a new request a new connection
requests every time and the other the

157
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:10,110
other matter both of them have gone so
of course report is low because we again

158
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:16,699
we need to create a new connection
everything is expensive because even if

159
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,800
we can paralyze it because we can use
your friend the bluetooth dongle for

160
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,960
example to create parallel

161
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:31,010
connections over time he'd get expensive
anyway also you have like 100 dongles

162
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:41,570
it's too long

163
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:55,500
communication between the smartphone and
device for example SmartWatch whatever

164
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,330
the reason

165
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:03,500
process required because for to get them
all four bytes we need the integration

166
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,750
process to intercept their initiation
process because I will be soon before

167
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:13,230
they make a video address is required to
create delinking for the function one of

168
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:27,040
the parameter in a function to generate
the linky is the others

169
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,840
so

170
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:37,860
so and the target can become aware
because we are usually not normal people

171
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:44,719
look at your side and we see that you
are not normal people so if someone at

172
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,380
the bar see a guy like this one they
became aware of something is wrong

173
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:58,530
this guy he's my hero when I was a
little girl I might be lodged there was

174
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:05,950
no speed internet connection I was just
fifty Seiki connection and I'm twenty so

175
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:11,070
it's not long time ago and this guy
inspired me to create my first container

176
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:16,340
to steal wifi connection from the
village near by which was like 1.5

177
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,790
kilometers so this is my year or don't
play with him

178
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:27,120
ok saw what we what we found is a
solution the solution is hybrid because

179
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,729
there is another issue in Android that
Android when you turn on the Bluetooth

180
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:38,420
automatically start sending out beacons
with the MAC address already paid

181
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:43,960
devices if something similar to wi-fi
connection when you turn on your wifi

182
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,190
you start looking for already known

183
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:54,300
networks it does that sending out the
makers of this network and the truck he

184
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,280
said that the trusted devices must be
already paid so the other side of the

185
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,350
trust the device descent and so we can
intersect the beacons and so we get the

186
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,399
first three bites of the MAC address we
need and then we can just brute force

187
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:17,860
one bite which is 256 possible make
others so that's more convenient and ok

188
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:26,260
now I have a video and then we plan to
do the video yesterday night yesterday

189
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,820
night 20 night organized this bigger
part and we are in russia and there's a

190
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,220
lot of alcohol in russia so the video
was not

191
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:42,559
so using a video we made the air at that
point that was made in Vegas Vegas as a

192
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,399
lot of our code so that the problem is
still the same so I'm very sorry for the

193
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,480
quality of the video will try to I try
to explain what the important parts are

194
00:21:51,480 --> 00:22:03,200
but ok sorry okay what what we will do
here is just to show how the MAC

195
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:12,690
addresses change on the example so this
is of course not true

196
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:21,000
is just some stupid McAllister and we
are now scanning for devices to the

197
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,730
Kelowna make others of our own little
devices ok this is there one highlighted

198
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,780
I don't know if you can see yes you can
see is the address of the target into

199
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:48,940
device we are trying to do stuff

200
00:22:48,940 --> 00:23:04,470
we just change the changes ok so now you
see that others is changed and what you

201
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:10,320
are doing now is just starting

202
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:19,360
which basically print out all the while
the age i pocket from from the mood in

203
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:29,229
the face and the screen Android device
which we turn on Bluetooth interface and

204
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:36,730
automatically try to connect and its
unlocked so here you can see that there

205
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,770
is this we try to

206
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:46,160
is trying to request a connection to our
laptop and since the connection from the

207
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,530
perspective of the Android device is
already there sorry delegation is

208
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:57,190
already on the linky is supposed to be
stored on both devices so is not

209
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:02,950
calculated again and so their device
Android device that laptop is ok and

210
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:09,200
unlock the device without the pin code
and after a few seconds of course that

211
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,660
exchanges doesn't match because they
think he is also used to create the keys

212
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:19,190
for the encryption for the data which is
of course not not doable because we

213
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,970
don't have the linky so after a few
seconds device yet

214
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:30,390
again not yet we are just showing that
devices seem connected should be there

215
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:37,900
being called requested again sorry for
the video quality is ok with Android 5.0

216
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:43,830
all there is no new feature which is
that we can access the bluetooth menu of

217
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,590
storage device from the lock screen
without being called so we can select

218
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:55,980
the target device and send out beacons
only for that device so if before we

219
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:03,270
have to we we will get to the MAC
address of all preview saved device

220
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:08,450
previous saving device now we can select
and targets just wonder wise to even

221
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:18,100
further decrease the number of brute
force tries to required and needs a new

222
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,049
video but the best is yet to come

223
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:28,809
which we just show her face which is
running on

224
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:34,860
on the laptop in on the right we have
again the Android device in which we are

225
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:40,939
enabling the Bluetooth interface and as
you can see we are trying to connect

226
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:49,330
just to this device creativity P 38 on
380 and here we can see the MAC address

227
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:56,710
which is the lapd of Justice device
which is for be seeks a a true so as you

228
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:01,710
can see we see a lot of packets just for
this device in the device was not

229
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,139
arranged so as you can see the
connection doesn't happen because the

230
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:09,110
devices not arranged we just have the
smartphone but we can have the first

231
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:22,539
three might require the first indication
that it and now ok with Android 5.1 they

232
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:28,820
fix the issue of Martin not feature
which is building in Android but the API

233
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:36,610
of looting and Reid are still vulnerable
to this thing so even now with Android

234
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:41,729
is six point they're still vulnerable we
will request to fix the underlying

235
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:48,220
security team this response that I don't
know if you can read this ok there is a

236
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:55,190
method in a USB and his public is metal
supposed to check if the connection is

237
00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:03,899
encrypted or not but the matter as today
actually not 27 but today is still not

238
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:08,209
present in the latest version of this so
you cannot use this method if you are

239
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:17,680
running the official Android SDK

240
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:24,480
ok so they enjoyed their smart unlock
feature is vixen so what's the problem

241
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,900
with API because the result of
third-party application the party

242
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:34,040
applications which are emulating the
smart unlock feature for Android the 4.6

243
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:39,720
or 3.6 or whatever so if you are running
older version of Android which we are

244
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,950
probably doing because we know the
Android updates are not to solve so fast

245
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:49,450
and you're using this application to
emulate the smart unlock feature then

246
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:53,520
you got problems and I have the latest

247
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,730
which is there was one you will see
probably just my face I'm sorry for that

248
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:06,920
this is me yesterday in Vegas probably
drunk trying to do this video I'm sorry

249
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:14,580
so here we are just changing again it's
also the focus problem is his fault not

250
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:20,860
mine I just writing on the keyboard so
blame him

251
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,909
we are just OK we changed the rules

252
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,890
address again to the

253
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,040
target device and we are resurrecting
the

254
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,690
interface as before

255
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:46,960
ok so the mecca is not changed and now
we will start the visibility we start

256
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,470
the visibility of the laptop so that
other devices can see actually the

257
00:28:51,470 --> 00:29:02,350
interface on the laptop and now we move
to the restart AG see them again to see

258
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:08,860
that the pockets and now we move to
their new skates and Android Android

259
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,610
tablet with Android before buying
something I remember sorry and we turn

260
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:18,820
on the Bluetooth interface it
automatically straw try to connect to

261
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:26,639
this device creative whatever which is
the MAC address we both before and I

262
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,040
don't know if you can read the device
unlocked and the device actually their

263
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,610
creative will be free

264
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:39,030
80 is not technically just available but
devices or unlock it anyway because the

265
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:44,820
the the the application using the API
things that device as the direct link

266
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:55,230
here so is correctly connected but
that's not true so here we just see the

267
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,560
package and we see that after a few
seconds a direct connection is

268
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,850
terminated but we already have devised a
Android device unlocked so we don't care

269
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:08,730
in this way we can be possible to being
called encryption of the device

270
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:14,310
whatever if you need to extract
information contacts whatever for

271
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:19,120
example take from the point of view of
police which are taking your smart phone

272
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,959
calls you are doing bad start you know

273
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:33,280
ok future work with what we we are
focusing on now we are trying to apply

274
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:39,899
the same methodology used for this kind
of test so trying to see what are the

275
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,610
critical points in this case was the
linky and the very base station of the

276
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:49,879
linky actually on several other devices
which are like for example you two

277
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:56,030
devices smart and we have some issues
here and there but we can discuss now

278
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:03,480
because we are on there in da you know
this is a record it and that's because

279
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,360
you do is everywhere I mean every device
has been an hour every hour you to

280
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,959
device implement or Bluetooth ZigBee
your wifi but is very very common so

281
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:21,570
thank you thank you for the time and

282
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:32,000
ok question

283
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:48,490
you have 30 minutes so you have to make
some question because the room

284
00:31:48,490 --> 00:32:10,330
experience itself

285
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:19,419
shell cold or something I think that was
something related to the vulnerability

286
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:29,150
discovered by other Maloney and which is
rather all ten years about something

287
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:36,670
later and what do you think if I need to
find this stuff what should I start for

288
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:43,390
the UN to first of all you have to read
the specific situation at least some

289
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:50,620
part of it it's like a big book very big
way and then you need some I don't know

290
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:56,178
if you know there were two device ok you
need eight because you need to be able

291
00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:02,540
to decode the packets and and then you
need to know

292
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,020
also complained their specific
implementation on the vice you're

293
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,090
looking you're looking at for example we
were focusing on Android but if you want

294
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,800
to check the same things on

295
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,950
you know you're smart lock the door IUDs
martin get to know how they are you

296
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,350
smarter Kendall the connection what are
the pockets and what are the interface

297
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:28,320
of the Bluetooth which are exposed from
the block as we said there in the

298
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:35,510
beginning the route is just a big
problem in which you can stock a lot of

299
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:41,430
other broader question so these are not
mandatory so every nation a different

300
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:45,970
particles inside and expose different
kind of fish or so so we can get

301
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:51,000
everywhere so we can attack everywhere

302
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:03,120
of this stuff we can know you can
analyze every layer you can start

303
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:10,920
studying every layer with a they were
2008 HP AC agency I dumped you can start

304
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:18,350
analyzing the packets but as again later
depends on the implementation so you can

305
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:25,739
say there is no general way to analyze
everything so since 2004 know even seem

306
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:43,939
to exploit exists for the stuff I just
explodes in my opinion but yes bluetooth

307
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:49,760
like those in but these are the most
critical what we used to start studying

308
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,100
we analyze our the these bags are
discovered and then we applied some of

309
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:00,720
this methodology for our or our stuff
and we create what you're seeing now

310
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,020
okay thank you

311
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:16,540
some sort of software-defined radio that
sort of stuff so you can analyze lower

312
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,910
layers or just the fall

313
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:28,060
Bluetooth transceivers yes and then we
saw that was a mess so actually we focus

314
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:35,490
on the higher level which is pretty easy
but because the calling of the packets

315
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:41,140
is all done automatically and we also
use a lot of the HCI dumping formation

316
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:46,140
because you can see where the process
starts or stops in the connection and

317
00:35:46,140 --> 00:36:19,109
but we didn't go on the lower layer on
the bottom of this this table

318
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:42,869
I can we just get up and you actually
this is a logical bug it's not something

319
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:50,339
its its logical because the result is
missing check so there is no need to

320
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:56,420
create new tools just how the connection
is made how is the checking procedures

321
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:02,130
is implemented it enjoyed so you just
use the standard tools Wireshark over to

322
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:07,690
tender age CI dam which is building in
and you can analyze the whole procedure

323
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:19,869
for the optimization of communication
and connection procedures rethinking

324
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:31,470
does a standard software and hardware
allowed to just monitor just

325
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:37,868
another pay cuts without actually
connection make a connection to observe

326
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:43,690
and make it from other devices or you
need something

327
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:53,480
special devices are special drivers may
be ok they were truth is required to

328
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,819
intercept back at you can change McHale
receive some particular chipset made by

329
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:07,609
Broadcom in another chipset manufacturer
which I don't remember but you can buy

330
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:13,328
from eBay for one year olds or something
like that very very very cheap standard

331
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:17,770
for intercepting things there is the use
there is a meeting of the new device

332
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,940
which is anyway

333
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:27,589
again it is not the greatest thing I
actually think you can apply the same

334
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:33,700
the same things used to be written on
any kind of SDR which has the range of

335
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:40,609
the frequency of course so 214 yards but
of course they were to December because

336
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,980
everything is just created for that if
you have to buy a new car for this I

337
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:53,000
don't recommend it just my you were to
thank you

338
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:05,040
it's not something that matters

339
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:16,529
the Bluetooth connection is the problem
as it as we saw before

340
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:27,130
before every time we use our key for
establishing the encryption encrypted

341
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:33,550
connection so the problem is that none
died before 5.1 whiskey whatever it is

342
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:39,080
that whatever version it is is not check
it so every version of Android is

343
00:39:39,080 --> 00:40:01,370
vulnerable to the was vulnerable to this
product to this issue

344
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:10,440
we say yes thank you

345
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:21,740
questions are present I would say okay
thank you I hope you enjoyed the talk

346
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:32,959
and so a big thank you again you don't
want to say
