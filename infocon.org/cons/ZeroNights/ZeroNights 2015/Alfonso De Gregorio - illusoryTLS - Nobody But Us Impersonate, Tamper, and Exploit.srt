1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,250
that again is the origin be up numbers
needed ABC a double agent

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:17,670
good evening everybody thank you for the
opportunity to speak with you today this

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:26,580
is also my first time zero nights in
first time came be unforgettable first

4
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:38,739
time should be unforgettable the first
live concert at the first may need to be

5
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:44,538
dole attack of course I remember to
supposedly first time when I was mainly

6
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:51,500
the middle attack do you remember yours
I get client to pull logs from a web

7
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:58,620
server the NSL connection or their door
network after some time as new CEO quits

8
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,289
were established a new per request
failed to connect you to a certificate

9
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,979
error so I dumped the service in Decatur
was getting from the network can point

10
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:15,530
if I wanted to differ from the one I was
expecting to see any day time I realized

11
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,670
oh my gosh oh my gosh I get many the
middle of the next

12
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,840
say to me is wow so cool

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,409
security flaws first ever the ability to
study their attack network flow from the

14
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:40,790
inside out first time are unforgettable
if only we could notice that I will do

15
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,939
the memory of it

16
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:49,158
two parties but this is possibly
outnumber by the false negatives all

17
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,090
which is to say that current web public
infrastructure is fragile

18
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,790
we are as a security community we see
with increasing frequency incidents

19
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,909
vulnerabilities dramas in fields or the
infrastructure we didn't trust our

20
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:12,060
business upon China Internet network
information center

21
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:19,560
Lenovo literally from its center of
India and see us to trust each in order

22
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:27,980
komodo very excited just go down there
followed a leadoff double these steps by

23
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,290
lesions or otherwise allowed
impersonation of a number of

24
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:39,269
high-profile websites right person
eating and it is the ability to spy on a

25
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:46,440
sizable number of unsuspecting users so
no for memories for those of us who

26
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,079
remain oblivious to their very first
time right now this is unfortunate

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,140
because if no silent feel or is the
pinnacle goal or security engineering if

28
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:04,010
no silent feel or is the goal of
security and Jiri undetected

29
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:11,209
impersonation is the measure of success
in our engineering for it as if that was

30
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:15,640
not enough coast for cancer we are now
discussing about building cryptographic

31
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:23,510
vidor's go figure I wanted intersection
of safety security and security software

32
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:30,929
is blowing and try to contain the space
of an anticipated date I want to go to

33
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:39,910
be open and robust secure backdoor
sounds like an oxymoron like almost safe

34
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:46,760
can you imagine asking your special
somebody darling I receive is to replace

35
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,660
you almost she's no good to repair give
you a satisfactory answer but it's about

36
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,579
people getting their doors that I would
like to speak today so before moving

37
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:06,540
quarter less even look to their agenda
in the west and all this mess here so I

38
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,700
was already start talking about is so
respected only prescribed her with a lot

39
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:19,450
into our business upon shortly I will
introduce you to illusory pls ape

40
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,300
a big dork targeting they are a secret
operation that I said meet the first

41
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,760
underground group took and passed I will
use this backdoor in this class a big

42
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,550
doors in order to discuss the impact
their impacted the implication on the

43
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:40,430
car in web public key infrastructure
before closing I will share with you a

44
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,700
novel bagged or embedding algorithm
exploiting delegate or bored with

45
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,330
surveillance so let's get started

46
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:55,340
great of a dorm is a timely topic of
debate as a matter for government to

47
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:02,659
legislate on for today I propose you to
approach it as a technical space this is

48
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:09,940
my 10th practically explored regardless
of the policy framework for intelligence

49
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,620
purposes if somebody in the believe
however questionable

50
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,400
secure back door with a golden key is
possible to build one will be able to

51
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,450
notice it will be a compromise will be
able to notice if our communication will

52
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,920
be inspired

53
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:35,180
before delving into the technicalities I
would like to pull your view about creep

54
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,190
Tibet tours so if you feel inclined
please rise around in a recognized your

55
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:51,320
view how many of you that big doors can
be a symmetric anyone just a few in how

56
00:05:51,320 --> 00:06:01,240
many of you the deadbeat North can be
planted in that alright well the common

57
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,370
view is the big door and somatic in asia
because the report some sort of

58
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,640
malicious logic in the target system
code base which is to say that everyone

59
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,229
with knowledge about a journalist David
organist played it and give enough ski

60
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:20,410
lesson at four to go read you can spot
their presence yet

61
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:26,120
discounts research published challenged
his view impact big horse

62
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,169
can be a symmetric in their complete
code does not enable anyone except those

63
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:36,760
with access to the cuticle resistant to
exploit a big bore a big dog can be

64
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,699
planted in data or to paraphrase a
popular vote on city of some programming

65
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:51,139
languages back to restart in that
respect or I ask you to consider a date

66
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:57,340
current web public infrastructure they
died X 509 web PKI security architecture

67
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:02,388
for support if its sequel certification
authority public key certificate me this

68
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:11,919
door and tourists is certainly can store
or relying parties and we did this did

69
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,400
not happen already while I'm not in a
position to know if this already and I

70
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,198
decided to explore this scenario from
office Barry Mendel in speculative point

71
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:22,919
of view

72
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,580
back in November 2014 1 year ago I said
it first

73
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:34,330
under ended the contest gone already
there are already crippled contest is a

74
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,030
competition to write and modify cryptic
code it appears to be secure but

75
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:47,809
actually does something evil illusion of
the elliptic curve as a door in Orosi

76
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:54,139
degeneration this is the worst possible
outcome because they big door completely

77
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:59,539
perverts the security guarantees of the
TLS protocol allowing the tucker to

78
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:05,560
impersonate points topped with a message
and activities drop their communication

79
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:15,660
that reflects the fall we model the big
designer is certainly our abilities I T

80
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,260
system networking and communication
devices used by targets get influenced

81
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,229
by Liz's standard specification for
commercial publicly technologists

82
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:28,500
interfere with the supply chain

83
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,539
everything about policy or simply the
position to be the security module used

84
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,080
by the certification authority in order

85
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:47,170
to generate a key material comprises
three modules in HTTPS client API server

86
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:54,360

and is used as is without any

88
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:05,240

without loss of generality illusory

89
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,950

with a client sending a basic HDD become

90
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,470
and all the necessary channel awaiting
the server response so

91
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:21,680
network security perspective resembles

92
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:31,930
with a client to server or in order to
mutually Atlantic 80 a question is do if

93
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,359
the client and server code is contribute
by an open source project and is used as

94
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,610
is without any modification where is the
back door I plan to back door in the

95
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:50,140
public did you communicate in point rely
upon to mutually out in a big story is

96
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,890
highly robust against the reverse
engineer II in particular they are perot

97
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:01,530
debates or the RSA modulus echoed in a
symmetric encryption of receipt generate

98

ability to factor with these say martyrs

102
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,560
this means that nobody door was sleep

103
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,290
the cryptographic credential issued a

104

loser et les is 20 years old I don't

105
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,349
introduce the notion was secretly
embedded door we need universal

106
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:50,889
protection or set up a creep 296
illusory class is an instance of a young

the first of which is that nobody but us

111
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,880
or now but this means that this
provision requires access the resource

112
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,180
not invaded the back door itself it is
case disagrees ours is a nearly picker

exploited by the back door designer wear

114
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,420
Birkenstocks as IC recovery system so
before moving farther I would like to

115
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,979
ask you one question do you believe that
is possible

116
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:47,220
24 beat anatomy intelligence
organization from gaining access to a

117
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,470
product key well respected those of you
who are inclined to believe that is

118
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,370
possible to forbid any name intelligence
organization from gaining access to a

119
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,319
product key will be less inclined to
regard this classic ignores us possibly

120
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:07,130
secure by the same time I spend it does
have you are inclined to regard all

121
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:12,889
measure to prevent disclosure ready to
be seen him back double to be inclined

122
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:19,380
also regard people gotta be doors as
inherently insecure but out on the top

123
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,630
of that nobody but a security property
illusion retail establishments other

124
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,699
properties such as indistinguishable T
as long as a computational Arden

125
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:34,290

decisional diffie-hellman holds the big

polynomial-time algorithms like genuine

127
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,310
hora si quieres this means that black
box office regenerator

128
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:51,819
does not allow the tax for tomorrow the
big tourist forward secure so if a

129
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,730
reverse engineer breached in particular
a door then they previously stolen

130
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,080
information remains confidential in this
big door is reusable because it can be

131
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:07,850
used multiple times and against multiple
targets therefore it is interesting to

132
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,029
look at it the impact and implications
are discussed

133
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:18,290
doors on public key infrastructure the
attacker can use a private key recover

134
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,250
by factory day RNC models in order to
break the alleged security guarantees it

135
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,160
will expose it to communicate and point
to a variety of topics ranging from

136
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,490
impersonation the message tampering into
activists rodeo Dr communication

137
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,600
whenever the attacker mounts a
man-in-the-middle attack no necessary

138
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,350
for the first time this means that for
the attacker there's no need to have

139
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,970
access to a product key used by system
actors

140
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,960
there's no need to tamper with the
communicating and points what they're

141
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,440
talking to do is to retain control over
the key generation or the target RNC

142
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,370
models therefore I want there is the
militia supplementary mitigated by IP

143
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:07,290
product security certification later I
will briefly review the security

144
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:11,650
requirements are for the most common
protection profile it demanded by

145
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:16,740

Scituate poor Bruce to be a schematic

00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:21,200
process the application enables entity
in one public infrastructure of trust

158
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,390
and it is another public infrastructure

159
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,970
relationship should be sportbike
recertification agreement between the

160
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,589
certification authority or each public
infrastructure so they could establish

161
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:39,310
responsibilities and a liability for
each party whenever we had a mutual

162
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:44,699
relationship each certification
authority is required to say we should

163
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,320
certificate to the other party in order
to establish a relationship in both

164
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,550
direction the powerful trust is not
necessary

165
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:57,229
iraqis include a different guy can have
certificate authorities what is

166
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,010
important is that after 2 certification
authority established in specified areas

167
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,839
but trust in each disappearing a
speechwriter and it is we did a separate

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:13,920
as well as Dylan overall many are just a
sample of exploitation his ability or do

178
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:21,380
we just say that universal certification
or the lack of boundaries of signer of

179
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:27,490
boringness is the security or dad since
I mitigated surprises what it believes

other three orders production provide
the issuance level is yell for augmented

201
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:30,840
argumentation comes from a dif three
additional security requirements this

202
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,559
security departments are focused on
assessing the vulnerability of the

203
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,720
target evaluation in quarantine the

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,000
incomplete installation of the target
valuation security functional

205

requirements special emphasis is placed
on identify channel capacity which is

206
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:56,740
fortunate because set up a tax is
applied to the key duration as a covert

207
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:03,840

the developer to be charged for the

nation faced with our grandmother right
away to his left the documentation and

209
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:20,740
implementation representation to be a
set so depressed as a big or be allowed

all four matters which are beneficial to

00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:38,289
solve anything but they are beneficial
but a yell for the implementation

213
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:43,029

actually likely just think about our

the atmosphere description language
provided assigned time or did not list

216
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,480

takeaway I would like to leave you with

217
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,909
today is that as long as the
implementation of policy or other

218
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:08,590
algorithms vulnerable to discuss a bit
doors used by president is gonna be

219
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:14,168
ordered by the late parties in interest
on course for the sea trusted entity is

220
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:19,799
to be regarded as a potential big door
which is to say that as long as Asian

221
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:22,790
tourists see cannot be proud

222
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:27,820
receivables area will discuss attack

223
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:34,590
partners insurance provided by User et
les none whatsoever is not any different

224
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:39,149
from there should provide but since then
rely on pls in Orosi

225
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:44,470
goods for or agent of the occasion
confidentiality a message integrity

226
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,500
guarantees a number of mitigation exists
on paper

227
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:55,230
ranging from keeping broader is pleased
it draws certification but not as widely

228
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:01,760
deployed yet so we have a problem we
have an open problem but let's look to

229
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,050
the most funny part of this because this
optimist or the back door planted in

230
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,659
cryptographic credential resides in the
absence of malicious logic in this is

231
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,780
the security key roads we have no
malicious logic indicating points

232
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:23,810
admittedly 52 is the back door embedding
algorithm it today I would like to share

233
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:31,030
with you a novel bagged or embedding
algorithm few weeks after my submission

234
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:37,000
today under a decree passed Ryan
Castellucci submit news article share D

235
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,840

like to start from this lady 8255 public

246
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,570
your secret usually picard in order to
do that

247
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:53,040
have access to the public yet to see the
public embedded in the key generator

248
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:59,590
therefore we have denied body but does
security property that tucker used

249
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,199
share secret to see the cryptographic
security to the random number generator

the republic in the cubicle cover attack

254
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:32,690
is there that I cannot boot record their
artists a product key now hope they do

255
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,670
is nice they keep their generated using
this algorithm for short in terms of

256
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:43,750
usability the for this game should be
regarded as broken in fact it's easy to

257
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:49,730
tell the big city apart from the online
or is it because using only black box

258
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,910
does anybody of you see why this is the
case anybody

259
00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:05,740
well what we're doing here is a bad the
public today Orosi marvelous right but

260
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:11,480
Olympic Republic is our point and
elliptical point can be easily

261
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,660
distinguished from uniform druggist
thinks because they satisfy the equation

262
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:22,170
so security evaluators check if the
court is encoded using a candidate 32 by

263
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,530
sub streams of the modulus

264
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:34,230
despite daily pic of equation can be
repaired a torn out to do that in India

265
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,929
debating the issue is that if we could
make the elliptical spice

266
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:42,890
indistinguishable from running things
that the big boring things ability will

Springs indistinguishable from uniform

270
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:07,520

interesting to me because all cyber

271
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,610
security technology is inherently
dual-use this long as their wisdom

272
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:17,990
believe is corroborated by alligator
just like any

273
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:22,320
also bring security tools and
detectability of good points can be used

274
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,799
for good or ill for censorship said
convention or for surveillance but I

275
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:34,889
believe we can contribute to the
discussion is a security engineering by

00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:00,300
the ability property openly and we can
now put the back door are insecure pair

291
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:05,919
in order to perform a key recovery
attack the same attacker extracted their

292
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:11,470
founded in target marvelous market they
represent district to the candidate if

293
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:16,770
you were all cool up to 50,000 in
public-key computershare secret in order

294
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,389
to do that

295
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:22,030
have access to the private key as a city
Republic embedded into the key generator

296
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:27,690
so again we have dinner buddy but as
property and use the shared secret see

297
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:33,190
this graphically security pseudo-random
number generator the attacker generated

298
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:38,810
is under a sec appear in replace 32 by
the deterring generate modelers with it

299
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:44,480
represented is found in a target modules
using despite two da original print

300
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,310
factors that occur computer crimes
leading to the target models embodied

301
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:55,340
uniform representatives Street in that
occurs at sidi recovering or origin of

302
00:28:55,340 --> 00:29:02,270
the artist a product key that you can
safely up and that's pretty much it as

303
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:07,470
far as the iPad goes the code is
publisher get up so please use it

304
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:13,870
responsibly but before wrapping up I
have one last remark to me it would like

305
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:24,040
to close within 7 GOG 1 seed to open in
the death of misery there is money in

306
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,480
music inside me if you like me

307
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,760
believed it security or depressants
surprises is the misery of our time if

308
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,300
you let me believe that insecurity is
the misery of our times and at the same

309
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:46,070
time you are also sanguine about our
ability to attain better security trade

310
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,929
off

311
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,320
to give our children the chance to reach
confidence in the process in which they

312
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,669
will trust their business then we can
paraphrase

313
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:58,220
dog and say that we are often in the
death of

314
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,789
security there is money

315
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:29,470
music inside us thank you

316
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:37,820
180

317
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:56,039
security so I leave it to the public key
infrastructure has appointed case just

318
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:00,980
two days ago we found out it is illegal
in oval instantly a rogue certification

319
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:08,970
authority in their computers in the top
of that there are some providers

320
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:17,720
publisher there are pinned up stores
they are doing likewise Certification

321
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,429
Authorities unfortunately they technical
measures in order to prevent degradation

322
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:29,480
process relationship exists our PK
technology standardizing the internet

323
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,280
Engineering Task Force but we are not
using just make it is the respective

324
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:48,540
views so we are a blight we are valuable
for president

325
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:59,520
about DNS sick and if you know the D and
E

326
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:08,020
protocol that possible two days

327
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,730
general to build trust

328
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:18,560
RNP is nice in theory but they believe
that the powerful the standardization

329
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:24,020
for we decide some important tactical

330
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:31,680
details I'm not persuaded it yes he's
going to solve our problems

331
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:44,850
discuss problems

332
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:58,399
any more questions

333
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,110
somehow

334
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:20,949
but on some real now not when there is a
possibility

335
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:26,610
despite some buildings writer I'm not in
a position to know if somebody is

336
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:34,500
actively exploited because you can't do
that without getting noticed you can

337
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:41,960
mount essentially whenever you recover a
key after interfere with display HUD key

338
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,919
generation technologies used by the
certification authority you can mount a

339
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,500
man and talk about security guarantees
it will so I'm not in a position to know

340
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:59,910
this already happen precisely biko's
attack sub dole and his

341
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:09,150
difficult to detect some technologies
like transparency competing to detect

342
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,510
active attacks in the field

343
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:18,330
trace back eventually someone then to
this class of problems we have in the

344
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:24,790
public key infrastructure but it's a war
that needs to be carried out by did is

345
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:40,349
better positioned to me

346
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:48,140
any more questions

347
00:34:48,139 --> 00:35:00,700
no question of maybe maybe not related
at all but how do you see this

348
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,029
initiative led sink read

349
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:09,080
for providing receive certificates for
free for everyone

350
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:20,370
well that is nice because we can play
see all the stakeholders all users of

351
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:27,049
public infrastructure in a position to
to Avatar essentially for free to make

352
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,770
their regular there

353
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:38,850
certainly so one-sided it is a positive
initiative that I will comment I believe

354
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:44,360
I will be using also that's a creep
certification authority that say that

355
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:49,280
same time there are some underlying
problems

356
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,440
technological problems that are
orthogonal to all certification

357
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,760
authorities and they are related to our
public infrastructure bored or don't

358
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:07,100
work nowadays so there are some it does
provide challenges that need to be

359
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:22,970
addressed a letter creep will need to
face them like everybody else

360
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:29,828
any more questions

361
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:34,680
we are we'll be hanging around here
today and also tomorrow so feel free to

362
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,058
catch me around then keep discussing
thank you
