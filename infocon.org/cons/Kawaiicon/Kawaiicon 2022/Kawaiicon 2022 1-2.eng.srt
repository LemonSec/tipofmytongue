anyway good morning and welcome uh we

51
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,400
have a wonderful day of entertainment

52
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,440
planned for you uh there are a few items

53
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,080
of administ trivia that uh our fine

54
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,840
script tells me that i should say

55
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:50,320
so first things first thank you for

56
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,080
continuing to mask thank you for

57
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,360
monitoring your own symptoms you've had

58
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,400
a few people

59
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,800
who felt crummy yesterday used the rat

60
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,640
tests that are available in the venue

61
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,840
discovered that they were covered

62
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,600
positive and spreading it around and

63
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,280
have subsequently left and are hopefully

64
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
watching the live stream so

65
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,000
thank you to those people

66
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,880
for being responsible for looking after

67
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,560
our hacker family

68
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,239
and if you are watching on the live

69
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:17,440
stream this morning and you haven't

70
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,880
picked up your merch please ask one of

71
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,120
your fellow hackathons to pick it up for

72
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,760
you if you uh

73
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,080
do want to pick up your merch uh most

74
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,520
yes it's going to be open until

75
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,960
afternoon break

76
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,400
if you don't pick up your merch it's a

77
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,719
real pain and adds us because he has to

78
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,320
go put it back in the lock-up and then

79
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,400
the logistics crew have to deal with it

80
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
all and then getting it out to you later

81
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,120
is a real pain so please help us out um

82
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,480
otherwise we have to pay for storage for

83
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,560
that stuff for the rest of time

84
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,760
and there is kiwicon 2 merch going back

85
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,800
a decade that we keep in a lock up

86
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,560
somewhere along with the sheep and the

87
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,840
and the llama actually the llama has a

88
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,120
job now

89
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,520
uh works uh it works for a day job at

90
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,000
llama engineering for all of your datsun

91
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,760
restoration services

92
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,600
courtesy mr bogan um anyway so yes uh

93
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,400
what else have we got uh the videos will

94
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,600
be available after the con if you want

95
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,360
to relive any of your experiences or

96
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,280
share them with your workmates or chums

97
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,000
or

98
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,480
other people who could not be here so we

99
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,880
will do that um

100
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,920
go participate in the ctf at hal

101
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,080
go investigate the lock picking desk

102
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,520
and have yourselves a good time

103
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,040
so our first speaker this morning

104
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,320
when you think about the history of

105
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,239
infosec i mean one of the things that

106
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:36,320
strikes me is that like we invented

107
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,760
computers to hack nazis which is pretty

108
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,719
cool

109
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:42,000
uh and then the cold war happened uh and

110
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,520
nuclear armageddon threatened us

111
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,640
unfortunately that's not a thing that

112
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,840
happens anymore

113
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
and the intersection of

114
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,560
nuclear weapons and the cold war and

115
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,960
command and control systems for icbms

116
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,480
and guidance systems for weapons and

117
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,640
eventually the space program contributed

118
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,320
to the development of computers and

119
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,800
communications and miniaturization uh

120
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,199
and all of the things that led to

121
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,360
the crazy cyberpunk dystopia that we

122
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,480
live in now

123
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,520
and when you think about the impact

124
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,840
you know of the of the cold war and

125
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,600
nuclear weapons and nuclear energy uh on

126
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,800
the development of infrastructure and

127
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,880
development of hacking

128
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
there's very few people who are directly

129
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,800
at the kind of intersection of both and

130
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
of course it is my great pleasure to

131
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,320
introduce to you a man who has spoken i

132
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,560
think all but one kiwi cons ever i think

133
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,800
maybe you missed one right and then

134
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,440
uh every other single one uh we have had

135
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,000
none other

136
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,520
than the maintainer of many many crypto

137
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,880
things himself

138
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,040
inspector of nuclear weapons mr peter

139
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,260
goodman

140
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:52,480
[Applause]

141
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,719
okay so about a couple years ago i did a

142
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,560
talk on the effects of faults on

143
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
security and what this talk is going to

144
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,280
be is on dealing with those faults

145
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,560
so basically in terms of faults you've

146
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,040
got random faults over voltage under

147
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,960
voltage spikes electrical glitches clock

148
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,440
glitches noise thermal issues and the

149
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,719
one i talked about a couple years ago

150
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,560
which was radiation which was a

151
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,920
one of the one of the ways of having

152
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,040
faults but more typically you'd have

153
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,800
electrical faults

154
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,400
and the nasty thing about these things

155
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,000
if you using to compromise the security

156
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,920
system is that it's entirely passive you

157
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,199
just sit there and wait you watch the

158
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,880
bits on the wire if there's some sort of

159
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,960
corruption there then it's probably been

160
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,320
caused by a fault and you can work

161
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,360
backwards and use that as an attack

162
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,719
there's very few studies that have been

163
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:34,640
actually carried out on

164
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,239
the effects of these faults so two of

165
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,719
the ones i could find um found that

166
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,800
about two percent of faults in firewalls

167
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,320
and ftp in an ssh how it had security

168
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,000
implications so there was some random

169
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,520
fault two percent of those caused

170
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,000
security vulnerabilities

171
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,440
so those are random faults but what if

172
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,640
you're an attacker and you help that

173
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,760
along a bit

174
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,679
um all of those faults that i mentioned

175
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,679
previously can be induced deliberately

176
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,360
so with hardware you introduce voltage

177
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
glitches clock glitches electromagnetic

178
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,640
fault injection where you put a huge

179
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,120
electromagnetic pulse into the circuitry

180
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,719
and there's also software-based ones you

181
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,159
may have heard of row hammer causing bit

182
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,640
flips in memory um and you can also do

183
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,120
things like undervolt a motherboard so

184
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,480
you know for power saving purposes

185
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,400
they're designed so that they run as low

186
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,320
as power as possible you undervolt it

187
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,520
into the point where the circuitry is

188
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,440
now working unreliably and cause faults

189
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,719
in that manner so you've actually got

190
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:24,800
software support for hardware attacks on

191
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,360
standard motherboards

192
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,960
and it's pretty much self-explanatory so

193
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,640
that's an example of an electromagnetic

194
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,719
fault injection probe so it's a

195
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:34,320
software-controlled way of generating a

196
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,960
very high voltage high current pulse

197
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,120
which you then push through a coil and

198
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,679
induce that inside the circuitry

199
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,440
um so you take the target you glitch it

200
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,800
you record the results and you repeat

201
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,320
until you get the effect you want so

202
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,000
that's an example obviously it's just a

203
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,600
test setup in that case of a raspberry

204
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,080
pi that's being used um for fault

205
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,199
injection so that red bit of the

206
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,640
circuitry is a high voltage pulse

207
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,120
generation circuitry which induces those

208
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,520
faults inside the pi

209
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,960
a couple years ago it used to be pretty

210
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,600
exotic stuff so that's that one the that

211
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,280
one there is handmade um that's

212
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
commercial off the shelf gear so you can

213
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,560
go and you can buy one of these things

214
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,560
in that case it's being used to

215
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,079
break a trees or hardware electronic

216
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,640
wallet so there's a series of devices

217
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,440
there's something called a chip

218
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,800
whisperer which does side channel

219
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,159
attacks and then there's a chip shelter

220
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,920
which does the opposite it introduces

221
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,400
faults into a circuit

222
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,000
and you can glitch data reads you can

223
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,520
glitch reads you can glitch cpu

224
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,199
operations there's an example there of a

225
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,159
chip shelter being used to glitch um

226
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:32,000
memory so depending on the polarity of

227
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,600
the pulse you can either force splits to

228
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,199
puts to one or bits to zero or at least

229
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:38,560
more bits to one or more bits to zero

230
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,840
and these attacks are incredibly

231
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,520
effective this is a comment from a smart

232
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,760
card from two smart card researchers one

233
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,840
of whom was a white hat who asked you

234
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,360
know what happens if you find a smart

235
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,719
card so some security circuitry you

236
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,960
can't glitch the other one who was very

237
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,719
much a grey hat said i've never found

238
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:55,760
anything that i can't glitch

239
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,280
okay so the way of dealing with this is

240
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,719
you use fault tolerance systems and

241
00:17:58,719 --> 00:17:59,840
there's a lot of architectures

242
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,040
architecture's designed for this

243
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,120
typically the terminology is x out of y

244
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,040
so x out of y units have to fail to get

245
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,800
an overall failure

246
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,159
incidentally these slides have a lot of

247
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:09,280
information on them particularly the

248
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,400
later ones so i'll be putting them

249
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,080
online online later you don't

250
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,520
necessarily need to photograph the

251
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,480
slides they'll be available later

252
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,159
standard systems are one out of one so

253
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:20,159
you get a failure anywhere in that chain

254
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:22,480
and the whole thing fails

255
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,880
then you've got fail safe systems so you

256
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,080
don't want to have an accidental

257
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,000
activation of something so in that case

258
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,520
both systems have to fail to get an

259
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,199
accidental activation

260
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:33,440
the opposite of is high availability so

261
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,600
either one of those has to be working in

262
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,520
order to get the correct activation in

263
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,360
other words both systems have to fail in

264
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,520
order to get an overall failure

265
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,880
and then there's a lot more complicated

266
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,159
stuff like two out of three and you have

267
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:46,400
voting majority voting stuff like that

268
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,159
the thing is all of these require custom

269
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:50,560
hardware so if you go to someone and you

270
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,239
say there's this theoretical probability

271
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:54,000
of some faults that may affect security

272
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,120
and we've got to completely redesign the

273
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,920
hardware that's really not going to fly

274
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,400
there was one variant um that requires

275
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,760
little to no custom hardware and that's

276
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,440
one out of 1d so it's a standard one out

277
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,040
of one system and it's got a diagnostic

278
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,480
channel and what that diagnostic channel

279
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,199
does it detects a fault and it resets or

280
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,719
restarts

281
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,000
if you remember the talk yesterday about

282
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
yesterday about the agc where it does

283
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,280
checkpointing and restarts from a safe

284
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,040
checkpoint that's an example of a one

285
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,640
out of 1d system

286
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,080
so basically you fail fast detect

287
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,000
default restart from a safe point and

288
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,280
keep going

289
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,800
so the goal is to make general purpose

290
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,199
software 1 out of 1d

291
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,880
the way to do this is to use something

292
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,280
called the swiss cheese model of failure

293
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,320
it was designed by a guy called

294
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,760
professor james reason who's done a lot

295
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,960
of work on the failure of complex

296
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,440
systems and what you do is you turn that

297
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,719
on its head and turn it into the swiss

298
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,159
cheese model of failure prevention so

299
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,320
the way this works is defenses are

300
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,400
imperfect it's like swiss cheese

301
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,840
however if you've got enough layers of

302
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,520
swiss cheese

303
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,120
a fault has to go through all of those

304
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,199
layers to get to to actually become a

305
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:53,199
serious noticeable effect

306
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:55,440
so in the case of a swiss cheese analogy

307
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,199
all the holes have to line up exactly to

308
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:58,320
get something that goes all the way

309
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,600
through them

310
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,880
so you need to constrain the code and

311
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,400
data flow in such a way that your

312
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,920
propagation through all of those layers

313
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,679
of swiss cheese is highly unlikely so

314
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,360
basically take the swiss cheese model

315
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,800
and turn it into a safety model instead

316
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,080
and again the way to do that is

317
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,360
something called designed by contract so

318
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,560
it was introduced by this guy called

319
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,880
bertrand meyer in the 1980s the basic

320
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
idea behind this is that each block of

321
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,639
code has a precondition so these things

322
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:21,840
have to be met before you go into the

323
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,920
code and a post condition these things

324
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,480
are satisfied once you exit that code

325
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,080
and see it's pretty easy to do that as a

326
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,560
macro just if this is met fail or if

327
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,440
this is not met fail

328
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,719
so there's an example so you've got a

329
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:36,719
function to do some that's actually

330
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:39,040
taken from some crypto code um and

331
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,400
typically when you pass in let's say an

332
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,840
integer parameter that can have one of

333
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,400
four billion values so that first macro

334
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,080
there it says that instead of any one of

335
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,840
these four billion values if there's any

336
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,199
corruption it can have one of these two

337
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:50,880
values if it doesn't meet those

338
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,239
conditions of having one of those two

339
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:54,000
values out of four billion

340
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,760
then it fails and it does goes into a

341
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,560
failure recovery

342
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,480
so basically it guarantees that all the

343
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,400
input parameters are expected i mean it

344
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,080
even beyond this there's a fault

345
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,760
tolerance it's just good sanitation and

346
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,440
it also catches things like wild jumps

347
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,960
into code and it makes rop a whole lot

348
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,400
harder because you've got to have all

349
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,679
the parameters set up correctly you

350
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,199
can't just randomly jump into a block of

351
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:15,440
code and it'll keep executing so it's a

352
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,719
fundamental building block for all of

353
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:19,360
the latest safety measures

354
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,280
so common problem in c um it doesn't

355
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,360
have any range checking

356
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,639
and you get problems with memory

357
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:26,400
overruns from men copy me move something

358
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,679
like that so if you look at that

359
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,360
function the last parameter is actually

360
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,120
an unsigned value but typically it's

361
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,719
passed an integer count value so when

362
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:33,679
you get a

363
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,960
any sort of corruption in that it

364
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,520
becomes negative uh when once you cast

365
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,880
that to an unsigned value it becomes a

366
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,719
very large unsigned value and then you

367
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:42,880
get a memory overrun and this has led to

368
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,800
a lot of security vulnerabilities you

369
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,400
can make everything unsigned but that

370
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,760
doesn't really work because then it

371
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,480
comes back and bites you in other places

372
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,000
so you basically create bounce checking

373
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
functions and again you've got that

374
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,880
precondition there that requires so

375
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,960
before every memory operation you do a

376
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,880
bounds check this must be a short

377
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,719
non-zero integer within this range which

378
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,000
means it's not going to be cast to a

379
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,159
large positive value once it's unsigned

380
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,880
and cause a memory overwrite

381
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,320
and you can do the same for enumerator

382
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,920
types and bit flags and other stuff with

383
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,000
a bit of macro trickery

384
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,280
and you can also use it to deal with

385
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,639
compiler brain damage so this is an

386
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:18,320
example of llvm and

387
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,239
what the c standard says if you've got a

388
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,080
case statement and there's no default at

389
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,679
the end and you fall off the end that's

390
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,600
undefined behavior in c so what the

391
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,880
compiler writers have said well okay

392
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,159
it's undefined we'll just generate a

393
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,400
code jump into random into a random

394
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,239
location in memory so they don't have

395
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:33,520
anything at the end of that function to

396
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,760
catch values that aren't specified in

397
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,600
that switch statement

398
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,199
so if you jump into that code with a

399
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,400
value that's been corrupted or an

400
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,080
unexpected value it just does a wild

401
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,600
jump into memory compiler doesn't

402
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,199
produce any warnings or generates code

403
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:48,480
that fails when executed

404
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,480
yep see there's no bounds checking i've

405
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,600
already mentioned that's a long standing

406
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
complaint

407
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,800
and you can again add macros to do

408
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,320
bounce checking so basically we've got

409
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,600
this block of memory we're doing an

410
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,199
operation here is that within this

411
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:01,040
larger block of memory

412
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,520
and macros to do this so

413
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,960
there's an example from ssh packet

414
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,719
assembly code and again packet assembly

415
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,400
and disassembly code has led to a lot of

416
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,159
problems with memory overruns and memory

417
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,600
overwrites because it's really tricky to

418
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,120
get right so before each one of these

419
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,719
memory operations you do a bounce check

420
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,239
to make sure that i'm still working

421
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:18,080
within this packet rather than using

422
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,600
some corrupted value that an attack has

423
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,280
passed me or for a value that's been

424
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,040
faulted to point outside that memory

425
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,480
block

426
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,400
so you may be wondering yeah okay it's c

427
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,480
why not just ditch c well there's a

428
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,080
reason why you need to use that and to

429
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,679
defend against faults you can't have any

430
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,360
hidden surprises c is a high level

431
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,520
assembly language so you know

432
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,800
pretty much exactly what you're going to

433
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,480
be getting from some source code if

434
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,000
you've got anything with complex hidden

435
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,159
internals polymorphism dynamic dispatch

436
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,080
v tables garbage collection anything

437
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,679
like that you've got this massive

438
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,120
complexity that can be affected by

439
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
faults and where you have no idea what

440
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,159
the compiler is actually going to be

441
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,400
generating in terms of code really bad

442
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,480
is even worse than that virtual machines

443
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,000
interpreters just in time compilers

444
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,760
anything like that you've got even more

445
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
complexity that can fault with no

446
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,679
control over it so that's why all this

447
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,080
is in c

448
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,840
okay say floops that's a standard form

449
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
of a loop counts to 10 passes the value

450
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,000
zero to ten nine to that function what

451
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,280
if there's a fault

452
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,960
so now you're passing random garbage

453
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,800
values to that function so if that

454
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,840
function happens to have these

455
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
preconditions then it'll catch most

456
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,679
problems but still the other problem is

457
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,600
that loop never terminates because if

458
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,960
you look at that loop it does a

459
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,120
comparison against the value 10. if that

460
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,360
falls and becomes 100 it will just keep

461
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,280
running until you get integer overflow

462
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,320
and do god knows what

463
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,679
so okay you make the loop variable

464
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,120
unsigned and use the less than rather

465
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,960
than equality comparison so you know

466
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,320
that it's going from zero to ten will

467
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,080
this loop terminate

468
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,520
yes it will for a simple loop but if

469
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,960
it's a more complex loop i mean that's

470
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,480
that's an example just for illustrative

471
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,040
purposes if that loop variable is the

472
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,719
subject of very complex calculations you

473
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,000
can't really look at that and say this

474
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,520
thing will terminate and even then it

475
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,960
may not work which i'll get onto in a

476
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,159
minute

477
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,360
what about that one will that loop

478
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,040
terminate you're following a series of

479
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,880
pointers i mean it's supposed to

480
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,159
terminate but if again if there's

481
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,520
corruption anywhere in those pointers

482
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,040
you're going all through random memory

483
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,158
and it will never terminate

484
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:08,800
so you statically bound every loop so

485
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,159
for most loops you have a pretty good

486
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,760
idea that this thing is shouldn't run

487
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,440
more than 10 times or 100 times or a

488
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,960
thousand times for example for a dns

489
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,400
name lookup you're not going to get it

490
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,440
we shouldn't be getting a thousand

491
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,120
results so you can bound it with a hard

492
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,719
upper bound so now you can guarantee

493
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,159
that every loop terminates rather than

494
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,040
running through all of memory

495
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,800
uh and again some horrible macros to

496
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,480
hide all that mess

497
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,320
problem is if you do that the compiler

498
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,239
will screw it up because

499
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,440
you've got this hard upper bound of

500
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,280
let's say a thousand iterations and the

501
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,719
loop bound of ten iterations so the

502
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:38,480
compiler looks at it and says well tens

503
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,679
less than a thousand i'll just throw

504
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,920
away this upper bounds check and reduce

505
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,800
it back to the original loop

506
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,320
so the way to deal with this is you have

507
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,679
one variable counting up and the other

508
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,440
one counting down in opposite directions

509
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,800
so the compiler can't figure out a

510
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,239
relationship between those and merge

511
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,760
them and there's some more tricks if

512
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,800
you've got a loop that counts down

513
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,520
anyway then the other one counts up

514
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,560
so then you've got this horrible

515
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,920
expanded form

516
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,760
all hidden by macros so now all the

517
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,360
loops are statically bounded and we can

518
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,880
guarantee that they terminate after a

519
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,719
fixed number of iterations

520
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:08,159
except then the compiler screws it up

521
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,280
again now you may be wondering what

522
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,040
could possibly go wrong with a loop like

523
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,080
that

524
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,560
if you look at what cc gcc does to that

525
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,440
remember that's the least stand

526
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,520
comparison it rewrites it as an equals

527
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,280
comparison so it's back to that broken

528
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,040
failure prone loop we had originally

529
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,560
that's x86

530
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,440
gcc arm equals comparison mips equals

531
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
comparison power pc is a bit of a

532
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,719
special case because the architecture

533
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:30,000
actually has a loop register which

534
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,760
counts down so you can see why the

535
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,920
compiler would generate that code

536
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,960
risk five equals comparison spark equals

537
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,480
comparison okay you've got a delay slot

538
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,239
there so you've got the store after the

539
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:41,760
branch operation because of the delay

540
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,000
slot but in every case it's actually

541
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,920
rewritten the loop from the safe bounded

542
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,920
loop into the unsafe equals comparison

543
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,199
where if you get a fault on the variable

544
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:51,760
it's just going to keep running forever

545
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,840
so there's no known version of gcc that

546
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,880
will actually compile that thing

547
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,960
correctly and there's a bonus feature in

548
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,600
gcc if you make it unsigned it looks at

549
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,800
it and said well this comparison is

550
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,159
unsigned it can never be less than zero

551
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,880
so i'll throw away that entire check so

552
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,120
it both break it first to treat it as a

553
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,400
signed variable for the equals

554
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,480
comparison which renders it useless and

555
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,600
then it treats it as an unsigned

556
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,199
variable for the actual range comparison

557
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:15,280
which also renders it useless okay what

558
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,120
about the competition

559
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,840
that's clang again equals comparison

560
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,719
um clang on arm equals comparison intel

561
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:24,480
c compiler that sort of gets it right it

562
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,080
does an unsigned comparison for the

563
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,000
signed and unsigned value

564
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,239
visual c equals comparison

565
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:32,400
um xlc which is the ibm compiler again

566
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,600
it's got account register that's a

567
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,800
special case

568
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,880
sun cc the sun compiler less than or

569
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,480
equal or less than equal unsigned it

570
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,840
actually gets it right so there exists

571
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,679
at least one compiler on at least one

572
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,320
machine which gets this correct

573
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
um so again you now need to do so this

574
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,920
is why it has to be in c because you

575
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,840
need to know what the compiler is doing

576
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,880
um

577
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,400
so you had a loop and variant inside the

578
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,000
code so inside the loop itself there's

579
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,360
another check to make sure that it's

580
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,040
within in range

581
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,719
and you know if you look at for example

582
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,639
real time control the real-time control

583
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,080
world you've got these safety standards

584
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,920
like iec electrical substation control

585
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,360
standards and they say you need to

586
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,520
compile with optimization disabled for

587
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,199
exactly this reason so you know what the

588
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:11,840
compiler is doing to your code

589
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,600
so in gcc if you disable optimization

590
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,360
does it fix things yes it does it

591
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,040
actually gets it right but the resulting

592
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,360
code is pretty bad what if you get a

593
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,960
formally verified compiler which is

594
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,719
guaranteed to produce code that has the

595
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:24,639
same semantics as the object code the

596
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:26,080
same semantics as the source code

597
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,480
there's a compiler called cert

598
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,320
which if you've used it it's developed

599
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,520
in france and it's also a very good way

600
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,800
of getting people to swear in french if

601
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,320
you've ever tried to use it

602
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,440
um

603
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,360
and that gets it right the problem is it

604
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,440
has really bad code generation so it's

605
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,880
basically the same as gcc without

606
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,600
optimization

607
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
um so okay well now we know or hope

608
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,880
we've got to the end of the loop okay

609
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,400
but what happens inside the loop body if

610
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
the fault happens inside the loop body

611
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,480
you can go through x amount of times

612
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,600
which is not the same as the amount of

613
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,560
times you're supposed to go through it

614
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,239
so for example in that code it goes to

615
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:58,320
10 if there's a fault it bails out at

616
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,080
seven and as far as that code's

617
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,920
concerned all the preconditions and post

618
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,360
conditions are met but it hasn't

619
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,760
executed it enough times

620
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,360
and this is great for glitch attacks so

621
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,120
this is a standard glitch going back at

622
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,960
least 30 years

623
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,480
you glitch password checking loops so

624
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,840
that's an example of some code to check

625
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,360
a password and it does it correctly it

626
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,880
checks every value in the password

627
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,239
rather than bailing out once you get the

628
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,000
mismatch so you can't guess the password

629
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,760
a character at a time

630
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,440
and so what you do to glitch that is

631
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,960
once you get to that last instruction

632
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,560
the branch instruction you send in two

633
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
clock pulses instead of one the program

634
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,000
counter is a simple bit of circuitry so

635
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
it steps twice the cpu is a complicated

636
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,760
bit of circuitry it steps once so

637
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,840
effectively it steps past that loop and

638
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,120
you've only got to get one character of

639
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,480
the password rather than the entire

640
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,080
password

641
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,520
there's a long history of this so this

642
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,560
is a 1990s thing called an unlooper

643
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,159
it's based on it's it's a dos-based

644
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,520
device so at least you control it via

645
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,360
dos stick a smart card in there and it

646
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,880
does a clock glitch and it breaks the

647
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,560
security of smart cards

648
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,159
today it's more likely to be voltage or

649
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,679
electromagnetic glitches or other things

650
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,760
not these things anymore

651
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,040
and you address this by using loop

652
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,560
invariants so if you've got one variable

653
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,159
accounts down and the other one that

654
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,760
sorry down and then the other one that

655
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
counts up or the other way around

656
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,239
the ratio between those two is constant

657
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,800
so you make sure that the the

658
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,400
down counter plus the up counter have a

659
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,920
constant value

660
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,120
and at that point you know that you've

661
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,560
executed the loop the correct number of

662
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,480
times and it also defeats the compiler

663
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,000
because it has to maintain that constant

664
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,840
ratio so it can't remove variables from

665
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,679
the loop

666
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,120
so now you've got this long suffering

667
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,400
loop which is there's a lot of mess

668
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,159
hidden behind this macro which is again

669
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,440
it's good in c because you can just hide

670
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
it all behind macros so now i've got a

671
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,520
loop that's basically unglitchable or

672
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,719
unfaultable i mean i'm sure there's

673
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,239
someone out there i'll figure some weird

674
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:38,719
trick to do it but uh in general it is

675
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:40,480
it is very very hard to fault or glitch

676
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,560
that loop

677
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,400
uh array bounds another example so

678
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,679
typically you go through an array and

679
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,120
there's some magic value like null or

680
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,960
minus one at the end of it what if that

681
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,639
gets corrupted and you'll blow past the

682
00:30:50,639 --> 00:30:52,560
end of the array

683
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,639
so you over allocate that by one element

684
00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:56,800
and then you have a hard bound which is

685
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,600
the

686
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,280
full size of the array if it's a static

687
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,120
sized array so for example if the null

688
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,800
or minus one if you go past that which

689
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,239
is the soft bound you then hit the hard

690
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:07,600
bound and you restart the system

691
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,520
pointers again that pointer example i

692
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,920
gave earlier

693
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,280
so you can make the loop safe you can

694
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,880
bound the loop but you still don't know

695
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,159
where those pointers are going if one of

696
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,679
those pointers is corrupted it could end

697
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,120
up going anywhere

698
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,400
so the problem is pointers are too

699
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,480
valued null is not a valid pointer

700
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,679
anything that isn't null is an

701
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:24,880
apparently valid pointer there should

702
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,199
really be tristate null a valid pointer

703
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,840
to something or not a valid pointer to

704
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,800
something so you make them scalar

705
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,280
variables um and then there's special

706
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,560
tricks with function pointers and other

707
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,360
stuff which is architecture specific

708
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,120
so basically you store a pointer and

709
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,560
it's bitwise inverse or you can

710
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,400
exclusive or with some random mask which

711
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,600
effectively encrypts the pointer if

712
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,320
you're worried about someone

713
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,199
deliberately manipulating pointer values

714
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,960
and that has to have a fixed value all

715
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,639
ones or whatever

716
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:51,920
and that will detect corruption and the

717
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,040
pointers and you've got this basic

718
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,719
building block is this pointer valid or

719
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:56,800
not so now you can say about every

720
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,000
pointer it's null it's valid or it's not

721
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,600
valid

722
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
and again you hide it all with macros

723
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,960
and so the loop becomes that so

724
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,239
basically instead of just grabbing the

725
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:07,600
pointer directly out of memory you use

726
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,639
this macro to hide the mess and if that

727
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:12,080
will that guarantees that you've always

728
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,360
got a valid pointer as you go through

729
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,560
this loop you're not going to get a wild

730
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,080
pointer pointing to some random location

731
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,920
in memory

732
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,600
booleans the same problem that's a

733
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,199
standard defined for a boolean force is

734
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:23,280
zero true is one defined but the

735
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
compiler treats anything that isn't zero

736
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,360
as true so it's basically a yes biased

737
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,880
boolean you've got one false value and

738
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,280
you've got four billion true values

739
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,960
and you know if you've got your boolean

740
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,719
doing something like eject reactor core

741
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,560
you don't really want a yes bias boolean

742
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,840
for that

743
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,639
in fact pretty much any any fault or

744
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,639
malicious overwrite of a boolean value

745
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:44,960
will make it be treated as true

746
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,480
and here's some examples of this is from

747
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,320
actual hardware faults

748
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,159
so nxp devices they have those for

749
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,560
32-bit values meaning high security and

750
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,320
anything other than those values meaning

751
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,920
no security so all you've got to do is

752
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,440
glitch one single bit through an

753
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,360
electromagnetic fault injection and it

754
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,840
disables the security on the system stms

755
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,679
stm32 has the same thing it's got a

756
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,920
16-bit value one single magic value that

757
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,320
says high security rdp we read our

758
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,560
protection level two you glitch that to

759
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,320
anything other than that one value and

760
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,440
you've dropped the security there's a

761
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,880
great video by a hardware hacker called

762
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,040
joe grand where he's um attacking a

763
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,960
trezor one hardware wallet and breaks

764
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,239
the security of that based on this

765
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:22,400
glitch attack

766
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,239
and other cpus do similar things there's

767
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:26,000
one called an efm32 which is another

768
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,080
arm-based system which mostly gets it

769
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,280
right but then you glitch it a slightly

770
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,400
different way

771
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,840
so basically for a boolean the same with

772
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,199
the pointer there should be one false

773
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:35,280
value one true value and four billion

774
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,600
invalid boolean values and again there's

775
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,199
a quote from a safety standard there

776
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:40,480
saying basically it should be stored in

777
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,239
such a way that any single double bit

778
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:44,159
fault cannot flip one value into another

779
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,639
valid value

780
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:48,080
so the way you do this and this is from

781
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,600
the previous talk on on radiation

782
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,040
induced faults that's a particular bit

783
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,320
pattern which is particularly vulnerable

784
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,000
to bit flips in memory so chances are if

785
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,360
you get a bit flip anywhere it's going

786
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,360
to affect that particular pattern

787
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,760
so you make that be true

788
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,760
and again the compiler strikes again so

789
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,520
you can't store these values in such a

790
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,719
way that the compiler can just turn it

791
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:06,320
into a meaningless comparison the

792
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,920
compiler will take that long complicated

793
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,920
magic value and say it's not zero

794
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,600
therefore it must be true

795
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,800
and in that case you've got the design

796
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,400
by contract again so at the entry to

797
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,719
that function it says this boolean has

798
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,480
the one value that's valid is true or

799
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,639
the one value that's valid is false

800
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,280
nothing else is valid

801
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,360
safe integers this is kind of a mess and

802
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,120
it's compiler specific so at the moment

803
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,239
it's still a bit of a problem this is

804
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,520
integers where you you can detect

805
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,520
overflows

806
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,040
there's not the compiler support's

807
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,320
pretty hit and miss and it's a pain to

808
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,440
deal with so it's better to just

809
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,880
explicitly use a macro to check for it

810
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,280
in advance

811
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,480
another c problem is buffer overruns um

812
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,840
this is pretty straightforward stuff you

813
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840
basically again instead of doing using

814
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,199
allocated memory directly you put a

815
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,560
cookie at the start and a cookie at the

816
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,480
end and it detects off by one errors and

817
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,000
overruns and so on

818
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,360
it's not going to take everything but it

819
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,800
will detect the most common areas of

820
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,159
writing past the end of a buffer or

821
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,679
being off by one and accessing element

822
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,520
minus one or something like that

823
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,000
control flow integrity so i mentioned

824
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,920
earlier with these preconditions you can

825
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,280
sort of guarantee that if you get a

826
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,960
while jump into code or you get used as

827
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,800
rob then it's um you know it's not going

828
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,480
to work assuming they hit that control

829
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,400
that check but what if they jump into

830
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,840
the middle of a function what if control

831
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,520
goes into the middle of a function

832
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,199
or there's just some fault and suddenly

833
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,400
the code jumps to somewhere where it

834
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,679
shouldn't be going

835
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:23,119
so what you want to do is make sure that

836
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,480
if you're calling a particular function

837
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,000
you did actually intend to call that

838
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,080
function

839
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,119
and there's a thing called bernstein

840
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,360
hashing which is just a way of

841
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,280
turning a standard ascii string into a

842
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,840
32-bit or 64-bit integer value

843
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,520
with a very low probability of collision

844
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,199
so if you've got a standard c identifier

845
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,320
or even programming a general identifier

846
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,760
you can turn that into a unique integer

847
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,920
value and this really beats up the

848
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,440
preprocessor but again this is this is

849
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,719
why it's good in c because you just get

850
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,920
the pre-processor to do all the hard

851
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,920
work for you

852
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,280
so here's an example of this you've got

853
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,960
a function shutdown reactor or reject

854
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,400
reactor core and you really don't want

855
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,080
to call into this by mistake so when you

856
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,119
call it

857
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,719
you use this hidden behind a macro this

858
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:02,400
bernstein hashing so it takes that value

859
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,800
shutdown shutdown reactor and turns it

860
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,040
into a unique 32-bit key the call

861
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,400
function then does the same thing it

862
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
checks that key so it makes effectively

863
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,920
it's like a password that's been called

864
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,840
that you pass to this function to make

865
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,360
sure that yes i really did want to shut

866
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,040
down this reactor and this isn't just a

867
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,800
wild jump into code or a wild branch

868
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,960
through code

869
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,639
you can also use it to enforce control

870
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,080
flow integrity within a function so

871
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,119
basically you're creating two

872
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,639
expressions of the control flow in the

873
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,080
code the first one is the code you've

874
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,679
actually written and the second one is

875
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,520
an explicit statement saying i intended

876
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,360
to execute these statements

877
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,800
right at the end of it you check the two

878
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,719
values and make sure they match up

879
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,239
so this is a notorious example this is

880
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,840
apple's go to fail

881
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,719
um

882
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:42,000
and as you can see there towards the

883
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,440
bottom they had they doubled up the go

884
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,119
to fail so instead of stepping through

885
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,400
all of these functions once it got to

886
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,800
that double go to fail the control flow

887
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,320
branched away from what the programmer

888
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,040
intended into something else

889
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,800
so the way they use this is you encode

890
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,639
sequence points in the code as part of

891
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,000
this

892
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,280
and at the end of it you check that all

893
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,119
those sequence points were passed and

894
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,360
again lots of preprocessor trickery um

895
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,280
i'll put the macros in the slides later

896
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,880
so in the apple case and this is a bit

897
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,400
of a you know it's an extreme case to

898
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,000
illustrate the point so basically after

899
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,600
every line of code there you've got ssl

900
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,800
free buffer and then you've got this

901
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,639
control flow integrity check saying i've

902
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:19,280
passed ssl free buffer

903
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,960
and once you get to that point the go to

904
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,480
fail it's going to miss the remaining

905
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,480
checks and so when you get to the end of

906
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,000
that that's saying i expect to have

907
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,239
passed all of these control points and

908
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:30,080
you've skipped from are you skipped

909
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,560
sha-3 show one update two and three

910
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,719
so basically that will detect that the

911
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,239
code you've written hasn't actually been

912
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,600
executed in the way you intended it to

913
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,520
be executed you then reset the system

914
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,080
and restart from a safe point um again

915
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,199
that's a bit of an extreme case

916
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,639
typically you have you know significant

917
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,000
code blocks particularly in critical

918
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,360
functions that you need to be executed

919
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,040
that you want to be executed safely

920
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,000
annotated in that way

921
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,600
you've also got to rethink your coding

922
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,880
um

923
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,159
you know how far do we need to go here

924
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,840
we need to limit exposure in time you've

925
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,000
got these safe booleans

926
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,360
and things in memory but at some point

927
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,400
you've got to take your nice safe

928
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,080
pointer that's pretty protective against

929
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,520
faults and turn it back into a standard

930
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,440
pointer so you can actually use it

931
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,400
so if you've got something that's in

932
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,920
memory for say 10 microseconds it's

933
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,000
reasonably safe against random faults

934
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
um at least if it's sitting there for 10

935
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,360
minutes you probably want to store in a

936
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,960
safe manner because you've got much

937
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,199
larger exposure there so for so you need

938
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,800
to think about data lifetimes and again

939
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,000
there's an example you sort of you're

940
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,440
sitting there with a pointer in memory

941
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,719
or a safe point of memory waiting for

942
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,600
data

943
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,119
you turn that into a standard pointer

944
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,719
that you can use you use it for a couple

945
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:30,080
of microseconds and then you store it

946
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,199
back into a safe point where it's

947
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,159
protected against faults and corruption

948
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:35,760
you also need to rethink standard coding

949
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,199
styles

950
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:38,639
where you can have errors at any point

951
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:40,639
so that's again a bit of a contrived

952
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:42,400
example

953
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,520
but you're reading a bunch of variable

954
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,040
length data so you drop a marker at the

955
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,320
start of the data you read these

956
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,679
variable length records you drop another

957
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:49,119
marker at the end the difference is how

958
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,159
much data you've read and then you

959
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,560
copied into a buffer somewhere um using

960
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,320
standard you know iftalif reads and so

961
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,560
on and it's a pretty standard pattern as

962
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,080
i said this is a simplified one just to

963
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,320
illustrate this and yet that last f read

964
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,520
you know that that succeeded because

965
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,040
you've just checked the return value so

966
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,239
you know that the f tail will also

967
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,520
succeed

968
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,360
unless there's a fault at which point

969
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,040
the f albert will return either a

970
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,480
garbage value or negative one to

971
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,400
indicate an error so even if that

972
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,920
previous call succeeded and all you're

973
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,760
doing is pulling a value out of memory

974
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
it can still the call cannot necessarily

975
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,960
succeed

976
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,239
and you've got that problem i mentioned

977
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,760
earlier where their offset goes from

978
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,159
being a simple positive value to a very

979
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:25,920
large negative value which the mem copy

980
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,920
or move or whatever then turns into an

981
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,760
overwrite

982
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,360
and this is a can never occur error you

983
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,560
can run this a million times in a

984
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,239
debugger and it won't occur because it

985
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,840
was either a random fault or an attacker

986
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,520
introduced fault

987
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,040
so it's very difficult to reproduce

988
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,159
yourself so you've got to actually

989
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,760
change the way you code and change a lot

990
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,360
of these coding patterns that you may be

991
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,960
used to

992
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,480
so basically real world systems can

993
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,400
experience faults and the nasty thing is

994
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,320
attackers can and and certainly hardware

995
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,159
hackers have been very busy helping

996
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,920
these things along and it's been going

997
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,000
on for quite some time

998
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,520
and it's not just availability but also

999
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,880
security because if you've got one

1000
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,360
single bit separating you from safe to

1001
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,800
unsafe

1002
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,239
that's a huge tempting target for an

1003
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,920
attacker and you can mitigate those

1004
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,080
effects via this one out of 1d design

1005
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,080
but then you need to fight the compiler

1006
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,000
to get it working as intended and just a

1007
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,760
side note to that if anyone's got access

1008
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,560
to any compiler that isn't gcc or clang

1009
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,840
and unfortunately a lot of the embedded

1010
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,360
systems compilers have also been turned

1011
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,960
into gcc or clang

1012
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,560
i'd love to get some of this code run on

1013
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,760
really obscure embedded systems

1014
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,280
compilers to see if they will actually

1015
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,760
generate correct code

1016
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,639
okay that's it thanks

1017
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:36,289
[Applause]

1018
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,000
blank looks

1019
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,239
no okay crickets thanks

1020
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:59,360
[Applause]

1021
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,639
sorry

1022
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:02,159
i've never

1023
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,159
met

1024
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,600
there's these really good donuts out the

1025
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,679
back in the green room

1026
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,040
you know stuck in my face

1027

cricket stop wave please like too

1028
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:27,360
consummate professional

1029

all right anyway

1030
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,080
we thought you would enjoy like a little

1031
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,760
light talk just to start the day you

1032
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,280
know something gentle

1033
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,880
easy going

1034
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,199
not 17 platforms worth of you know

1035
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,199
assembly language

1036
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:46,000
dumps and compiler optimization minutiae

1037
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,280
you never do that to you at nine o'clock

1038
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,920
in the morning where you've got a

1039
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,840
hangover sorry

1040
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,280
anyway

1041
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,440
from things

1042
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,280
that catch fire on purpose

1043
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,760
do things that catch fire by accident

1044
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,960
it's my very great pleasure to welcome

1045
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,560
the stage you may remember him from

1046
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,159
previous fires on stage

1047
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:03,910
mr jeremy start

1048
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:13,899
[Applause]

1049
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,719
hello everyone

1050
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:19,199
i'm jeremy um

1051
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:21,600
i'm a software engineer

1052
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
dead joke enthusiast

1053
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,080
um security professional you see the

1054
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,080
order is important here

1055
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,000
i help some companies with their

1056
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
security operations compliance things

1057
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,080
some cloud things blow things up as well

1058
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,440
i love to build security tools

1059
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,600
and i work on my talk until i have to

1060
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,520
walk out on stage

1061
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,880
someone called me out on the inside in

1062
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,560
physics like the other day

1063
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,320
that's true except not this time because

1064
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,760
i had to leave my laptop here so i was

1065
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,520
very nervous backstage because i

1066
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,000
couldn't work on my talk

1067
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,480
well seth security's a second thought

1068
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,320
i love this title because it's so broad

1069
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,560
it could mean anything

1070
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,800
so i hope you're strapped in for well

1071
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,199
just about anything really

1072
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:08,880
you know a couple of months ago i read

1073
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,840
the pci 4.0 spec

1074
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,280
i didn't even have a client to read it

1075
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,080
to

1076
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,679
it was very sad

1077
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:19,520
what's worse is i got excited about it

1078
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,280
yeah

1079
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,199
it's not because i wanted to win an

1080
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,960
argument no no not at all and that

1081
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,320
argument is now with myself because the

1082
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,520
other person doesn't care um

1083
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,239
well anyway pci is one of those second

1084
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:33,840
thoughts it's definitely not the first

1085
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,280
thought when you're like oh let's add

1086
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,960
credit cards to our app it's not the

1087
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,040
first thought in the developers and the

1088
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,280
marketing people the product people no

1089
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,000
no no it's it's more of a second thought

1090
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,800
thing

1091
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,920
risk and governance and compliance those

1092
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,000
are really great security second thought

1093
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,040
words

1094
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,199
and i thought so too as a developer

1095
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:54,239
you know i wanted to build the cool

1096
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,760
stuff i didn't want to do this you know

1097
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,600
boring uh

1098
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,920
what i thought was boring stuff

1099
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,360
yeah basically

1100
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,199
this is the talk about how i had to do

1101
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,719
something boring and i completely over

1102
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:06,320
engineered and did something unnecessary

1103
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,920
but

1104
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,280
anyway

1105
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,480
if there's one thought i want you to

1106
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,199
remember from this talk it is

1107
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:15,920
to remember to build a secure company

1108
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,600
not just a secure product

1109
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,840
otherwise security leaks

1110
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:29,680
yeah yeah thank you

1111
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,400
[Applause]

1112
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,760
as you can see i spent my time wisely

1113
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,560
i

1114
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,800
got way too carried away with dali mini

1115
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,679
i don't know if you've seen this like

1116
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:41,119
you give it a prompt and it generates

1117
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,440
pictures uh it takes like 90 seconds to

1118
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,800
generate it's perfect for just like

1119
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,159
doing something and just waiting and

1120
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:49,920
doing nothing else um

1121
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,520
yeah and so i'm not i'm not talking

1122
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,639
about startups you know they've got

1123
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:54,320
enough problems it's hard enough to you

1124
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,679
know build the product i'm not saying

1125
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,880
like hey where you should spend your

1126
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,639
time i'm not talking about really large

1127
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:00,400
organizations they really have to do

1128
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,320
this stuff out of necessity uh you know

1129
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,280
they're already doing the stuff or

1130
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,520
should be doing this stuff um

1131
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,719
you know

1132
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:09,840
if not just for logistics you know

1133
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,760
but uh there's a big gray area where you

1134
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,600
were small you had this cool idea your

1135
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,199
product started getting big hopefully

1136
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:16,639
really successful

1137
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:19,679
um and then at some point bam you're all

1138
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:21,280
grown up you know you've got to pay the

1139
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,440
bills go to work and you're one you're

1140
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,600
thinking how great it was back then

1141
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,719
when you didn't have all these problems

1142
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:29,199
and why didn't i invest in bitcoin at 20

1143
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:31,440
you know so i'm just going to give you

1144
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,080
some things to think about that if

1145
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,400
you're in that place of growing really

1146
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,639
quickly uh here's some things you can do

1147
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:40,719
before you'll need to do them later and

1148
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:42,320
it'll make your life so much easier

1149
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,199
later

1150
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,560
and maybe if you're already in that late

1151
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,719
stage i i'm not sure how this is gonna

1152
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:48,000
apply and how you're gonna you know

1153
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,840
maybe some cool ideas here that you can

1154
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,679
if you can make it work in a big org let

1155
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:54,000
me know

1156
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,280
so

1157
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,920
here's uh you know these first boring

1158
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,400
thoughts that i had and you can see i

1159
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,159
got really carried away in

1160
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,159
grafana and graphql and a graph database

1161
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:07,760
i really just wanted to play with graphs

1162
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,880
i didn't want to do any of that boring

1163
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,159
stuff so

1164
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:11,520
well that's what we're gonna that's what

1165
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,159
we're gonna find out

1166
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,080
first things first are you sitting on a

1167
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,800
pile of sass services you know that

1168
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,560
really heaped them on there your startup

1169
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,800
they just like this big pile of laundry

1170
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,639
of big sass products it wouldn't be

1171
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:28,880
unusual to have hundreds in your

1172
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,159
organization

1173
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:32,320
um which write them down go and find out

1174
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,600
what they are

1175
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,040
the best time to do this is during

1176
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,040
security awareness training you know so

1177
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,639
i've gone up there i've been in and i've

1178
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:40,400
told people just yell out all the

1179
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,920
services we use and i'm there on the

1180
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,679
whiteboard they're thinking oh this is

1181
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:45,199
just part of the training i'm like oh

1182
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:47,119
what did you say

1183
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,360
we've got another dropbox thing okay

1184
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,800
you're writing that oh yeah

1185
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,560
as great as a gold mine you've got to

1186
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,080
talk to everyone in the organization

1187
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,239
because they're going to have those

1188
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:58,320
services that they think everyone else

1189
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,080
knows about but it's really just the

1190
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,600
three people in the back the quarter

1191
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,159
that use that service

1192
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:05,679
and which ones are critical how do you

1193
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:07,679
define critical for your company if

1194
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:09,520
amazon stopped existing

1195
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,800
you know would your company be able to

1196
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,440
continue we all know if there's like a

1197
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,440
whiff of a slack outage that's it no

1198
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,600
more work you know gotta go get a coffee

1199
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,040
my message is taking more than five

1200
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,040
seconds to load you know that's it can't

1201
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,880
work i wasn't even using slack but you

1202
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,040
know

1203
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,760
and so for those uh critical services

1204
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,679
how would you even contact them and

1205
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:31,840
particularly those in a hurry um it's a

1206
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,360
pro tip you can figure out how to

1207
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,800
contact them before there's an incident

1208
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,840
you don't want to be finding this out on

1209
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,679
a friday night that your you know domain

1210
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:42,000
registrar doesn't have a phone number

1211
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,520
and you can't contact them until monday

1212
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,960
and even then there's no person you can

1213
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,119
talk to does like does your ceo need to

1214
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,600
tweet their ceo like that's your method

1215
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,960
of communication

1216
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,840
um

1217
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,840
are you just like a 10 a year customer

1218
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,360
to them

1219
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,040
and this is like this domain name is

1220
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,480
your entire business

1221
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,760
um

1222
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,880
what would that what would your domain

1223
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,320
registrar do if they got a bunch of

1224
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,159
automated spam complaints against your

1225
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:06,800
domain you know are they going to really

1226
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,000
do they know how to contact you

1227
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,639
and who looks after each one otherwise

1228
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,639
known as you know who can give me

1229
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:16,400
access and this is usually how there's

1230
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,840
the start you know someone's like gone

1231
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,199
through onboarding they got really fed

1232
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,239
up and they're like oh i'm gonna make

1233
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:22,400
this big list but then they on board to

1234
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,600
everything they didn't need to update it

1235
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,639
anymore

1236
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:26,159
um so it's usually three years out of

1237
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:28,719
date and in confluence somewhere in the

1238
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:32,000
depths of your wikis

1239
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,679
many of you come across um

1240
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,239
a list of service only find out you know

1241
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:37,600
these people why they're still on this

1242
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,360
there's a contractor from years ago he's

1243
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,960
still on my i still got access to this

1244
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,600
thing or have you got any mdm software

1245
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,800
where the

1246
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,960
account you know sales rep has an admin

1247
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,159
account because they gave you a demo

1248
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:50,719
that one time

1249
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,880
yeah business requirements also very

1250
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,480
important to remember why we're even

1251
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,400
using the service if you don't need it

1252
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,719
then just get rid of it but also don't

1253
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:00,320
discount things that you think people

1254
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,000
shouldn't be using find out what the

1255
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,440
actual business benefit is there could

1256
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,719
be a really good reason why you're using

1257
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:07,040
it you could consolidate some things but

1258
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,800
yeah this is a really big one

1259
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,000
that people don't think about until way

1260
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,239
too late

1261
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,800
so i have a bunch of demos let's see if

1262
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,679
they're going to work

1263
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,599
so

1264
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,639
oh pretty graph things

1265
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,920
yes

1266
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,599
so here i've just put a whole bunch of

1267
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,800
services

1268
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,040
um you know we've got these ones here

1269
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,280
these services and it looks cool there's

1270
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,880
lots of nodes this is the see this is

1271
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,119
the fun bit that i was doing right

1272
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,400
but then you when as you're doing this

1273
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,599
fun thing you discover things you're

1274
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,199
thinking hang on

1275
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:48,480
i've got the service here github and

1276
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,000
i've got these two people

1277
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,080
but two people own the service and

1278
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,719
that's very unusual and and maybe and in

1279
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:56,560
fact this person they don't even belong

1280
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,320
to a team anymore so maybe that's

1281
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,840
something i should look into

1282
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,800
um

1283
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,000
you know and you can find some really

1284
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,599
cool stuff you can look at it from a

1285
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:04,960
really big

1286
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,040
big distance and you find some reason oh

1287
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,560
it was like one of these ones over here

1288
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,639
they don't that look unusual here and

1289
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:12,000
then you can go and have a look and say

1290
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,520
oh yes there's some services with no

1291
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,639
owners

1292
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:16,080
okay so yeah we better go and check

1293
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,000
those out

1294
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,280
these kind of things are really hard to

1295
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,480
spot in a big list of stuff on the wiki

1296
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,080
here's another one we've got octa here

1297
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,800
as a service and what's owned by someone

1298
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,719
from security

1299
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:30,560
but also owned by someone from

1300
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,880
engineering so maybe that's how it was

1301
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,280
introduced and then never really you

1302
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,320
know tidied up properly

1303
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,679
so yeah there's some really cool stuff

1304
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:43,040
you can do with some graphs

1305
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,960
what are your assets

1306
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,000
next in this database you know like uh

1307
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,360
go through now you've got all these

1308
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,560
services you've got you're gonna start

1309
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,679
thinking what am i putting there you've

1310
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,520
got databases you've got employee data

1311
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,840
personal information customer data

1312
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,520
go and tag them go and they can go and

1313
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,280
annotate these things

1314
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,719
this is another good thing to do during

1315
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:08,320
the security awareness thing you know

1316
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,599
this is the next logical next thing

1317
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,880
people are like oh yeah this is great

1318
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,239
you're like oh again

1319
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:16,719
make a note of which third party service

1320
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:19,440
then supports those assets

1321
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,719
so this is what like the graph database

1322
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:24,239
this is the real power i think is this

1323
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:26,560
is the query language it's called cipher

1324
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,560
and it's a bit of a weird learning curve

1325
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,719
and you you create these relationships

1326
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:32,239
but you can it's as easy as just this

1327
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:33,599
text file that's like okay i'm going to

1328
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,599
create this relationship between amazon

1329
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,520
and it's storing this customer data or

1330
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,599
you know bamboo hr restoring my employee

1331
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,920
data

1332
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,920
of course

1333
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,040
naturally then you're going to start

1334
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,280
having to classify your data

1335
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,320
and

1336
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,239
you're going to go through this list

1337
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:53,440
and and you're going to find common

1338
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,239
pieces and this is just one of the ways

1339
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:57,599
you know one of the four different ways

1340
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,199
you could public internal confidential

1341
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,960
restricted you can start thinking about

1342
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,800
how do we use this data that's stored in

1343
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,960
these services in our company um some

1344
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,800
things do have to be public otherwise no

1345
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,080
one will know about your company and you

1346
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,239
can't send those school tweets um but

1347
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:11,920
then some things do need to be

1348
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,199
internal maybe that's your business

1349
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:15,679
processes maybe that's i know some some

1350
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:17,920
issues and an issue tracker or something

1351
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,080
confidential your employee

1352
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,560
employee records um only the people who

1353
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,000
need to know them to do their job should

1354
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,679
have access to them and then maybe

1355
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:26,719
there's some restricted stuff that you

1356
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:28,320
don't want anyone to have access to

1357
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,159
maybe that's your you know your customer

1358
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:31,760
data and a database and or something

1359
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,080
like that

1360
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,440
so now you've thought about all that

1361
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,199
data how important it is to you and

1362
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,360
which ones you really like and now

1363
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,679
imagine that they're gone you know how

1364
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:48,560
sad would you actually be if um if you

1365
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,639
lost this data and this can be a really

1366
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:53,199
fun exercise but um i'd say pace

1367
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:55,920
yourself don't get too carried away

1368
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,679
because it can be a bit heavy in one of

1369
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,199
these exercises you know someone's going

1370
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:01,760
yeah and we're going to lose our jobs

1371
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,960
and then we're going to possibly go to

1372
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,920
jail

1373
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,199
and then our customers are going to

1374
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:06,560
suffer and everyone walks out of this

1375
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,760
meeting going oh geez you know

1376
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,159
so don't get too carried away

1377
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:13,760
but do think about this stuff before it

1378
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,599
happens to you because maybe just

1379
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:16,639
thinking about it's going to have

1380
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:18,159
sparked the discussion you're going to

1381
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:19,760
talk about it amongst yourselves and

1382
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,719
you're going to say hey there's actually

1383
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:23,040
something we could do to

1384
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,639
reduce these reduce these impacts

1385
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:30,560
so we've got some more graphical graph

1386
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,920
stuff

1387
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,920
um

1388
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,159
so you can see i don't know how well you

1389
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:45,119
can see this but you've got that you've

1390
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,119
got that query right that that you're

1391
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,719
that you're asking this is this is the

1392
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:49,840
bit i really love about the graph

1393
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,239
database that you're asking a quite

1394
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:54,719
generic question but you get a very

1395
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:57,199
specific answer back so this is i'm

1396
00:53:57,199 --> 00:53:58,320
saying hey

1397
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,040
show me all of the ways i can go from a

1398
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,599
service to an impact

1399
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,040
and that impact

1400
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,840
is going to be lose company

1401
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,520
so now we can start having a look at

1402
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,719
that that's that's going to be like a

1403
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:12,480
one that we might want to have a little

1404
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,639
zoom into and see so here's our impact

1405
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:16,719
blues company in the middle and what

1406
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:21,040
have we got okay well slack why is slack

1407
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,639
could potentially cause you know lose

1408
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:24,000
company and that's maybe because it's

1409
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,520
storing database credentials

1410
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,360
right

1411
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,080
so just little facts over time

1412
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,760
um you can add these little

1413
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,360
relationships in just as you discover

1414
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,679
them oh we're storing some customers and

1415
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:39,360
you know database credentials and slack

1416
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,639
but i know that database credentials a

1417
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:43,679
loss of

1418
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:45,760
confidentiality could lead to

1419
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,280
you know lose company

1420
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,360
so that can help you prioritize some

1421
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,800
things

1422
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,080
um

1423
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,599
yeah there's some other ones in here you

1424
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,520
might not have expected and it could be

1425
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,800
something you want to run

1426
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,880
uh quite comp like all the time and just

1427
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,800
keep an idea of this picture and you can

1428
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,080
take this picture to somebody and say

1429
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,280
hey what's the problems like there's the

1430
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,639
picture of the problem and it's much

1431
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:07,760
much easier to talk about

1432
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:13,159
so

1433
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,040
let's go to the next one

1434
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,400
so look i didn't want to say it but uh

1435
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,560
once you've got this likelihood and you

1436
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,760
know you've got these threads and you've

1437
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,040
got this you've almost got this basic

1438
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,760
risk register now i'm not as one of

1439
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,920
these i'm not i don't think i'm official

1440
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,280
in this area i don't know if there's

1441
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,320
like i'm not a lawyer but for grc um but

1442
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,560
i would say if you do hire your siso and

1443
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,000
you and you get you know your security

1444
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,679
team and you've done all this stuff and

1445
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:53,920
that's what you give them uh you know

1446
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,360
it's gonna be a very different story

1447
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,960
they're gonna have a much better time

1448
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,920
you're gonna have a better time they're

1449
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,119
gonna have a better time it could be you

1450
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,239
know way way of a better start usually

1451
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:04,320
um you know the first security people

1452
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,920
into the organization are coming in at a

1453
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,719
time where it's a little bit too late

1454
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:09,920
so

1455
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,040
yeah have a think about this stuff and

1456
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,800
do it beforehand

1457
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,800
i learned from assassin once that

1458
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,880
a risk register is really just a

1459
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,560
communications tool

1460
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,239
not just to accept and sign off risks

1461
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:22,800
and things but also to show how the risk

1462
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,880
is changing over time

1463
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,119
with the investment of you know money

1464
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,800
into security from people who have the

1465
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,199
money so if you can communicate back up

1466
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:32,880
to people and say oh you spend that

1467
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,719
million dollars and here's how it's

1468
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:36,560
changed over time and in a picture i

1469
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,080
mean

1470
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,599
it is a really good it is a really

1471
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,400
visual thing to show people

1472
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,159
and i think the communication part is

1473
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:45,360
really key

1474
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,960
not just up to the execs and the people

1475
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,320
who've got the money but actually

1476
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,719
everyone needs this information

1477
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:51,920
and it's just maybe in a different

1478
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,679
context of their work

1479
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:55,599
you can imagine a developer adding a new

1480
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,040
microservice

1481
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,880
what kind of impact does similar

1482
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,040
services have what do i need to consider

1483
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,800
for the service imagine they start

1484
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,560
classifying the data before they've even

1485
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,440
worked on the project because the data

1486
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,560
is available to them and they can query

1487
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,400
it and search it and even put a cool

1488
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,719
picture in their github you know readme

1489
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:14,960
says hey yeah here's my service if you

1490
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,320
make these tools available and they're

1491
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,599
good tools and they're up to date and

1492
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,440
it's the source of truth of data then

1493
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,119
people will have no problem doing good

1494
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,440
work

1495
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,040
you know someone brings in another yet

1496
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,199
another sas product that's okay um all

1497
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:28,639
the information's there someone's gonna

1498
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:30,560
be want to add it to this graph because

1499
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,880
maybe then it appears in some you know

1500
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,679
uh

1501
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:35,119
report or something and they can say oh

1502
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,520
yes i added this in

1503
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,040
and initially maybe they just add the

1504
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,639
service that they own it

1505
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:42,400
and that's fine and over time you can

1506
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,840
add more information like does that

1507
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,840
service have a risk assessment um you

1508
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,719
know and

1509
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:48,080
have we looked at this other thing and

1510
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,159
have what's the impact of these things

1511
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:51,679
but you can just add little pieces at a

1512
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:53,040
time and not have to worry too much

1513
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,840
about you know oh before i add this new

1514
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,119
service to my you know i've got to get

1515
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,639
security sign off of this new service

1516
00:57:58,639 --> 00:57:59,599
because no one's ever going to look at

1517
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,520
it ever again but if you're constantly

1518
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,480
looking at this stuff then it doesn't

1519
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,080
matter you can do things piecewise a

1520
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,880
little bit at a time

1521
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,360
it really allows the business to assess

1522
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,920
the risk constantly so that you can take

1523
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,520
on more risk right so these

1524
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,800
opportunities out there these really big

1525
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,000
opportunities going to come with some

1526
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,480
risk if someone can quickly say oh

1527
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,960
actually we you know we do have a lot of

1528
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,880
this high-risk data that we're storing

1529
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,480
in all these places already maybe adding

1530
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,320
another one's not such a good idea or

1531
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,920
maybe we don't and maybe we can take on

1532
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,400
this really risky service um but it's

1533
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,239
and it's only because they have the data

1534
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:34,320
that they can have a look at and and

1535
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,280
make the decisions from

1536
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,639
you can also use this graph tool

1537
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:44,239
as a way to communicate

1538
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:45,760
and help you actually get some controls

1539
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,080
in place it's much much easier to

1540
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,960
explain why you need mfa when you've

1541
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,040
connected it to an impact and then like

1542
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,480
the set of assets and you can say oh

1543
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,360
well

1544
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,960
all this data that's going to lead to

1545
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,880
loss of company loss of sales loss of

1546
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,080
data

1547
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,520
that's the one that we're protecting and

1548
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,119
so we can actually show you which ones

1549
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,080
need the extra controls in place

1550
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,679
and then you can even alert when you

1551
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:10,800
have a new service that is impacted that

1552
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,719
doesn't have mfa and you can alert with

1553
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:15,800
a picture

1554
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,679
so this real next part is that's that

1555
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,760
really brings people in is the

1556
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,000
automation side um

1557
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,280
and i've realized you can't just give

1558
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,719
everyone access to

1559
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:28,960
write these cipher queries i think it's

1560
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,960
similar to putting an sql database just

1561
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,880
on the internet um

1562
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,719
and relying on like the table access

1563
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:35,760
controls

1564
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,159
i don't think it's a good idea at all

1565
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:39,679
you can have similar access controls in

1566
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:41,440
the cipher database but

1567
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,599
that's not a good idea so i i that's

1568
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,199
where i've started adding in

1569
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:48,000
graphql

1570
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,560
even though the graph is in the name

1571
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,840
actually doesn't mean it needs to have a

1572
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,679
graph database behind it at all it's

1573
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:56,800
really just an interface

1574
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,639
description of your api

1575
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:00,960
and you create a schema so you say

1576
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,560
here's the type of data i'm storing in

1577
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,199
my api and here's how i can query it

1578
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:06,639
and then it does a whole lot of the

1579
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:09,119
input validation output validation the

1580
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,199
type checking you can have required

1581
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:12,480
fields and you can do all this neat

1582
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,840
stuff with it

1583
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,199
so it's really just a way to say here's

1584
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:17,119
the way i'm expecting people to use my

1585
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,360
api and then they can query it

1586
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,440
themselves you also get

1587
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,280
quite a nice little

1588
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,800
ui that you can query from

1589
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,960
so you get like this graph playground

1590
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,080
you may have seen something like this

1591
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,719
before this is what the query looks like

1592
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:39,199
and you actually just you query

1593
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:41,040
and you tell it the format and structure

1594
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,119
of the information you want and then all

1595
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:44,560
that data validate the input validation

1596
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,719
happens and then it goes off and

1597
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,560
gets the data from your data source and

1598
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,719
then returns it so you can see here i've

1599
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:52,480
i'm running my person query and i'm

1600
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,880
getting back all of the people

1601
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,520
from my graph

1602
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,159
so you might also

1603
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:01,599
wonder how that actually connects to the

1604
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,080
back end there's a really cute

1605
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,159
library that makes this kind of nice is

1606
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:07,679
there's there's that cipher query again

1607
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:09,840
but now it's in this resolver for the

1608
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,080
graphql bit so this is really all that

1609
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,400
was required now i haven't actually pen

1610
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,599
tested this or anything so there's

1611
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,199
probably more lines that need to go in

1612
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:19,520
there um but this is the start right

1613
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,800
this is you're saying okay i want to

1614
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,639
actually control who can who can query

1615
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:24,000
this data and what the type of query you

1616
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,280
can run is

1617
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,040
and where the parameters are going to go

1618
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,560
and then i can have my access control

1619
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,320
but it's just really to enable everyone

1620
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,639
in the company to access this data as

1621
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:34,239
much as possible and when you're

1622
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:37,119
connecting it to graphql then it

1623
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,639
actually enables you to use other tools

1624
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:39,760
as well

1625
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,840
um because graphql is

1626
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,679
kind of a standard tool that have that

1627
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:45,840
other things have a lot of plugins for

1628
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,880
for example um grafana

1629
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,960
also has graph in the name as part of my

1630
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,119
that's kind of why i chose it really but

1631
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:57,280
it also was a nice dashboarding tool and

1632
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,199
so this is a an open source tool that

1633
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:01,280
you can use to graph metrics and things

1634
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,119
but with a plugin it can query data from

1635
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,000
a graphql database so you might have

1636
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,920
and even had this cool you know graph

1637
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,239
view so you might imagine that your

1638
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:13,920
specific query where it's saying hey

1639
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,000
show me all of the services that have no

1640
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,639
owners or show me the impacts that could

1641
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:20,719
lead to this you know certain kind of

1642
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:23,199
financial loss or reputational loss um i

1643
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:24,960
want to make that as a dashboard so i

1644
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,639
can just have it and have a look every

1645
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:29,679
now and then and see what the

1646
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,840
what my environment looks like

1647
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,560
um i think i have some more

1648
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,920
bits as well so

1649
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,440
if you wanted to add some data into this

1650
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,599
you you'd use one of these mutations and

1651
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,199
here's here's i'm just

1652
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:50,719
running this query where i'm saying okay

1653
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:52,880
we're going to create this person um add

1654
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,400
them in and then i'm going to get this

1655
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,320
person back as a result

1656
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,320
and so you run that and you get here's

1657
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,560
the result from the um from the graph

1658
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,239
database now that should be in there i

1659
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:05,199
think if i if all went well

1660
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:06,639
uh i might see

1661
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:08,560
myself appear here

1662
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,080
oh yeah there we go

1663
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,440
there's the second one that i just added

1664
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,480
in

1665
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,800
so that's a really nice part of it if

1666
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,159
you're adding like oh how do people

1667
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:18,880
actually consume this without having to

1668
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,080
you know docker

1669
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,040
uh

1670
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,080
outdated docker and compose up

1671
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,679
i was very suspicious my docker needs

1672
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:28,400
updating and

1673
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,000
i haven't done it before the talk yet

1674
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,040
and

1675
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,159
i'm a bit scared actually

1676
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,760
so

1677
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,760
the other thing i've got is

1678
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,239
how many of you um

1679
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:43,760
have seen in environments where the

1680
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,000
endpoints are completely unmanaged right

1681
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:46,960
like you

1682
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,520
you go into an org and they say well

1683
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,119
well what we did is we told people to

1684
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,480
here's five thousand dollars go out and

1685
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,560
buy a laptop as long as you do the work

1686
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,360
you know we want you to be happy

1687
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,360
people come back with like rgb laptops

1688
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,679
that can hover and all that and

1689
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:03,040
and then you've got you know but you

1690
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,880
just got no idea what everyone's using

1691
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,639
and half the people using windows

1692
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:09,599
halfway using um you know mac os and the

1693
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:10,719
other half you didn't know about are

1694
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:12,140
using linux so

1695
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,000
[Music]

1696
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,599
and i've been in an organization where

1697
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,320
you're like okay they had a anti-virus

1698
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,239
software but they just couldn't report

1699
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:22,000
basic things like what's the patch level

1700
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,320
of of windows you know what's the what

1701
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:28,000
version what major version am i on

1702
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,800
so

1703
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,000
things like that if you don't have that

1704
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
visibility to start with how can you

1705
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,159
even begin doing other things you know

1706
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:36,000
there's some new you know you can follow

1707
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,679
the news it's like oh new windows zero

1708
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:39,520
day great

1709
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,599
are we affected by that you know

1710
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,360
i don't know

1711
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,679
so but then you can also go to too far

1712
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:47,599
too quickly and go well we need mdm we

1713
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:48,400
need to

1714
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,679
manage these endpoints with some

1715
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:51,679
automated stuff and yeah we're going to

1716
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,480
pay 60 000 dollars a year and get it's

1717
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,119
going to be great for it team you know

1718
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,280
already under resourced now have to

1719
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,440
automate everyone's stuff for them you

1720
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,719
know and you don't even know why you're

1721
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,560
automating it you're not really sure

1722
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,800
what problem you're solving you could do

1723
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,560
this much more efficiently if you just

1724
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:10,000
said well actually all i really wanted

1725
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,239
to know was what version of windows you

1726
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:14,159
had and what version of firefox or

1727
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:16,400
chrome you're using so maybe that's just

1728
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,639
what you do install a little tool and

1729
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:20,560
ryan's helped me write a rus tool to to

1730
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,800
do this where i go and collect

1731
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,560
okay all it collects is

1732
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,000
what version of windows what version of

1733
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,520
browser you got and then it could post

1734
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,840
this back into the graph database

1735
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,920
so

1736
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,400
i don't have the rust demo going and

1737
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,079
i was considering it doing it last night

1738
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,119
but that was a bad idea

1739
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,400
but i do have a curl combined that that

1740
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,639
is just about as good

1741
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:46,960
so you can see

1742
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,800
and in fact it could actually be curl on

1743
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,719
some on like curl with a cron job like

1744
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:52,480
why does it have to be anything too

1745
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,000
fancy you know all you want to do is

1746
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
record you know which user has what

1747
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,440
operating system and what version and

1748
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,800
then you can decide later on what you

1749
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,239
want to do about that because when

1750
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:01,280
you're small you could just go and ask

1751
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,960
them you say hey you need to update a

1752
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,000
machine

1753
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,159
you know and that's much easier than

1754
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:08,880
um oh relinquish control of your laptops

1755
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,719
to someone who's now got you know admin

1756
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:12,480
privileges and it's like why is this why

1757
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,880
i'm doing this again

1758
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,239
so you could just do a a graphql request

1759
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,760
and so here i've registered oh yeah i've

1760
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,239
registered this endpoint um

1761
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:23,440
you know

1762
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,760
with with this graph database and then

1763
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,520
you might want to say okay so one of the

1764
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,040
queries i might want to add and add it

1765
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,440
to graphql to my grafana dashboard as

1766
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,800
well what operating systems are being

1767
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,840
used

1768
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,599
by different people

1769
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,520
and so now we're actually

1770
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,440
traveling away from like there's no

1771
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,079
graph component of this this is just but

1772
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:43,760
behind it there's a graph database if i

1773
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:49,079
showed you what that endpoint looks like

1774
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,920
i don't think we have i know what we're

1775
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,400
gonna do we'll add um

1776
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,239
we'll add bonnie and

1777
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:13,719
bonnie could register

1778
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,960
coming up with test data is really um

1779
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,639
difficult especially coming with a whole

1780
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:20,079
bunch of names so i'm going to just grab

1781
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,079
like the friends list of names their

1782
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,360
character names

1783
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,800
um

1784
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,599
to do all this and then um just it's not

1785
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,599
so i have a bunch of friends in my fake

1786
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,159
company but

1787
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,119
so now we should have um

1788
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:40,520
operating system used by bonnie and

1789
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,719
yeah no yeah

1790
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:47,199
and then if i went to query that with my

1791
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:50,199
graphql

1792
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,560
so here's bonnie

1793
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,320
and you might say okay bonnie is a

1794
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,400
member of engineering

1795
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,199
and

1796
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,440
or they actually registered an endpoint

1797
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,840
and that endpoint

1798
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,639
has

1799
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:10,480
a version of windows on it that you can

1800
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,480
go and inspect the version of

1801
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,920
what's really strange here is actually

1802
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,599
kiki also registered that endpoint so

1803
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,359
that would be a really good query to add

1804
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,960
i'd only change the name so they've

1805
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,960
somehow got the same endpoint

1806
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,399
and but that's a real situation that can

1807
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,078
happen where maybe someone takes over

1808
01:08:24,078 --> 01:08:25,760
your laptop but you might want to go and

1809
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,040
make sure that

1810
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,800
was this endpoint not wiped why has it

1811
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,479
got the same you know id as the last one

1812
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,078
yeah and why is that why is that

1813
01:08:34,078 --> 01:08:36,719
interesting to know what version of

1814
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,960
you know windows bonnie's running well

1815
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,760
maybe bonnie's actually trying to access

1816
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,439
amazon you know and i already know

1817
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,520
how the ways in which amazon can lead to

1818
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,599
lose company

1819
01:08:49,599 --> 01:08:51,679
and but through this query to say okay

1820
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:53,840
well if bonnie is accessing a service

1821
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,359
that has a really important impact like

1822
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:57,520
this um i actually want to make sure

1823
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,279
that their version of windows is up to

1824
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:00,078
date

1825
01:09:00,078 --> 01:09:02,960
and now that can be my query to run when

1826
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,040
i'm giving them access to this

1827
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,719
and it's a generic query it doesn't

1828
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:09,040
really matter what the impact was you

1829
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,520
know or what the service was

1830
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,040
just because you gave it

1831
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,960
these little pieces of data over time

1832
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,238
now you suddenly have this really

1833
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:18,319
powerful query to say oh they're

1834
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:19,840
actually out of date

1835
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,760
and maybe you would give them um you

1836
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,520
know seven days to update their machine

1837
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,800
otherwise they're going to lose access

1838
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,880
to the service that they want to use

1839
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,078
but now they're going to understand that

1840
01:09:28,078 --> 01:09:29,279
they can understand why they need to

1841
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:30,639
update their machine so they can keep

1842
01:09:30,639 --> 01:09:32,319
logging into the thing you know they're

1843
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:33,599
gonna

1844
01:09:33,599 --> 01:09:35,279
you can imagine the alternative when

1845
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:36,560
seven days passes and they go to the

1846
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,920
security team and say i've been locked

1847
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:38,639
out

1848
01:09:38,639 --> 01:09:40,479
and the security team goes ah was the

1849
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,639
notification not working oh no no it was

1850
01:09:42,639 --> 01:09:43,920
working

1851
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,679
okay so did the update network well i

1852
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:48,158
just no i just didn't do it you know

1853
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:50,000
that's so much harder to do now because

1854
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
you know in advance you know why and you

1855
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,760
know the impact and it's been explained

1856
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,280
to you this is why because you're

1857
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,560
accessing an important service that

1858
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,480
stores the starter that has this impact

1859
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,159
that's why we're requiring you to have

1860
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,960
an up-to-date machine

1861
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,840
and you can go even further and

1862
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,360
i want to what i want to throw into this

1863
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,040
is like the um

1864
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,679
the osv.dev i saw earlier which was like

1865
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:13,199
the you know the

1866
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:15,440
current vulnerability information you

1867
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,719
can imagine if

1868
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,320
maybe there's a zero day for windows

1869
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,159
currently in the wild so that impact

1870
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,159
that likelihood of that impact goes to

1871
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:23,679
you know certain

1872
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:25,760
or maybe very likely

1873
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,599
um and then you don't even give them

1874
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:29,280
seven days right it's like well okay

1875
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,480
well hang on you're trying to access the

1876
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,520
service you've got an out-of-date

1877
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,440
machine and there's a zero day in the

1878
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,360
wild that we've added to the graph so

1879
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,639
actually you're going to not have access

1880
01:10:36,639 --> 01:10:38,880
at all uh we need to fix this first we

1881
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,639
need to make sure that you know we're

1882
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,320
not affected before you can keep

1883
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,480
accessing the

1884
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,560
services that lead to

1885
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,360
the sad times

1886
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,839
so

1887
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,840
so really coming back to um you know

1888
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,079
remember to build the secure company not

1889
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:08,000
just secure product and then we're going

1890
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,360
to end up with

1891
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,320
security patch patch cabin patch cabbage

1892
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,719
patches

1893
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,040
yeah

1894
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,639
they look cool i like the pictures i've

1895
01:11:22,639 --> 01:11:24,480
read this there was like i also tried an

1896
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,599
eye patch

1897
01:11:25,599 --> 01:11:27,119
and it came out a bit weird you got to

1898
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:29,520
get very specific with these prompts

1899
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,040
if you go and play with this stuff

1900
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,119
if you want to try it out there's

1901
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:37,920
there's the repo and you can see it's

1902
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,440
not it's not a fully fledged sas

1903
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,639
application but it's more just a

1904
01:11:40,639 --> 01:11:42,480
collection of ideas maybe you can use

1905
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,400
those to to generate to build this

1906
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,800
yourself and your own organization um so

1907
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,079
you can have a play with the graph stuff

1908
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:49,840
and you can use docker if you're still

1909
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,800
brave enough to do that

1910
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:55,199
why is it called leaks well i just name

1911
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,440
all my projects after vegetables

1912
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,520
to avoid the problem of not starting

1913
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,639
anything because i can't think of a good

1914
01:12:00,639 --> 01:12:01,520
name

1915
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,199
and then

1916
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:07,760
leaks kind of just really fit i suppose

1917
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,480
um so yeah thank you to a couple people

1918
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,079
who helped me with my slides and my

1919
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:13,520
presentation

1920
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,840
um this was one of my favorite outputs

1921
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,840
of the uh

1922
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,000
you know dali there's the pla there's

1923
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,400
the playground that i used i had to give

1924
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,800
google extra money to run jeep to warm

1925
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,560
up some gpu somewhere

1926
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,079
so um

1927
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:29,040
yeah

1928
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:33,360
but this yeah p's in the seas with eyes

1929
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:36,400
oh yeah thank you

1930
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,400
look i hit my queue this time

1931
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,560
not not out the back eating donuts uh

1932
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,199
thank you much jeremy

1933
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,480
now

1934
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,760
i grew up

1935
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,199
uh in

1936
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:57,040
the 80s virus scene that was my kind of

1937
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,639
introduction to

1938
01:12:58,639 --> 01:13:01,199
um to what ended up being hacking what

1939
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,199
ended up being my career

1940
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,000
i

1941
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,800
infected my mother's computer with

1942
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,800
a virus dark avenger from sofia bulgaria

1943
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,840
and

1944
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,119
that caused me some grief as you can

1945
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:14,560
imagine anyway so i became quite

1946
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,480
interested in virus i used to collect

1947
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,960
them like i have a home i have a box of

1948
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,960
uh five and a quarter inch disks you

1949
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,719
know with caught in the wild pakistani

1950
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:25,520
brain and dark avenger and uh cascade

1951
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,199
and all of that is stoned

1952
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,719
written

1953
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:30,000
several hundred meters from this very

1954
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,840
place um

1955
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,079
and so that was you know my my gateway

1956
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:35,840
into this sort of thing and then

1957
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,000
i guess i never really thought about the

1958
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,840
other sort of virus

1959
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,679
the pandemic sort because that's the

1960
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:43,599
thing that happened in the old days so

1961
01:13:43,599 --> 01:13:45,119
we're in a strange time

1962
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:46,480
and

1963
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,840
you know that the analogy between

1964
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,000
computer viruses and biologic viruses

1965
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,040
you know does have a bunch of

1966
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,480
interesting points now

1967
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,840
our next speaker

1968
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,079
has been involved in instant response in

1969
01:13:56,079 --> 01:13:58,560
in both capacities and

1970
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,840
perhaps there really are some things to

1971
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,199
learn so it's my great pleasure to

1972
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,540
introduce to you izzy

1973
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:10,880
[Applause]

1974
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,480
kyoto koto

1975
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,360
uh and uh as you can probably guess and

1976
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,040
from that introduction

1977
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,920
uh this talk will extensively cover the

1978
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,840
covert 19 pandemic

1979
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,440
now i get that this is the first time

1980
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,920
we've ever kind of attended an in-person

1981
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,360
conference during this pandemic

1982
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,119
environment and if it's all feeling a

1983
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:31,440
bit much for you i totally get it go

1984
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,440
grab a coffee we can chat in the break

1985
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:37,119
and i promise i'll sanitize it for you

1986
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:41,199
but hello i'm izzy comms lady about town

1987
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,840
and i specialize in helping people and

1988
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,320
companies talk about their cybers rogue

1989
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,679
or otherwise

1990
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,679
i honed my trade with several years

1991
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,360
building a national search

1992
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,360
and now i'm out helping other people

1993
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,840
talking about computers and since i'm a

1994
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,960
free agent i can say swears on stage

1995
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,280
this presentation brings together the

1996
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,760
two great career loves of my life

1997
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,920
health communications and cyber security

1998
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,440
communications

1999
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,159
and these things have so much in common

2000
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,560
so today i want to share with you the

2001
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,199
why and the how and give you some things

2002
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:18,000
that you can take away to maybe

2003
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
uh learn something

2004
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,360
something that you can use from the

2005
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:24,079
covert 19 hellscape

2006
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:26,800
so cast your mind back to the before

2007
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,840
times long before covert

2008
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,960
uh before we wore masks and bumped

2009
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,320
elbows

2010
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,719
before the nation had assert in fact i

2011
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,199
was a health communicator i talked about

2012
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,520
how to keep people safe from flu and

2013
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,920
what hospital capacity was like

2014
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,079
and i gave out patient status updates

2015
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:47,840
like she's in a serious but stable

2016
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,679
condition in the intensive care unit

2017
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,400
with complete earnest

2018
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,000
and i learned to be an incident

2019
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,079
responder and i worked on the health

2020
01:15:56,079 --> 01:15:58,639
response to the christchurch earthquakes

2021
01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:00,400
and i once got to watch a helicopter

2022
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,719
full of ppe clad people land on a

2023
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:06,000
disused helipad during an ebola outbreak

2024
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,599
uh

2025
01:16:07,599 --> 01:16:10,320
and then life moved on and i discovered

2026
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,880
cyber security and you find folk but i i

2027
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,040
never forgot my roots in health

2028
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,599
which is where i honed my trade

2029
01:16:17,599 --> 01:16:19,760
in fact one of my most used resources

2030
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,079
even now when teaching people how to

2031
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:24,480
respond to cyber security incidents as a

2032
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,239
battered old copy of a world health

2033
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,800
organization handbook on effective media

2034
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,280
communications in a public health crisis

2035
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,359
and then like an analogy that would make

2036
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:35,519
sense at this point in the talk

2037
01:16:35,519 --> 01:16:38,240
we had covert and everyone suddenly knew

2038
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,639
about things like viral load and genome

2039
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:41,920
sequencing

2040
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,920
and the experts that it was my job to

2041
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,000
fight on the internet about password

2042
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,359
entropy was suddenly epidemiologists

2043
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,679
so how do these things even relate is

2044
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:54,719
see

2045
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:57,519
well i think there's four really key uh

2046
01:16:57,519 --> 01:17:00,559
components of both a true virus and a

2047
01:17:00,559 --> 01:17:02,960
computer virus responding to those types

2048
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,519
of incidents that we can really uh take

2049
01:17:05,519 --> 01:17:07,920
away so the first one is we're operating

2050
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,639
in this constantly evolving situation

2051
01:17:10,639 --> 01:17:12,960
new information is coming to hand all

2052
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,559
the time

2053
01:17:14,559 --> 01:17:15,840
secondly

2054
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,160
there's lots of uh people in the general

2055
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,559
public or potentially in our user base

2056
01:17:20,559 --> 01:17:22,399
who just think that they're they're

2057
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:25,120
immune to it in one way or another it

2058
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,359
simply won't happen to me and so there's

2059
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:29,920
a real barrier to overcome with everyday

2060
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,760
folks

2061
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,080
thirdly there is so much information

2062
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,719
around the information overload is truly

2063
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:39,120
real and discerning what's real and

2064
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,960
what's dodgy

2065
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,359
is much more challenging

2066
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:45,120
and of course the fourth thing the thing

2067
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,160
that i care most about is people

2068
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,000
people are at the center of what we do

2069
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,519
they're at the center

2070
01:17:51,519 --> 01:17:53,519
of a health crisis if we didn't have

2071
01:17:53,519 --> 01:17:54,479
people

2072
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:57,200
we wouldn't have anything to do

2073
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,399
and of course

2074
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,319
comms why i'm here right

2075
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:02,639
so we've got to understand people and

2076
01:18:02,639 --> 01:18:04,559
issues because without knowing our

2077
01:18:04,559 --> 01:18:07,040
audience and knowing our subject matter

2078
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,359
we can't overcome them

2079
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:11,840
now when i was planning this talk i

2080
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,800
looked through lots of media interviews

2081
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,519
lots of press conferences we're all very

2082
01:18:17,519 --> 01:18:18,639
familiar with the press conference

2083
01:18:18,639 --> 01:18:20,960
machine now of course and i found this

2084
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,439
fantastic

2085
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:26,000
uh dr michael j ryan he works for the

2086
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,639
world health organization he's irish so

2087
01:18:28,639 --> 01:18:31,040
he has an amazing accent and he is the

2088
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,679
most quotable person i found throughout

2089
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:35,040
and he said some

2090
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,719
really poignant things that i think

2091
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:39,760
really relate to the work that we do

2092
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,479
and

2093
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:41,920
the first one that i'd like to share is

2094
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:42,960
this one

2095
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,319
be fast have no regrets you must be the

2096
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:49,280
first mover the virus will always get

2097
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,519
you if you don't move quickly and you

2098
01:18:51,519 --> 01:18:53,920
need to be prepared

2099
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,240
now this is all about german gloom right

2100
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,040
so

2101
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,639
what can we do well fortunately heaps

2102
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:03,120
put simply everything can be a learning

2103
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,399
experience

2104
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:06,960
the more we can open our eyes to finding

2105
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,359
out what we can take from other maybe

2106
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:11,920
even vaguely related disciplines

2107
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,319
the better prepared we'll be for the

2108
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:16,160
time when it's something in our

2109
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,639
wheelhouse going pear-shaped

2110
01:19:18,639 --> 01:19:20,800
now of course there is the oft-used

2111
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,599
quote from winston churchill never waste

2112
01:19:23,599 --> 01:19:26,080
a good crisis or unfortunately for

2113
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,399
everyone i've ever worked with me just

2114
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:30,639
constantly all the time during an

2115
01:19:30,639 --> 01:19:32,080
instant response

2116
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:32,960
but

2117
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,359
from this crisis i've got four key

2118
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:37,599
things that i think we can learn

2119
01:19:37,599 --> 01:19:40,559
so the first one nothing's set in stone

2120
01:19:40,559 --> 01:19:43,519
so you can always change direction

2121
01:19:43,519 --> 01:19:45,439
during your response if something isn't

2122
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:47,599
working

2123
01:19:47,599 --> 01:19:50,000
here's my old mate again

2124
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,479
if you need to be right before you move

2125
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:54,240
you will never win

2126
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,399
perfection is the enemy of the good when

2127
01:19:56,399 --> 01:19:58,640
it comes to emergency management

2128
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,840
speed trumps

2129
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,760
perfection so really this boils down to

2130
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,439
do the thing

2131
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:07,200
when we're in the midst of an incident

2132
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,000
it can be really easy to get stuck in

2133
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,359
the detail

2134
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:14,720
to start analyzing the true technical

2135
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:17,200
nature of an incident and that's awesome

2136
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,359
and interesting for us

2137
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:21,520
but less awesome and interesting for

2138
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,520
other everyday folk who might be

2139
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,920
impacted so if you're that kind of

2140
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,880
person that's cool but find someone in

2141
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,520
your team who's ready to act and ready

2142
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,160
to move so that they can take the helm

2143
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:37,040
an incident controller if you will

2144
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,040
so when we think about this in terms of

2145
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,040
the new zealand response in terms of

2146
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,439
changing direction you'll remember the

2147
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:47,120
early days 2020 what a banger

2148
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,439
where masks you know were a thing

2149
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:51,280
constantly asked about and in fact the

2150
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,359
new zealand response to masks kind of

2151
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:54,960
hilariously looking out into this crowd

2152
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:55,760
was

2153
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,280
yeah now

2154
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,920
and scanning you know keeping track of

2155
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,160
your movements through an app of which

2156
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,880
we acquired many was kind of a oh

2157
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,359
possibly maybe but maybe

2158
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:08,640
i don't know i'm sure you'll remember

2159
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:12,000
it'll be fine but miq was a sorry

2160
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,760
everyone yeah no we've got to stick with

2161
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:17,280
miq miq is the long-term solution to

2162
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,600
this problem

2163
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,520
let's click forward to delta

2164
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,319
suddenly masks yes yes all the time what

2165
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:28,560
does your one look like n95 kn 94 fabric

2166
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,319
we're sewing them it's amazing

2167
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:32,080
everyone's got a new hobby

2168
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,560
the direction changed but the way that

2169
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,720
direction changed was using evidence

2170
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:39,280
using insight using the experience of

2171
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,439
our overseas partners

2172
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:43,520
scanning scanning became the center of

2173
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,600
our universes we all installed that

2174
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,520
little ios trick where you could tap the

2175
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,319
back of your phone it was a core part of

2176
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:52,800
our response because we had so few cases

2177
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,560
in the community we learned that

2178
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,880
tracking and tracing was the way to get

2179
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,720
that moving forward to keep our

2180
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,399
community safe

2181
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:03,040
and then miq well miq

2182
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,120
you know not everyone's darling was

2183
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,240
suddenly

2184
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,280
gone burgers it was out of here because

2185
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,120
our the environment that we were

2186
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,720
operating in had changed

2187
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,240
so when we think about changing

2188
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,920
direction in cyber incidents i'm sure

2189
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,160
you'll all remember this old fella

2190
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,920
so wannacrobe was the first cyber

2191
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,160
incident i ever worked on which holy

2192
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,479
mama that was a baptism by fire

2193
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:29,520
um and when we were responding to this

2194
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:30,800
incident a couple of my former

2195
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,319
colleagues in this room

2196
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:34,880
uh a couple of scared little monkeys as

2197
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,680
we have been described um we had a bunch

2198
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,760
of evidence right wannacry for new

2199
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,000
zealanders happened overnight so we had

2200
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,520
this evidence from our international

2201
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,600
partners saying hey look it could be

2202
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,600
this windows vulnerability but we also

2203
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,760
have some evidence that there is

2204
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,080
propagation through phishing

2205
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,880
and so we shared this information

2206
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,600
and then as the time evolved as things

2207
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,479
moved on we discovered that actually the

2208
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:03,040
fishing thing was not a thing

2209
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,760
so

2210
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,800
we

2211
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,520
owned our decision we changed our advice

2212
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,080
we had to field a few oias but in the

2213
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,399
end changing the direction was the right

2214
01:23:12,399 --> 01:23:14,319
thing to do because it gave new

2215
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:16,960
zealanders the right information to stay

2216
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,800
safe from the virus

2217
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,600
because the right pivot is worth the

2218
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,760
pushback that doesn't mean it's going to

2219
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:26,880
be easy

2220
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,439
but it is worth doing

2221
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:31,520
because when you're the person when

2222
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,200
you're the man in the arena in the arena

2223
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,120
so to speak

2224
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,600
it can feel pretty overwhelming being

2225
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,439
the one giving the advice the one

2226
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:41,760
changing the direction

2227
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,760
but that direction change it can show

2228
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,399
humility it shows vulnerability

2229
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:50,319
and it can be the right thing to do

2230
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,720
the second thing is getting back to

2231
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,640
basics right

2232
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,680
and

2233
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,840
when i think about basics i think about

2234
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,319
simple easy to understand and easy to

2235
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:02,479
action advice because no one ever

2236
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:04,399
complained that something was too easy

2237
01:24:04,399 --> 01:24:05,920
to understand

2238
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,560
so while we may want all the detail

2239
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,960
every last piece of information

2240
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,520
in fact for some people that is just not

2241
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,359
going to work for people who don't

2242
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:17,439
operate in our environment it's much

2243
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:20,240
more challenging in fact and so

2244
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:22,080
making sure that the things we need

2245
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,399
people to do are clear simple and

2246
01:24:24,399 --> 01:24:28,000
actionable are critical

2247
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,720
so a great example of this is the

2248
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,720
wonderful national game of go home stay

2249
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:33,680
home

2250
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,319
uh march 2020 saw us all go into

2251
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:37,680
lockdown

2252
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,240
but we saw compliance from

2253
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,399
pretty much 5 million new zealanders

2254
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:45,760
with the stay home save lives message it

2255
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,760
was clear it was simple and it was

2256
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,200
actionable

2257
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,600
similarly look a quote from someone else

2258
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,160
uh was hand washing

2259
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,080
hand washing is both an amazing

2260
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,640
mitigation to the virus but also a

2261
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,760
simple thing that people can do

2262
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,240
so you're giving people a simple

2263
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:05,920
understandable action that they can

2264
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,600
undertake that's actually going to make

2265
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,399
a difference for them

2266
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:13,120
so when we're taking uh security

2267
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,439
information taking it back to basics

2268
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:17,600
there are four key things to remember

2269
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,680
the first thing is use familiar language

2270
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,080
to make it real so think about how you

2271
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,960
can boil down your advice into simple

2272
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,359
clear familiar language

2273
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:29,359
now once upon a time when i ran the

2274
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:31,200
search twitter account i used to get a

2275
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,960
bit of grief because i would always say

2276
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,880
this information is easy enough for your

2277
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,800
mum to do it now

2278
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,520
some people took that as as an insult

2279
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,000
that mothers were not intelligent but

2280
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,840
i'm thinking about my mum

2281
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,080
my mom is a senior leader she's highly

2282
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,479
educated she's a chief executive i'm not

2283
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:50,560
thinking about dumbing it down i'm

2284
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,640
thinking about bringing someone new into

2285
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,640
our universe

2286
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,800
the second thing is make it actionable

2287
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,439
give people something they can do or in

2288
01:25:59,439 --> 01:26:00,880
the case of the air new zealand example

2289
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,120
that nadia gave yesterday but give them

2290
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,479
a clear nothing to do

2291
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:08,000
number three

2292
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,800
if in doubt tell a story

2293
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,880
storytelling is part of what's what

2294
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,720
makes us human

2295
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,800
by telling people a story that they're

2296
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,760
familiar with we can make them uh and

2297
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,040
make make it easier for them to

2298
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,880
understand what we are trying to get

2299
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,640
across to them

2300
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:27,439
and number four no well actually this is

2301
01:26:27,439 --> 01:26:29,920
not a time for perfect information this

2302
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:33,120
is not a time to debate the ins and outs

2303
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,280
of password entropy

2304
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,680
this is a time to help people do the

2305
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:40,000
thing that they need to do

2306
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,920
to help them be safer

2307
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
now sometimes basics aren't going to

2308
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:46,960
work

2309
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,120
but technical information

2310
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:52,000
can be for everyone

2311
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,840
so there will be

2312
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,399
instances where you simply need to wade

2313
01:26:56,399 --> 01:26:57,439
into

2314
01:26:57,439 --> 01:26:59,359
technical language and technical

2315
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:00,479
concepts

2316
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:03,439
but doing so in a way that is empathetic

2317
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:05,520
that is caring to the people we're

2318
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,319
communicating with will give you a much

2319
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:10,000
better outcome

2320
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:10,800
for

2321
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,520
uh the the actions that you want them to

2322
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,600
take

2323
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,840
so a great example of this during the

2324
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,479
covert 19 pandemic was of course

2325
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:23,280
everyone's favorite five-star rated show

2326
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,040
the 1pm update

2327
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,160
uh keeping people up-to-date daily

2328
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,960
giving them a mechanism to understand

2329
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,120
technical concepts gave them an

2330
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,520
opportunity to build their knowledge

2331
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,920
gradually over time

2332
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,560
because what we were entering was

2333
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,880
unprecedented times

2334
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,160
and so being able to present experts

2335
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,399
and very senior people

2336
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:51,280
telling a cohesive easy to understand

2337
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,240
story while explaining technical detail

2338
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:56,720
brought new zealanders on a journey to

2339
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:00,640
be more safe from the virus

2340
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:03,359
and the new zealand response

2341
01:28:03,359 --> 01:28:06,000
to both locking down and responding to

2342
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,800
covid has been internationally lauded

2343
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:09,920
for the way

2344
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,640
that we were communicated with i think

2345
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,720
many of us in this room

2346
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,800
are incredibly fortunate to have lived

2347
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,960
through the the pandemic lockdown here

2348
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,200
in new zealand because we didn't know

2349
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,880
what everyone else was experiencing we

2350
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,359
only got to experience this really

2351
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:28,000
world-leading communications response

2352
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,800
so the way potent for instance that the

2353
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,760
prime minister talked to us about how we

2354
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,920
were going to enter lockdown

2355
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:41,040
was very clear concise and decisive

2356
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,600
but sometimes you need to think about

2357
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,760
maybe an alternative

2358
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,280
method for communicating this

2359
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,439
information to people sometimes people

2360
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:51,760
need more information sometimes they

2361
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,760
prefer to read information as opposed to

2362
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,800
it being spoken to them and so the other

2363
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,120
great example of this is

2364
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,840
the covert 19 alert level summary we all

2365
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,600
got one in our post box we saw them

2366
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,520
everywhere they were up in the office if

2367
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,439
you had the fortune slash misfortune of

2368
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:09,439
going in there during lockdown but

2369
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:11,280
whenever you needed to know

2370
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,920
what information was required what steps

2371
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,000
were required for you to take

2372
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
during the

2373
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,240
different levels of lockdown

2374
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,680
the alert level framework and the

2375
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:24,720
information provided by the covert 19

2376
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:27,600
group was incredibly useful to help

2377
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,200
people

2378
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,359
know the detail if they wanted to get

2379
01:29:31,359 --> 01:29:33,840
into it

2380
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,080
and of course i couldn't talk about

2381
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,560
making technical information clear

2382
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,359
without mentioning the amazing work from

2383
01:29:41,359 --> 01:29:44,319
toby morris and susie wiles uh the the

2384
01:29:44,319 --> 01:29:46,479
media work that they undertook with

2385
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:49,680
these cartoons this is an example of how

2386
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:53,520
an mrna vaccine works

2387
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,319
was

2388
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:56,479
amazing it has been replicated around

2389
01:29:56,479 --> 01:29:59,840
the world the who are using these

2390
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,479
but we had the opportunity to have these

2391
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:05,120
very complex subjects you know i don't

2392
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,600
think that five years ago many people in

2393
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,680
this room would have been able to

2394
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:11,359
understand that the inner workings of an

2395
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:13,600
mrna vaccine and it's its various

2396
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,920
benefits over any other type of vaccine

2397
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,240
suddenly though we've had these very

2398
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,000
compassionate people

2399
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,479
speak to us about

2400
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:26,720
how these complicated things work

2401
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,560
so then how do we apply this to our

2402
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,319
world

2403
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:34,880
well when simplifying isn't going to cut

2404
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,280
it i can't tell you which bits to

2405
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,280
include or not include

2406
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:42,479
every situation will be different

2407
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:45,040
but what i can advise is when we're in

2408
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,399
this situation

2409
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:48,479
bring these three things so bring

2410
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:50,800
empathy for your audience

2411
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,200
i know we've all experienced things

2412
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,479
where we're not the expert in our uh in

2413
01:30:56,479 --> 01:30:58,000
the thing that's being explained to us

2414
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,960
right and so having someone explain

2415
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,120
something complicated to you with

2416
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,840
empathy and with kindness

2417
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,160
is always going to give you as the the

2418
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:11,280
audience a better outcome

2419
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,520
number two transparency this is

2420
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,640
something that nadia spoke about

2421
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,000
yesterday it's something i will always

2422
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,200
endorse tell as much as you can

2423
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,880
because the more information we're

2424
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,840
sharing

2425
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,479
the more likely we will be a collective

2426
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,960
to respond to an incident

2427
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,200
bring people on the journey with you and

2428
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,000
do it by telling them the truth

2429
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,960
and third expertise make sure that your

2430
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,720
information is right

2431
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,840
now this sounds a bit obvious but

2432
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,439
unfortunately it's actually very

2433
01:31:41,439 --> 01:31:42,880
challenging to do

2434
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,399
particularly when we think about

2435
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:47,840
security there are so many opinions

2436
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,920
and so finding a way to cut through the

2437
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,000
noise and make sure that we're giving

2438
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,720
the right information for this situation

2439
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,560
to make sure that people can recover

2440
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:00,479
effectively is really critical

2441
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:04,000
the last thing that i want to cover is

2442
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,080
we're not always going to get it right

2443
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,760
right not everyone got everything right

2444
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,479
and in the covert 19 response not

2445
01:32:10,479 --> 01:32:12,479
everyone will get everything right when

2446
01:32:12,479 --> 01:32:16,640
responding to a security incident

2447
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:18,479
and

2448
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:21,520
when my old mate dr ryan was asked

2449
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,640
about

2450
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,479
which country is doing worst at

2451
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:27,040
responding to covert 19.

2452
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,960
this is what he said

2453
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,120
we're trying to identify the best

2454
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:34,160
lessons we can all use the best way to

2455
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:36,800
move forward together

2456
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,439
no one has done perfectly and no one has

2457
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:41,920
made all the mistakes we share all of

2458
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,920
the errors together

2459
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,920
and i think that as a community this is

2460
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,240
a really critical point right

2461
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:49,840
you don't want to be

2462
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,760
the one responding to an incident and

2463
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,640
having your peers critique you

2464
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:58,720
online internally wherever it may be

2465
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:02,560
what we need to do is is band together

2466
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,240
support each other

2467
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,319
make sure that when someone is having a

2468
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:09,200
tough time responding to an incident

2469
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,600
that we're helping them that we are

2470
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,720
giving them our expertise to help them

2471
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:17,120
recover more effectively

2472
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:18,240
so then

2473
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:20,399
in light of this i've got four key

2474
01:33:20,399 --> 01:33:22,640
things that are

2475
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:25,439
maybe things we could learn from uh as

2476
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:28,319
we go through this

2477
01:33:28,319 --> 01:33:31,040
the first one is eat your own dog food

2478
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,680
so if you are talking the talk if you

2479
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:35,520
are saying hey the thing that you need

2480
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,120
to do is have

2481
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,359
20 character passwords while you've got

2482
01:33:39,359 --> 01:33:42,000
middens123 sitting on your machine you

2483
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,439
know it's probably

2484
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:46,319
not the way to go or if

2485
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:48,560
just hypothetically

2486
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,960
you're the minister of health

2487
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,880
and you go to the beach

2488
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,760
during a level four lockdown

2489
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,240
that's probably not a great look but you

2490
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:00,240
know just hypothetically of course of

2491
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:03,240
course

2492
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:05,040
number two

2493
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,520
you're better than click carefully

2494
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:11,439
don't give people advice

2495
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:13,420
click

2496
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:16,700
[Applause]

2497
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:20,720
what does click carefully even mean

2498
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:23,040
so give people something that they can

2499
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,720
do something with

2500
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:27,040
if you can't tell them you'll come back

2501
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,680
to them don't give them something to do

2502
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,760
like in the early days of the pandemic

2503
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,640
when we were told not to touch our faces

2504
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:36,560
if you ever tried to not touch your face

2505
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,319
it's almost impossible

2506
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:40,720
instead give them something meaningful

2507
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,960
and actionable that they can do or leave

2508
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,840
them alone

2509
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:47,920
number three

2510
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,399
the industry will consume itself and i

2511
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:52,319
alluded to this earlier

2512
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:53,520
but

2513
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:56,319
now is a time to love each other

2514
01:34:56,319 --> 01:34:59,120
this is not a time to criticize the

2515
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,200
response publicly

2516
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:04,000
through uh public channels on twitter

2517
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,160
have a big fight get yourself a hashtag

2518
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:07,840
maybe make a logo

2519
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,280
this is a time

2520
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,760
to come together and share that advice

2521
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:12,560
to

2522
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,800
to commiserate to send a coffee run to

2523
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,560
your friends who you know are having a

2524
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:17,920
terrible day

2525
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,760
because otherwise

2526
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,920
we'll never get through this we must

2527
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,720
come together

2528
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:28,080
and fourth haters gonna hate

2529
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,240
sometimes people are just gonna hate

2530
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:32,640
your response that's okay

2531
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,600
because um i'm sure all of us could name

2532
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:39,200
a pseudo expert who's probably got views

2533
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,840
on the response that you've undertaken

2534
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,680
but at the end of the day if we're

2535
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:46,800
supporting each other as much as we can

2536
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,960
that is the best thing we can do

2537
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,200
and also you know maybe like

2538
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,720
do what you can to take those people off

2539
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:56,080
twitter because they're a nightmare

2540
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,439
so then

2541
01:35:57,439 --> 01:35:59,439
there was a lot of information right

2542
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:00,800
like this is

2543
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,960
this is a lot to take home

2544
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,520
so then to finish up i just wanted to

2545
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,600
take give you three points if you

2546
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,600
remember nothing else this is the one to

2547
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,200
take a picture of

2548
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,120
what do we do about it

2549
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:15,600
so the first thing to remember when

2550
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,160
responding to an incident particularly

2551
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:22,240
when speaking to others is to be humble

2552
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:25,280
remember that remember how it feels to

2553
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,560
not be an expert in something

2554
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,399
and give people the advice that you

2555
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:32,960
would want in that situation

2556
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,200
that kindness that humbleness that

2557
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,399
empathy

2558
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:38,720
that's what's going to give you the best

2559
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,240
outcome it's what what's going to give

2560
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:42,880
you buy-in from the people that you're

2561
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,800
speaking to

2562
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,560
number two use analogies analogies will

2563
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,800
be the thing that saves us when talking

2564
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,600
to everyday folk about security

2565
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,840
the thing we talk about is incredibly

2566
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:58,080
complex for everyday folk

2567
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:58,880
so

2568
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,560
liken it to something that people are

2569
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:01,920
familiar with

2570
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,680
something maybe

2571
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,359
like a pandemic

2572
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:07,520
we've all lived through this so think

2573
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,359
about how we can take the lessons we've

2574
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:11,920
learned from something like covert to

2575
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,240
tell a story about security incident

2576
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,000
response

2577
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,280
and lastly

2578
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:18,800
know your audience

2579
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,960
think about who you're talking to

2580
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,680
really consider who they are as people

2581
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:26,240
the other demands that they have on them

2582
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,800
and what they need this isn't about

2583
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,399
dumbing it down

2584
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:32,240
if you're dumbing it down you're doing

2585
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:35,520
it wrong instead we're making meaning

2586
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,760
for people who don't understand quite

2587
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,840
what we're talking about

2588
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,960
and so

2589
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,720
that's it

2590
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:43,760
thank you

2591
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:47,840
and uh let's check

2592
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:57,280
thanks very much izzy

2593
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,040
i think nearly all of us

2594
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,560
you know in this room who work in

2595
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,880
security who aspire to work in security

2596
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,600
you know understand that our role really

2597
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,840
is explaining and communicating our

2598
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,359
expertise

2599
01:38:09,359 --> 01:38:10,960
to everybody else in this world who is

2600
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,479
forced to live in this technological

2601
01:38:12,479 --> 01:38:14,640
nightmare that we've built for them um

2602
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,479
so having

2603
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:18,080
like content like that having something

2604
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:19,040
that really

2605
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,120
you know that we have seen what instant

2606
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:23,120
response looks like on a on a global

2607
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:24,720
scale on a national scale and getting

2608
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,000
that kind of expertise and understanding

2609
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,399
what that means for how we practice our

2610
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:29,920
craft i mean if you want to be a pen

2611
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:30,960
tester

2612
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,800
50 of your job is

2613
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,720
looking at terrible ssl certificates and

2614
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,319
alert ones and the other 50 is

2615
01:38:36,319 --> 01:38:37,439
explaining all the things that actually

2616
01:38:37,439 --> 01:38:38,640
do matter

2617
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:39,520
through the business and to the

2618
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,439
customers so

2619
01:38:41,439 --> 01:38:43,520
it's really great to have

2620
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:46,960
you know such a level of experience in

2621
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:49,040
explaining very very complicated issues

2622
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,640
to a very very wide range of people so i

2623
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:52,560
hope you found that useful so

2624
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,319

so that service that apparently i

2636
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,160
provide uh i don't know what my life is

2637
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,920
anymore but anyway thank you very much

2638
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,200
and we'll see you back get a cup of

2639
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:23,040
coffee remember to wear your mask around

2640
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:27,399
the venue and we'll see you soon

2641
02:18:42,959 --> 02:18:45,959
foreign

2642
02:20:53,439 --> 02:20:55,279
welcome back

2643
02:20:55,279 --> 02:20:58,399
now when we first started kiwi con

2644
02:20:58,399 --> 02:20:59,200
um

2645
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:00,640
we all thought that we were like super

2646
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:02,160
underground badass hackers when in fact

2647
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:03,520
we all had jobs

2648
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:05,520
and you know some of us mortgages and

2649
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:06,720
children we have a lot more children

2650
02:21:06,720 --> 02:21:08,000
than we did in cubicon one there's been

2651
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,600
quite a lot of quite a lot of

2652
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:11,680
procreation since then um

2653
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:13,359
but anyway we thought we were a badass

2654
02:21:13,359 --> 02:21:15,120
you know we thought that we were you

2655
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:17,840
know we were underground hacking the man

2656
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:18,880
uh

2657
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:20,880
and yeah we're all like sold out shelves

2658
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:22,479
anyway we had plenty of talks about

2659
02:21:22,479 --> 02:21:23,920
attacking and very few about defending

2660
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:24,880
back then because we thought you know

2661
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:27,200
that's not what you know we're badasses

2662
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:29,439
we want to attack stuff uh and it turns

2663
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:30,960
out that

2664
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:32,160
uh a

2665
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:34,399
all of the defense that we did 10 years

2666
02:21:34,399 --> 02:21:36,640
ago 15 years ago didn't matter anyway

2667
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:38,479
because didn't work

2668
02:21:38,479 --> 02:21:40,239
and b we didn't want to think about that

2669
02:21:40,239 --> 02:21:41,600
because we were just busy having fun

2670
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:42,720
right the computers didn't matter

2671
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:45,120
security didn't matter firewalls didn't

2672
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:47,120
really work vpns totally gets you owned

2673
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:48,960
these days and we spent all those years

2674
02:21:48,960 --> 02:21:50,560
telling you you had to use your like

2675
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:53,040
nasty palo alto that drops java 1.6 on

2676
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:55,680
you so that you can vpn for security

2677
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:56,720
um

2678
02:21:56,720 --> 02:21:58,720
but now the world's different right now

2679
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:00,399
the world has

2680
02:22:00,399 --> 02:22:02,319
you know computers matter and security

2681
02:22:02,319 --> 02:22:04,800
matters and our hospitals stop working

2682
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:07,439
because of stupid vpn tech or whatever

2683
02:22:07,439 --> 02:22:09,439
else we sold them you know in the mid

2684
02:22:09,439 --> 02:22:11,840
2000s because security didn't have to

2685
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:13,520
work then there was no pressure that

2686
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:15,520
security had to work then we could just

2687
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:17,040
do what we liked

2688
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:18,960
turned out it was a terrible idea anyway

2689
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:20,479
where i'm going with this

2690
02:22:20,479 --> 02:22:22,560
is that we now attempt to have some at

2691
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:24,800
least slightly defensive talks

2692
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:27,200
on the schedule and so on that subject

2693
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:29,520
uh it is my pleasure uh to welcome the

2694
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:31,800
stage

2695
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:39,590
[Applause]

2696
02:22:44,479 --> 02:22:47,120
kieran good morning thanks adam

2697
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:49,359
thank you for joining me today

2698
02:22:49,359 --> 02:22:52,160
to talk about security operations and

2699
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:53,600
why i think

2700
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:55,520
it should be a lot simpler than some of

2701
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:57,520
us make it out to be

2702
02:22:57,520 --> 02:22:59,520
so to adam's point we've spent a fair

2703
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:01,200
chunk of this conference talking about

2704
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:02,800
you know breaking into networks and

2705
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:04,080
hacking things

2706
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:06,080
um but then there is kind of this other

2707
02:23:06,080 --> 02:23:09,279
side to our industry who and and you

2708
02:23:09,279 --> 02:23:11,359
know we focus on defending our networks

2709
02:23:11,359 --> 02:23:13,520
right like how do we make sure the bad

2710
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:15,600
folks don't break in and you know steal

2711
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:17,520
the data and do the damages and things

2712
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:19,600
like that so

2713
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:21,279
the goal today is to spend a bit of time

2714
02:23:21,279 --> 02:23:22,720
thinking about that

2715
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:24,319
um you know so if you're if you're kind

2716
02:23:24,319 --> 02:23:25,920
of looking at all the talks and going

2717
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:28,720
there's no hope everything's broken um

2718
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:30,399
i'm just going to quit my job and take

2719
02:23:30,399 --> 02:23:32,080
up farming or something like that you

2720
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:33,600
know i'm here to give you some hope

2721
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:35,840
today

2722
02:23:36,080 --> 02:23:38,880
so my name is astrid i think i live in

2723
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:40,880
melbourne australia and it's great to be

2724
02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:43,439
back in kiwiland after the after the

2725
02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:45,520
lockdowns and whatnot

2726
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:47,920
um i'm a principal security specialist

2727
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:49,439
at elastic

2728
02:23:49,439 --> 02:23:51,040
some of you may have heard us from

2729
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:53,120
projects like elasticsearch and cabana

2730
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:56,080
full disclosure my employer does

2731
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:58,720
build and sell a security solution but

2732
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:00,319
rest assured this talk is going to be

2733
02:24:00,319 --> 02:24:03,600
completely vendor agnostic

2734
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:05,359
um my job is to work with customers

2735
02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:06,239
across

2736
02:24:06,239 --> 02:24:08,880
australia new zealand um primarily kind

2737
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:11,120
of helping them observe and understand

2738
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:13,359
their ip environments

2739
02:24:13,359 --> 02:24:15,520
and from that observability

2740
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:17,279
what i can generally then do is help

2741
02:24:17,279 --> 02:24:19,600
them build thread detection prevention

2742
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:22,399
response type capabilities

2743
02:24:22,399 --> 02:24:24,000
and you know the whole goal is to defend

2744
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,560
themselves from cyber attack i also

2745
02:24:26,560 --> 02:24:29,040
recently published a book

2746
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:30,319
it's called getting started with the

2747
02:24:30,319 --> 02:24:32,800
elastic stack eight it focuses on making

2748
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:35,279
it as easy as possible for folks to

2749
02:24:35,279 --> 02:24:37,040
learn and use elasticsearch combine and

2750
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:38,560
all the technologies around it for

2751
02:24:38,560 --> 02:24:40,319
things like search and observability and

2752
02:24:40,319 --> 02:24:42,239
security and so forth

2753
02:24:42,239 --> 02:24:43,040
i

2754
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:44,800
started off life

2755
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:46,960
as a software engineer

2756
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:49,279
and then turned into a guy that does the

2757
02:24:49,279 --> 02:24:51,680
cyber things

2758
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:53,680
my first job in security was really

2759
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:56,160
working with a group of analysts to help

2760
02:24:56,160 --> 02:24:57,920
them do their job a lot more effectively

2761
02:24:57,920 --> 02:24:59,120
right like give them the tools

2762
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:01,359
technologies to help them be successful

2763
02:25:01,359 --> 02:25:03,840
so it's kind of like a long time spent

2764
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:06,720
in building security capability for

2765
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:09,359
defense

2766
02:25:09,359 --> 02:25:11,359
before we get started though i just want

2767
02:25:11,359 --> 02:25:14,720
to quickly gauge the audience here

2768
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:17,200
who here works on defending their

2769
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:18,640
environments if i can get a show of

2770
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:21,039
hands

2771
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:22,560
so about

2772
02:25:22,560 --> 02:25:25,600
30 30 percent of the audience

2773
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:27,120
do we have any security analysts in the

2774
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:29,920
room like folks who work in a sock use

2775
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:31,920
tools like sim

2776
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:34,000
endpoint detection software things along

2777
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,600
those lines

2778
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:38,239
okay so about 20-ish percent

2779
02:25:38,239 --> 02:25:40,479
maybe

2780
02:25:40,560 --> 02:25:42,720
that's really good so good audience i'll

2781
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:44,319
you know there's there's no kind of like

2782
02:25:44,319 --> 02:25:46,080
in-depth terminology or anything like

2783
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:47,600
that the goal here is to keep things as

2784
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:49,040
simple as possible and give you give

2785
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:50,800
your folks a bit of food for thought as

2786
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:54,640
you as you go go away from this

2787
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:56,399
so

2788
02:25:56,399 --> 02:25:58,160
i think it's good to kind of start this

2789
02:25:58,160 --> 02:25:59,920
talk by framing

2790
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:01,840
the conversation

2791
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:04,960
with a few trends and stats

2792
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:08,080
the first trend is that our environments

2793
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:10,319
are more complicated than ever before

2794
02:26:10,319 --> 02:26:11,600
today

2795
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:14,800
there's just way more data than most

2796
02:26:14,800 --> 02:26:17,040
security teams can collect

2797
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:19,200
so i've put on the references here by

2798
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:20,560
the way so you can go and have a have a

2799
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:22,239
look at the stories behind some of these

2800
02:26:22,239 --> 02:26:24,800
stats but by 2025

2801
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:28,399
predicted worldwide data growth is 175

2802
02:26:28,399 --> 02:26:30,560
zettabytes like that's just you know

2803
02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:33,120
mind-boggling volumes of data i think i

2804
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:35,680
read somewhere that in the next three to

2805
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:37,200
four years the world is going to

2806
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:38,399
generate

2807
02:26:38,399 --> 02:26:40,000
as much data

2808
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,600
as

2809
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:44,399
all as all the data we had five years

2810
02:26:44,399 --> 02:26:45,439
ago

2811
02:26:45,439 --> 02:26:47,040
that's how much

2812
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:49,359
volumes and data are growing

2813
02:26:49,359 --> 02:26:51,120
now i want you to think about when

2814
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:52,399
you're building your defensive

2815
02:26:52,399 --> 02:26:54,560
capabilities how much of the data that

2816
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:56,479
you generate as an organization do you

2817
02:26:56,479 --> 02:26:58,640
actually end up using for your use cases

2818
02:26:58,640 --> 02:27:00,800
so just keep that in mind the other

2819
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:03,920
trend is and i mean a few of the stats

2820
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:05,200
on average

2821
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:08,560
we use about 288 applications to do our

2822
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:09,600
jobs

2823
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:11,120
think about when you log into your

2824
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:13,120
single sign-on portal or octa or what

2825
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:14,960
have you just think just

2826
02:27:14,960 --> 02:27:16,640
think about how many applications like

2827
02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:18,720
how many new applications you see pop up

2828
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:21,600
there on a daily basis

2829
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:24,080
those applications are not only

2830
02:27:24,080 --> 02:27:26,640
increasing the attack surface in size

2831
02:27:26,640 --> 02:27:28,319
but it's also the depth of the attack

2832
02:27:28,319 --> 02:27:30,640
surface so once someone gets in through

2833
02:27:30,640 --> 02:27:33,359
one of those applications they have more

2834
02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:35,920
space to hide once they get in which is

2835
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:38,399
you know pretty pretty scary to think

2836
02:27:38,399 --> 02:27:40,080
about especially if you think about the

2837
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:42,800
number of these applications 64 of the

2838
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:44,319
organizations

2839
02:27:44,319 --> 02:27:46,160
that were part of this survey are also

2840
02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:48,319
looking at multi-cloud adoption

2841
02:27:48,319 --> 02:27:50,399
so as if a single cloud digital

2842
02:27:50,399 --> 02:27:52,800
transformation wasn't complicated enough

2843
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:54,479
we're looking at now doing that across

2844
02:27:54,479 --> 02:27:56,399
multiple cloud providers

2845
02:27:56,399 --> 02:27:59,600
and 95 percent of our peers that were

2846
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:01,359
interviewed expressed some sort of

2847
02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:03,279
concern around cloud security at their

2848
02:28:03,279 --> 02:28:05,680
organization which is not a great place

2849
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:09,279
to be right if you think about it

2850
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:11,359
the second trend

2851
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:13,040
that i wanted to highlight

2852
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:15,040
is while we have that complexity around

2853
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:17,520
data and transformation and all that

2854
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:20,080
adversaries are extremely motivated to

2855
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:21,760
accomplish their missions

2856
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:24,239
so expected global cost of cyber crime

2857
02:28:24,239 --> 02:28:27,279
by 2025 10 and a half trillion us

2858
02:28:27,279 --> 02:28:28,479
dollars

2859
02:28:28,479 --> 02:28:30,880
like that's just crazy

2860
02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:34,239
70 percent of attacks using malware that

2861
02:28:34,239 --> 02:28:36,800
leverage zero days zero days attacks

2862
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:38,960
that are vulnerabilities

2863
02:28:38,960 --> 02:28:40,560
attacks that use vulnerabilities that

2864
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:42,479
are unknown to the vendor or to the

2865
02:28:42,479 --> 02:28:44,160
community

2866
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:46,160
the average cost of cyber incident in

2867
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:47,279
australia

2868
02:28:47,279 --> 02:28:49,600
6.8 million dollars

2869
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:51,680
i'm sure new zealand is somewhere on

2870
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:54,479
around the same ballpark figure

2871
02:28:54,479 --> 02:28:57,359
and there's a 26 increase in the cost of

2872
02:28:57,359 --> 02:29:00,560
a cyber incident since 2016.

2873
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:02,720
so what i'm trying to get at here is you

2874
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:04,319
know on the one hand you've got the

2875
02:29:04,319 --> 02:29:06,239
complexities of defending your

2876
02:29:06,239 --> 02:29:08,319
organization on the other hand there's

2877
02:29:08,319 --> 02:29:09,200
this

2878
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:10,880
motivation and there's this whole

2879
02:29:10,880 --> 02:29:12,080
industry

2880
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:15,120
um that's built around taking advantage

2881
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:17,120
of that complexity and you know of all

2882
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:18,880
the all the issues that we have as

2883
02:29:18,880 --> 02:29:21,839
defenders

2884
02:29:22,399 --> 02:29:24,640
it's also worth understanding

2885
02:29:24,640 --> 02:29:27,040
what the state of secops is today so

2886
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:28,960
what what are the problems right like i

2887
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:30,319
mean it's easy to talk about the

2888
02:29:30,319 --> 02:29:31,600
challenges but

2889
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:33,760
how how much of a problem do we have in

2890
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:36,880
being able to do our jobs

2891
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:38,479
eighty percent of companies that had a

2892
02:29:38,479 --> 02:29:39,680
cloud breach

2893
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:41,680
in the last 18 months

2894
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:44,080
reported that the breach was due to poor

2895
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:46,239
high poor cloud visibility especially

2896
02:29:46,239 --> 02:29:47,760
across hybrid cloud

2897
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:49,279
so you know that transformation thing i

2898
02:29:49,279 --> 02:29:50,640
talked about and how people are going on

2899
02:29:50,640 --> 02:29:51,840
all these different cloud providers

2900
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:53,279
based on what those providers are good

2901
02:29:53,279 --> 02:29:54,239
at

2902
02:29:54,239 --> 02:29:56,080
it's it's uh it's starting to give us a

2903
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:58,080
lot of grief

2904
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:01,120
90 of it leaders also said that having

2905
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:03,920
silos of data right so having your you

2906
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:06,319
know itops data sitting separate to your

2907
02:30:06,319 --> 02:30:08,560
security audit trails which are which is

2908
02:30:08,560 --> 02:30:10,160
then sending separately to your endpoint

2909
02:30:10,160 --> 02:30:11,520
telemetry

2910
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:13,680
it's hindering security

2911
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:15,439
efforts and also innovation across the

2912
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:17,840
company

2913
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:21,120
on average we use 49 security tools

2914
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:22,640
to do our job

2915
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:25,040
and alert fatigue is still not improving

2916
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:26,960
right because all these tools

2917
02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:29,359
say things that are not working and we

2918
02:30:29,359 --> 02:30:30,800
just don't have enough people to go and

2919
02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:32,080
look at them

2920
02:30:32,080 --> 02:30:34,319
and there's 93

2921
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:36,239
of the alerts that are being generated

2922
02:30:36,239 --> 02:30:38,640
that are not being dealt with on the

2923
02:30:38,640 --> 02:30:40,800
same day if you work in a sock you can

2924
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:42,800
probably relate to this right like

2925
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:43,920
you're you're probably looking at all

2926
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:46,000
your alerts going yeah i don't trust the

2927
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
tool that's broken that's a false

2928
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,520
positive i'm just not going to deal with

2929
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:51,680
it and also you've got other priorities

2930
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:53,600
so you know there's no humanly possible

2931
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:55,120
way of going and dealing with with them

2932
02:30:55,120 --> 02:30:56,880
all

2933
02:30:56,880 --> 02:31:00,399
so what do we do

2934
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:04,800
look

2935
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:06,960
the solution here is

2936
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:08,800
not to buy more tools

2937
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:10,479
i know it's very easy i know it's very

2938
02:31:10,479 --> 02:31:13,359
tempting our security folks love working

2939
02:31:13,359 --> 02:31:16,239
with shiny tools

2940
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:21,040
thank you

2941
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:23,279
but the solution is to not go and buy

2942
02:31:23,279 --> 02:31:25,439
just another tool another point solution

2943
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:26,880
to go and address go and fix your

2944
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:28,479
problem right you're kind of to take a

2945
02:31:28,479 --> 02:31:30,160
bit of a step back and you know start

2946
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:32,080
thinking about what you actually want

2947
02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:33,120
what what do you actually want to

2948
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:34,640
achieve when you're looking at all this

2949
02:31:34,640 --> 02:31:36,640
complexity all this

2950
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:37,520
you know

2951
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:39,279
this problem space in your in your

2952
02:31:39,279 --> 02:31:41,439
organization

2953
02:31:41,439 --> 02:31:43,279
so what do we actually want

2954
02:31:43,279 --> 02:31:45,200
i think this is the wrong slide we

2955
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:47,040
definitely don't want to be binging our

2956
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:50,160
favorite tv show instead of working

2957
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:52,000
what we actually want

2958
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:53,600
and this by the way i don't think has

2959
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:55,600
changed for a very long time

2960
02:31:55,600 --> 02:31:57,439
um but what we actually want is we want

2961
02:31:57,439 --> 02:31:58,800
to reduce

2962
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:00,319
the dwell time

2963
02:32:00,319 --> 02:32:03,520
that attackers have in our organization

2964
02:32:03,520 --> 02:32:05,439
and you know the associated damage that

2965
02:32:05,439 --> 02:32:07,120
comes with it i think that's that's a

2966
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:08,479
fair statement that's pretty obvious

2967
02:32:08,479 --> 02:32:09,840
right like the last thing like if

2968
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:11,040
someone managed to break into your

2969
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:13,279
network the most important thing that

2970
02:32:13,279 --> 02:32:14,800
you want to do is kick them out as soon

2971
02:32:14,800 --> 02:32:17,679
as you possibly can

2972
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:19,760
the second thing we want

2973
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:23,359
is we want to improve our ability

2974
02:32:23,359 --> 02:32:25,600
to respond and remediate

2975
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:26,880
right

2976
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:29,279
when we find out that something bad has

2977
02:32:29,279 --> 02:32:31,120
happened

2978
02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:33,200
we actually want to take some effective

2979
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:34,880
response actions you know the last thing

2980
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:36,160
we want to do is apply a blunt

2981
02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:38,880
instrument across across the environment

2982
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:40,560
we want to do something targeted we want

2983
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:41,920
to do something effective and we want to

2984
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:43,760
do it in a way that we're not

2985
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:45,920
hindering the business and we're not

2986
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:47,600
pissing off

2987
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:49,200
you know the stakeholders

2988
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:51,279
that give us money to buy shiny toys

2989
02:32:51,279 --> 02:32:54,319
when we do buy shiny toys

2990
02:32:54,319 --> 02:32:55,920
and the third thing is we want to have

2991
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:57,040
more

2992
02:32:57,040 --> 02:33:00,080
smart and informed investigations

2993
02:33:00,080 --> 02:33:02,479
right a lot of people in security talk

2994
02:33:02,479 --> 02:33:03,680
about the

2995
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:06,399
needle in the haystack and so forth

2996
02:33:06,399 --> 02:33:08,000
but the last thing anyone wants to do is

2997
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,239
just dive into a haystack not knowing

2998
02:33:10,239 --> 02:33:11,439
what the hell they're doing or what

2999
02:33:11,439 --> 02:33:12,880
they're looking for and you know what

3000
02:33:12,880 --> 02:33:14,319
the needle looks like right what you

3001
02:33:14,319 --> 02:33:16,000
actually want to do is you want the tool

3002
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:16,720
to

3003
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:18,399
you want to use technology and you want

3004
02:33:18,399 --> 02:33:20,160
to use everything that you have at your

3005
02:33:20,160 --> 02:33:23,600
disposal tools and data and so forth to

3006
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:25,200
tell you what you should be looking for

3007
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:26,319
and to guide you through that

3008
02:33:26,319 --> 02:33:27,920
investigation because as a human you

3009
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:30,880
want to apply your you know intelligence

3010
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:32,479
understanding and contextualizing a

3011
02:33:32,479 --> 02:33:34,479
threat not necessarily just looking for

3012
02:33:34,479 --> 02:33:38,160
things aimlessly going down rabbit holes

3013
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:40,319
so

3014
02:33:40,319 --> 02:33:44,239
what does that mean for your sock

3015
02:33:44,800 --> 02:33:47,120
so this list that i've got here is kind

3016
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:48,239
of a

3017
02:33:48,239 --> 02:33:49,840
i don't want to say a laundry list but

3018
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:51,600
it's kind of like the high level of what

3019
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:53,120
i see

3020
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:55,520
across all of my different customers

3021
02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:57,040
at elastic

3022
02:33:57,040 --> 02:33:58,399
you know

3023
02:33:58,399 --> 02:34:01,200
when people think about sec ops this

3024
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:03,760
in a nutshell is what they're trying to

3025
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:04,560
do

3026
02:34:04,560 --> 02:34:06,640
right not not all of them do everything

3027
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:08,720
not and it's and the important thing to

3028
02:34:08,720 --> 02:34:09,600
note here is there's no

3029
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:11,520
one-size-fits-all right depending on the

3030
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:13,439
size of your organization

3031
02:34:13,439 --> 02:34:15,040
the types of attacks that you are

3032
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:17,120
concerned about and the type of

3033
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:20,880
adversaries that you're going to attract

3034
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:22,479
the priorities and importance of these

3035
02:34:22,479 --> 02:34:23,760
things will vary

3036
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:26,479
but at a broad scale this is

3037
02:34:26,479 --> 02:34:27,279
these are things that you should

3038
02:34:27,279 --> 02:34:28,720
consider

3039
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:29,840
the first thing that you need to think

3040
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:32,880
about is plugging visibility gaps

3041
02:34:32,880 --> 02:34:35,120
and collecting all the data

3042
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:36,560
they actually need to build your

3043
02:34:36,560 --> 02:34:38,800
defensive security capability and you

3044
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:40,640
need to be able to do this at scale

3045
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:42,880
right if you if you set up your

3046
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:44,560
collection

3047
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:47,040
data collection

3048
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:49,200
processes or workflows you want it to

3049
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:51,279
work when your environment is a hundred

3050
02:34:51,279 --> 02:34:52,800
people large or a hundred endpoints

3051
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:54,399
large but you also want it to continue

3052
02:34:54,399 --> 02:34:57,760
to work when you then grow 500 1 000 10

3053
02:34:57,760 --> 02:34:59,680
000 or when you go to when you go to a

3054
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:01,120
cloud provider and you have you know

3055
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:03,040
that exponential growth that most people

3056
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:04,000
often do

3057
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:05,359
so you want to think about that right

3058
02:35:05,359 --> 02:35:07,200
like where are your gaps in visibility

3059
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:09,680
and how are you going to go and plug it

3060
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:11,520
the second thing you want to do

3061
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:13,120
is

3062
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:14,560
you want to bring together the different

3063
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:16,560
silos of data that you've got lying

3064
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:18,640
across lying around your environment a

3065
02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:20,080
few people kind of talked about this

3066
02:35:20,080 --> 02:35:21,680
throughout the conference right like

3067
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:22,720
there's

3068
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:24,319
there's a lot of value in being able to

3069
02:35:24,319 --> 02:35:27,359
collaborate and use different

3070
02:35:27,359 --> 02:35:29,120
insights that are being generated across

3071
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:30,800
different different parts of your

3072
02:35:30,800 --> 02:35:33,680
company right good example here is your

3073
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:35,840
sre team or your it team is going to

3074
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:37,279
collect a whole bunch of information

3075
02:35:37,279 --> 02:35:38,800
around the performance uptime

3076
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:40,960
reliability stability of your of your

3077
02:35:40,960 --> 02:35:43,200
business critical applications

3078
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:45,359
from a security perspective isn't that

3079
02:35:45,359 --> 02:35:47,760
just a you know goldmine of

3080
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:49,520
understanding how

3081
02:35:49,520 --> 02:35:51,680
actions from a security perspective

3082
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:55,279
impact business critical capabilities

3083
02:35:55,279 --> 02:35:56,960
but not a lot of us end up using that

3084
02:35:56,960 --> 02:35:58,319
information to actually come to the

3085
02:35:58,319 --> 02:35:59,840
right conclusions so it makes a lot of

3086
02:35:59,840 --> 02:36:01,120
sense to think about how you bring those

3087
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:03,359
silos together

3088
02:36:03,359 --> 02:36:04,720
you also want to reduce the number of

3089
02:36:04,720 --> 02:36:06,319
false positives right this is obvious

3090
02:36:06,319 --> 02:36:07,840
right when a security tool tells you

3091
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:09,760
something's gone wrong you want to have

3092
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:12,000
a high degree of confidence that this

3093
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,640
alert is legit so that you can justify

3094
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:17,439
spending time and effort understanding

3095
02:36:17,439 --> 02:36:19,439
contextualizing and responding to that

3096
02:36:19,439 --> 02:36:21,200
thing so you want high fidelity

3097
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:22,560
detections

3098
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:24,640
uh touched upon this before you want

3099
02:36:24,640 --> 02:36:27,200
your tools and your technology to inform

3100
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:29,120
and guide your investigations and you

3101
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:30,640
actually also want to close the loop

3102
02:36:30,640 --> 02:36:32,000
between your detections and your

3103
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,359
remediations

3104
02:36:33,359 --> 02:36:36,160
right um remediations are always going

3105
02:36:36,160 --> 02:36:38,000
to be like a maturity thing right like

3106
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:39,680
you're not going to have all all your

3107
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:41,359
remediations be

3108
02:36:41,359 --> 02:36:42,640
at the best point that they're going to

3109
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:45,359
be on day one but

3110
02:36:45,359 --> 02:36:46,880
if you're able to then take the

3111
02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:48,479
learnings from that if you're able to

3112
02:36:48,479 --> 02:36:50,399
tie that back in and close the loop

3113
02:36:50,399 --> 02:36:52,880
between remediation and detections and

3114
02:36:52,880 --> 02:36:54,479
namely this this means things like you

3115
02:36:54,479 --> 02:36:56,960
know tuning and so forth

3116
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:58,399
you can start getting a lot of value for

3117
02:36:58,399 --> 02:37:00,880
your sock

3118
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:04,640
so let's elaborate and let's let's

3119
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:06,399
go into each of these and understand

3120
02:37:06,399 --> 02:37:09,119
what i mean here

3121
02:37:10,080 --> 02:37:11,359
so

3122
02:37:11,359 --> 02:37:12,800
and like i said we'll we'll kind of

3123
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:15,439
stick to simple terms here right because

3124
02:37:15,439 --> 02:37:16,960
we're talking about these concepts and i

3125
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:18,319
want you to go home and think about what

3126
02:37:18,319 --> 02:37:21,200
this actually means for your company

3127
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:23,040
so first problem is you've got a bunch

3128
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:24,800
of computers

3129
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:25,680
the first thing you want to do is

3130
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:27,120
protect them right

3131
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:28,479
because that's where your attackers will

3132
02:37:28,479 --> 02:37:30,080
start that's generally when you do your

3133
02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:32,000
attack modeling that's generally where

3134
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:33,680
the entry point is so if you if you can

3135
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:35,520
protect them as much as possible apply

3136
02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:38,720
preventative capability do that

3137
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:41,279
some of these sit on a cloud somewhere

3138
02:37:41,279 --> 02:37:42,319
the rest

3139
02:37:42,319 --> 02:37:44,560
sit under someone's desk right or a

3140
02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:46,399
closet or something along those lines

3141
02:37:46,399 --> 02:37:48,479
you need to collect a bunch of data of

3142
02:37:48,479 --> 02:37:50,399
these you know namely things like logs

3143
02:37:50,399 --> 02:37:53,680
metrics audit trail endpoint telemetry

3144
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:55,120
you want to understand what's happening

3145
02:37:55,120 --> 02:37:58,080
on these things

3146
02:37:58,080 --> 02:38:00,399
so that's where you start

3147
02:38:00,399 --> 02:38:02,720
now part of plugging visibility gaps

3148
02:38:02,720 --> 02:38:04,800
is you should you also should think

3149
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:07,840
about how you can do this continuously

3150
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:09,760
right this is not a static thing where

3151
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:11,600
you've got a few endpoints and you've

3152
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:13,279
understood what the workloads are and

3153
02:38:13,279 --> 02:38:14,319
you've gone and set up some log

3154
02:38:14,319 --> 02:38:15,920
collection you actually need to be able

3155
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:18,160
to continuously collect and onboard this

3156
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:19,680
data as you go along because you're not

3157
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:21,680
going to get everything on day one

3158
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:22,880
so

3159
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:24,160
think about things like how you collect

3160
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:26,239
from every corner of your environment

3161
02:38:26,239 --> 02:38:27,920
think about how you evolve alongside

3162
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:30,000
that data source right so as you're

3163
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,960
updating applications as you know

3164
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:35,120
technologies evolve the actual logging

3165
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:36,720
is going to evolve the telemetry that it

3166
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:38,080
gives you is going to evolve so think

3167
02:38:38,080 --> 02:38:40,000
about how you can actually be on top of

3168
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:41,840
that

3169
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:44,640
process and understand and contextualize

3170
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:46,560
this data before storing it don't just

3171
02:38:46,560 --> 02:38:48,319
blindly collect all your logs and

3172
02:38:48,319 --> 02:38:50,560
metrics and dump them somewhere

3173
02:38:50,560 --> 02:38:52,239
that no one's going to go and use

3174
02:38:52,239 --> 02:38:53,600
actually think about how this is going

3175
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:55,279
to be useful for you

3176
02:38:55,279 --> 02:38:57,680
now granted like you can't you can't

3177
02:38:57,680 --> 02:38:59,920
boil the ocean you know up front and do

3178
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:02,640
all of this work at once but make a bit

3179
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:04,319
of an effort just

3180
02:39:04,319 --> 02:39:05,680
thinking about the value in some of

3181
02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:07,520
these data sets

3182
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:09,760
and as part of that also think about how

3183
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:12,000
you can enrich this data to increase the

3184
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,239
value in downstream use cases

3185
02:39:14,239 --> 02:39:16,399
a good example is you know if you've got

3186
02:39:16,399 --> 02:39:17,840
a bunch of

3187
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:20,640
events with us with an associated user

3188
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:22,239
think about what other context you've

3189
02:39:22,239 --> 02:39:24,640
got in your environment that

3190
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:26,560
can paint a picture around what the user

3191
02:39:26,560 --> 02:39:28,560
is right so if you've got

3192
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:30,479
say for example ad or some sort of hr

3193
02:39:30,479 --> 02:39:31,520
data

3194
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:33,279
enrich the information with the user's

3195
02:39:33,279 --> 02:39:35,520
title enrich the information with are

3196
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:38,080
they on leave or not enrich with you

3197
02:39:38,080 --> 02:39:40,160
know what the risk for that user is what

3198
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:41,840
their job title is things along those

3199
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:43,199
lines because when you then do your

3200
02:39:43,199 --> 02:39:47,199
detections that's context for you

3201
02:39:47,439 --> 02:39:48,880
and then don't be afraid of the data

3202
02:39:48,880 --> 02:39:52,640
volumes um a lot of stocks out there

3203
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:54,160
will kind of make

3204
02:39:54,160 --> 02:39:56,000
very conscious decisions around hey like

3205
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:57,680
i'm gonna drop this data source so i'm

3206
02:39:57,680 --> 02:39:59,840
gonna heavily aggregate and summarize

3207
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:01,520
this data source because it's just too

3208
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:03,199
much volume i just don't wanna deal with

3209
02:40:03,199 --> 02:40:05,359
it

3210
02:40:05,359 --> 02:40:06,800
but when you actually think about

3211
02:40:06,800 --> 02:40:09,359
building hi-fi detections you need a lot

3212
02:40:09,359 --> 02:40:11,439
more than just aero audit logs right

3213
02:40:11,439 --> 02:40:13,120
like that that

3214
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:15,199
telemetry the the

3215
02:40:15,199 --> 02:40:17,120
information actually gives you a lot of

3216
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:19,520
insight um in being able to build those

3217
02:40:19,520 --> 02:40:21,920
detections so use technology effectively

3218
02:40:21,920 --> 02:40:23,920
there's lots of you know very scalable

3219
02:40:23,920 --> 02:40:25,439
cheap solutions out there cheap

3220
02:40:25,439 --> 02:40:27,920
technologies in the open source um

3221
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:29,600
ecosystem as well

3222
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:30,880
that'll actually help you deal with this

3223
02:40:30,880 --> 02:40:33,040
don't be afraid of the volume

3224
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:36,560
think about slas on timely ingestion

3225
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:38,800
and you know your sock right like when

3226
02:40:38,800 --> 02:40:40,160
you have when you have an event that

3227
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:42,720
happens in a corner of your organization

3228
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:45,279
it's not good enough to get that event

3229
02:40:45,279 --> 02:40:47,840
48 hours later right

3230
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:50,000
when the attacker's gone in and wreaked

3231
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:51,680
havoc and you know already left the

3232
02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:53,680
environment you actually need to start

3233
02:40:53,680 --> 02:40:55,840
thinking about how reliably and quickly

3234
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:58,479
am i getting this stuff into my sock so

3235
02:40:58,479 --> 02:41:01,279
i can deal with it and process it

3236
02:41:01,279 --> 02:41:02,960
and you also need to be resilient in

3237
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:04,399
being able to handle peaks and troughs

3238
02:41:04,399 --> 02:41:07,120
in your volumes so classic example here

3239
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:08,160
is you know

3240
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:09,920
holiday season or black friday sales

3241
02:41:09,920 --> 02:41:11,439
type things right like when your

3242
02:41:11,439 --> 02:41:13,199
business is actually

3243
02:41:13,199 --> 02:41:15,120
you know going through its seasonal

3244
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:16,800
peaks you don't want your security to

3245
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:19,679
start lagging behind

3246
02:41:20,319 --> 02:41:22,080
and then also think about

3247
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:24,080
the layers in your technology and

3248
02:41:24,080 --> 02:41:26,000
operational stacks so think about the

3249
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,319
physical world think about the platform

3250
02:41:28,319 --> 02:41:30,399
cloud or provider that you're using

3251
02:41:30,399 --> 02:41:32,239
think about the hypervisor or the bare

3252
02:41:32,239 --> 02:41:34,560
metal that that stuff ends up running on

3253
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:36,399
then think about the host os and the

3254
02:41:36,399 --> 02:41:38,239
appliances and all the ancillary stuff

3255
02:41:38,239 --> 02:41:40,239
around that think about the software

3256
02:41:40,239 --> 02:41:41,520
think about the containers you get the

3257
02:41:41,520 --> 02:41:43,760
idea right so start from

3258
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:45,680
one end of the spectrum go to the other

3259
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:47,600
end think about all the different layers

3260
02:41:47,600 --> 02:41:49,600
and think about what visibility is

3261
02:41:49,600 --> 02:41:51,279
important for you

3262
02:41:51,279 --> 02:41:53,040
and then lastly think about

3263
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:54,880
is the visibility that you're getting

3264
02:41:54,880 --> 02:41:56,239
good enough when you're actually having

3265
02:41:56,239 --> 02:41:58,239
a bad day because that's when this stuff

3266
02:41:58,239 --> 02:42:00,399
matters the most right

3267
02:42:00,399 --> 02:42:02,080
and the last thing you want to do is

3268
02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:03,600
when you're having a bad day you start

3269
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:05,120
thinking about what you then need to

3270
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:06,720
have visibility on and then go and

3271
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:08,880
introduce like really bad point

3272
02:42:08,880 --> 02:42:10,479
solutions to deal with that which you're

3273
02:42:10,479 --> 02:42:13,920
then going to be stuck with forever

3274
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:18,160
the next thing you do

3275
02:42:18,160 --> 02:42:20,319
is you take all that data that we talked

3276
02:42:20,319 --> 02:42:21,279
about

3277
02:42:21,279 --> 02:42:24,880
and you store that on a bunch of these

3278
02:42:24,880 --> 02:42:28,399
3d printed save icons

3279
02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:32,160
this will prove to be a very smart thing

3280
02:42:32,160 --> 02:42:34,479
that that you that you do in the future

3281
02:42:34,479 --> 02:42:36,640
when you actually need that data

3282
02:42:36,640 --> 02:42:38,880
so this is i'm talking about making your

3283
02:42:38,880 --> 02:42:41,359
data sets usable and interoperable here

3284
02:42:41,359 --> 02:42:43,120
um so think about you know what's

3285
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:45,279
meaningful data retention for you right

3286
02:42:45,279 --> 02:42:47,120
like are your archives actually usable

3287
02:42:47,120 --> 02:42:48,720
on a friday afternoon we talked about

3288
02:42:48,720 --> 02:42:51,120
this before how long can you look back

3289
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:53,040
for indicators of compromise or

3290
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:54,880
indicators of attack uh you know

3291
02:42:54,880 --> 02:42:56,399
patterns that you're interested in right

3292
02:42:56,399 --> 02:42:58,479
like sequences of events think about you

3293
02:42:58,479 --> 02:43:00,800
know how fast ld adversaries will go

3294
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:02,479
back uh i think someone was talking

3295
02:43:02,479 --> 02:43:04,399
about the solomon's stuff and there was

3296
02:43:04,399 --> 02:43:06,239
basically there were a couple of months

3297
02:43:06,239 --> 02:43:08,160
in between you know initial access and

3298
02:43:08,160 --> 02:43:11,199
then when they actually uh ended up

3299
02:43:11,199 --> 02:43:12,720
you know compromising or moving

3300
02:43:12,720 --> 02:43:14,720
laterally within the environment so is

3301
02:43:14,720 --> 02:43:16,880
that retention that you have meaningful

3302
02:43:16,880 --> 02:43:18,319
enough for you

3303
02:43:18,319 --> 02:43:19,840
and how quickly can you access and

3304
02:43:19,840 --> 02:43:22,319
manipulate this data right when you when

3305
02:43:22,319 --> 02:43:24,239
you when your stuff is on fire and you

3306
02:43:24,239 --> 02:43:26,000
run a query and your

3307
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,319
platform says okay cool come back six

3308
02:43:28,319 --> 02:43:29,920
coffees later

3309
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:30,880
um

3310
02:43:30,880 --> 02:43:32,319
not really good enough like you need to

3311
02:43:32,319 --> 02:43:34,239
be able to at least get some insight

3312
02:43:34,239 --> 02:43:37,840
relatively quickly so you can act on it

3313
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:40,640
and then think about the data platforms

3314
02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:42,319
or you know lakes or repositories or

3315
02:43:42,319 --> 02:43:44,479
whatever your favorite word there is

3316
02:43:44,479 --> 02:43:46,080
but think about how they need to talk to

3317
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:47,359
each other we touched on this before as

3318
02:43:47,359 --> 02:43:49,680
well itops sec ops business data right

3319
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:51,439
how can you bring that all together this

3320
02:43:51,439 --> 02:43:52,560
also applies across different

3321
02:43:52,560 --> 02:43:55,840
technologies like aws gcp on-prem so on

3322
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:58,640
also applies to geographies if you work

3323
02:43:58,640 --> 02:44:01,359
at a large you know multinational org

3324
02:44:01,359 --> 02:44:02,720
they're going to have data that is

3325
02:44:02,720 --> 02:44:04,880
generated across multiple

3326
02:44:04,880 --> 02:44:07,199
regions and generally because of cost

3327
02:44:07,199 --> 02:44:08,640
and things like that people will keep

3328
02:44:08,640 --> 02:44:10,800
that data isolated

3329
02:44:10,800 --> 02:44:12,160
and i mean there's other good reasons

3330
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:13,520
why things like you know role-based

3331
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:15,359
access control so obviously you know

3332
02:44:15,359 --> 02:44:17,439
think about what what those requirements

3333
02:44:17,439 --> 02:44:20,160
are but having some sort of ability to

3334
02:44:20,160 --> 02:44:21,920
bring these data sets together to be

3335
02:44:21,920 --> 02:44:23,760
able to do trend analysis and apply

3336
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:26,720
these patterns is very meaningful

3337
02:44:26,720 --> 02:44:28,800
your investigations will generally need

3338
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:30,720
to span across these data silos because

3339
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:33,040
your threats will obviously do that

3340
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:34,479
right if you've got a business critical

3341
02:44:34,479 --> 02:44:36,640
system and you don't have any visibility

3342
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:38,479
over that kind of defeats the purpose of

3343
02:44:38,479 --> 02:44:40,319
what you're trying to do and things like

3344
02:44:40,319 --> 02:44:44,479
devsecops type mindsets here um you know

3345
02:44:44,479 --> 02:44:46,239
are very relevant to think about right

3346
02:44:46,239 --> 02:44:49,600
like if your org you know works that way

3347
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:51,920
and the line between these different

3348
02:44:51,920 --> 02:44:53,439
disciplines are a little bit blurred

3349
02:44:53,439 --> 02:44:54,720
think about how that applies to your

3350
02:44:54,720 --> 02:44:56,640
security

3351
02:44:56,640 --> 02:44:58,479
and then you know the plus the the

3352
02:44:58,479 --> 02:45:00,319
benefit of doing all of this is if you

3353
02:45:00,319 --> 02:45:01,760
do it well

3354
02:45:01,760 --> 02:45:03,600
you can have better collaboration and

3355
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:06,000
shared accountability and in the process

3356
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:07,600
of doing that you can drive down your

3357
02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:09,520
costs and you can drive down the strain

3358
02:45:09,520 --> 02:45:11,920
on your resources which is good because

3359
02:45:11,920 --> 02:45:14,560
while we all have a lot of job security

3360
02:45:14,560 --> 02:45:16,479
we're all very stressed in our roles

3361
02:45:16,479 --> 02:45:19,040
right because we have way too much to do

3362
02:45:19,040 --> 02:45:22,880
so it's it's a net positive there

3363
02:45:24,319 --> 02:45:26,479
so once you do all that

3364
02:45:26,479 --> 02:45:28,479
run your data through your security

3365
02:45:28,479 --> 02:45:30,080
detections

3366
02:45:30,080 --> 02:45:32,319
um which are these uh

3367
02:45:32,319 --> 02:45:35,520
very cute german shepherds here um

3368
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:37,199
and the goal here is to look for known

3369
02:45:37,199 --> 02:45:38,960
bad

3370
02:45:38,960 --> 02:45:40,080
there's a lot of there's a lot of

3371
02:45:40,080 --> 02:45:41,120
research out there there's a lot of

3372
02:45:41,120 --> 02:45:42,640
intelligence that tells you like hey

3373
02:45:42,640 --> 02:45:44,960
what's what's known bad um and you know

3374
02:45:44,960 --> 02:45:46,319
it makes a lot of sense to run all this

3375
02:45:46,319 --> 02:45:48,399
data through that so

3376
02:45:48,399 --> 02:45:50,880
with detections the goal the the kind of

3377
02:45:50,880 --> 02:45:53,439
key thing that i see is the need to be

3378
02:45:53,439 --> 02:45:54,479
able to pivot

3379
02:45:54,479 --> 02:45:56,399
to an engineering mindset to actually

3380
02:45:56,399 --> 02:45:58,800
build your detections so things like

3381
02:45:58,800 --> 02:46:00,640
using detections as code

3382
02:46:00,640 --> 02:46:02,640
peer reviewing detection logic right

3383
02:46:02,640 --> 02:46:04,399
testing it before you actually deploy in

3384
02:46:04,399 --> 02:46:06,479
production ability to roll back

3385
02:46:06,479 --> 02:46:09,199
detection logic and having that audit

3386
02:46:09,199 --> 02:46:11,439
trail of changes that are that that

3387
02:46:11,439 --> 02:46:13,199
apply to your detections

3388
02:46:13,199 --> 02:46:15,359
uh measuring detection performance in

3389
02:46:15,359 --> 02:46:17,359
terms of effectiveness to actually look

3390
02:46:17,359 --> 02:46:19,600
for bad stuff but also reducing the

3391
02:46:19,600 --> 02:46:21,279
false positives associated with your bad

3392
02:46:21,279 --> 02:46:22,720
stuff it's all really you know very

3393
02:46:22,720 --> 02:46:24,800
sensible stuff and this comes with

3394
02:46:24,800 --> 02:46:26,720
maturity right this is not a day one

3395
02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:28,239
thing that you're going to have to do

3396
02:46:28,239 --> 02:46:30,319
but think about how

3397
02:46:30,319 --> 02:46:32,479
using these sort of tech techniques you

3398
02:46:32,479 --> 02:46:34,840
can improve the fidelity of those

3399
02:46:34,840 --> 02:46:36,880
detections the other thing that makes

3400
02:46:36,880 --> 02:46:38,319
all sense is you know continuously

3401
02:46:38,319 --> 02:46:39,920
mapping detection coverage to your

3402
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:41,279
attack model

3403
02:46:41,279 --> 02:46:43,199
and the visibility that you have so you

3404
02:46:43,199 --> 02:46:45,520
know a lot of folks prefer using things

3405
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:47,279
like mitra attack but really it doesn't

3406
02:46:47,279 --> 02:46:49,520
matter like whatever framework you use

3407
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:51,199
to understand

3408
02:46:51,199 --> 02:46:52,160
you know

3409
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:54,640
the tactics and techniques that are you

3410
02:46:54,640 --> 02:46:56,560
know relevant to you and your

3411
02:46:56,560 --> 02:46:58,800
environment actually map your detections

3412
02:46:58,800 --> 02:46:59,920
on top of that because then you

3413
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:02,840
understand how much coverage you've

3414
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:06,479
got it also makes sense to combine

3415
02:47:06,479 --> 02:47:08,239
multiple detections

3416
02:47:08,239 --> 02:47:11,600
or signals to create more high fidelity

3417
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:14,160
overarching detections a good example

3418
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:16,160
here is you know you might have an alert

3419
02:47:16,160 --> 02:47:18,160
from your endpoint software that says

3420
02:47:18,160 --> 02:47:21,359
hey saw some john the mill malware

3421
02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:23,439
cool right that's a good alert i'm not

3422
02:47:23,439 --> 02:47:25,520
saying that granular alerting is a bad

3423
02:47:25,520 --> 02:47:26,880
thing

3424
02:47:26,880 --> 02:47:28,319
but

3425
02:47:28,319 --> 02:47:30,000
you know so what like it happens all the

3426
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:31,359
time

3427
02:47:31,359 --> 02:47:33,279
if you're able to combine that with

3428
02:47:33,279 --> 02:47:35,840
another alert that says hey

3429
02:47:35,840 --> 02:47:38,880
this user account sent in

3430
02:47:38,880 --> 02:47:41,279
an anomalous amount of data to this

3431
02:47:41,279 --> 02:47:43,439
weird destination that they've never

3432
02:47:43,439 --> 02:47:45,439
interacted with before

3433
02:47:45,439 --> 02:47:47,199
and then you see hey this person's

3434
02:47:47,199 --> 02:47:49,359
deleting a whole bunch of files

3435
02:47:49,359 --> 02:47:50,720
on this machine

3436
02:47:50,720 --> 02:47:52,319
if you combine those three things

3437
02:47:52,319 --> 02:47:53,279
together

3438
02:47:53,279 --> 02:47:55,520
it's a lot more meaningful and it's a

3439
02:47:55,520 --> 02:47:57,040
lot more severe

3440
02:47:57,040 --> 02:47:58,960
right as as an activity happening on

3441
02:47:58,960 --> 02:48:01,680
that endpoint so think about how you can

3442
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:03,760
bring multiple little detections

3443
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:05,760
together not necessarily acting on those

3444
02:48:05,760 --> 02:48:08,080
little detections but putting them

3445
02:48:08,080 --> 02:48:10,319
together to look for more important

3446
02:48:10,319 --> 02:48:13,439
highly severe activities

3447
02:48:13,439 --> 02:48:15,279
techniques like normal detection right

3448
02:48:15,279 --> 02:48:16,800
like machine learning is actually your

3449
02:48:16,800 --> 02:48:18,960
friend here um for a long time the

3450
02:48:18,960 --> 02:48:21,760
defense the defensive security industry

3451
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:23,840
um you know looked at ml as a bit of a

3452
02:48:23,840 --> 02:48:25,680
black box type technology and not a lot

3453
02:48:25,680 --> 02:48:28,319
of people trust it very much but the

3454
02:48:28,319 --> 02:48:29,760
technology has evolved since then

3455
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:31,520
there's a lot of really good open source

3456
02:48:31,520 --> 02:48:32,960
tools out there

3457
02:48:32,960 --> 02:48:35,279
that can apply some statistical analysis

3458
02:48:35,279 --> 02:48:37,120
to the data you're collecting to give

3459
02:48:37,120 --> 02:48:40,160
you some context right that anomalous

3460
02:48:40,160 --> 02:48:42,000
amount of data being sent out of your

3461
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:43,439
environment is a good example of that

3462
02:48:43,439 --> 02:48:44,720
you're not necessarily going to write a

3463
02:48:44,720 --> 02:48:46,479
rule for that right like every person's

3464
02:48:46,479 --> 02:48:48,720
got a different usage profile you're not

3465
02:48:48,720 --> 02:48:50,319
going to say hey this person's got five

3466
02:48:50,319 --> 02:48:51,680
megabytes that's their limit and the

3467
02:48:51,680 --> 02:48:54,160
other person's got 10. um but using some

3468
02:48:54,160 --> 02:48:56,399
sort of statistical analysis to see how

3469
02:48:56,399 --> 02:48:58,080
far this person's deviating from the

3470
02:48:58,080 --> 02:49:00,960
norm is really really useful

3471
02:49:00,960 --> 02:49:03,760
and then as a follow-on to that one you

3472
02:49:03,760 --> 02:49:05,600
can also start using things like risk

3473
02:49:05,600 --> 02:49:07,680
profiles on entities in your environment

3474
02:49:07,680 --> 02:49:10,479
right users hosts to start quantifying

3475
02:49:10,479 --> 02:49:11,680
threats like if they're doing a lot of

3476
02:49:11,680 --> 02:49:12,960
weird stuff if they're associated with a

3477
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:15,600
lot of alerts start raising the risk

3478
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:17,439
around that user and you can take more

3479
02:49:17,439 --> 02:49:20,880
you know decisive action around them

3480
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:24,640
then once you've done the detections you

3481
02:49:24,640 --> 02:49:26,399
can also investigate and hunt through

3482
02:49:26,399 --> 02:49:27,199
this

3483
02:49:27,199 --> 02:49:28,800
data

3484
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:30,399
based on findings based on threat

3485
02:49:30,399 --> 02:49:32,160
intelligence or hypothesis that your

3486
02:49:32,160 --> 02:49:33,520
team has

3487
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:35,439
and this is just as important as looking

3488
02:49:35,439 --> 02:49:37,040
for the known bad right so you need to

3489
02:49:37,040 --> 02:49:38,479
make sure the investigations that you're

3490
02:49:38,479 --> 02:49:39,439
doing

3491
02:49:39,439 --> 02:49:41,279
are actually meaningful

3492
02:49:41,279 --> 02:49:43,120
and what i mean here is doing things

3493
02:49:43,120 --> 02:49:44,239
like

3494
02:49:44,239 --> 02:49:46,160
contextual detection alerts right like

3495
02:49:46,160 --> 02:49:47,680
applying the timely intelligence and

3496
02:49:47,680 --> 02:49:49,600
context around these

3497
02:49:49,600 --> 02:49:51,840
you can also do things like automating

3498
02:49:51,840 --> 02:49:54,319
repetitive context gathering tasks

3499
02:49:54,319 --> 02:49:56,160
generally like you see an alert right

3500
02:49:56,160 --> 02:49:57,920
the analyst is going to have 10

3501
02:49:57,920 --> 02:49:58,880
different things that they're going to

3502
02:49:58,880 --> 02:50:01,040
have to do that never changes it's very

3503
02:50:01,040 --> 02:50:03,199
run-of-the-mill automate that stuff

3504
02:50:03,199 --> 02:50:04,880
right and that's that's a way for you to

3505
02:50:04,880 --> 02:50:06,640
actually scale your bandwidth scale your

3506
02:50:06,640 --> 02:50:08,319
capacity

3507
02:50:08,319 --> 02:50:10,399
look at effective ways of actually

3508
02:50:10,399 --> 02:50:12,880
triaging so i spoke about risk but you

3509
02:50:12,880 --> 02:50:14,160
can also think about

3510
02:50:14,160 --> 02:50:15,680
occurrence you can look at the

3511
02:50:15,680 --> 02:50:17,680
sensitivity of that particular alert you

3512
02:50:17,680 --> 02:50:19,840
can look at the exposure if it's tied to

3513
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:21,600
a critical asset or critical

3514
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:23,199
infrastructure in your organization

3515
02:50:23,199 --> 02:50:25,120
you're going to treat that a lot more

3516
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:26,319
with a lot more

3517
02:50:26,319 --> 02:50:27,520
caution

3518
02:50:27,520 --> 02:50:31,040
compared to someone's workstation

3519
02:50:31,840 --> 02:50:34,399
you can also use ml to identify some of

3520
02:50:34,399 --> 02:50:36,479
the noise around your detections so

3521
02:50:36,479 --> 02:50:38,319
remember like alerts

3522
02:50:38,319 --> 02:50:40,239
are also data sets

3523
02:50:40,239 --> 02:50:42,720
right there's no reason why you can't

3524
02:50:42,720 --> 02:50:44,319
use the same techniques that you do on

3525
02:50:44,319 --> 02:50:49,239
your raw data sets on your alerting

3526
02:50:49,600 --> 02:50:50,560
and then

3527
02:50:50,560 --> 02:50:52,560
graph and maintain entity relationships

3528
02:50:52,560 --> 02:50:53,840
in your environment again this is the

3529
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:55,840
maturity thing someone was showing you

3530
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:57,520
folks just before

3531
02:50:57,520 --> 02:50:59,680
around the you know powers of using

3532
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:01,600
graph databases think about how you can

3533
02:51:01,600 --> 02:51:03,120
apply that here think about how you can

3534
02:51:03,120 --> 02:51:04,479
understand relationships between

3535
02:51:04,479 --> 02:51:08,239
different entities actions and so forth

3536
02:51:09,359 --> 02:51:11,359
and then the last thing you want to do

3537
02:51:11,359 --> 02:51:14,080
is you want to take the right response

3538
02:51:14,080 --> 02:51:15,680
depending on what you find in your

3539
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:18,160
investigation or through your detection

3540
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:20,080
so close the loop right tie alerts to

3541
02:51:20,080 --> 02:51:22,239
automated response workflows that are

3542
02:51:22,239 --> 02:51:24,000
actually meaningful to your environment

3543
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:25,439
there's no silver bullet here like no

3544
02:51:25,439 --> 02:51:26,880
one's going to be able to give you like

3545
02:51:26,880 --> 02:51:28,640
a whole list of playbooks that you can

3546
02:51:28,640 --> 02:51:30,720
apply to all the alerts that you find

3547
02:51:30,720 --> 02:51:32,239
these are going to be very specific so

3548
02:51:32,239 --> 02:51:34,399
someone getting malware

3549
02:51:34,399 --> 02:51:36,319
on their workstation means that you're

3550
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:37,760
generally going to have to reimage their

3551
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:38,960
workstation

3552
02:51:38,960 --> 02:51:39,680
but

3553
02:51:39,680 --> 02:51:41,439
someone you know

3554
02:51:41,439 --> 02:51:43,439
triggering an insider threat detection

3555
02:51:43,439 --> 02:51:45,600
right someone exfiltrating data out of

3556
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:47,040
your environment you're going to have to

3557
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:49,040
do a very different response action

3558
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:50,000
there right like you're going to have to

3559
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:51,199
lock down their account you're going to

3560
02:51:51,199 --> 02:51:52,080
have to get in touch with your

3561
02:51:52,080 --> 02:51:53,680
colleagues in hr

3562
02:51:53,680 --> 02:51:55,520
and legal and so forth so you know think

3563
02:51:55,520 --> 02:51:56,880
about what that means and automate as

3564
02:51:56,880 --> 02:51:59,279
much as possible

3565
02:51:59,279 --> 02:52:00,800
you also want the ability to kind of

3566
02:52:00,800 --> 02:52:02,720
reach into your endpoints and key bits

3567
02:52:02,720 --> 02:52:05,120
of infrastructure to very quickly go in

3568
02:52:05,120 --> 02:52:07,279
and act and block block and remediate

3569
02:52:07,279 --> 02:52:09,040
appropriately the last thing you want to

3570
02:52:09,040 --> 02:52:11,120
do is once you actually find out what's

3571
02:52:11,120 --> 02:52:13,199
going on going going and talking to this

3572
02:52:13,199 --> 02:52:15,120
completely different team

3573
02:52:15,120 --> 02:52:17,199
that's not part of your sock

3574
02:52:17,199 --> 02:52:19,040
to go and do things on your endpoints

3575
02:52:19,040 --> 02:52:21,040
you actually want that ability tied in

3576
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:23,760
very closely with your core tools and

3577
02:52:23,760 --> 02:52:26,160
capabilities

3578
02:52:26,160 --> 02:52:29,439
and while you're closing the loop

3579
02:52:29,439 --> 02:52:32,239
you also want to

3580
02:52:32,239 --> 02:52:34,160
bring back some feedback into use case

3581
02:52:34,160 --> 02:52:35,920
development right so based on the things

3582
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:37,199
that you're finding based on things that

3583
02:52:37,199 --> 02:52:38,640
are triggering in your environment you

3584
02:52:38,640 --> 02:52:41,279
want to inform the engineering process

3585
02:52:41,279 --> 02:52:43,120
ideally that's done as part of the same

3586
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:45,199
team right like with people specializing

3587
02:52:45,199 --> 02:52:46,880
in different roles but you want to bring

3588
02:52:46,880 --> 02:52:49,279
that bring that feedback

3589
02:52:49,279 --> 02:52:52,160
into that process

3590
02:52:52,479 --> 02:52:54,720
so what do we end up with

3591
02:52:54,720 --> 02:52:56,800
you've reduced your gaps in visibility

3592
02:52:56,800 --> 02:52:58,080
you're keeping more of what your

3593
02:52:58,080 --> 02:52:59,920
environment generates and that's useful

3594
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:01,840
for your downstream use cases

3595
02:53:01,840 --> 02:53:03,520
you've got higher confidence in

3596
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:04,960
detections

3597
02:53:04,960 --> 02:53:06,800
and you've got the operational maturity

3598
02:53:06,800 --> 02:53:08,319
in detection engineering if you've kind

3599
02:53:08,319 --> 02:53:10,399
of gone through that process

3600
02:53:10,399 --> 02:53:12,880
you're now using your tech

3601
02:53:12,880 --> 02:53:16,319
to guide your analysis right

3602
02:53:16,319 --> 02:53:18,000
and your investigations and you know the

3603
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:19,920
whole point here is take off some load

3604
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:21,520
from the analysts and actually get them

3605
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:23,760
to do useful things

3606
02:53:23,760 --> 02:53:25,439
and then lastly you're now going

3607
02:53:25,439 --> 02:53:28,560
end-to-end you're closing the loop

3608
02:53:28,560 --> 02:53:31,120
between detections and response actions

3609
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:32,880
and that will hopefully help drive

3610
02:53:32,880 --> 02:53:37,040
operational maturity even further

3611
02:53:37,040 --> 02:53:38,960
and the other useful thing and you know

3612
02:53:38,960 --> 02:53:41,279
a really good benefit is your analysts

3613
02:53:41,279 --> 02:53:42,800
actually going to be far happier doing

3614
02:53:42,800 --> 02:53:44,319
the role that they do right they don't

3615
02:53:44,319 --> 02:53:46,239
have an easy job

3616
02:53:46,239 --> 02:53:48,560
like these these folks literally live in

3617
02:53:48,560 --> 02:53:51,199
this loop of look at an alert understand

3618
02:53:51,199 --> 02:53:53,760
what it means either qualify it out or

3619
02:53:53,760 --> 02:53:55,920
act on it right and it's like a very

3620
02:53:55,920 --> 02:53:58,080
very tedious hard job to do and that's

3621
02:53:58,080 --> 02:54:00,080
why there's so much burnout so actually

3622
02:54:00,080 --> 02:54:02,239
help them have a better quality of life

3623
02:54:02,239 --> 02:54:05,840
and make them happier in their role

3624
02:54:06,960 --> 02:54:09,199
and that's it so

3625
02:54:09,199 --> 02:54:11,439
sec ops doesn't have to be as hard as

3626
02:54:11,439 --> 02:54:13,600
some of us make it out to be

3627
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:15,199
take a step back

3628
02:54:15,199 --> 02:54:17,680
think about what your team needs to be

3629
02:54:17,680 --> 02:54:18,880
successful

3630
02:54:18,880 --> 02:54:20,319
and just work your way backwards from

3631
02:54:20,319 --> 02:54:22,160
there right take a whole take take a

3632
02:54:22,160 --> 02:54:24,239
holistic approach

3633
02:54:24,239 --> 02:54:26,160
um so thanks very much send me your

3634
02:54:26,160 --> 02:54:27,680
questions and your feedback if you have

3635
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:28,960
any this is the first time i'm doing

3636
02:54:28,960 --> 02:54:30,319
this talk in front of such a large

3637
02:54:30,319 --> 02:54:32,880
audience so i'd really appreciate

3638
02:54:32,880 --> 02:54:34,880

3639
02:54:34,880 --> 02:54:36,640
and if you're interested in the elastic

02:54:36,640 --> 02:54:40,519
stack check out my book

3641
02:54:46,880 --> 02:54:48,640
thank you very much for the crew here uh

3642
02:54:48,640 --> 02:54:50,880
for putting up this amazing event um

3643
02:54:50,880 --> 02:54:53,199
it's been great to be here thank you

3644
02:54:53,199 --> 02:54:56,160
thanks very much i said

3645
02:54:56,160 --> 02:54:57,279
so

3646
02:54:57,279 --> 02:54:59,279
i want you to imagine

3647
02:54:59,279 --> 02:55:01,279
that you work

3648
02:55:01,279 --> 02:55:04,319
the government agency

3649
02:55:04,479 --> 02:55:06,880
that's step one step two

3650
02:55:06,880 --> 02:55:08,640
someone walks into your office and says

3651
02:55:08,640 --> 02:55:09,760
you probably have an office because the

3652
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:10,880
building is really old so they actually

3653
02:55:10,880 --> 02:55:12,720
still have offices

3654
02:55:12,720 --> 02:55:14,720
and someone says to you

3655
02:55:14,720 --> 02:55:15,840
okay

3656
02:55:15,840 --> 02:55:18,319
a really really bad thing's happened

3657
02:55:18,319 --> 02:55:19,439
we're gonna have to do everything

3658
02:55:19,439 --> 02:55:21,279
completely differently and we need to do

3659
02:55:21,279 --> 02:55:23,199
it by next week and we need to not get

3660
02:55:23,199 --> 02:55:24,800
wrecked

3661
02:55:24,800 --> 02:55:26,800
now i want you to imagine

3662
02:55:26,800 --> 02:55:29,520
what noise you would make

3663
02:55:29,520 --> 02:55:32,399
if you were i don't know an architect

3664
02:55:32,399 --> 02:55:34,880
responsible for all of this happening

3665
02:55:34,880 --> 02:55:36,560
very very quickly and not going horribly

3666
02:55:36,560 --> 02:55:39,520
wrong in the middle of a pandemic so

3667
02:55:39,520 --> 02:55:40,880
would you like to make the noise that

3668
02:55:40,880 --> 02:55:42,000
you would make when someone walks in and

3669
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,560
says that to you

3670
02:55:47,439 --> 02:55:49,199
yeah that's that's about what i imagined

3671
02:55:49,199 --> 02:55:50,720
and i that is the noise that i would

3672
02:55:50,720 --> 02:55:52,160
make also

3673
02:55:52,160 --> 02:55:53,760
so

3674
02:55:53,760 --> 02:55:57,040
in order to share this catharsis

3675
02:55:57,040 --> 02:55:58,800
i'm going to invite to the stage mr

3676
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:00,720
patrick hindmarsh who is the person who

3677
02:56:00,720 --> 02:56:02,960
made that noise

3678
02:56:02,960 --> 02:56:04,800
on your behalf so

3679
02:56:04,800 --> 02:56:07,040
big round of applause

3680
02:56:07,040 --> 02:56:10,840
mr patrick how much

3681
02:56:13,600 --> 02:56:15,680
cool yeah i i can confirm i definitely

3682
02:56:15,680 --> 02:56:17,040
made that noise several times in the

3683
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:20,000
last couple of years um so yeah it's uh

3684
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:21,439
it's been a trap that's for sure so yeah

3685
02:56:21,439 --> 02:56:23,359
thank you all for having me today um as

3686
02:56:23,359 --> 02:56:25,760
as introduced i'm patrick

3687
02:56:25,760 --> 02:56:27,359
i was an architect at the ministry for

3688
02:56:27,359 --> 02:56:29,040
about two years uh finished up just

3689
02:56:29,040 --> 02:56:31,279
yesterday actually um

3690
02:56:31,279 --> 02:56:33,279
so i first joined the ministry uh on a

3691
02:56:33,279 --> 02:56:34,720
friday afternoon and then spent the

3692
02:56:34,720 --> 02:56:36,399
weekend writing the first requirements

3693
02:56:36,399 --> 02:56:37,600
for what would turn out to be the covert

3694
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:39,840
tracer app um and in the last two years

3695
02:56:39,840 --> 02:56:41,120
i've also had the privilege of working

3696
02:56:41,120 --> 02:56:42,640
on pretty much every digital service

3697
02:56:42,640 --> 02:56:43,920
that we've built

3698
02:56:43,920 --> 02:56:45,279
as part of the pandemic response

3699
02:56:45,279 --> 02:56:47,199
including book my vaccine

3700
02:56:47,199 --> 02:56:48,399
my current record on the my health

3701
02:56:48,399 --> 02:56:49,840
account service

3702
02:56:49,840 --> 02:56:51,439
and more recently was the technology

3703
02:56:51,439 --> 02:56:53,600
lead for the vaccine passes and

3704
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:54,640
vaccination certificates for

3705
02:56:54,640 --> 02:56:56,399
international travel so

3706
02:56:56,399 --> 02:56:58,399
if you used a qr code as part of the

3707
02:56:58,399 --> 02:57:00,560
pandemic response i'm terribly sorry

3708
02:57:00,560 --> 02:57:03,040
it's probably my fault

3709
02:57:03,040 --> 02:57:04,880
obviously views expressed in this talk

3710
02:57:04,880 --> 02:57:05,920
of mine i don't represent the new

3711
02:57:05,920 --> 02:57:06,880
zealand government or the ministry of

3712
02:57:06,880 --> 02:57:09,120
health particularly not anymore

3713
02:57:09,120 --> 02:57:10,960
so if you take umbrage to what's been

3714
02:57:10,960 --> 02:57:13,120
said here come and talk to me

3715
02:57:13,120 --> 02:57:15,279
and we'll we can see what we make of

3716
02:57:15,279 --> 02:57:17,120
that so today we're here to talk about

3717
02:57:17,120 --> 02:57:18,960
the cover tracer app

3718
02:57:18,960 --> 02:57:20,160
it's one of the first of the digital

3719
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:22,000
products that the ministry um shipped

3720
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:23,359
directly to consumers there was actually

3721
02:57:23,359 --> 02:57:25,040
another app that beat us out by a week

3722
02:57:25,040 --> 02:57:26,960
or two that was for health workers but

3723
02:57:26,960 --> 02:57:28,319
um but this is the one that we're

3724
02:57:28,319 --> 02:57:29,840
focusing on today so i originally

3725
02:57:29,840 --> 02:57:32,319
submitted this talk about a year ago um

3726
02:57:32,319 --> 02:57:33,520
i was checking in my emails the other

3727
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:34,880
day and it's about a year um and so

3728
02:57:34,880 --> 02:57:36,880
things were quite different then um for

3729
02:57:36,880 --> 02:57:37,840
those of you who are in new zealand

3730
02:57:37,840 --> 02:57:40,319
you'll remember uh we were still

3731
02:57:40,319 --> 02:57:42,319
in the middle of uh

3732
02:57:42,319 --> 02:57:43,840
all of these public health measures uh

3733
02:57:43,840 --> 02:57:46,000
scanning quite quite actively lots of

3734
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:47,680
things like that so i'm going to take a

3735
02:57:47,680 --> 02:57:49,279
bit of a trip down memory lane today

3736
02:57:49,279 --> 02:57:50,479
just to remind ourselves about what that

3737
02:57:50,479 --> 02:57:51,680
was like because today it's quite

3738
02:57:51,680 --> 02:57:52,800
different even though we're all here

3739
02:57:52,800 --> 02:57:54,720
with masks and passes to get into the

3740
02:57:54,720 --> 02:57:56,000
building it was a bit of a different

3741
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:57,199
time back then

3742
02:57:57,199 --> 02:57:58,720
and then talk about what we did to

3743
02:57:58,720 --> 02:58:00,319
secure covert tracer and the way we the

3744
02:58:00,319 --> 02:58:02,479
method that we took around doing that so

3745
02:58:02,479 --> 02:58:04,080
as mentioned at the beginning

3746
02:58:04,080 --> 02:58:05,840
we were having to learn about a whole

3747
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:07,120
lot of new stuff really really quickly

3748
02:58:07,120 --> 02:58:08,560
and change our ways of doing stuff

3749
02:58:08,560 --> 02:58:10,640
really rapidly and make sure that we did

3750
02:58:10,640 --> 02:58:12,399
that without

3751
02:58:12,399 --> 02:58:15,840
breaking anything or getting popped

3752
02:58:15,840 --> 02:58:16,640
so

3753
02:58:16,640 --> 02:58:18,720
to take us back a little bit

3754
02:58:18,720 --> 02:58:20,399
at the start of the pandemic response

3755
02:58:20,399 --> 02:58:21,840
and for the first 18 months or so we

3756
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:23,199
operated this elimination strategy for

3757
02:58:23,199 --> 02:58:24,000
those of you in new zealand you'll

3758
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:25,120
remember that

3759
02:58:25,120 --> 02:58:26,800
pretty pretty

3760
02:58:26,800 --> 02:58:28,160
well i would hope

3761
02:58:28,160 --> 02:58:29,920
the idea was if we found covert in the

3762
02:58:29,920 --> 02:58:31,600
community we would work really hard to

3763
02:58:31,600 --> 02:58:33,439
stamp it out get rid of it we did no

3764
02:58:33,439 --> 02:58:35,760
tolerance for it circulating right

3765
02:58:35,760 --> 02:58:37,359
if a person tested positive to covert in

3766
02:58:37,359 --> 02:58:38,479
the community they'd get a phone call

3767
02:58:38,479 --> 02:58:40,239
from a contact tracer typically that

3768
02:58:40,239 --> 02:58:41,680
person would be you know from their

3769
02:58:41,680 --> 02:58:43,760
public health unit local to their to

3770
02:58:43,760 --> 02:58:45,840
their region and there'd be a bunch of

3771
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:47,040
case interviews that would happen to

3772
02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:49,040
understand where that person had been

3773
02:58:49,040 --> 02:58:50,800
who they'd been in contact with and

3774
02:58:50,800 --> 02:58:51,920
assessing the likely risk of

3775
02:58:51,920 --> 02:58:53,199
transmission for that person having

3776
02:58:53,199 --> 02:58:55,439
passed the virus onto other people

3777
02:58:55,439 --> 02:58:57,520
that involves canvassing possible

3778
02:58:57,520 --> 02:58:59,120
locations of interest so places that

3779
02:58:59,120 --> 02:59:00,160
you've been

3780
02:59:00,160 --> 02:59:02,960
where transmission might have occurred

3781
02:59:02,960 --> 02:59:04,720
could be places like home or work it

3782
02:59:04,720 --> 02:59:06,479
could also be places in the public like

3783
02:59:06,479 --> 02:59:07,600
on a bus

3784
02:59:07,600 --> 02:59:09,600
and then linking those those locations

3785
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:11,760
of interest to close and casual contacts

3786
02:59:11,760 --> 02:59:13,279
that you might have exposed

3787
02:59:13,279 --> 02:59:15,040
the virus to and then finding out

3788
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:16,319
whether those people need to be traced

3789
02:59:16,319 --> 02:59:18,319
and isolating as well typically this

3790
02:59:18,319 --> 02:59:20,640
would happen over the phone uh a couple

3791
02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:21,600
of cases interviews might happen it

3792
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:22,720
would take usually about an hour or two

3793
02:59:22,720 --> 02:59:24,160
to do the case interview sometimes

3794
02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:26,080
longer sometimes less

3795
02:59:26,080 --> 02:59:27,920
the main challenges that were related to

3796
02:59:27,920 --> 02:59:28,960
that was actually just getting in touch

3797
02:59:28,960 --> 02:59:30,080
with people getting phone numbers and

3798
02:59:30,080 --> 02:59:31,680
contact details and finding people the

3799
02:59:31,680 --> 02:59:32,800
first time was one of the more

3800
02:59:32,800 --> 02:59:34,720
challenging things to do helping people

3801
02:59:34,720 --> 02:59:36,319
remember

3802
02:59:36,319 --> 02:59:38,319
who they've been in touch with

3803
02:59:38,319 --> 02:59:39,920
so that's there's two two aspects to

3804
02:59:39,920 --> 02:59:41,600
that the first is people that you don't

3805
02:59:41,600 --> 02:59:43,439
remember being being with and the other

3806
02:59:43,439 --> 02:59:45,040
one is the people who you don't know you

3807
02:59:45,040 --> 02:59:46,160
you know you're with you know who they

3808
02:59:46,160 --> 02:59:47,040
are

3809
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:48,720
and then the last thing was consistently

3810
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:50,319
identifying those locations of interest

3811
02:59:50,319 --> 02:59:51,760
so if you talk to one person on the

3812
02:59:51,760 --> 02:59:53,279
phone they say i was at this place when

3813
02:59:53,279 --> 02:59:54,800
you talk to another person on the phone

3814
02:59:54,800 --> 02:59:55,920
and they say they're at the same place

3815
02:59:55,920 --> 02:59:58,399
they need to use the same kind of

3816
02:59:58,399 --> 02:59:59,680
language to describe that place you

3817
02:59:59,680 --> 03:00:00,960
might have someone who refers to a cafe

3818
03:00:00,960 --> 03:00:02,560
by one name or a different name and it's

3819
03:00:02,560 --> 03:00:03,520
really important that we link those

3820
03:00:03,520 --> 03:00:04,640
things together to make sure that we're

3821
03:00:04,640 --> 03:00:06,960
tracing people the right way

3822
03:00:06,960 --> 03:00:08,319
so the main problems that the app sent

3823
03:00:08,319 --> 03:00:09,600
out to solve in the beginning was there

3824
03:00:09,600 --> 03:00:11,040
was two really uh in the first

3825
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:12,319
requirements document that we wrote the

3826
03:00:12,319 --> 03:00:13,680
first one was getting up-to-date contact

3827
03:00:13,680 --> 03:00:15,279
details from people sounds like a really

3828
03:00:15,279 --> 03:00:18,080
dumb problem um surprisingly i remember

3829
03:00:18,080 --> 03:00:19,120
this is the first thing that i got that

3830
03:00:19,120 --> 03:00:19,760
i

3831
03:00:19,760 --> 03:00:21,279
tasked with when i joined

3832
03:00:21,279 --> 03:00:22,560
and it's really down to the fact that

3833
03:00:22,560 --> 03:00:24,560
new zealand doesn't have a national

3834
03:00:24,560 --> 03:00:25,920
register or centralized register for

3835
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:27,920
contact details of people we've got

3836
03:00:27,920 --> 03:00:29,199
something kind of like that within the

3837
03:00:29,199 --> 03:00:30,479
health system called the national health

3838
03:00:30,479 --> 03:00:32,960
index but it's based on data that you

3839
03:00:32,960 --> 03:00:34,319
get you give to your general practice

3840
03:00:34,319 --> 03:00:35,359
typically

3841
03:00:35,359 --> 03:00:37,199
so for the most part the data that's in

3842
03:00:37,199 --> 03:00:38,960
that set is up to date the last time you

3843
03:00:38,960 --> 03:00:39,920
went to your general practice and i

3844
03:00:39,920 --> 03:00:41,120
don't know about many of you i certainly

3845
03:00:41,120 --> 03:00:42,319
know when i've moved cities it took me

3846
03:00:42,319 --> 03:00:44,399
about five years to go to my gp again

3847
03:00:44,399 --> 03:00:46,880
and so the the data the details that

3848
03:00:46,880 --> 03:00:47,920
they had for me with my parents home

3849
03:00:47,920 --> 03:00:50,720
phone number um and my and my mum and

3850
03:00:50,720 --> 03:00:52,800
dad's old address so

3851
03:00:52,800 --> 03:00:54,640
we knew at the time we figured about the

3852
03:00:54,640 --> 03:00:56,319
time about 70 of the details in the nhr

3853
03:00:56,319 --> 03:00:57,840
were up to date but we didn't know which

3854
03:00:57,840 --> 03:00:58,720
70

3855
03:00:58,720 --> 03:01:00,160
was up to date and so that was one of

3856
03:01:00,160 --> 03:01:01,760
the big challenges we had to start with

3857
03:01:01,760 --> 03:01:03,120
this also doesn't account for people who

3858
03:01:03,120 --> 03:01:04,479
are visitors to new zealand tourists and

3859
03:01:04,479 --> 03:01:06,720
what have you um because if they don't

3860
03:01:06,720 --> 03:01:07,920
that they don't interact with the health

3861
03:01:07,920 --> 03:01:08,960
system when they come to the country

3862
03:01:08,960 --> 03:01:10,319
they have no opportunity to load their

3863
03:01:10,319 --> 03:01:12,640
data into that into that register

3864
03:01:12,640 --> 03:01:14,000
the second problem we set out to solve

3865
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:15,199
was help people remember where they've

3866
03:01:15,199 --> 03:01:16,479
been and who they've seen so this is

3867
03:01:16,479 --> 03:01:18,960
actually where the most of the work went

3868
03:01:18,960 --> 03:01:20,160
primarily because it's actually quite a

3869
03:01:20,160 --> 03:01:22,479
hard sell to say to people

3870
03:01:22,479 --> 03:01:23,920
uh give us your contact details without

3871
03:01:23,920 --> 03:01:25,199
actually any other benefit or help to

3872
03:01:25,199 --> 03:01:26,560
them to get them to use to download and

3873
03:01:26,560 --> 03:01:28,560
use an app like this so human memory is

3874
03:01:28,560 --> 03:01:29,680
pretty bad at this kind of recall

3875
03:01:29,680 --> 03:01:30,880
particularly when you're in a stressful

3876
03:01:30,880 --> 03:01:32,080
situation where you've just been told

3877
03:01:32,080 --> 03:01:33,760
that you might have covered so knowing

3878
03:01:33,760 --> 03:01:34,880
the places that you've been to and who

3879
03:01:34,880 --> 03:01:36,160
you've been with and having a record of

3880
03:01:36,160 --> 03:01:38,000
that you can refer to is is really

3881
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:38,880
helpful for speeding up the

3882
03:01:38,880 --> 03:01:40,640
investigation process

3883
03:01:40,640 --> 03:01:42,080
so lots of the time the people that

3884
03:01:42,080 --> 03:01:43,040
you've been with the people in your

3885
03:01:43,040 --> 03:01:44,479
household you'll probably remember them

3886
03:01:44,479 --> 03:01:46,000
but quite often it's also just random

3887
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:47,680
people you don't know and part of the

3888
03:01:47,680 --> 03:01:49,439
contact tracing process is designed to

3889
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:51,279
try and

3890
03:01:51,279 --> 03:01:54,319
find those people as quickly as possible

3891
03:01:54,319 --> 03:01:56,080
and so we were doing this within a

3892
03:01:56,080 --> 03:01:57,680
pretty risky kind of environment so

3893
03:01:57,680 --> 03:01:59,520
there's a lot of complex intersections

3894
03:01:59,520 --> 03:02:02,479
of requirements and politics and and um

3895
03:02:02,479 --> 03:02:03,600
changing knowledge about the way the

3896
03:02:03,600 --> 03:02:05,760
pandemic was working and so a core part

3897
03:02:05,760 --> 03:02:07,760
of contact tracing is creating links

3898
03:02:07,760 --> 03:02:09,600
between people building a social graph

3899
03:02:09,600 --> 03:02:11,040
and mapping out that social graph to

3900
03:02:11,040 --> 03:02:12,960
manage risk and transmission

3901
03:02:12,960 --> 03:02:14,080
and at the time there was plenty of

3902
03:02:14,080 --> 03:02:15,439
concern about the privacy of doing that

3903
03:02:15,439 --> 03:02:17,439
it's a general it's by design quite a

3904
03:02:17,439 --> 03:02:19,279
privacy invasive process

3905
03:02:19,279 --> 03:02:20,720
you might remember there was a flood of

3906
03:02:20,720 --> 03:02:22,000
check-in solutions that came out there

3907
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:24,000
was lots of qr codes all over the place

3908
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:24,880
um

3909
03:02:24,880 --> 03:02:26,640
with solutions collecting data mostly

3910
03:02:26,640 --> 03:02:27,920
centrally so the idea was they'd

3911
03:02:27,920 --> 03:02:29,359
digitize that paper-based form that

3912
03:02:29,359 --> 03:02:30,319
you'd find

3913
03:02:30,319 --> 03:02:31,680
at the front of at the front of places

3914
03:02:31,680 --> 03:02:32,800
that you'd go to and store it in a

3915
03:02:32,800 --> 03:02:34,399
central database

3916
03:02:34,399 --> 03:02:35,920
we had reports in the media about data

3917
03:02:35,920 --> 03:02:36,960
from that being misused you might

3918
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:38,479
remember there was a guy who worked at

3919
03:02:38,479 --> 03:02:40,479
subway who used the data that or used

3920
03:02:40,479 --> 03:02:42,000
the record offer

3921
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:43,199
off a paper-based register and use it to

3922
03:02:43,199 --> 03:02:44,560
harass a customer which is pretty not

3923
03:02:44,560 --> 03:02:45,439
good

3924
03:02:45,439 --> 03:02:47,279
um and and those are the kind of things

3925
03:02:47,279 --> 03:02:48,399
that we were really those were really

3926
03:02:48,399 --> 03:02:49,680
visceral for us at the time when we were

3927
03:02:49,680 --> 03:02:50,720
trying to build this was how do we make

3928
03:02:50,720 --> 03:02:51,760
sure that we build something that people

3929
03:02:51,760 --> 03:02:52,720
are going to trust that they're going to

3930
03:02:52,720 --> 03:02:53,920
understand

3931
03:02:53,920 --> 03:02:55,040
and it's going to give them control over

3932
03:02:55,040 --> 03:02:57,199
what they do there's a general trust and

3933
03:02:57,199 --> 03:02:58,479
skepticism of government motives and

3934
03:02:58,479 --> 03:02:59,680
ability as well you know we don't have a

3935
03:02:59,680 --> 03:03:00,800
great reputation of building good

3936
03:03:00,800 --> 03:03:03,520
technology in this space um and that's

3937
03:03:03,520 --> 03:03:05,279
for good reason too you know and part of

3938
03:03:05,279 --> 03:03:06,560
my thing was you know i can get up on

3939
03:03:06,560 --> 03:03:07,760
the stage and tell everybody hey look

3940
03:03:07,760 --> 03:03:09,040
you know trust me i'm doing the right

3941
03:03:09,040 --> 03:03:11,680
thing but i don't have

3942
03:03:11,680 --> 03:03:12,880
not everyone's going to do that and so

3943
03:03:12,880 --> 03:03:14,800
our solutions had to be had to take into

3944
03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:16,479
account that that distrust and that fear

3945
03:03:16,479 --> 03:03:18,399
about surveillance and overreach

3946
03:03:18,399 --> 03:03:20,160
and whatever we built needed so that

3947
03:03:20,160 --> 03:03:21,439
means whatever we built needed to be

3948
03:03:21,439 --> 03:03:22,720
technically privacy preserving we had to

3949
03:03:22,720 --> 03:03:23,680
make sure the technology and the

3950
03:03:23,680 --> 03:03:25,120
security and all that stuff worked but

3951
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:26,720
we also had to be visibly seen to be

3952
03:03:26,720 --> 03:03:27,840
doing that as well because it's no good

3953
03:03:27,840 --> 03:03:29,359
to build great tech if people don't see

3954
03:03:29,359 --> 03:03:30,399
that you're doing the things that they

3955
03:03:30,399 --> 03:03:32,239
expect you to do which is where social

3956
03:03:32,239 --> 03:03:33,520
license and expectations around

3957
03:03:33,520 --> 03:03:34,880
technology come into it so social

3958
03:03:34,880 --> 03:03:36,000
license

3959
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:37,600
is a very um

3960
03:03:37,600 --> 03:03:39,199
it's a nebulous idea in some senses but

3961
03:03:39,199 --> 03:03:41,279
it's the concept that the public gives a

3962
03:03:41,279 --> 03:03:43,359
service like this a license to operate

3963
03:03:43,359 --> 03:03:44,960
based on the comfort that the public has

3964
03:03:44,960 --> 03:03:46,160
that we're doing the right things in

3965
03:03:46,160 --> 03:03:48,080
line with their expectations and it's

3966
03:03:48,080 --> 03:03:49,600
not something we can we have to earn

3967
03:03:49,600 --> 03:03:50,800
social license it's not a thing that we

3968
03:03:50,800 --> 03:03:52,880
can buy and so we had to do that by

3969
03:03:52,880 --> 03:03:54,479
demonstrating that the work that we're

3970
03:03:54,479 --> 03:03:55,279
doing

3971
03:03:55,279 --> 03:03:56,560
and if we didn't do that it didn't

3972
03:03:56,560 --> 03:03:57,920
matter how good the tech was people just

3973
03:03:57,920 --> 03:03:59,920
simply wouldn't use it

3974
03:03:59,920 --> 03:04:01,279
from a technology perspective as well

3975
03:04:01,279 --> 03:04:02,640
there's also plenty of complexity we're

3976
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:04,399
working in an environment that was

3977
03:04:04,399 --> 03:04:06,080
unfamiliar to the ministry at the time

3978
03:04:06,080 --> 03:04:07,760
um the first consumer-based

3979
03:04:07,760 --> 03:04:09,680
consumer-facing application or using

3980
03:04:09,680 --> 03:04:11,600
cloud-based tech

3981
03:04:11,600 --> 03:04:13,040
most of the technology there and this is

3982
03:04:13,040 --> 03:04:14,399
a little bit uncharitable you know the

3983
03:04:14,399 --> 03:04:15,760
typical approach was chuck everything

3984
03:04:15,760 --> 03:04:18,640
behind the f5 and we'll be fine um

3985
03:04:18,640 --> 03:04:19,600
can't do that with this kind of

3986
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:20,640
application that's not really the kind

3987
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:22,319
of thing that works that way so we had

3988
03:04:22,319 --> 03:04:24,319
to do this really quickly as well

3989
03:04:24,319 --> 03:04:26,160
as metal said you know we it wasn't that

3990
03:04:26,160 --> 03:04:28,160
far from the from the truth we i joined

3991
03:04:28,160 --> 03:04:29,040
the minister and they said right we've

3992
03:04:29,040 --> 03:04:30,000
got a week we've got to ship the first

3993
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:31,199
version the prime minister expects it in

3994
03:04:31,199 --> 03:04:33,199
two and we were like well okay you can't

3995
03:04:33,199 --> 03:04:34,399
really go and tally stakeholder to go

3996
03:04:34,399 --> 03:04:36,399
out to go jump in the lake at that level

3997
03:04:36,399 --> 03:04:37,199
so

3998
03:04:37,199 --> 03:04:38,319
um

3999
03:04:38,319 --> 03:04:39,760
we we started built something quickly

4000
03:04:39,760 --> 03:04:41,040
iterate to make it better but it meant

4001
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:42,560
but we couldn't skimp on the privacy and

4002
03:04:42,560 --> 03:04:43,760
the security aspect the solution to

4003
03:04:43,760 --> 03:04:45,520
start with it just wasn't an option and

4004
03:04:45,520 --> 03:04:47,279
so those two come back those two factors

4005
03:04:47,279 --> 03:04:48,800
combined meant that there was a really

4006
03:04:48,800 --> 03:04:49,920
seriously high risk that we were going

4007
03:04:49,920 --> 03:04:51,680
to make a mistake or do something wrong

4008
03:04:51,680 --> 03:04:52,960
and finding out the hard way at one of

4009
03:04:52,960 --> 03:04:54,479
those 1pm press briefings that we'd done

4010
03:04:54,479 --> 03:04:57,840
something stupid so

4011
03:04:58,160 --> 03:04:59,279
that that was one of the things that

4012
03:04:59,279 --> 03:05:00,880
drove us quite quite a lot in the design

4013
03:05:00,880 --> 03:05:02,560
of the solution and how we did it

4014
03:05:02,560 --> 03:05:04,080
there also really wasn't a whole lot of

4015
03:05:04,080 --> 03:05:06,160
existing this is what good looks like we

4016
03:05:06,160 --> 03:05:07,359
didn't have a whole lot of existing

4017
03:05:07,359 --> 03:05:09,439
international implement examples of this

4018
03:05:09,439 --> 03:05:11,120
the bluetooth-based proximity tracing

4019
03:05:11,120 --> 03:05:12,239
and things that we that we're all used

4020
03:05:12,239 --> 03:05:13,840
to now didn't even apple and google

4021
03:05:13,840 --> 03:05:15,439
hadn't even announced it at that point

4022
03:05:15,439 --> 03:05:16,640
singapore had done some interesting

4023
03:05:16,640 --> 03:05:19,040
stuff but it was still very very nascent

4024
03:05:19,040 --> 03:05:21,359
um and with something this high profile

4025
03:05:21,359 --> 03:05:22,239
and

4026
03:05:22,239 --> 03:05:24,239
for as i mentioned lots of parts of the

4027
03:05:24,239 --> 03:05:26,160
population found it quite controversial

4028
03:05:26,160 --> 03:05:27,520
there's always a risk of the bad people

4029
03:05:27,520 --> 03:05:28,880
doing bad things for their own for their

4030
03:05:28,880 --> 03:05:30,479
own gain and and so we had to make sure

4031
03:05:30,479 --> 03:05:32,399
that we were ready for that too

4032
03:05:32,399 --> 03:05:34,080
underneath all of this too was just this

4033
03:05:34,080 --> 03:05:35,199
general uncertainty about what the

4034
03:05:35,199 --> 03:05:36,720
future held we we didn't know what was

4035
03:05:36,720 --> 03:05:39,120
coming uh it's it's quaint to look back

4036
03:05:39,120 --> 03:05:40,319
in hindsight and see where we are now

4037
03:05:40,319 --> 03:05:42,560
but at the time we had no idea um we

4038
03:05:42,560 --> 03:05:43,439
were getting new and changing

4039
03:05:43,439 --> 03:05:44,880
requirements almost daily we were having

4040
03:05:44,880 --> 03:05:46,880
to be really reactive and to changes and

4041
03:05:46,880 --> 03:05:48,640
pivot to to understand what was coming

4042
03:05:48,640 --> 03:05:49,279
and

4043
03:05:49,279 --> 03:05:50,560
and and how we needed to build

4044
03:05:50,560 --> 03:05:52,000
technology to better to better serve the

4045
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,399
contact traces um we also had a contact

4046
03:05:54,399 --> 03:05:55,439
tracing business that was actually

4047
03:05:55,439 --> 03:05:56,800
really just focused on contact racing

4048
03:05:56,800 --> 03:05:58,000
trying to sit down and say hey we'd love

4049
03:05:58,000 --> 03:05:58,960
to talk to you about an app that can

4050
03:05:58,960 --> 03:06:00,000
make things better they're just like

4051
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,720
cool i don't care i'm really busy so we

4052
03:06:02,720 --> 03:06:04,479
had to really really get make the most

4053
03:06:04,479 --> 03:06:05,680
of the time we had and make some really

4054
03:06:05,680 --> 03:06:08,000
smart decisions and then get on with it

4055
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:09,120
and doing all of that in the really

4056
03:06:09,120 --> 03:06:11,680
unusual working environment i spent um

4057
03:06:11,680 --> 03:06:13,520
well everyone was remote obviously i

4058
03:06:13,520 --> 03:06:14,800
never went into the office and the for

4059
03:06:14,800 --> 03:06:16,080
the first couple of months and i've

4060
03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:17,439
never spent so many contiguous hours on

4061
03:06:17,439 --> 03:06:18,640
zoom meetings pretty sure all of you

4062
03:06:18,640 --> 03:06:20,239
would be the same but

4063
03:06:20,239 --> 03:06:22,160
yeah i i think you know starting the

4064
03:06:22,160 --> 03:06:23,840
days at seven o'clock in the morning and

4065
03:06:23,840 --> 03:06:25,279
finishing at 9 30 at night and spending

4066
03:06:25,279 --> 03:06:26,479
the whole day sitting in a chair on zoom

4067
03:06:26,479 --> 03:06:27,680
was not something that i'm keen to go

4068
03:06:27,680 --> 03:06:28,960
back to

4069
03:06:28,960 --> 03:06:30,560
and on top of all of this the daily

4070
03:06:30,560 --> 03:06:32,399
media briefings and public scrutiny we

4071
03:06:32,399 --> 03:06:34,399
had meant that any mistake that we made

4072
03:06:34,399 --> 03:06:36,720
would be amplified ridiculous amounts

4073
03:06:36,720 --> 03:06:38,000
and so we just had to be really really

4074
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:39,520
conscious about that

4075
03:06:39,520 --> 03:06:41,359
so what do we do well we built this this

4076
03:06:41,359 --> 03:06:43,279
blue built this app all of you i'm sure

4077
03:06:43,279 --> 03:06:44,880
were just uh absolutely thrilled to

4078
03:06:44,880 --> 03:06:46,160
download it on the first time it came

4079
03:06:46,160 --> 03:06:49,120
out um it has uh so the first thing we

4080
03:06:49,120 --> 03:06:50,160
did was actually build a website that

4081
03:06:50,160 --> 03:06:51,199
you could give us your name and phone

4082
03:06:51,199 --> 03:06:52,239
number with

4083
03:06:52,239 --> 03:06:53,760
and demographic information like address

4084
03:06:53,760 --> 03:06:54,800
and gender and things that help you

4085
03:06:54,800 --> 03:06:57,120
remember uh sorry help us find you if we

4086
03:06:57,120 --> 03:06:58,720
need to find you amongst amongst the

4087
03:06:58,720 --> 03:07:00,880
population of people uh we save that in

4088
03:07:00,880 --> 03:07:02,479
the database next to the contact tracing

4089
03:07:02,479 --> 03:07:03,680
system so that they could search for it

4090
03:07:03,680 --> 03:07:05,120
while also not mixing it up with all of

4091
03:07:05,120 --> 03:07:06,319
the other contact tracing data that we

4092
03:07:06,319 --> 03:07:08,000
were keeping and a digital diary that

4093
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:09,279
kept a record of what you where you'd

4094
03:07:09,279 --> 03:07:10,720
been and the places that you'd been with

4095
03:07:10,720 --> 03:07:13,279
in a database locally on your phone

4096
03:07:13,279 --> 03:07:14,399
you could create those entries by

4097
03:07:14,399 --> 03:07:15,680
scanning a qr code like the one on the

4098
03:07:15,680 --> 03:07:17,120
screen if you've got the app on your

4099
03:07:17,120 --> 03:07:18,080
phone you want to scan that you might

4100
03:07:18,080 --> 03:07:20,560
get some get some little things

4101
03:07:20,560 --> 03:07:22,080
and then that qr code had a unique

4102
03:07:22,080 --> 03:07:23,840
number in it the idea was that you could

4103
03:07:23,840 --> 03:07:24,880
um

4104
03:07:24,880 --> 03:07:26,239
would use that number to be able to link

4105
03:07:26,239 --> 03:07:28,080
link the same places together and later

4106
03:07:28,080 --> 03:07:29,279
on we made it so that you could manually

4107
03:07:29,279 --> 03:07:31,359
record entries as well

4108
03:07:31,359 --> 03:07:32,800
putting the diary on the phone was one

4109
03:07:32,800 --> 03:07:33,920
of the more significant decisions we

4110
03:07:33,920 --> 03:07:35,279
made quite early on

4111
03:07:35,279 --> 03:07:36,560
and it was a deliberate trade-off that

4112
03:07:36,560 --> 03:07:38,000
we made with respect to the privacy

4113
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:40,000
versus usefulness of the app so having

4114
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:41,600
this kind of data in the cloud the idea

4115
03:07:41,600 --> 03:07:43,520
of this massive database full of people

4116
03:07:43,520 --> 03:07:45,520
places where people had been in any form

4117
03:07:45,520 --> 03:07:46,960
even if it was anonymized was something

4118
03:07:46,960 --> 03:07:48,880
that we didn't really like the idea of

4119
03:07:48,880 --> 03:07:50,239
and we wanted we tried really hard to

4120
03:07:50,239 --> 03:07:52,319
avoid a situation we would do that the

4121
03:07:52,319 --> 03:07:53,600
main drawback with that approach was

4122
03:07:53,600 --> 03:07:55,199
that it didn't give contact tracers any

4123
03:07:55,199 --> 03:07:57,120
visibility about the potential exposure

4124
03:07:57,120 --> 03:07:59,040
of places unless someone contacted us so

4125
03:07:59,040 --> 03:08:01,040
there's no way for us to know that which

4126
03:08:01,040 --> 03:08:03,439
was a real challenge

4127
03:08:03,439 --> 03:08:05,359
and but one other thing like i said that

4128
03:08:05,359 --> 03:08:06,399
was one of the trade-offs that we made

4129
03:08:06,399 --> 03:08:08,080
between privacy and utility for the

4130
03:08:08,080 --> 03:08:10,000
content tracing team we did consider

4131
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:11,199
this kind of middle ground where we'd

4132
03:08:11,199 --> 03:08:13,120
like upload this anonymous identifier

4133
03:08:13,120 --> 03:08:14,319
and then try and map it back and do all

4134
03:08:14,319 --> 03:08:15,680
this other crazy stuff but in the end we

4135
03:08:15,680 --> 03:08:17,520
figured it just muddied the message and

4136
03:08:17,520 --> 03:08:19,040
so the message that we got to was really

4137
03:08:19,040 --> 03:08:21,120
simple the data that you collect via the

4138
03:08:21,120 --> 03:08:22,720
app sits on your phone it stays on your

4139
03:08:22,720 --> 03:08:23,840
phone and it only leaves your phone

4140
03:08:23,840 --> 03:08:24,960
unless you if you choose to share it

4141
03:08:24,960 --> 03:08:26,800
with us and that gave people a lot of

4142
03:08:26,800 --> 03:08:28,239
agency about controlling the

4143
03:08:28,239 --> 03:08:29,520
participation that they had with

4144
03:08:29,520 --> 03:08:31,359
technology because ultimately for us the

4145
03:08:31,359 --> 03:08:32,720
use of the technology and having the

4146
03:08:32,720 --> 03:08:34,080
record even if you never shared it with

4147
03:08:34,080 --> 03:08:36,399
us electronically was still better than

4148
03:08:36,399 --> 03:08:37,600
not having it because when you're on the

4149
03:08:37,600 --> 03:08:39,760
phone you can read it yourself

4150
03:08:39,760 --> 03:08:40,880
and that turned out to be a really good

4151
03:08:40,880 --> 03:08:42,479
call because when bluetooth tracing

4152
03:08:42,479 --> 03:08:44,080
specs came out a couple of months later

4153
03:08:44,080 --> 03:08:45,359
they followed a similar approach with

4154
03:08:45,359 --> 03:08:46,640
the data being on the phone the user

4155
03:08:46,640 --> 03:08:48,720
initiates the sharing um and the

4156
03:08:48,720 --> 03:08:49,920
detection of the possible exposures

4157
03:08:49,920 --> 03:08:51,760
happens on the device as well and even

4158
03:08:51,760 --> 03:08:53,680
more reinforcing later later on was

4159
03:08:53,680 --> 03:08:55,120
apple released some requirements around

4160
03:08:55,120 --> 03:08:57,439
location-based data collection so

4161
03:08:57,439 --> 03:08:59,439
basically what we built and and the

4162
03:08:59,439 --> 03:09:00,720
requirements were exactly the same so we

4163
03:09:00,720 --> 03:09:01,680
didn't have to change anything which was

4164
03:09:01,680 --> 03:09:03,520
really good

4165
03:09:03,520 --> 03:09:05,279
for the qr code posters we experimented

4166
03:09:05,279 --> 03:09:07,040
a little bit i remember

4167
03:09:07,040 --> 03:09:08,319
trying to come up with a spec for this

4168
03:09:08,319 --> 03:09:09,279
and it was

4169
03:09:09,279 --> 03:09:10,399
um

4170
03:09:10,399 --> 03:09:13,040
very rapid but my main can so we looked

4171
03:09:13,040 --> 03:09:14,399
at the things like data matrices and

4172
03:09:14,399 --> 03:09:15,840
aztec codes we looked at other ways of

4173
03:09:15,840 --> 03:09:17,040
encoding it and then the end we settled

4174
03:09:17,040 --> 03:09:19,199
on a qr code with with a base64 encoded

4175
03:09:19,199 --> 03:09:20,960
json blog and we all know the tradeoff

4176
03:09:20,960 --> 03:09:22,479
of that was just this these really dense

4177
03:09:22,479 --> 03:09:23,680
qr codes and that's one of the most

4178
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:25,040
common pieces of feedback i get from

4179
03:09:25,040 --> 03:09:27,279
people was why is the qr code so tense

4180
03:09:27,279 --> 03:09:28,880
but i chose this primarily because the

4181
03:09:28,880 --> 03:09:30,399
qr codes and json decoding are really

4182
03:09:30,399 --> 03:09:31,600
well established technical patterns on

4183
03:09:31,600 --> 03:09:33,680
mobile so there was good battle battle

4184
03:09:33,680 --> 03:09:36,080
tested libraries that we could use to to

4185
03:09:36,080 --> 03:09:38,800
generate and and and parse them and the

4186
03:09:38,800 --> 03:09:40,479
major concern was at the time what

4187
03:09:40,479 --> 03:09:41,920
happens if we have a bug in the post is

4188
03:09:41,920 --> 03:09:43,279
that when someone scans it it causes

4189
03:09:43,279 --> 03:09:44,560
some weird thing and we have to get

4190
03:09:44,560 --> 03:09:45,680
everyone to reprint the posters again

4191
03:09:45,680 --> 03:09:48,239
because that'll be a disaster

4192
03:09:48,239 --> 03:09:49,359
so the front-end apps were initially

4193
03:09:49,359 --> 03:09:50,560
built using swift and kotlin using

4194
03:09:50,560 --> 03:09:52,479
native tech and then later migrated to

4195
03:09:52,479 --> 03:09:54,080
react native when bluetooth tracing came

4196
03:09:54,080 --> 03:09:55,279
along

4197
03:09:55,279 --> 03:09:56,800
in the design we treated the apps like

4198
03:09:56,800 --> 03:09:58,319
they were untrusted we said our security

4199
03:09:58,319 --> 03:09:59,920
boundary was our cloud services and the

4200
03:09:59,920 --> 03:10:01,279
app we just assumed that someone had

4201
03:10:01,279 --> 03:10:02,560
done dumb stuff with it or were doing

4202
03:10:02,560 --> 03:10:03,840
naughty things with it

4203
03:10:03,840 --> 03:10:05,520
and we let that kind of run on itself we

4204
03:10:05,520 --> 03:10:06,880
obviously had security controls on the

4205
03:10:06,880 --> 03:10:08,319
phone but our main security perimeter

4206
03:10:08,319 --> 03:10:09,680
was in the cloud which was really

4207
03:10:09,680 --> 03:10:10,800
important to how we structured our

4208
03:10:10,800 --> 03:10:13,439
security uh security approach so all

4209
03:10:13,439 --> 03:10:14,960
that all that all of the backend stuff

4210
03:10:14,960 --> 03:10:16,800
was on aws using serverless and api

4211
03:10:16,800 --> 03:10:18,399
driven architectures and it was

4212
03:10:18,399 --> 03:10:19,439
following all of the aws well

4213
03:10:19,439 --> 03:10:21,439
architected best practices uh which made

4214
03:10:21,439 --> 03:10:23,040
it really easy for us to to get going

4215
03:10:23,040 --> 03:10:25,040
and get things done quickly

4216
03:10:25,040 --> 03:10:26,720
so by the numbers uh there's a whole lot

4217
03:10:26,720 --> 03:10:27,680
of really big numbers with lots of

4218
03:10:27,680 --> 03:10:29,600
commas in them um the ones that i'm most

4219
03:10:29,600 --> 03:10:31,120
interested in here is or the ones that i

4220
03:10:31,120 --> 03:10:32,319
think are the most exciting and this is

4221
03:10:32,319 --> 03:10:33,840
really down to the team that that was

4222
03:10:33,840 --> 03:10:34,960
running this in the last little while

4223
03:10:34,960 --> 03:10:36,399
was the bluetooth tracing numbers there

4224
03:10:36,399 --> 03:10:38,880
so you know you can see we've got 81 000

4225
03:10:38,880 --> 03:10:40,720
at the time 81 000 devices that have

4226
03:10:40,720 --> 03:10:43,199
shared bluetooth tracing keys uh 300 and

4227
03:10:43,199 --> 03:10:44,319
something thousand alerts that have been

4228
03:10:44,319 --> 03:10:45,439
sent to people that might have been

4229
03:10:45,439 --> 03:10:47,279
exposed by bluetooth tracing

4230
03:10:47,279 --> 03:10:48,040
uh

4231
03:10:48,040 --> 03:10:50,720
804 million scans of qr codes i mean

4232
03:10:50,720 --> 03:10:51,760
that's a bit of a vanity number but it's

4233
03:10:51,760 --> 03:10:53,520
still very big which is nice

4234
03:10:53,520 --> 03:10:54,640
one of the things that i thought was

4235
03:10:54,640 --> 03:10:56,399
quite cool was

4236
03:10:56,399 --> 03:10:58,720
if you're a person who used the app

4237
03:10:58,720 --> 03:11:00,960
and during a case investigation it

4238
03:11:00,960 --> 03:11:02,720
reduced the time there was one instance

4239
03:11:02,720 --> 03:11:03,680
that i was talking to our contact

4240
03:11:03,680 --> 03:11:04,800
tracing team they said it reduced the

4241
03:11:04,800 --> 03:11:06,800
time from eight hours to one hour to

4242
03:11:06,800 --> 03:11:08,960
send out all the location alerts to

4243
03:11:08,960 --> 03:11:10,800
that person's potential contacts and if

4244
03:11:10,800 --> 03:11:11,920
you think about that in the context of a

4245
03:11:11,920 --> 03:11:13,120
massive outbreak like we're having in

4246
03:11:13,120 --> 03:11:14,560
delta that's huge that's a massive time

4247
03:11:14,560 --> 03:11:16,159
saving for something that seems quite

4248
03:11:16,159 --> 03:11:18,000
quite trivial and so that was something

4249
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:19,600
that i really enjoyed you know different

4250
03:11:19,600 --> 03:11:20,880
to these to these numbers which is just

4251
03:11:20,880 --> 03:11:23,120
the sort of the vanity metrics i guess

4252
03:11:23,120 --> 03:11:23,920
um

4253
03:11:23,920 --> 03:11:24,640
one of the other things that's

4254
03:11:24,640 --> 03:11:26,080
interesting you know 3.6 million people

4255
03:11:26,080 --> 03:11:27,439
registered their contact details with us

4256
03:11:27,439 --> 03:11:29,600
which is really cool uh but we're also

4257
03:11:29,600 --> 03:11:30,720
just going through the process in fact

4258
03:11:30,720 --> 03:11:32,159
just did it last week where we're

4259
03:11:32,159 --> 03:11:33,359
deleting that data now because we don't

4260
03:11:33,359 --> 03:11:35,199
need it so we've decommissioned the

4261
03:11:35,199 --> 03:11:36,720
ability for you to view to register in

4262
03:11:36,720 --> 03:11:37,680
the app and we've deleted all that

4263
03:11:37,680 --> 03:11:38,880
contact information because we've got

4264
03:11:38,880 --> 03:11:40,000
better sources for it now and that was

4265
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:41,120
in line with some of the privacy

4266
03:11:41,120 --> 03:11:43,920
commitments we made in the app early on

4267
03:11:43,920 --> 03:11:44,960
so to talk a little bit about the

4268
03:11:44,960 --> 03:11:47,199
security assurance process i'm not in

4269
03:11:47,199 --> 03:11:48,640
the security team my security friends

4270
03:11:48,640 --> 03:11:49,760
are all sitting in the airline somewhere

4271
03:11:49,760 --> 03:11:50,800
today so hopefully i say things that

4272
03:11:50,800 --> 03:11:52,960
they agree with um but the uh the

4273
03:11:52,960 --> 03:11:54,319
curvature like i said was the first

4274
03:11:54,319 --> 03:11:56,319
digital product we shipped uh and it was

4275
03:11:56,319 --> 03:11:57,680
the largest direct to production app

4276
03:11:57,680 --> 03:12:00,000
that we'd ever done before

4277
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:02,399
so when we first started the security uh

4278
03:12:02,399 --> 03:12:04,080
process was very much the sort of

4279
03:12:04,080 --> 03:12:06,239
standard cna security and accreditation

4280
03:12:06,239 --> 03:12:07,760
process designed for enterprise and

4281
03:12:07,760 --> 03:12:09,760
sector-facing it delivery it's pretty

4282
03:12:09,760 --> 03:12:11,760
reactive um it tended to be the gate you

4283
03:12:11,760 --> 03:12:12,880
got through at the end so you'd go and

4284
03:12:12,880 --> 03:12:13,920
do all your work and you'd get to the

4285
03:12:13,920 --> 03:12:15,120
end and they'd do the assessments and

4286
03:12:15,120 --> 03:12:16,000
tell you all the things you've done

4287
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:17,680
wrong and then you go back and fix them

4288
03:12:17,680 --> 03:12:19,199
which was you know a line in the sand

4289
03:12:19,199 --> 03:12:20,319
approach that was intended to be done

4290
03:12:20,319 --> 03:12:21,680
every couple of years but it was really

4291
03:12:21,680 --> 03:12:22,960
inhibited it didn't really work for

4292
03:12:22,960 --> 03:12:25,359
rapid iterative development processes

4293
03:12:25,359 --> 03:12:26,640
some of those early releases had some

4294
03:12:26,640 --> 03:12:28,479
really ridiculous deadlines i'm not sure

4295
03:12:28,479 --> 03:12:29,840
if any of the pen testers that pen

4296
03:12:29,840 --> 03:12:31,040
tested the app in the early days are in

4297
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:32,880
the room if you are i'm very sorry

4298
03:12:32,880 --> 03:12:34,640
we gave you like a weekend to test the

4299
03:12:34,640 --> 03:12:36,960
first version it was insane um and they

4300
03:12:36,960 --> 03:12:39,439
did some some really crazy hours uh and

4301
03:12:39,439 --> 03:12:41,120
and went above and beyond to make to

4302
03:12:41,120 --> 03:12:42,720
make the app to make sure the app was

4303
03:12:42,720 --> 03:12:44,560
built right and and i'm really grateful

4304
03:12:44,560 --> 03:12:46,399
for the work that they did

4305
03:12:46,399 --> 03:12:47,359
but it wasn't something that was going

4306
03:12:47,359 --> 03:12:48,479
to scale we were going to burn people

4307
03:12:48,479 --> 03:12:49,760
out like crazy if we did that for too

4308
03:12:49,760 --> 03:12:50,479
long

4309
03:12:50,479 --> 03:12:52,560
we also took a policy-based approach to

4310
03:12:52,560 --> 03:12:54,399
setting controls for those of you that

4311
03:12:54,399 --> 03:12:55,600
remember the first version of the app

4312
03:12:55,600 --> 03:12:56,560
required you'd have username and

4313
03:12:56,560 --> 03:12:57,760
password you'll also remember it

4314
03:12:57,760 --> 03:12:59,680
required you to have an nzism compliant

4315
03:12:59,680 --> 03:13:01,920
password uh i don't know how many i mean

4316
03:13:01,920 --> 03:13:03,199
all of you i'm sure have inset in

4317
03:13:03,199 --> 03:13:04,479
compliance internet incompliant

4318
03:13:04,479 --> 03:13:05,840
passwords because you're all you know up

4319
03:13:05,840 --> 03:13:07,120
to speed with that but most of the

4320
03:13:07,120 --> 03:13:09,279
public don't so most people when they

4321
03:13:09,279 --> 03:13:11,120
registered for the app they had to make

4322
03:13:11,120 --> 03:13:12,319
up a new password they'd never used

4323
03:13:12,319 --> 03:13:13,920
before and then when they got logged out

4324
03:13:13,920 --> 03:13:15,439
after 30 days because of a different bug

4325
03:13:15,439 --> 03:13:16,960
we found or a different design decision

4326
03:13:16,960 --> 03:13:19,199
we found in the amazon's cognito service

4327
03:13:19,199 --> 03:13:20,479
um

4328
03:13:20,479 --> 03:13:21,680
everyone had to reset their passwords

4329
03:13:21,680 --> 03:13:23,040
again so the most common flow was people

4330
03:13:23,040 --> 03:13:24,399
would log out they'd try and log in

4331
03:13:24,399 --> 03:13:25,600
they'd forget their password they reset

4332
03:13:25,600 --> 03:13:26,880
it then they'd come back and reset and

4333
03:13:26,880 --> 03:13:28,000
that would happen every 30 days it was

4334
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:29,199
just a massive complexity that didn't

4335
03:13:29,199 --> 03:13:31,120
really add any value but because the

4336
03:13:31,120 --> 03:13:32,640
only thing that we had

4337
03:13:32,640 --> 03:13:34,239
in the toolkit was nzic and that was

4338
03:13:34,239 --> 03:13:35,520
what we used and so we didn't have any

4339
03:13:35,520 --> 03:13:36,880
pragmatic ways of thinking about

4340
03:13:36,880 --> 03:13:38,159
policies that would be that would be

4341
03:13:38,159 --> 03:13:41,120
applicable in a consumer scenario

4342
03:13:41,120 --> 03:13:42,720
so as we started building more things to

4343
03:13:42,720 --> 03:13:44,159
support the pandemic response the curve

4344
03:13:44,159 --> 03:13:45,760
traceroute being the start of that the

4345
03:13:45,760 --> 03:13:47,199
pace of building things didn't slow down

4346
03:13:47,199 --> 03:13:48,880
we realized we had to adapt so the

4347
03:13:48,880 --> 03:13:50,239
security team introduced this concept of

4348
03:13:50,239 --> 03:13:52,080
shifting security to the left which

4349
03:13:52,080 --> 03:13:53,359
means our security team gets more

4350
03:13:53,359 --> 03:13:54,960
involved in the design and the delivery

4351
03:13:54,960 --> 03:13:56,239
of the apps as we're building them as

4352
03:13:56,239 --> 03:13:57,359
opposed to being something that they

4353
03:13:57,359 --> 03:13:58,640
assess at the end

4354
03:13:58,640 --> 03:14:01,359
uh that ended up being something i was

4355
03:14:01,359 --> 03:14:03,359
incredibly grateful for so by the time

4356
03:14:03,359 --> 03:14:05,359
we'd get to the building and the release

4357
03:14:05,359 --> 03:14:06,720
of the app a whole bunch of

4358
03:14:06,720 --> 03:14:07,760
collaborative work had already been done

4359
03:14:07,760 --> 03:14:09,439
with the security team to effectively

4360
03:14:09,439 --> 03:14:10,720
set controls and make pragmatic

4361
03:14:10,720 --> 03:14:12,399
decisions about what we could and could

4362
03:14:12,399 --> 03:14:14,000
and couldn't do and that was baked into

4363
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:15,840
the designer's solution and it means

4364
03:14:15,840 --> 03:14:16,960
that the results of the independent

4365
03:14:16,960 --> 03:14:18,479
penetration test and assessments that we

4366
03:14:18,479 --> 03:14:21,120
did at the end were way more predictable

4367
03:14:21,120 --> 03:14:22,720
and less likely to derail the go live

4368
03:14:22,720 --> 03:14:24,080
dates which was really important for us

4369
03:14:24,080 --> 03:14:25,520
at the time

4370
03:14:25,520 --> 03:14:26,960
that also changed the perception of the

4371
03:14:26,960 --> 03:14:28,479
security team to be from you know from

4372
03:14:28,479 --> 03:14:29,520
people who are

4373
03:14:29,520 --> 03:14:31,520
i'm sure some of you would like to not

4374
03:14:31,520 --> 03:14:32,479
not have this but you know there's often

4375
03:14:32,479 --> 03:14:33,760
a reputation of security people saying

4376
03:14:33,760 --> 03:14:35,040
no you know they're the people you go to

4377
03:14:35,040 --> 03:14:37,120
if you want to have have no told you

4378
03:14:37,120 --> 03:14:38,960
um and they always mess up your best

4379
03:14:38,960 --> 03:14:40,080
laid plans you know we had a go live

4380
03:14:40,080 --> 03:14:41,279
date and the security team said nuts and

4381
03:14:41,279 --> 03:14:42,479
secure and now we have to go and deal

4382
03:14:42,479 --> 03:14:43,520
with that and it's the security team's

4383
03:14:43,520 --> 03:14:44,880
fault and that's not what the re that's

4384
03:14:44,880 --> 03:14:46,399
not what the reality is right

4385
03:14:46,399 --> 03:14:48,000
um but

4386
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:49,920
what happened was that the security team

4387
03:14:49,920 --> 03:14:51,120
that we worked with you know shifted to

4388
03:14:51,120 --> 03:14:52,479
be a team that's there to help us safely

4389
03:14:52,479 --> 03:14:53,680
and proactively work together to get

4390
03:14:53,680 --> 03:14:55,120
done to get things done with with

4391
03:14:55,120 --> 03:14:57,840
confidence uh and that shift happened

4392
03:14:57,840 --> 03:14:58,960
you know where they started becoming

4393
03:14:58,960 --> 03:15:00,399
more proactive more involved in the

4394
03:15:00,399 --> 03:15:02,159
design stages and and bringing in great

4395
03:15:02,159 --> 03:15:04,159
tooling and processes that helped us do

4396
03:15:04,159 --> 03:15:05,840
things with more confidence and it

4397
03:15:05,840 --> 03:15:07,680
didn't happen overnight and there's a

4398
03:15:07,680 --> 03:15:09,040
bunch of really smart people and we've

4399
03:15:09,040 --> 03:15:10,720
got really good backing from our exec

4400
03:15:10,720 --> 03:15:12,720
and our leadership as well to focus the

4401
03:15:12,720 --> 03:15:14,319
role at security play to get it to get

4402
03:15:14,319 --> 03:15:16,080
it as early in the process as possible

4403
03:15:16,080 --> 03:15:18,000
so they set out that strategy to change

4404
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:19,040
they feel it was filled by an

4405
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:20,560
organization that had some crushing

4406
03:15:20,560 --> 03:15:22,800
deadlines and some crazy demands and we

4407
03:15:22,800 --> 03:15:23,840
changed the security culture of the

4408
03:15:23,840 --> 03:15:25,040
business in a couple of months and i

4409
03:15:25,040 --> 03:15:26,560
think that's no small

4410
03:15:26,560 --> 03:15:29,359
no small thing and it and i think the

4411
03:15:29,359 --> 03:15:30,880
the outcome of that now is that health

4412
03:15:30,880 --> 03:15:32,720
has a much much much better and richer

4413
03:15:32,720 --> 03:15:34,080
way of managing security events and

4414
03:15:34,080 --> 03:15:36,159
managing security delivery that's just

4415
03:15:36,159 --> 03:15:37,359
come naturally to the way the product

4416
03:15:37,359 --> 03:15:38,880
teams work

4417
03:15:38,880 --> 03:15:40,239
so yeah like i said now we've got this

4418
03:15:40,239 --> 03:15:41,520
dedicated security staff working

4419
03:15:41,520 --> 03:15:43,680
alongside our dev teams they result in

4420
03:15:43,680 --> 03:15:45,199
they participate in regular activities

4421
03:15:45,199 --> 03:15:47,040
like sprint planning and stand-ups

4422
03:15:47,040 --> 03:15:48,399
they coordinate the assurance activities

4423
03:15:48,399 --> 03:15:49,760
manage comms or senior stakeholders all

4424
03:15:49,760 --> 03:15:51,120
of that stuff right

4425
03:15:51,120 --> 03:15:52,640
there's documented best practices about

4426
03:15:52,640 --> 03:15:54,399
how to do security architectures and

4427
03:15:54,399 --> 03:15:56,000
things in cloud environments that

4428
03:15:56,000 --> 03:15:58,399
baseline against the nz ism and the

4429
03:15:58,399 --> 03:16:00,159
health information security framework

4430
03:16:00,159 --> 03:16:01,680
we've got tools integrated into seams

4431
03:16:01,680 --> 03:16:02,800
and we've got socks that look after

4432
03:16:02,800 --> 03:16:04,080
style you know keep an eye on things

4433
03:16:04,080 --> 03:16:06,000
we've got automated crcd pipelines with

4434
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:07,920
static and secret dependency and dynamic

4435
03:16:07,920 --> 03:16:09,359
security testing

4436
03:16:09,359 --> 03:16:10,800
using gitlab and tenable and stuff like

4437
03:16:10,800 --> 03:16:12,479
that we've got automation that the

4438
03:16:12,479 --> 03:16:14,000
automation that looks for stuff on top

4439
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:16,000
of those regular assessments that we do

4440
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:18,159
so our team can focus and the security

4441
03:16:18,159 --> 03:16:19,840
assessments can focus on doing more high

4442
03:16:19,840 --> 03:16:22,000
value manual testing uh which is i think

4443
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:23,120
is really really powerful and really

4444
03:16:23,120 --> 03:16:25,439
valuable and these tools are really

4445
03:16:25,439 --> 03:16:26,880
and these processes actually really now

4446
03:16:26,880 --> 03:16:28,000
just give the business leaders the

4447
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:29,359
confidence that we've got security and

4448
03:16:29,359 --> 03:16:31,359
privacy under control and it gives us

4449
03:16:31,359 --> 03:16:32,399
more freedom to actually go and build

4450
03:16:32,399 --> 03:16:33,439
the interesting stuff without having to

4451
03:16:33,439 --> 03:16:34,800
spend a whole time justifying why we're

4452
03:16:34,800 --> 03:16:36,319
doing it and so the attitude for

4453
03:16:36,319 --> 03:16:38,000
security is much more now about how do

4454
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:39,600
we make this happen as opposed to how do

4455
03:16:39,600 --> 03:16:41,520
we work out why it's bad so how do we

4456
03:16:41,520 --> 03:16:42,720
make it happen becomes a thing that

4457
03:16:42,720 --> 03:16:44,000
means that we're way more collaborative

4458
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:46,960
and we work together way more way better

4459
03:16:46,960 --> 03:16:48,720
one of the other things we did was open

4460
03:16:48,720 --> 03:16:50,000
source the app so

4461
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:51,920
on github you'll find repositories that

4462
03:16:51,920 --> 03:16:52,960
have the source code for the front end

4463
03:16:52,960 --> 03:16:54,000
of the application as well as a

4464
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:55,520
documentation repo

4465
03:16:55,520 --> 03:16:56,880
we weren't really mature enough to work

4466
03:16:56,880 --> 03:16:58,319
in the open as much as i'd like to have

4467
03:16:58,319 --> 03:17:00,080
a lot of countries did but we didn't

4468
03:17:00,080 --> 03:17:01,680
have any practices and processes for how

4469
03:17:01,680 --> 03:17:03,680
you would how you would manage code in a

4470
03:17:03,680 --> 03:17:05,439
public space like that we're also pretty

4471
03:17:05,439 --> 03:17:06,800
concerned about that the idea that those

4472
03:17:06,800 --> 03:17:08,319
repos would get brigaded by people who

4473
03:17:08,319 --> 03:17:09,680
disagreed with the way that the

4474
03:17:09,680 --> 03:17:11,040
government was responding to the

4475
03:17:11,040 --> 03:17:12,479
pandemic in general

4476
03:17:12,479 --> 03:17:14,239
um and it took longer to open source it

4477
03:17:14,239 --> 03:17:15,439
than we wanted to but we got it done by

4478
03:17:15,439 --> 03:17:17,120
the end of 2021

4479
03:17:17,120 --> 03:17:18,800
that's right into 2020.

4480
03:17:18,800 --> 03:17:20,479
so the the great thing about the open

4481
03:17:20,479 --> 03:17:21,840
sourcing was it was increased the

4482
03:17:21,840 --> 03:17:23,439
transparency around the hip around how

4483
03:17:23,439 --> 03:17:24,720
the app works so it was one thing that

4484
03:17:24,720 --> 03:17:26,000
for us to tell you that it looked after

4485
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:27,120
data and it kept it on your phone and

4486
03:17:27,120 --> 03:17:28,080
didn't share it but it's another thing

4487
03:17:28,080 --> 03:17:29,600
for having people with expertise to go

4488
03:17:29,600 --> 03:17:30,800
in and actually assess that for

4489
03:17:30,800 --> 03:17:32,239
themselves

4490
03:17:32,239 --> 03:17:33,439
and i think one of the other things that

4491
03:17:33,439 --> 03:17:35,040
i was really really really keen to see

4492
03:17:35,040 --> 03:17:37,040
was that by us doing it hopefully it

4493
03:17:37,040 --> 03:17:38,399
gave other particular government

4494
03:17:38,399 --> 03:17:40,319
departments an opportunity to to say

4495
03:17:40,319 --> 03:17:41,359
well if they've did it we could probably

4496
03:17:41,359 --> 03:17:42,479
do it too

4497
03:17:42,479 --> 03:17:43,840
the idea that software that's built with

4498
03:17:43,840 --> 03:17:45,120
public money should be made publicly

4499
03:17:45,120 --> 03:17:45,920
available something i'm really

4500
03:17:45,920 --> 03:17:47,600
passionate about so i i hope that that's

4501
03:17:47,600 --> 03:17:48,960
something that really

4502
03:17:48,960 --> 03:17:50,960
sticks as an enduring

4503
03:17:50,960 --> 03:17:52,960
effective for the work that we've done

4504
03:17:52,960 --> 03:17:54,319
i did want to give a shout out to the to

4505
03:17:54,319 --> 03:17:56,000
the folks that did the

4506
03:17:56,000 --> 03:17:57,760
nz goal so the new zealand government

4507
03:17:57,760 --> 03:17:59,120
open access

4508
03:17:59,120 --> 03:18:01,600
uh licenses and license i think software

4509
03:18:01,600 --> 03:18:03,199
extensions uh which is published by

4510
03:18:03,199 --> 03:18:04,640
stats indeed so that's a really great

4511
03:18:04,640 --> 03:18:05,920
framework for if you're working in

4512
03:18:05,920 --> 03:18:07,199
government or you're working in a sector

4513
03:18:07,199 --> 03:18:08,319
that you're trying to decide how do we

4514
03:18:08,319 --> 03:18:10,319
open source what licenses do we use how

4515
03:18:10,319 --> 03:18:11,279
do we make sure we've got commercials

4516
03:18:11,279 --> 03:18:12,880
with our vendors sorted out that

4517
03:18:12,880 --> 03:18:14,080
framework's really good and they've done

4518
03:18:14,080 --> 03:18:15,600
a lot of really awesome ground work

4519
03:18:15,600 --> 03:18:17,199
which was helpful for us so it helped us

4520
03:18:17,199 --> 03:18:18,960
helped our legal team choose what

4521
03:18:18,960 --> 03:18:20,800
licenses we would work with

4522
03:18:20,800 --> 03:18:21,760
and all sorts of stuff with that which

4523
03:18:21,760 --> 03:18:24,479
was great um and also the open sourcing

4524
03:18:24,479 --> 03:18:25,760
was actually helpful because it made me

4525
03:18:25,760 --> 03:18:26,880
have to document the things that we'd

4526
03:18:26,880 --> 03:18:28,319
made for in a more technically focused

4527
03:18:28,319 --> 03:18:30,080
audience and so it meant that a bunch of

4528
03:18:30,080 --> 03:18:31,120
the questions that i'd get about how

4529
03:18:31,120 --> 03:18:32,239
things worked or why they worked that

4530
03:18:32,239 --> 03:18:33,680
way we could just publish them on github

4531
03:18:33,680 --> 03:18:35,040
and it was already there and that was

4532
03:18:35,040 --> 03:18:36,479
also a really helpful thing for us to do

4533
03:18:36,479 --> 03:18:38,560
too

4534
03:18:38,560 --> 03:18:40,319
the other thing that we did which which

4535
03:18:40,319 --> 03:18:42,000
i think was

4536
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:43,520
really pivotal to the to the success of

4537
03:18:43,520 --> 03:18:44,960
the program as well was to create a

4538
03:18:44,960 --> 03:18:47,040
vulnerability disclosure policy so we

4539
03:18:47,040 --> 03:18:48,080
didn't have to start from scratch with

4540
03:18:48,080 --> 03:18:50,080
this we've got a big thank you to the

4541
03:18:50,080 --> 03:18:51,680
security team at msd for helping us get

4542
03:18:51,680 --> 03:18:54,000
a good starting point but

4543
03:18:54,000 --> 03:18:55,520
this was this was another one of those

4544
03:18:55,520 --> 03:18:57,040
really helpful tools that like

4545
03:18:57,040 --> 03:18:58,239
automation was one of the things that

4546
03:18:58,239 --> 03:18:59,680
set expectations around and another

4547
03:18:59,680 --> 03:19:00,960
layer of confidence around how we were

4548
03:19:00,960 --> 03:19:02,239
managing the security of this of the

4549
03:19:02,239 --> 03:19:04,319
services we were building for covert

4550
03:19:04,319 --> 03:19:05,600
uh it's important that to have a clear

4551
03:19:05,600 --> 03:19:07,840
scope for those though um we had a lot

4552
03:19:07,840 --> 03:19:09,279
of potential scope across the health

4553
03:19:09,279 --> 03:19:11,040
system the ministry of health

4554
03:19:11,040 --> 03:19:13,120
at the time has had a very policy sort

4555
03:19:13,120 --> 03:19:14,319
of focused thing and all of the

4556
03:19:14,319 --> 03:19:16,319
execution of health is managed by again

4557
03:19:16,319 --> 03:19:18,000
at the time dhbs

4558
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:18,960
so there's a lot of things that we're

4559
03:19:18,960 --> 03:19:20,560
not actually directly involved in either

4560
03:19:20,560 --> 03:19:21,920
through delivery or actually even just

4561
03:19:21,920 --> 03:19:23,359
from

4562
03:19:23,359 --> 03:19:25,199
an accountability perspective but we did

4563
03:19:25,199 --> 03:19:26,640
get plenty of low value reports about

4564
03:19:26,640 --> 03:19:27,600
you know like

4565
03:19:27,600 --> 03:19:29,040
dmacc not being configured on domain

4566
03:19:29,040 --> 03:19:30,479
names we don't even own

4567
03:19:30,479 --> 03:19:32,159
um but you know we did get a handful of

4568
03:19:32,159 --> 03:19:33,439
useful reports and it was really good

4569
03:19:33,439 --> 03:19:35,439
for us to be able to have that there

4570
03:19:35,439 --> 03:19:37,520
and for something that this visible for

4571
03:19:37,520 --> 03:19:38,560
something we were publishing it and as

4572
03:19:38,560 --> 03:19:39,840
soon as we publish anything it goes

4573
03:19:39,840 --> 03:19:41,680
straight onto the front page of the news

4574
03:19:41,680 --> 03:19:43,359
an absence of reports through that

4575
03:19:43,359 --> 03:19:44,640
through that framework was or that

4576
03:19:44,640 --> 03:19:46,080
policy was actually really indicative

4577
03:19:46,080 --> 03:19:47,680
for us that we we're on the right track

4578
03:19:47,680 --> 03:19:50,319
as well which i think was really good

4579
03:19:50,319 --> 03:19:52,560
um and i also

4580
03:19:52,560 --> 03:19:54,479
think that the vdp was what was actually

4581
03:19:54,479 --> 03:19:55,600
one of the more valuable things when you

4582
03:19:55,600 --> 03:19:57,760
ended up with uh

4583
03:19:57,760 --> 03:19:59,520
inquiry or concerns

4584
03:19:59,520 --> 03:20:01,439
well-founded or otherwise

4585
03:20:01,439 --> 03:20:02,880
from from the from the public about

4586
03:20:02,880 --> 03:20:04,080
whether the apps are built the right way

4587
03:20:04,080 --> 03:20:05,040
you know you get someone who goes and

4588
03:20:05,040 --> 03:20:07,359
just points an online tool to check your

4589
03:20:07,359 --> 03:20:08,880
configuration of your ssl certificates

4590
03:20:08,880 --> 03:20:10,000
and then writes an article about how

4591
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:11,279
it's really bad

4592
03:20:11,279 --> 03:20:12,880
it's really helpful for us to be able to

4593
03:20:12,880 --> 03:20:14,800
point at things like the vdp and say if

4594
03:20:14,800 --> 03:20:17,120
you found vulnerabilities that are

4595
03:20:17,120 --> 03:20:18,239
that you think of that you think are

4596
03:20:18,239 --> 03:20:19,600
explorable they're actually impactful

4597
03:20:19,600 --> 03:20:20,800
come and talk to us we're going to work

4598
03:20:20,800 --> 03:20:22,800
with you to sort through that our focus

4599
03:20:22,800 --> 03:20:24,800
is on getting security done right not

4600
03:20:24,800 --> 03:20:26,399
just telling you that it's secure and

4601
03:20:26,399 --> 03:20:28,080
not asking for your help

4602
03:20:28,080 --> 03:20:29,359
and that so that was a really useful

4603
03:20:29,359 --> 03:20:31,120
public policy position to to have so

4604
03:20:31,120 --> 03:20:32,239
that we could point people to that and

4605
03:20:32,239 --> 03:20:33,520
say if you've got a problem and you

4606
03:20:33,520 --> 03:20:34,880
think it's going to be bad or even if

4607
03:20:34,880 --> 03:20:35,680
you don't think it's going to be bad

4608
03:20:35,680 --> 03:20:37,520
you're not sure come talk to us

4609
03:20:37,520 --> 03:20:39,040
and so it's clear that we value people's

4610
03:20:39,040 --> 03:20:40,640
exec you know we value their expertise

4611
03:20:40,640 --> 03:20:43,120
we we support them to safely report it

4612
03:20:43,120 --> 03:20:44,399
and we'll be confident you know give

4613
03:20:44,399 --> 03:20:45,600
provide confidence that we'll respect

4614
03:20:45,600 --> 03:20:46,800
them in the research that they do which

4615
03:20:46,800 --> 03:20:50,080
i thought was really really important

4616
03:20:50,159 --> 03:20:51,040
and so

4617
03:20:51,040 --> 03:20:53,040
you know takeaways from this you know

4618
03:20:53,040 --> 03:20:54,800
covertracer was used by a lot of people

4619
03:20:54,800 --> 03:20:55,920
every day to track where they've been

4620
03:20:55,920 --> 03:20:57,120
and who they've been in contact with

4621
03:20:57,120 --> 03:20:58,080
it's a lot different now i don't know

4622
03:20:58,080 --> 03:20:59,680
how many of you opening it and scanning

4623
03:20:59,680 --> 03:21:00,880
that qriket the first time you've done

4624
03:21:00,880 --> 03:21:03,199
it in months um but for me being part of

4625
03:21:03,199 --> 03:21:04,560
this especially in the days was a really

4626
03:21:04,560 --> 03:21:05,920
amazing opportunity it was a privilege

4627
03:21:05,920 --> 03:21:07,040
to be part of the team that put this

4628
03:21:07,040 --> 03:21:08,880
together there was a lot of people who

4629
03:21:08,880 --> 03:21:10,560
worked some really hard really hard

4630
03:21:10,560 --> 03:21:12,640
hours to get to get the tech done

4631
03:21:12,640 --> 03:21:14,880
and i think you know i i'm confident

4632
03:21:14,880 --> 03:21:16,000
that we made a difference in the

4633
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:17,680
response that we that the government put

4634
03:21:17,680 --> 03:21:18,720
together

4635
03:21:18,720 --> 03:21:19,920
and it's not not every day you get a

4636
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:21,359
chance to design technology that's used

4637
03:21:21,359 --> 03:21:22,560
by pretty much everyone in the country

4638
03:21:22,560 --> 03:21:23,520
you get to walk around and see the

4639
03:21:23,520 --> 03:21:26,560
posters that were designed and and have

4640
03:21:26,560 --> 03:21:28,399
it be so visible as it was

4641
03:21:28,399 --> 03:21:30,239
so i think one of the key things for me

4642
03:21:30,239 --> 03:21:31,920
was focusing on the privacy the privacy

4643
03:21:31,920 --> 03:21:33,520
focused design of the solution and

4644
03:21:33,520 --> 03:21:35,040
giving people control over their data

4645
03:21:35,040 --> 03:21:37,040
and how it's used resulted in a much

4646
03:21:37,040 --> 03:21:40,000
more secure by default design overall

4647
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:41,760
and it meant that we were

4648
03:21:41,760 --> 03:21:44,560
much well by not aggregating data in the

4649
03:21:44,560 --> 03:21:45,920
cloud for example meant that we don't

4650
03:21:45,920 --> 03:21:47,279
have that huge target on our backs we

4651
03:21:47,279 --> 03:21:48,399
don't have to worry too much about how

4652
03:21:48,399 --> 03:21:49,680
we do that

4653
03:21:49,680 --> 03:21:50,960
it might have been easier for us to put

4654
03:21:50,960 --> 03:21:52,000
data in the cloud and actually there's

4655
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:53,199
plenty of arguments i had with people

4656
03:21:53,199 --> 03:21:54,479
about how that's what we were doing even

4657
03:21:54,479 --> 03:21:55,760
though you know i could quite

4658
03:21:55,760 --> 03:21:56,880
confidently say that's not what was

4659
03:21:56,880 --> 03:21:57,760
happening

4660
03:21:57,760 --> 03:21:59,359
but we reduced the risk position of the

4661
03:21:59,359 --> 03:22:00,960
service both from from an accidental

4662
03:22:00,960 --> 03:22:02,640
disclosure us making a mistake as well

4663
03:22:02,640 --> 03:22:03,760
as someone doing some deliberate

4664
03:22:03,760 --> 03:22:06,159
malicious activity

4665
03:22:06,159 --> 03:22:07,279
even though we were working in some

4666
03:22:07,279 --> 03:22:08,479
unusual environments under some

4667
03:22:08,479 --> 03:22:09,760
ridiculous time pressure we still

4668
03:22:09,760 --> 03:22:11,279
managed to ship and continue to ship

4669
03:22:11,279 --> 03:22:13,279
things that that balance the security

4670
03:22:13,279 --> 03:22:14,960
and privacy and usefulness

4671
03:22:14,960 --> 03:22:16,880
of the service that they provide

4672
03:22:16,880 --> 03:22:18,159
and make sure that we were actually

4673
03:22:18,159 --> 03:22:20,720
delivering things that provided value

4674
03:22:20,720 --> 03:22:22,080
from my perspective our security team

4675
03:22:22,080 --> 03:22:23,760
did a really great job to evolve to meet

4676
03:22:23,760 --> 03:22:24,960
business need

4677
03:22:24,960 --> 03:22:26,560
there's no way we could have shipped the

4678
03:22:26,560 --> 03:22:27,920
things we shipped with the confidence we

4679
03:22:27,920 --> 03:22:29,600
ship them with without having the

4680
03:22:29,600 --> 03:22:31,760
security team evolved to do that

4681
03:22:31,760 --> 03:22:33,279
not just for this project but across the

4682
03:22:33,279 --> 03:22:34,560
board right

4683
03:22:34,560 --> 03:22:35,760
and as a result we've got this more

4684
03:22:35,760 --> 03:22:36,960
responsive more integrated and more

4685
03:22:36,960 --> 03:22:38,399
involved security practice and process

4686
03:22:38,399 --> 03:22:40,720
across the across health new zealand now

4687
03:22:40,720 --> 03:22:42,479
which is i think sets us up for a great

4688
03:22:42,479 --> 03:22:44,479
success in the future which is awesome

4689
03:22:44,479 --> 03:22:46,080
security seen as an enabler rather than

4690
03:22:46,080 --> 03:22:47,920
a blocker uh and for me as someone

4691
03:22:47,920 --> 03:22:49,279
designing new things i'm not afraid

4692
03:22:49,279 --> 03:22:50,560
about engaging the security team in case

4693
03:22:50,560 --> 03:22:51,760
they say no i'm actually more interested

4694
03:22:51,760 --> 03:22:52,960
to see what they'll what they'll have

4695
03:22:52,960 --> 03:22:54,000
what tools they can give me to make

4696
03:22:54,000 --> 03:22:55,120
things better

4697
03:22:55,120 --> 03:22:56,640
and the things like automation and open

4698
03:22:56,640 --> 03:22:58,000
source the vulnerability disclosure

4699
03:22:58,000 --> 03:23:00,080
processes are really great for shaping

4700
03:23:00,080 --> 03:23:02,080
expectations and experience both

4701
03:23:02,080 --> 03:23:04,159
internally and externally so internal

4702
03:23:04,159 --> 03:23:05,680
culture is a really important thing for

4703
03:23:05,680 --> 03:23:07,439
us to do

4704
03:23:07,439 --> 03:23:09,040
around how we do security and how we

4705
03:23:09,040 --> 03:23:10,560
manage it

4706
03:23:10,560 --> 03:23:12,159
so we you know positioning these things

4707
03:23:12,159 --> 03:23:13,600
as net benefits to the security posture

4708
03:23:13,600 --> 03:23:14,880
of the organization rather than things

4709
03:23:14,880 --> 03:23:16,640
that we do as a cost are really

4710
03:23:16,640 --> 03:23:17,920
important to change attitudes around the

4711
03:23:17,920 --> 03:23:19,439
way that security works

4712
03:23:19,439 --> 03:23:20,560
and then and

4713
03:23:20,560 --> 03:23:22,319
the role that it plays in the in

4714
03:23:22,319 --> 03:23:24,000
the trust of product development and the

4715
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:26,880
trust of the products that we build

4716
03:23:26,880 --> 03:23:28,080
so by doing these things we built

4717
03:23:28,080 --> 03:23:29,680
technology platforms that withstood the

4718
03:23:29,680 --> 03:23:31,359
public pressure and the public scrutiny

4719
03:23:31,359 --> 03:23:32,800
that was well deserved

4720
03:23:32,800 --> 03:23:34,800
uh you know they they deserve to be

4721
03:23:34,800 --> 03:23:36,720
scrutinized but we managed to stand up

4722
03:23:36,720 --> 03:23:38,080
against that scrutiny across the whole

4723
03:23:38,080 --> 03:23:39,920
covered portfolio which i'm really proud

4724
03:23:39,920 --> 03:23:40,880
of

4725
03:23:40,880 --> 03:23:42,080
and the iterative process that we

4726
03:23:42,080 --> 03:23:43,199
followed and getting that foundation

4727
03:23:43,199 --> 03:23:44,800
right was really important

4728
03:23:44,800 --> 03:23:46,319
but so i was adapting and learning to

4729
03:23:46,319 --> 03:23:47,199
the new things as we got new

4730
03:23:47,199 --> 03:23:48,560
requirements and build new things and

4731
03:23:48,560 --> 03:23:50,800
receive feedback

4732
03:23:50,800 --> 03:23:51,760
so that's the end of what i've got to

4733
03:23:51,760 --> 03:23:53,520
talk about today

4734
03:23:53,520 --> 03:23:54,960
as i mentioned there's a lot of change

4735
03:23:54,960 --> 03:23:55,920
going on in the health system at the

4736
03:23:55,920 --> 03:23:57,680
moment uh just yesterday we had the new

4737
03:23:57,680 --> 03:23:59,040
the new health new zealand organization

4738
03:23:59,040 --> 03:24:00,720
get formally ratified

4739
03:24:00,720 --> 03:24:01,920
and there's a lot of really interesting

4740
03:24:01,920 --> 03:24:03,359
work that we're taking from covert to

4741
03:24:03,359 --> 03:24:04,720
start applying across the health system

4742
03:24:04,720 --> 03:24:05,920
so if you've got an interest in that

4743
03:24:05,920 --> 03:24:07,279
keep an eye out reach out to some of my

4744
03:24:07,279 --> 03:24:09,439
colleagues in the in the health team

4745
03:24:09,439 --> 03:24:11,040
i'm sure they'd love to hear from you

4746
03:24:11,040 --> 03:24:12,800
otherwise thanks so much for having me

4747
03:24:12,800 --> 03:24:16,519
and have a good rest of the con

4748
03:24:24,319 --> 03:24:25,920
i think for a lot of people in the world

4749
03:24:25,920 --> 03:24:27,920
new zealand's response to the pandemic

4750
03:24:27,920 --> 03:24:30,239
is a thing that they see as having done

4751
03:24:30,239 --> 03:24:32,640
been having been done you know very very

4752
03:24:32,640 --> 03:24:34,319
well and we are the in many respects you

4753
03:24:34,319 --> 03:24:38,319
know the envy of of the world and it's

4754
03:24:38,319 --> 03:24:39,439
through the hard work of people like

4755
03:24:39,439 --> 03:24:41,359
that i mean you can imagine how much

4756
03:24:41,359 --> 03:24:42,640
work what it was like in that

4757
03:24:42,640 --> 03:24:44,399
environment um

4758
03:24:44,399 --> 03:24:46,000
and i think you know we're all very very

4759
03:24:46,000 --> 03:24:47,680
glad for the sacrifices that all of the

4760
03:24:47,680 --> 03:24:49,680
people you know working in in the health

4761
03:24:49,680 --> 03:24:52,399
sector have made uh for us all

4762
03:24:52,399 --> 03:24:54,000
during the pandemic so if you want to

4763
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:56,399
give us a

4764
03:25:02,800 --> 03:25:03,920
and it's also one of the things i really

4765
03:25:03,920 --> 03:25:05,359
love about this community as i said you

4766
03:25:05,359 --> 03:25:06,800
know once upon a time kirikon we thought

4767
03:25:06,800 --> 03:25:08,479
we were underground badass hackers but

4768
03:25:08,479 --> 03:25:10,239
actually the reality is you know this

4769
03:25:10,239 --> 03:25:11,680
community

4770
03:25:11,680 --> 03:25:14,239
is who is at the forefront of all sorts

4771
03:25:14,239 --> 03:25:16,000
of things that are just really important

4772
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:17,520
and really matter in ways that they

4773
03:25:17,520 --> 03:25:19,600
never did and i'm really proud that we

4774
03:25:19,600 --> 03:25:21,520
can come together you know and learn

4775
03:25:21,520 --> 03:25:23,120
from that you know that we can come

4776
03:25:23,120 --> 03:25:25,439
together and find employment find ways

4777
03:25:25,439 --> 03:25:28,800
to help uh and really contributes to

4778
03:25:28,800 --> 03:25:31,040
you know the safety and security of of

4779
03:25:31,040 --> 03:25:32,880
our society and our friends and our

4780
03:25:32,880 --> 03:25:35,600
family and our farm now uh so yeah it's

4781
03:25:35,600 --> 03:25:37,439
a having talks like that on this stage

4782
03:25:37,439 --> 03:25:40,319
makes me really happy i'm really proud

4783
03:25:40,319 --> 03:25:41,439
now one of the things i'm less proud

4784
03:25:41,439 --> 03:25:44,720
about is that as attackers

4785
03:25:44,720 --> 03:25:46,479
we kind of just shot and busted stuff

4786
03:25:46,479 --> 03:25:49,920
and tbh it's pretty easy

4787
03:25:49,920 --> 03:25:51,040
because it turns out that actually

4788
03:25:51,040 --> 03:25:53,760
building secure things especially at

4789
03:25:53,760 --> 03:25:56,239
scale is legit hard

4790
03:25:56,239 --> 03:25:58,159
and showing up and just sticking a you

4791
03:25:58,159 --> 03:25:59,760
know a couple of backticks or whatever

4792
03:25:59,760 --> 03:26:02,000
in the search box and what you do it's a

4793
03:26:02,000 --> 03:26:04,000
perl script we've got command injection

4794
03:26:04,000 --> 03:26:06,159
it's not that difficult

4795
03:26:06,159 --> 03:26:09,439
uh so i'm always in awe of people who do

4796
03:26:09,439 --> 03:26:10,800
manage to build

4797
03:26:10,800 --> 03:26:13,199
very big sometimes very fast scaling

4798
03:26:13,199 --> 03:26:14,880
projects and do so without things going

4799
03:26:14,880 --> 03:26:17,120
horribly wrong

4800
03:26:17,120 --> 03:26:18,319
and so

4801
03:26:18,319 --> 03:26:19,920
on that note it's my pleasure to

4802
03:26:19,920 --> 03:26:22,880
introduce to the stage

4803
03:26:22,880 --> 03:26:27,039
candace with a cave like kubernetes

4804
03:26:27,439 --> 03:26:30,920
but not evil

4805
03:26:34,640 --> 03:26:36,800
hello

4806
03:26:36,800 --> 03:26:38,159
i was so worried i was going to trip

4807
03:26:38,159 --> 03:26:40,640
over on the way here i was making jokes

4808
03:26:40,640 --> 03:26:42,239
backstage i should just like drop to the

4809
03:26:42,239 --> 03:26:44,560
floor get it out of the way early

4810
03:26:44,560 --> 03:26:46,319
it was freaked me out

4811
03:26:46,319 --> 03:26:48,800
so i'm candace i'm talking today about

4812
03:26:48,800 --> 03:26:52,159
treating security as a product

4813
03:26:52,159 --> 03:26:54,319
i'm i have two

4814
03:26:54,319 --> 03:26:56,640
really cute cats and a really cute dog

4815
03:26:56,640 --> 03:26:59,040
so i just wanted to share them with you

4816
03:26:59,040 --> 03:27:01,920
i'm currently a security product manager

4817
03:27:01,920 --> 03:27:03,840
so

4818
03:27:03,840 --> 03:27:06,960
um i have a team of product owners we're

4819
03:27:06,960 --> 03:27:08,640
not actually we don't actually work for

4820
03:27:08,640 --> 03:27:10,560
a company that makes a security product

4821
03:27:10,560 --> 03:27:12,239
we don't do firewalls or anything like

4822
03:27:12,239 --> 03:27:14,800
that we're a security team within a

4823
03:27:14,800 --> 03:27:16,720
bigger organization that serves the rest

4824
03:27:16,720 --> 03:27:20,159
of the organization to make them secure

4825
03:27:20,159 --> 03:27:22,960
but i haven't always been in product i

4826
03:27:22,960 --> 03:27:25,520
haven't even always been in security

4827
03:27:25,520 --> 03:27:28,560
i'm actually relatively new to the tech

4828
03:27:28,560 --> 03:27:30,720
industry

4829
03:27:30,720 --> 03:27:32,479
the majority of my career right from

4830
03:27:32,479 --> 03:27:35,359
when i was 14 and worked in a cafe up to

4831
03:27:35,359 --> 03:27:37,199
when i was 24 and i was working in call

4832
03:27:37,199 --> 03:27:38,880
centers

4833
03:27:38,880 --> 03:27:41,520
i was in customer service

4834
03:27:41,520 --> 03:27:46,319
and that is a great job let me tell you

4835
03:27:47,199 --> 03:27:50,880
i just you know i really just so enjoyed

4836
03:27:50,880 --> 03:27:54,000
all of the interactions i had every day

4837
03:27:54,000 --> 03:27:56,479
where i tried my absolute best and

4838
03:27:56,479 --> 03:27:58,000
nothing was ever good enough and i loved

4839
03:27:58,000 --> 03:28:00,960
it so much that i decided that i needed

4840
03:28:00,960 --> 03:28:03,600
to go re-skill in something where i

4841
03:28:03,600 --> 03:28:06,080
would get the most minimal human

4842
03:28:06,080 --> 03:28:09,800
interaction possible

4843
03:28:10,310 --> 03:28:12,319
[Applause]

4844
03:28:12,319 --> 03:28:14,800
so i chose engineering computer

4845
03:28:14,800 --> 03:28:16,239
engineering

4846
03:28:16,239 --> 03:28:18,159
because engineers don't have to talk to

4847
03:28:18,159 --> 03:28:20,159
people right we never ever have to talk

4848
03:28:20,159 --> 03:28:21,359
to each other

4849
03:28:21,359 --> 03:28:23,760
or the people that use our products

4850
03:28:23,760 --> 03:28:26,399
so i went and re-skilled i became a i

4851
03:28:26,399 --> 03:28:28,319
got a network engineering degree and

4852
03:28:28,319 --> 03:28:30,239
then i got my first role out in the tech

4853
03:28:30,239 --> 03:28:32,640
world as a systems engineer

4854
03:28:32,640 --> 03:28:35,359
and the first thing that i built was

4855
03:28:35,359 --> 03:28:37,120
this private cloud

4856
03:28:37,120 --> 03:28:40,159
and i was quite proud of it like

4857
03:28:40,159 --> 03:28:43,040
i automated a whole lot of stuff like

4858
03:28:43,040 --> 03:28:45,199
you know it seemed to run pretty well i

4859
03:28:45,199 --> 03:28:46,640
thought it was quite good you know my

4860
03:28:46,640 --> 03:28:49,120
team seemed pretty okay with it

4861
03:28:49,120 --> 03:28:50,800
the people that weren't okay with it

4862
03:28:50,800 --> 03:28:52,399
were the people that actually had to use

4863
03:28:52,399 --> 03:28:54,800
the thing

4864
03:28:56,560 --> 03:28:58,720
uh after being a systems engineer and

4865
03:28:58,720 --> 03:29:00,479
doing kind of platform stuff i moved

4866
03:29:00,479 --> 03:29:02,960
over to being a security engineer and i

4867
03:29:02,960 --> 03:29:05,680
kind of found the same sort of problems

4868
03:29:05,680 --> 03:29:08,000
happening again you know i was working

4869
03:29:08,000 --> 03:29:09,840
on these really great tools like our

4870
03:29:09,840 --> 03:29:12,159
purpose was amazing we're there to build

4871
03:29:12,159 --> 03:29:14,720
the stuff that keeps our customers data

4872
03:29:14,720 --> 03:29:17,279
safe you know our organization's data

4873
03:29:17,279 --> 03:29:19,439
their gold mine we're keeping people

4874
03:29:19,439 --> 03:29:20,960
safe for being superheroes and we're

4875
03:29:20,960 --> 03:29:23,040
using this really amazing tech and like

4876
03:29:23,040 --> 03:29:24,239
i'm working with these really great

4877
03:29:24,239 --> 03:29:27,520
people and like we really care

4878
03:29:27,520 --> 03:29:29,359
but um

4879
03:29:29,359 --> 03:29:31,520
it's just more of the same stuff like we

4880
03:29:31,520 --> 03:29:33,840
all saw it was doing really good

4881
03:29:33,840 --> 03:29:34,800
but

4882
03:29:34,800 --> 03:29:36,880
no one that had to interact with the

4883
03:29:36,880 --> 03:29:39,680
tools liked it and it kind of felt like

4884
03:29:39,680 --> 03:29:41,840
security was sort of public enemy number

4885
03:29:41,840 --> 03:29:43,439
one like when i told people i was in

4886
03:29:43,439 --> 03:29:45,279
security it wasn't a smile that they

4887
03:29:45,279 --> 03:29:49,040
gave me it was more like a

4888
03:29:52,319 --> 03:29:54,399
after being a security engineer for a

4889
03:29:54,399 --> 03:29:58,000
while i got the opportunity to

4890
03:29:58,000 --> 03:29:58,840
be

4891
03:29:58,840 --> 03:30:01,120
a team lead

4892
03:30:01,120 --> 03:30:04,159
for a security team they win the team

4893
03:30:04,159 --> 03:30:05,840
that i'd started in but they're a team

4894
03:30:05,840 --> 03:30:07,359
that i knew of

4895
03:30:07,359 --> 03:30:08,960
and they were pretty great

4896
03:30:08,960 --> 03:30:10,800
and so i got put in charge of them for

4897
03:30:10,800 --> 03:30:13,760
six months and i was you know i was

4898
03:30:13,760 --> 03:30:16,640
young i was full of enthusiasm and

4899
03:30:16,640 --> 03:30:18,479
energy and i just wanted to make the

4900
03:30:18,479 --> 03:30:20,239
world a better place so i started out by

4901
03:30:20,239 --> 03:30:21,840
going and talking to all these leaders

4902
03:30:21,840 --> 03:30:23,840
that i knew of that seemed really really

4903
03:30:23,840 --> 03:30:25,920
good and without fail they all gave me

4904
03:30:25,920 --> 03:30:28,479
the same advice

4905
03:30:28,479 --> 03:30:30,239
don't change anything

4906
03:30:30,239 --> 03:30:31,279
but

4907
03:30:31,279 --> 03:30:32,960
i have a bit of a selective hearing

4908
03:30:32,960 --> 03:30:36,880
problem so what i really heard was this

4909
03:30:37,120 --> 03:30:40,000
that poor team

4910
03:30:40,000 --> 03:30:42,399
i mean i did listen for like two weeks

4911
03:30:42,399 --> 03:30:44,640
um i did spend about two weeks trying to

4912
03:30:44,640 --> 03:30:46,880
like you know get a handle on things see

4913
03:30:46,880 --> 03:30:49,199
where the team are what i found was that

4914
03:30:49,199 --> 03:30:51,199
i was working with a team that were

4915
03:30:51,199 --> 03:30:52,880
incredibly skilled

4916
03:30:52,880 --> 03:30:55,600
incredibly high performing they're

4917
03:30:55,600 --> 03:30:58,080
really really cared about the work that

4918
03:30:58,080 --> 03:30:59,600
they were doing and they were really

4919
03:30:59,600 --> 03:31:01,600
really good at it

4920
03:31:01,600 --> 03:31:03,840
but there were some problems

4921
03:31:03,840 --> 03:31:05,920
it seemed like they weren't actually

4922
03:31:05,920 --> 03:31:07,760
producing anything

4923
03:31:07,760 --> 03:31:09,600
they

4924
03:31:09,600 --> 03:31:11,199
had a lot of things going on at the same

4925
03:31:11,199 --> 03:31:14,080
time but like nothing ever got finished

4926
03:31:14,080 --> 03:31:15,439
so

4927
03:31:15,439 --> 03:31:17,840
i found that when you're not producing

4928
03:31:17,840 --> 03:31:19,199
something if people can't see that

4929
03:31:19,199 --> 03:31:21,359
you're finishing work they always think

4930
03:31:21,359 --> 03:31:24,479
that you're not doing anything

4931
03:31:24,479 --> 03:31:25,199
so

4932
03:31:25,199 --> 03:31:26,720
we kind of set out to try and change

4933
03:31:26,720 --> 03:31:28,960
that

4934
03:31:29,120 --> 03:31:30,399
this was the first thing that we needed

4935
03:31:30,399 --> 03:31:32,800
to tackle we had this trello board and

4936
03:31:32,800 --> 03:31:34,399
it looked like the digital version of

4937
03:31:34,399 --> 03:31:37,680
this there were so many cards like

4938
03:31:37,680 --> 03:31:39,600
the team had tried to wrangle them into

4939
03:31:39,600 --> 03:31:41,199
kind of columns but there was just so

4940
03:31:41,199 --> 03:31:42,640
much there was really hard to kind of

4941
03:31:42,640 --> 03:31:44,560
conceptualize what was going on

4942
03:31:44,560 --> 03:31:45,680
and

4943
03:31:45,680 --> 03:31:48,600
out of 300 cards or so there were

4944
03:31:48,600 --> 03:31:52,319
297 top priorities

4945
03:31:52,319 --> 03:31:53,640
so

4946
03:31:53,640 --> 03:31:56,399
297 with a high priority and then the

4947
03:31:56,399 --> 03:31:58,319
other three i guess they didn't matter

4948
03:31:58,319 --> 03:32:00,399
too much

4949
03:32:00,399 --> 03:32:02,319
so i kind of looked around the business

4950
03:32:02,319 --> 03:32:04,399
to see what everyone else is doing

4951
03:32:04,399 --> 03:32:06,319
and everyone was using jira for some

4952
03:32:06,319 --> 03:32:07,920
reason like everyone was using jira

4953
03:32:07,920 --> 03:32:10,000
except the security team so i was like

4954
03:32:10,000 --> 03:32:11,040
okay

4955
03:32:11,040 --> 03:32:12,720
maybe we should align with literally

4956
03:32:12,720 --> 03:32:15,520
everyone else in the organization so we

4957
03:32:15,520 --> 03:32:18,319
created a jira board we kind of did a

4958
03:32:18,319 --> 03:32:20,399
loose kanban sort of style

4959
03:32:20,399 --> 03:32:22,880
and we ported all of these cards over

4960
03:32:22,880 --> 03:32:24,479
and actually while we were putting them

4961
03:32:24,479 --> 03:32:26,720
over we found some cards were no longer

4962
03:32:26,720 --> 03:32:29,920
relevant we found duplicates

4963
03:32:29,920 --> 03:32:31,600
we found stuff that actually already

4964
03:32:31,600 --> 03:32:33,520
been completed they just got so lost and

4965
03:32:33,520 --> 03:32:36,080
this mess had brought in nothing

4966
03:32:36,080 --> 03:32:37,520
so it was really good it mean we cleaned

4967
03:32:37,520 --> 03:32:39,040
it up a little bit

4968
03:32:39,040 --> 03:32:41,199
and i say a little bit because

4969
03:32:41,199 --> 03:32:43,439
even once we moved to jira

4970
03:32:43,439 --> 03:32:44,960
it might not look like this

4971
03:32:44,960 --> 03:32:47,600
but it still wasn't like pretty

4972
03:32:47,600 --> 03:32:49,600
there was still a lot going on but the

4973
03:32:49,600 --> 03:32:51,199
good thing here was that we can actually

4974
03:32:51,199 --> 03:32:54,159
kind of see what's happening

4975
03:32:55,040 --> 03:32:57,520
now that we actually had

4976
03:32:57,520 --> 03:32:59,920
a good idea of what was happening it was

4977
03:32:59,920 --> 03:33:03,279
time to kind of look at why

4978
03:33:03,279 --> 03:33:05,039
nothing was going you know getting

4979
03:33:05,039 --> 03:33:08,240
finished and the reason why was because

4980
03:33:08,240 --> 03:33:10,240
of this so this is little's law it's a

4981
03:33:10,240 --> 03:33:12,400
mathematical theorem it's base it's it's

4982
03:33:12,400 --> 03:33:14,000
from cueing theory

4983
03:33:14,000 --> 03:33:15,520
um but it's used a lot when you're

4984
03:33:15,520 --> 03:33:18,160
talking about workflow optimization

4985
03:33:18,160 --> 03:33:19,279
basically

4986
03:33:19,279 --> 03:33:21,359
the concept is that all three of these

4987
03:33:21,359 --> 03:33:23,039
things they all relate to each other and

4988
03:33:23,039 --> 03:33:24,320
if you change one of them the others

4989
03:33:24,320 --> 03:33:25,760
will change

4990
03:33:25,760 --> 03:33:27,920
so how many things currently in progress

4991
03:33:27,920 --> 03:33:30,160
how fast the things are getting done and

4992
03:33:30,160 --> 03:33:32,000
how long it is going to take to get the

4993
03:33:32,000 --> 03:33:34,320
things done

4994
03:33:34,320 --> 03:33:36,879
so obviously this is our big problem it

4995
03:33:36,879 --> 03:33:38,959
was taking a really long time to get

4996
03:33:38,959 --> 03:33:41,199
things done

4997
03:33:41,199 --> 03:33:43,760
this was not our problem because the ex

4998
03:33:43,760 --> 03:33:46,480
the engineers were all really good all

4999
03:33:46,480 --> 03:33:48,480
really high performing all knew their

5000
03:33:48,480 --> 03:33:50,320
stuff really well they all really cared

5001
03:33:50,320 --> 03:33:52,719
and they were doing heaps

5002
03:33:52,719 --> 03:33:54,719
so this was our problem how many things

5003
03:33:54,719 --> 03:33:57,519
were in progress

5004
03:33:57,680 --> 03:33:58,639
so

5005
03:33:58,639 --> 03:34:00,799
five engineers 20 things at the same

5006
03:34:00,799 --> 03:34:05,600
time that's doable right no no it is not

5007
03:34:05,600 --> 03:34:06,480
so

5008
03:34:06,480 --> 03:34:08,639
i managed to convince them

5009
03:34:08,639 --> 03:34:11,119
after promising and cajoling and being

5010
03:34:11,119 --> 03:34:13,039
like come on please just try it i

5011
03:34:13,039 --> 03:34:14,879
promise if anyone blames everyone it's

5012
03:34:14,879 --> 03:34:16,240
going to be me

5013
03:34:16,240 --> 03:34:18,240
i managed to convince them to

5014
03:34:18,240 --> 03:34:20,639
shut all the projects down we spent two

5015
03:34:20,639 --> 03:34:22,879
weeks either closing them off or

5016
03:34:22,879 --> 03:34:24,879
finishing them up if we could or just

5017
03:34:24,879 --> 03:34:26,719
you know deleting them if they really

5018
03:34:26,719 --> 03:34:29,439
weren't very relevant

5019
03:34:29,439 --> 03:34:31,039
and

5020
03:34:31,039 --> 03:34:32,400
it meant that

5021
03:34:32,400 --> 03:34:34,480
we could just all focus on one thing we

5022
03:34:34,480 --> 03:34:35,760
could you know

5023
03:34:35,760 --> 03:34:40,480
fix that problem that we had here

5024
03:34:40,480 --> 03:34:43,279
but the next problem was

5025
03:34:43,279 --> 03:34:44,799
if we're only choosing one thing of the

5026
03:34:44,799 --> 03:34:46,320
20 stuff that was in project and

5027
03:34:46,320 --> 03:34:48,719
progress to keep working on

5028
03:34:48,719 --> 03:34:51,760
how do you prioritize that

5029
03:34:51,760 --> 03:34:54,400
so for that first project that we did

5030
03:34:54,400 --> 03:34:55,439
um

5031
03:34:55,439 --> 03:34:56,799
we thought about what makes something

5032
03:34:56,799 --> 03:34:59,520
valuable to us

5033
03:34:59,520 --> 03:35:01,039
and we chose the thing that was valuable

5034
03:35:01,039 --> 03:35:03,199
to us so i like to think of that as kind

5035
03:35:03,199 --> 03:35:04,959
of technical values that's the things

5036
03:35:04,959 --> 03:35:07,279
that make our team happy that's the

5037
03:35:07,279 --> 03:35:08,879
stuff that's going to optimize your

5038
03:35:08,879 --> 03:35:11,039
process that's the innovative tech that

5039
03:35:11,039 --> 03:35:12,719
you want to try those are the things

5040
03:35:12,719 --> 03:35:14,080
that are really going to benefit your

5041
03:35:14,080 --> 03:35:15,279
team

5042
03:35:15,279 --> 03:35:16,639
but maybe it's not going to benefit the

5043
03:35:16,639 --> 03:35:18,480
rest of the organization and that's kind

5044
03:35:18,480 --> 03:35:20,561
of an issue because

5045
03:35:20,561 --> 03:35:22,160
we don't get hired as security teams

5046
03:35:22,160 --> 03:35:24,080
just to make our own lives better we get

5047
03:35:24,080 --> 03:35:27,439
hired for a bigger purpose right

5048
03:35:27,439 --> 03:35:29,920
so another way of determining value is

5049
03:35:29,920 --> 03:35:32,480
the organizational or business value

5050
03:35:32,480 --> 03:35:34,320
whatever you want to call it so i like

5051
03:35:34,320 --> 03:35:36,000
this is kind of how to make your leaders

5052
03:35:36,000 --> 03:35:38,799
happy right um you're creating projects

5053
03:35:38,799 --> 03:35:40,719
that your leaders like yes see where

5054
03:35:40,719 --> 03:35:44,480
we're helping to their leaders

5055
03:35:44,480 --> 03:35:45,760
sometimes though

5056
03:35:45,760 --> 03:35:47,840
it's really hard to figure out where the

5057
03:35:47,840 --> 03:35:50,400
organizational value of a security

5058
03:35:50,400 --> 03:35:52,240
product or a tool or a service or

5059
03:35:52,240 --> 03:35:53,439
project is

5060
03:35:53,439 --> 03:35:55,520
because you know we don't really make

5061
03:35:55,520 --> 03:35:57,680
any money right we

5062
03:35:57,680 --> 03:35:59,600
we're there to make sure that we don't

5063
03:35:59,600 --> 03:36:01,439
lose money and if we're doing our job

5064
03:36:01,439 --> 03:36:03,279
right no one thinks we are going to lose

5065
03:36:03,279 --> 03:36:06,080
money due to security

5066
03:36:06,080 --> 03:36:07,920
um but it's really hard to translate

5067
03:36:07,920 --> 03:36:09,039
that into

5068
03:36:09,039 --> 03:36:11,760
a cost that we're giving

5069
03:36:11,760 --> 03:36:13,439
so you can look at things like values

5070
03:36:13,439 --> 03:36:15,039
you can look at things like strategy can

5071
03:36:15,039 --> 03:36:16,639
look at the vision

5072
03:36:16,639 --> 03:36:18,879
but even then it's very rare to see a

5073
03:36:18,879 --> 03:36:20,561
company say

5074
03:36:20,561 --> 03:36:23,119
you know security is our strategy

5075
03:36:23,119 --> 03:36:25,439
we want everyone to adopt

5076
03:36:25,439 --> 03:36:27,039
um vulnerability management within their

5077
03:36:27,039 --> 03:36:28,879
product teams for example that's that's

5078
03:36:28,879 --> 03:36:31,199
pretty rare within organizations to to

5079
03:36:31,199 --> 03:36:33,039
focus on that instead they usually focus

5080
03:36:33,039 --> 03:36:35,119
on something like this

5081
03:36:35,119 --> 03:36:37,279
ship features faster

5082
03:36:37,279 --> 03:36:39,520
it's so hard to see where

5083
03:36:39,520 --> 03:36:42,719
you fit as a security team in that

5084
03:36:42,719 --> 03:36:44,959
in that strategy right

5085
03:36:44,959 --> 03:36:47,279
it doesn't feel like a secure priority

5086
03:36:47,279 --> 03:36:49,039
either like shipping features faster

5087
03:36:49,039 --> 03:36:50,719
means that they're probably going to be

5088
03:36:50,719 --> 03:36:52,561
less secure because no one's going to

5089
03:36:52,561 --> 03:36:55,840
take the time to check that they ask you

5090
03:36:55,840 --> 03:36:58,799
but actually we do we do help

5091
03:36:58,799 --> 03:37:00,639
so what we can do

5092
03:37:00,639 --> 03:37:03,600
is we can make sure that we're enabling

5093
03:37:03,600 --> 03:37:05,920
these features to be developed quickly

5094
03:37:05,920 --> 03:37:07,439
and securely

5095
03:37:07,439 --> 03:37:09,119
you know one of the problems that we

5096
03:37:09,119 --> 03:37:10,719
always hear from people that are working

5097
03:37:10,719 --> 03:37:12,320
with us is that we're blockers that we

5098
03:37:12,320 --> 03:37:14,240
always get in people's way so when you

5099
03:37:14,240 --> 03:37:16,799
see a priority like this or similar your

5100
03:37:16,799 --> 03:37:18,959
job is to make sure that the security

5101
03:37:18,959 --> 03:37:20,959
that you need them to put in is not

5102
03:37:20,959 --> 03:37:24,160
going to make them take ages

5103
03:37:24,799 --> 03:37:26,719
the other one and this is my bread and

5104
03:37:26,719 --> 03:37:28,240
butter nowadays because i'm a product

5105
03:37:28,240 --> 03:37:29,520
manager

5106
03:37:29,520 --> 03:37:31,760
it's the customer value

5107
03:37:31,760 --> 03:37:35,439
okay how to make your users happy

5108
03:37:35,439 --> 03:37:38,000
i just want to clarify here

5109
03:37:38,000 --> 03:37:39,520
i'm going to talk about customers quite

5110
03:37:39,520 --> 03:37:42,000
a few times on the next few slides so

5111
03:37:42,000 --> 03:37:44,879
for me uh in a security team like a you

5112
03:37:44,879 --> 03:37:46,480
know we're kind of like a platform team

5113
03:37:46,480 --> 03:37:48,561
we serve the great organization we don't

5114
03:37:48,561 --> 03:37:50,240
interact directly with

5115
03:37:50,240 --> 03:37:51,920
our organization's customers which is

5116
03:37:51,920 --> 03:37:54,320
probably a good thing um this is someone

5117
03:37:54,320 --> 03:37:56,160
who directly interacts with our tools

5118
03:37:56,160 --> 03:37:58,080
and services so these are the product

5119
03:37:58,080 --> 03:38:00,160
teams that put an end point behind a waf

5120
03:38:00,160 --> 03:38:01,680
for example

5121
03:38:01,680 --> 03:38:03,439
or if you're in grc

5122
03:38:03,439 --> 03:38:04,799
probably

5123
03:38:04,799 --> 03:38:07,119
the team that has to go through

5124
03:38:07,119 --> 03:38:10,000
your risk treatment plan

5125
03:38:10,000 --> 03:38:12,480
so if i'm talking about a customer it

5126
03:38:12,480 --> 03:38:14,719
will be someone within the organization

5127
03:38:14,719 --> 03:38:17,039
that we are working with to help uplift

5128
03:38:17,039 --> 03:38:19,600
security

5129
03:38:20,480 --> 03:38:22,160
it was around here when i started

5130
03:38:22,160 --> 03:38:23,439
looking for customer value that i

5131
03:38:23,439 --> 03:38:27,279
realized that i needed i never had and i

5132
03:38:27,279 --> 03:38:30,160
never will escape from customer service

5133
03:38:30,160 --> 03:38:31,119
um

5134
03:38:31,119 --> 03:38:32,639
everything that was happening was very

5135
03:38:32,639 --> 03:38:35,439
familiar right like all of the problems

5136
03:38:35,439 --> 03:38:37,439
that i'd had with projects not being

5137
03:38:37,439 --> 03:38:39,359
appreciated and my team not being

5138
03:38:39,359 --> 03:38:41,680
appreciated and being underappreciated

5139
03:38:41,680 --> 03:38:43,760
by the people that use the stuff that we

5140
03:38:43,760 --> 03:38:45,439
deliver

5141
03:38:45,439 --> 03:38:48,959
it's all customer service related

5142
03:38:48,959 --> 03:38:50,719
but because i have a decade of

5143
03:38:50,719 --> 03:38:52,879
experience and customer service at least

5144
03:38:52,879 --> 03:38:55,119
i knew how to talk to customers

5145
03:38:55,119 --> 03:38:57,199
so i have put together a how to talk to

5146
03:38:57,199 --> 03:39:00,799
customers 101 slide for you

5147
03:39:00,959 --> 03:39:02,561
turns out you don't even have to talk

5148
03:39:02,561 --> 03:39:04,480
with them a lot of the time there is a

5149
03:39:04,480 --> 03:39:06,160
whole lot of techniques you can use to

5150
03:39:06,160 --> 03:39:07,840
listen to them without actually having

5151
03:39:07,840 --> 03:39:11,439
to talk to them one-on-one or at all

5152
03:39:11,439 --> 03:39:12,799
so

5153
03:39:12,799 --> 03:39:14,719
if you start looking into product

5154
03:39:14,719 --> 03:39:17,119
principles a lot of the time what you'll

5155
03:39:17,119 --> 03:39:20,400
hear and see is send out surveys and

5156
03:39:20,400 --> 03:39:22,080
what you've got to remember

5157
03:39:22,080 --> 03:39:24,561
in regards to sending out surveys is

5158
03:39:24,561 --> 03:39:25,920
that

5159
03:39:25,920 --> 03:39:28,160
these kind of blogs or

5160
03:39:28,160 --> 03:39:29,840
journal entries or whatever that people

5161
03:39:29,840 --> 03:39:32,400
put up about product

5162
03:39:32,400 --> 03:39:34,400
they're really targeted towards people

5163
03:39:34,400 --> 03:39:36,959
that have organizational customers right

5164
03:39:36,959 --> 03:39:39,360
customers that are using the

5165
03:39:39,360 --> 03:39:41,600
organization's product they might have

5166
03:39:41,600 --> 03:39:44,000
thirty forty thousand a million

5167
03:39:44,000 --> 03:39:46,798
customers so they can send out a survey

5168
03:39:46,798 --> 03:39:49,200
to five percent of the customer base and

5169
03:39:49,200 --> 03:39:50,240
only like

5170
03:39:50,240 --> 03:39:52,958
you know five percent actually respond

5171
03:39:52,958 --> 03:39:54,560
and they've still got like a good six or

5172
03:39:54,560 --> 03:39:56,080
seven hundred

5173
03:39:56,080 --> 03:39:58,480
people's feedback

5174
03:39:58,480 --> 03:40:01,040
when you're in an internal team

5175
03:40:01,040 --> 03:40:03,680
sometimes you know you'll only have

5176
03:40:03,680 --> 03:40:05,280
15 people

5177
03:40:05,280 --> 03:40:07,200
using the tool that you've built

5178
03:40:07,200 --> 03:40:09,600
so if you send out a survey to 10 of

5179
03:40:09,600 --> 03:40:11,840
those people that's 1.5 people

5180
03:40:11,840 --> 03:40:13,200
and then if only

5181
03:40:13,200 --> 03:40:15,120
5 of those people

5182
03:40:15,120 --> 03:40:18,320
actually reply well that's no one so

5183
03:40:18,320 --> 03:40:21,920
just be careful with surveys

5184
03:40:21,920 --> 03:40:24,400
not only just because

5185
03:40:24,400 --> 03:40:27,680
sometimes you won't get enough of a

5186
03:40:27,680 --> 03:40:29,200
you won't get enough people responding

5187
03:40:29,200 --> 03:40:31,440
to get actually any value out of it but

5188
03:40:31,440 --> 03:40:33,680
i also

5189
03:40:33,680 --> 03:40:34,798
you know

5190
03:40:34,798 --> 03:40:36,160
engineers

5191
03:40:36,160 --> 03:40:39,120
go to work to do engineering they don't

5192
03:40:39,120 --> 03:40:41,280
go to work just to answer surveys so you

5193
03:40:41,280 --> 03:40:42,958
just gotta be really careful with that i

5194
03:40:42,958 --> 03:40:44,718
would really just limit them to when you

5195
03:40:44,718 --> 03:40:47,440
have like a really big cross

5196
03:40:47,440 --> 03:40:48,798
organization

5197
03:40:48,798 --> 03:40:51,120
uh project going on so something like a

5198
03:40:51,120 --> 03:40:53,360
vulnerability management program or

5199
03:40:53,360 --> 03:40:55,920
devsecops or like those really big meaty

5200
03:40:55,920 --> 03:40:58,000
things that would be a good time to use

5201
03:40:58,000 --> 03:41:00,560
surveys

5202
03:41:02,400 --> 03:41:03,760
the other thing you can do is you can

5203
03:41:03,760 --> 03:41:05,680
look through your support tickets so i'm

5204
03:41:05,680 --> 03:41:07,520
sure we're not the only security team in

5205
03:41:07,520 --> 03:41:09,600
the world that had a whole lot of

5206
03:41:09,600 --> 03:41:11,600
support tickets coming in all the time

5207
03:41:11,600 --> 03:41:13,120
and something my amazing team had

5208
03:41:13,120 --> 03:41:14,480
already been doing well before i came

5209
03:41:14,480 --> 03:41:17,680
along was labeling the tickets so that

5210
03:41:17,680 --> 03:41:19,680
we knew which product the question was

5211
03:41:19,680 --> 03:41:20,878
about

5212
03:41:20,878 --> 03:41:22,560
and what that meant was that we could

5213
03:41:22,560 --> 03:41:24,320
actually do sort of an inventory how

5214
03:41:24,320 --> 03:41:25,840
many times people asked about each

5215
03:41:25,840 --> 03:41:26,878
product

5216
03:41:26,878 --> 03:41:29,680
and we can find outliers and have a look

5217
03:41:29,680 --> 03:41:32,878
deeper into them so we've got you know a

5218
03:41:32,878 --> 03:41:34,878
high a high much higher amount of

5219
03:41:34,878 --> 03:41:37,840
queries for aws im than anything else so

5220
03:41:37,840 --> 03:41:39,600
most likely there is something broken

5221
03:41:39,600 --> 03:41:42,160
there that we can probably remediate

5222
03:41:42,160 --> 03:41:43,760
and a lot of the time it will be around

5223
03:41:43,760 --> 03:41:46,798
documentation so you can look for key

5224
03:41:46,798 --> 03:41:49,040
sentences like tried to follow the

5225
03:41:49,040 --> 03:41:50,878
documentation but

5226
03:41:50,878 --> 03:41:52,560
which will most likely mean that your

5227
03:41:52,560 --> 03:41:56,000
documentation needs to be updated

5228
03:41:56,000 --> 03:41:58,160
could also say i couldn't find any

5229
03:41:58,160 --> 03:41:59,120
guides

5230
03:41:59,120 --> 03:42:01,360
maybe you need to add some guides or if

5231
03:42:01,360 --> 03:42:03,040
you already have them are they tagged

5232
03:42:03,040 --> 03:42:05,520
correctly if you're in confluence or is

5233
03:42:05,520 --> 03:42:06,798
it just that

5234
03:42:06,798 --> 03:42:08,480
the people that are using that tool

5235
03:42:08,480 --> 03:42:10,160
don't have access to confluence you need

5236
03:42:10,160 --> 03:42:12,958
to put it somewhere else

5237
03:42:13,920 --> 03:42:16,718
and the other one is help channels so

5238
03:42:16,718 --> 03:42:18,878
if you've got select help channels or

5239
03:42:18,878 --> 03:42:20,638
whatever you do to

5240
03:42:20,638 --> 03:42:22,160
for people to be able to contact you

5241
03:42:22,160 --> 03:42:23,840
directly

5242
03:42:23,840 --> 03:42:26,400
you can scroll through them and just see

5243
03:42:26,400 --> 03:42:28,000
what are people asking about what are

5244
03:42:28,000 --> 03:42:29,920
people complaining about

5245
03:42:29,920 --> 03:42:31,440
what do people like because sometimes

5246
03:42:31,440 --> 03:42:32,798
people actually do put shout outs and

5247
03:42:32,798 --> 03:42:35,040
help channels it's not an urban match it

5248
03:42:35,040 --> 03:42:37,840
does happen i promise

5249
03:42:39,680 --> 03:42:41,600
unfortunately at some point you probably

5250
03:42:41,600 --> 03:42:44,000
do need to go talk to them

5251
03:42:44,000 --> 03:42:45,280
so there's a couple of ways you could do

5252
03:42:45,280 --> 03:42:46,560
this

5253
03:42:46,560 --> 03:42:48,400
i don't know if this one's really

5254
03:42:48,400 --> 03:42:50,240
relevant as much as it used to be but

5255
03:42:50,240 --> 03:42:53,440
informal chats so when i became a team

5256
03:42:53,440 --> 03:42:54,798
lead and started going off on this

5257
03:42:54,798 --> 03:42:57,920
journey with my team i tried to go out

5258
03:42:57,920 --> 03:42:59,760
and find as many people as i can and

5259
03:42:59,760 --> 03:43:02,160
they were product owners or engineers

5260
03:43:02,160 --> 03:43:04,240
and kind of like try to build some sort

5261
03:43:04,240 --> 03:43:05,920
of relationship so i could at least say

5262
03:43:05,920 --> 03:43:08,480
hi and how are you and then maybe just

5263
03:43:08,480 --> 03:43:10,080
get them to just

5264
03:43:10,080 --> 03:43:12,000
if there's some big security thing going

5265
03:43:12,000 --> 03:43:13,920
on then they know i'm in security so

5266
03:43:13,920 --> 03:43:15,120
they're most likely going to bring it up

5267
03:43:15,120 --> 03:43:16,160
with me

5268
03:43:16,160 --> 03:43:19,680
so i could get information that way

5269
03:43:19,680 --> 03:43:22,240
the other one is customer interviews so

5270
03:43:22,240 --> 03:43:24,000
customer interview is when you book out

5271
03:43:24,000 --> 03:43:24,718
some

5272
03:43:24,718 --> 03:43:26,958
some of their time and you go through a

5273
03:43:26,958 --> 03:43:28,798
specific series of questions so this is

5274
03:43:28,798 --> 03:43:30,400
really good for gathering feedback from

5275
03:43:30,400 --> 03:43:33,360
a range of different people um

5276
03:43:33,360 --> 03:43:34,798
things to note make sure you come

5277
03:43:34,798 --> 03:43:36,798
prepared have a

5278
03:43:36,798 --> 03:43:39,520
set list of questions uh also make sure

5279
03:43:39,520 --> 03:43:41,680
it's only like 25 minutes long you don't

5280
03:43:41,680 --> 03:43:44,320
want to waste anyone's time and also

5281
03:43:44,320 --> 03:43:45,520
just try and make sure that you're

5282
03:43:45,520 --> 03:43:47,200
talking to a range of different people

5283
03:43:47,200 --> 03:43:49,200
it doesn't help if you're building a

5284
03:43:49,200 --> 03:43:51,120
tool that you're only

5285
03:43:51,120 --> 03:43:53,600
going to go talk to product owners when

5286
03:43:53,600 --> 03:43:54,798
they're not the ones that are actually

5287
03:43:54,798 --> 03:43:56,080
going to use the tool all the time maybe

5288
03:43:56,080 --> 03:43:57,440
they're only using a dashboard so go

5289
03:43:57,440 --> 03:43:59,760
talk to a po go talk to engineers go

5290
03:43:59,760 --> 03:44:01,280
talk to the principal engineers maybe

5291
03:44:01,280 --> 03:44:03,440
even talk to like team leads

5292
03:44:03,440 --> 03:44:05,360
talk to as many different people as you

5293
03:44:05,360 --> 03:44:09,040
can so you can get a range of feedback

5294
03:44:11,760 --> 03:44:13,680
so once you've got all this you know

5295
03:44:13,680 --> 03:44:15,440
what your customers want you know what

5296
03:44:15,440 --> 03:44:17,280
the business wants you've kind of like

5297
03:44:17,280 --> 03:44:19,760
started prioritizing

5298
03:44:19,760 --> 03:44:21,040
the next thing you need to do is you

5299
03:44:21,040 --> 03:44:22,958
have to go start looking at the bigger

5300
03:44:22,958 --> 03:44:25,360
picture

5301
03:44:25,760 --> 03:44:27,600
so something that happens in a lot of

5302
03:44:27,600 --> 03:44:29,280
security teams even lots of platform

5303
03:44:29,280 --> 03:44:31,040
teams as far as i've seen and everyone

5304
03:44:31,040 --> 03:44:32,718
i've talked to has told me this that

5305
03:44:32,718 --> 03:44:35,200
there's so much reactive work so many

5306
03:44:35,200 --> 03:44:37,200
things happen that prevent you from

5307
03:44:37,200 --> 03:44:39,120
doing other things

5308
03:44:39,120 --> 03:44:40,240
you know

5309
03:44:40,240 --> 03:44:41,520
people are falling off cliffs all the

5310
03:44:41,520 --> 03:44:43,040
time we've got to get our ambulance out

5311
03:44:43,040 --> 03:44:45,760
and we've got to go save them

5312
03:44:45,760 --> 03:44:47,120
but obviously

5313
03:44:47,120 --> 03:44:48,878
we don't want to be ambulances all the

5314
03:44:48,878 --> 03:44:51,040
time we really need to build a fence the

5315
03:44:51,040 --> 03:44:53,200
fence is the most logical thing to do we

5316
03:44:53,200 --> 03:44:54,480
need to go build a fence so we don't

5317
03:44:54,480 --> 03:44:56,160
have to pull out our ambulance all the

5318
03:44:56,160 --> 03:44:57,760
time

5319
03:44:57,760 --> 03:44:59,040
and there'll be some kind of timeline

5320
03:44:59,040 --> 03:45:00,878
that goes like this

5321
03:45:00,878 --> 03:45:02,560
where you'll make the assessment that

5322
03:45:02,560 --> 03:45:05,360
the ambulance is very inefficient

5323
03:45:05,360 --> 03:45:07,520
so we're like yes let's build a fence

5324
03:45:07,520 --> 03:45:09,040
but then you know we get started

5325
03:45:09,040 --> 03:45:10,560
building this fence and all of a sudden

5326
03:45:10,560 --> 03:45:12,000
long for jay happens and we need the

5327
03:45:12,000 --> 03:45:13,280
ambulance so we have to get that back

5328
03:45:13,280 --> 03:45:15,040
out again and then there's a risk above

5329
03:45:15,040 --> 03:45:16,320
tolerance so now we have to get the

5330
03:45:16,320 --> 03:45:18,000
ambulance out again

5331
03:45:18,000 --> 03:45:19,440
and then we get a little bit of breather

5332
03:45:19,440 --> 03:45:20,718
and we're like oh my goodness this

5333
03:45:20,718 --> 03:45:22,638
ambulance is so inefficient we should

5334
03:45:22,638 --> 03:45:24,400
really build a fence

5335
03:45:24,400 --> 03:45:25,920
and we tr we're like okay let's build

5336
03:45:25,920 --> 03:45:27,520
friends and we start building that fence

5337
03:45:27,520 --> 03:45:28,878
and then all of a sudden something else

5338
03:45:28,878 --> 03:45:32,400
happens and the ambulance comes back

5339
03:45:32,958 --> 03:45:35,680
the other thing is a fence isn't built

5340
03:45:35,680 --> 03:45:38,560
in a day you can't just build a fence

5341
03:45:38,560 --> 03:45:40,958
you have to do a number of smaller steps

5342
03:45:40,958 --> 03:45:42,958
towards building a fence

5343
03:45:42,958 --> 03:45:44,240
you have to chop down trees you have to

5344
03:45:44,240 --> 03:45:46,000
make fence posts and you buy some tools

5345
03:45:46,000 --> 03:45:48,718
you need to dig some holes and you know

5346
03:45:48,718 --> 03:45:50,798
when we say build a fence what even if

5347
03:45:50,798 --> 03:45:52,400
we get a little bit of the way through

5348
03:45:52,400 --> 03:45:54,080
that probably after we've bought some

5349
03:45:54,080 --> 03:45:55,520
tools a whole lot of stuff is going to

5350
03:45:55,520 --> 03:45:57,040
happen we need to bring that ambulance

5351
03:45:57,040 --> 03:45:58,958
back out and start using it again and

5352
03:45:58,958 --> 03:46:00,480
again

5353
03:46:00,480 --> 03:46:02,480
and then 12 months later we'll come

5354
03:46:02,480 --> 03:46:03,920
across these tools that we bought we're

5355
03:46:03,920 --> 03:46:05,040
like oh yeah

5356
03:46:05,040 --> 03:46:08,400
that's right we're building a fence

5357
03:46:09,760 --> 03:46:12,240
and i mean these are some types of

5358
03:46:12,240 --> 03:46:14,240
security fences right

5359
03:46:14,240 --> 03:46:16,400
we already we all know what these are

5360
03:46:16,400 --> 03:46:18,718
most of us zero trust we've heard that

5361
03:46:18,718 --> 03:46:21,120
word a lot the last couple days

5362
03:46:21,120 --> 03:46:24,080
um uber is another one that i hear a lot

5363
03:46:24,080 --> 03:46:26,560
and of course devsecops

5364
03:46:26,560 --> 03:46:28,718
like these are all good initiatives but

5365
03:46:28,718 --> 03:46:30,638
you can't get them done in three months

5366
03:46:30,638 --> 03:46:32,080
they're not like just one part of

5367
03:46:32,080 --> 03:46:34,560
something you actually have to look to

5368
03:46:34,560 --> 03:46:36,878
the future and plan your way along and

5369
03:46:36,878 --> 03:46:38,958
you have to account for the fact that

5370
03:46:38,958 --> 03:46:40,638
sometimes you're going to have to bring

5371
03:46:40,638 --> 03:46:43,440
the ambulance out

5372
03:46:43,440 --> 03:46:45,760
so anyway make a roadmap it's like the

5373
03:46:45,760 --> 03:46:47,760
most simple thing you can do and a

5374
03:46:47,760 --> 03:46:50,400
roadmap is not a document that you just

5375
03:46:50,400 --> 03:46:52,798
write things down set and forget

5376
03:46:52,798 --> 03:46:54,798
that is not going to help you or help

5377
03:46:54,798 --> 03:46:56,480
anyone and you might as well just not do

5378
03:46:56,480 --> 03:47:00,160
it a roadmap is a living document

5379
03:47:00,160 --> 03:47:02,400
what that means is that

5380
03:47:02,400 --> 03:47:05,120
you can have these steps out

5381
03:47:05,120 --> 03:47:06,958
but then if after you make the fence

5382
03:47:06,958 --> 03:47:08,320
posts

5383
03:47:08,320 --> 03:47:09,200
you

5384
03:47:09,200 --> 03:47:10,400
have something happen that you have to

5385
03:47:10,400 --> 03:47:12,160
bring the ambulance back in or another

5386
03:47:12,160 --> 03:47:13,920
priority happens you know something

5387
03:47:13,920 --> 03:47:16,080
other than building a fence for a second

5388
03:47:16,080 --> 03:47:17,680
you can add that in and squish

5389
03:47:17,680 --> 03:47:19,520
everything down and make sure that once

5390
03:47:19,520 --> 03:47:20,958
you've finished with that ambulance or

5391
03:47:20,958 --> 03:47:22,878
finished with that other priority you go

5392
03:47:22,878 --> 03:47:25,360
back heading towards them that vision

5393
03:47:25,360 --> 03:47:31,000
that you have of devsecops or xero trust

5394
03:47:33,360 --> 03:47:36,958
so we did all that we had a roadmap

5395
03:47:36,958 --> 03:47:39,680
and we talked to our customers and

5396
03:47:39,680 --> 03:47:41,120
we made sure that everything we did

5397
03:47:41,120 --> 03:47:44,000
aligned with the business value and we

5398
03:47:44,000 --> 03:47:45,600
were making sure that we were you know

5399
03:47:45,600 --> 03:47:47,680
doing things that we consider valuable

5400
03:47:47,680 --> 03:47:51,680
and minimizing toil and using cool stuff

5401
03:47:51,680 --> 03:47:53,920
so you know we didn't really know it at

5402
03:47:53,920 --> 03:47:55,360
the time but we were kind of becoming a

5403
03:47:55,360 --> 03:47:57,760
product team

5404
03:47:57,760 --> 03:47:59,040
what happened next what did they

5405
03:47:59,040 --> 03:48:02,560
actually do what did we actually see

5406
03:48:02,560 --> 03:48:03,760
well

5407
03:48:03,760 --> 03:48:06,000
we started getting stuff done

5408
03:48:06,000 --> 03:48:08,400
you know we didn't just like say

5409
03:48:08,400 --> 03:48:09,520
we're going to get this done in three

5410
03:48:09,520 --> 03:48:11,440
months but then it didn't get done for

5411
03:48:11,440 --> 03:48:13,040
like a year and a half because we're

5412
03:48:13,040 --> 03:48:14,400
working on 20 other things at the same

5413
03:48:14,400 --> 03:48:16,560
time we actually started regularly

5414
03:48:16,560 --> 03:48:18,320
showing you know finishing work and

5415
03:48:18,320 --> 03:48:19,680
showing value

5416
03:48:19,680 --> 03:48:22,638
and people noticed that

5417
03:48:22,638 --> 03:48:24,320
we even have got to the point where

5418
03:48:24,320 --> 03:48:27,360
users willingly adopt our tools

5419
03:48:27,360 --> 03:48:29,840
even very recently we released an an

5420
03:48:29,840 --> 03:48:31,760
alternative way to access the platform

5421
03:48:31,760 --> 03:48:33,440
it's a way that's more secure and works

5422
03:48:33,440 --> 03:48:36,160
more with our long-term vision

5423
03:48:36,160 --> 03:48:37,680
in the past it would have had everyone

5424
03:48:37,680 --> 03:48:39,440
complaining oh my god why we have to do

5425
03:48:39,440 --> 03:48:40,878
the security ways makes things so

5426
03:48:40,878 --> 03:48:42,958
difficult

5427
03:48:42,958 --> 03:48:44,718
but with this tool we had been talking

5428
03:48:44,718 --> 03:48:46,878
to our customers and adapting and making

5429
03:48:46,878 --> 03:48:48,480
sure that it's doing the things that

5430
03:48:48,480 --> 03:48:50,160
they want and we're making as easy as it

5431
03:48:50,160 --> 03:48:52,320
possible for them to adopt it all we had

5432
03:48:52,320 --> 03:48:54,080
to do is tell them that exists they go

5433
03:48:54,080 --> 03:48:55,440
in and try it and they have such a good

5434
03:48:55,440 --> 03:48:58,000
experience that they just keep using it

5435
03:48:58,000 --> 03:48:59,920
i mean they'll be the outliers people

5436
03:48:59,920 --> 03:49:01,600
that don't like change

5437
03:49:01,600 --> 03:49:02,798
that's fine

5438
03:49:02,798 --> 03:49:05,840
we can mandate them but the majority of

5439
03:49:05,840 --> 03:49:07,280
the company

5440
03:49:07,280 --> 03:49:09,440
will be you know they just did it

5441
03:49:09,440 --> 03:49:11,040
themselves and it was nice it's a nice

5442
03:49:11,040 --> 03:49:12,480
experience

5443
03:49:12,480 --> 03:49:15,120
and obviously like when people willingly

5444
03:49:15,120 --> 03:49:16,958
use your tools and actually actively use

5445
03:49:16,958 --> 03:49:18,798
them every day

5446
03:49:18,798 --> 03:49:20,638
like you get a better security posture

5447
03:49:20,638 --> 03:49:21,920
right because otherwise why are we

5448
03:49:21,920 --> 03:49:23,680
building these things why are we writing

5449
03:49:23,680 --> 03:49:26,160
risk reports why are we

5450
03:49:26,160 --> 03:49:28,480
building automation for access why are

5451
03:49:28,480 --> 03:49:30,160
we doing any of it

5452
03:49:30,160 --> 03:49:33,360
and so that people start using it and

5453
03:49:33,360 --> 03:49:37,360
we become more secure as an organization

5454
03:49:37,360 --> 03:49:39,600
but the biggest benefit to me

5455
03:49:39,600 --> 03:49:41,920
probably because of all my decade of

5456
03:49:41,920 --> 03:49:43,440
customer service

5457
03:49:43,440 --> 03:49:45,840
was that we don't feel like the enemy

5458
03:49:45,840 --> 03:49:47,920
anymore like obviously we still do

5459
03:49:47,920 --> 03:49:50,000
things that they don't like every now

5460
03:49:50,000 --> 03:49:52,080
and again the decision will come along

5461
03:49:52,080 --> 03:49:54,638
that you know they're not quite on board

5462
03:49:54,638 --> 03:49:56,000
with but

5463
03:49:56,000 --> 03:49:57,840
they'll still work with us and they'll

5464
03:49:57,840 --> 03:49:59,280
still like kind of get it done while

5465
03:49:59,280 --> 03:50:00,480
they grumble

5466
03:50:00,480 --> 03:50:02,160
it doesn't feel like we're public enemy

5467
03:50:02,160 --> 03:50:03,760
number one it feels like we're part of a

5468
03:50:03,760 --> 03:50:06,400
greater team

5469
03:50:08,080 --> 03:50:08,958
so

5470
03:50:08,958 --> 03:50:11,440
you might be thinking candace this is

5471
03:50:11,440 --> 03:50:12,798
kind of wasting my time this is all

5472
03:50:12,798 --> 03:50:14,798
really obvious stuff i'm pretty sure we

5473
03:50:14,798 --> 03:50:17,200
already do all of that

5474
03:50:17,200 --> 03:50:18,560
well

5475
03:50:18,560 --> 03:50:20,240
i don't think you do

5476
03:50:20,240 --> 03:50:21,680
so

5477
03:50:21,680 --> 03:50:24,160
i've got a scenario for you

5478
03:50:24,160 --> 03:50:26,080
and just have a think and see if this

5479
03:50:26,080 --> 03:50:27,840
applies to your team and your

5480
03:50:27,840 --> 03:50:30,400
organization

5481
03:50:30,400 --> 03:50:32,320
so let's say there's a used ux

5482
03:50:32,320 --> 03:50:33,680
governance group

5483
03:50:33,680 --> 03:50:35,280
and they do audits

5484
03:50:35,280 --> 03:50:37,120
and at some point the ux team has come

5485
03:50:37,120 --> 03:50:38,480
around and told everyone that they need

5486
03:50:38,480 --> 03:50:40,160
to install this agent or run the script

5487
03:50:40,160 --> 03:50:42,400
on any sort of online reports and it's

5488
03:50:42,400 --> 03:50:44,480
going to spit out a list of flaws and

5489
03:50:44,480 --> 03:50:46,718
you need to remediate them

5490
03:50:46,718 --> 03:50:49,360
it spits out something like this

5491
03:50:49,360 --> 03:50:52,000
like i don't know about all you but

5492
03:50:52,000 --> 03:50:53,760
i don't know anything

5493
03:50:53,760 --> 03:50:57,760
i know sweet fa about you ux like i can

5494
03:50:57,760 --> 03:50:59,600
pick out words here that i recognize but

5495
03:50:59,600 --> 03:51:01,680
i would have absolutely no clue how to

5496
03:51:01,680 --> 03:51:03,920
go about fixing any of these things

5497
03:51:03,920 --> 03:51:06,000
like what is this

5498
03:51:06,000 --> 03:51:09,120
why do i need to have a nice ux

5499
03:51:09,120 --> 03:51:10,160
like

5500
03:51:10,160 --> 03:51:12,480
and then how do i do it

5501
03:51:12,480 --> 03:51:13,920
and where am i supposed to start these

5502
03:51:13,920 --> 03:51:16,798
little things on here

5503
03:51:17,520 --> 03:51:19,040
the most likely scenario that's going to

5504
03:51:19,040 --> 03:51:20,560
happen right now is i'm going to try to

5505
03:51:20,560 --> 03:51:22,000
remediate

5506
03:51:22,000 --> 03:51:23,600
and i won't be able to figure it out

5507
03:51:23,600 --> 03:51:25,920
because this is just way outside where i

5508
03:51:25,920 --> 03:51:28,798
am as a security person

5509
03:51:28,798 --> 03:51:30,400
another priority comes in you know an

5510
03:51:30,400 --> 03:51:32,798
actual security priority the reason that

5511
03:51:32,798 --> 03:51:36,240
i'm here to keep people secure not make

5512
03:51:36,240 --> 03:51:38,320
pretty things

5513
03:51:38,320 --> 03:51:40,638
and i'm going to ignore this

5514
03:51:40,638 --> 03:51:42,560
but you know it's our ux governance

5515
03:51:42,560 --> 03:51:45,280
group they have authority

5516
03:51:45,280 --> 03:51:46,080
and

5517
03:51:46,080 --> 03:51:48,240
our leaders are being measured on their

5518
03:51:48,240 --> 03:51:51,920
team's compliance to these ux

5519
03:51:51,920 --> 03:51:54,320
uh remediation reports

5520
03:51:54,320 --> 03:51:56,240
so my manager comes in they're like you

5521
03:51:56,240 --> 03:51:57,680
need to get this done i'm getting

5522
03:51:57,680 --> 03:51:59,920
measured by this

5523
03:51:59,920 --> 03:52:02,638
so i do my best and i go back

5524
03:52:02,638 --> 03:52:04,638
and i try to remediate something and

5525
03:52:04,638 --> 03:52:06,718
maybe i remediate one thing but in

5526
03:52:06,718 --> 03:52:08,080
general i don't really know what i'm

5527
03:52:08,080 --> 03:52:09,840
doing

5528
03:52:09,840 --> 03:52:11,360
and then another priority comes in like

5529
03:52:11,360 --> 03:52:12,958
an actual security priority that i

5530
03:52:12,958 --> 03:52:16,000
actually care about and so i ignore this

5531
03:52:16,000 --> 03:52:18,000
and then it goes back to my manager and

5532
03:52:18,000 --> 03:52:20,400
then my manager is coming back to me and

5533
03:52:20,400 --> 03:52:23,120
this endless circle until it goes on and

5534
03:52:23,120 --> 03:52:24,638
on and at some point it just becomes

5535
03:52:24,638 --> 03:52:26,878
white noise and like just a

5536
03:52:26,878 --> 03:52:28,160
you know a ritual you do with your

5537
03:52:28,160 --> 03:52:29,200
manager

5538
03:52:29,200 --> 03:52:33,440
go remediate these things okay

5539
03:52:33,440 --> 03:52:36,440
no

5540
03:52:38,958 --> 03:52:39,840
so

5541
03:52:39,840 --> 03:52:42,080
i really hope that this is familiar to

5542
03:52:42,080 --> 03:52:44,560
all of you

5543
03:52:46,240 --> 03:52:47,760
because

5544
03:52:47,760 --> 03:52:50,400
this is vulnerability management

5545
03:52:50,400 --> 03:52:52,480
we literally do this to product teams

5546
03:52:52,480 --> 03:52:55,120
all the time we give them this massive

5547
03:52:55,120 --> 03:52:56,718
list of things that they have to

5548
03:52:56,718 --> 03:52:58,080
remediate

5549
03:52:58,080 --> 03:52:59,920
and they're a product team right they

5550
03:52:59,920 --> 03:53:01,840
just want to make their cool features

5551
03:53:01,840 --> 03:53:02,958
and like they want to go make the

5552
03:53:02,958 --> 03:53:04,400
company money that is their priority

5553
03:53:04,400 --> 03:53:05,680
that's what they care about and we give

5554
03:53:05,680 --> 03:53:08,480
this big big list of things that they

5555
03:53:08,480 --> 03:53:10,320
have to fix you know why should they do

5556
03:53:10,320 --> 03:53:13,840
it we've never had a security breach

5557
03:53:16,320 --> 03:53:17,440
so this is

5558
03:53:17,440 --> 03:53:19,760
this should be very familiar

5559
03:53:19,760 --> 03:53:23,120
and this is what we should be doing

5560
03:53:23,680 --> 03:53:26,240
so the ux team when they say that i

5561
03:53:26,240 --> 03:53:27,840
haven't remediated all of these things

5562
03:53:27,840 --> 03:53:29,360
they should not be going to my manager

5563
03:53:29,360 --> 03:53:31,120
and telling my manager to tell me be

5564
03:53:31,120 --> 03:53:33,840
compliant so it's clearly not working

5565
03:53:33,840 --> 03:53:35,600
they say they come talk to me and i'm

5566
03:53:35,600 --> 03:53:38,160
like i don't know what this is

5567
03:53:38,160 --> 03:53:41,200
so at the at minimum they add a title at

5568
03:53:41,200 --> 03:53:43,040
the top of the report like i'd you know

5569
03:53:43,040 --> 03:53:44,000
they should have done that in the first

5570
03:53:44,000 --> 03:53:46,160
place so at least now i know what it is

5571
03:53:46,160 --> 03:53:48,400
it's a user experience audit report

5572
03:53:48,400 --> 03:53:52,080
and it's for security tool for

5573
03:53:52,560 --> 03:53:55,040
and i'm like okay that's cool

5574
03:53:55,040 --> 03:53:56,400
why do i need to do it i don't care

5575
03:53:56,400 --> 03:53:58,798
about ux

5576
03:53:58,798 --> 03:53:59,600
so

5577
03:53:59,600 --> 03:54:02,560
you know add another line in there it's

5578
03:54:02,560 --> 03:54:04,718
to make sure that we're compliant

5579
03:54:04,718 --> 03:54:08,080
with these audits and also the ux policy

5580
03:54:08,080 --> 03:54:10,560
that everyone at your organization has

5581
03:54:10,560 --> 03:54:13,360
to comply with

5582
03:54:13,360 --> 03:54:14,798
i would really hope that that also

5583
03:54:14,798 --> 03:54:17,200
backed this up by going to like global

5584
03:54:17,200 --> 03:54:20,480
all hand meetings or whatever you have

5585
03:54:20,480 --> 03:54:21,280
and

5586
03:54:21,280 --> 03:54:23,680
educating people on the fact that there

5587
03:54:23,680 --> 03:54:25,840
is this ux governance group and we do do

5588
03:54:25,840 --> 03:54:28,000
ux audits and if we aren't complying

5589
03:54:28,000 --> 03:54:29,760
with it then we lose hundreds and

5590
03:54:29,760 --> 03:54:31,760
hundreds of customers and millions of

5591
03:54:31,760 --> 03:54:35,280
dollars or whatever the reasons are

5592
03:54:36,878 --> 03:54:38,798
and then i'm going to be like i actually

5593
03:54:38,798 --> 03:54:40,958
have no idea what most these words are

5594
03:54:40,958 --> 03:54:43,520
so i'm not going to be able to fix this

5595
03:54:43,520 --> 03:54:46,320
how do i do it

5596
03:54:46,320 --> 03:54:48,638
well at least this helps right

5597
03:54:48,638 --> 03:54:51,920
it's kind of more clear directions on

5598
03:54:51,920 --> 03:54:53,440
what i can do to remediate these

5599
03:54:53,440 --> 03:54:54,560
problems

5600
03:54:54,560 --> 03:54:55,760
i mean there's still a lot of them and i

5601
03:54:55,760 --> 03:54:57,200
still don't quite know what i'm doing at

5602
03:54:57,200 --> 03:55:00,160
least i'm getting somewhere

5603
03:55:00,160 --> 03:55:02,080
but then the last one is there's so much

5604
03:55:02,080 --> 03:55:04,000
work here and there's only so much time

5605
03:55:04,000 --> 03:55:05,920
that i can devote to not doing security

5606
03:55:05,920 --> 03:55:06,798
things

5607
03:55:06,798 --> 03:55:08,958
so where do i start

5608
03:55:08,958 --> 03:55:10,638
like it's literally as simple as adding

5609
03:55:10,638 --> 03:55:13,120
a priority list

5610
03:55:13,120 --> 03:55:16,000
start at number 10

5611
03:55:17,920 --> 03:55:19,360
even better

5612
03:55:19,360 --> 03:55:22,080
maybe the ux team realizes that most the

5613
03:55:22,080 --> 03:55:23,680
people in the company just don't have

5614
03:55:23,680 --> 03:55:25,680
the time to be fixing these things all

5615
03:55:25,680 --> 03:55:26,798
the time

5616
03:55:26,798 --> 03:55:28,400
and they just automate the whole thing

5617
03:55:28,400 --> 03:55:29,760
away so you don't even have to think

5618
03:55:29,760 --> 03:55:32,080
about it

5619
03:55:34,160 --> 03:55:36,480
so i've said a lot of words

5620
03:55:36,480 --> 03:55:39,040
in the last half an hour

5621
03:55:39,040 --> 03:55:41,440
about a lot of random things

5622
03:55:41,440 --> 03:55:43,120
but if there's nothing else that you

5623
03:55:43,120 --> 03:55:45,680
remember from this talk today the one

5624
03:55:45,680 --> 03:55:47,360
thing that i want you to take away from

5625
03:55:47,360 --> 03:55:48,320
this

5626
03:55:48,320 --> 03:55:51,120
is that you as a security person whether

5627
03:55:51,120 --> 03:55:53,040
you're an engineering team

5628
03:55:53,040 --> 03:55:55,040
or you're a consultant

5629
03:55:55,040 --> 03:55:57,840
or you're in a grc team

5630
03:55:57,840 --> 03:55:59,920
go talk to your customers and find out

5631
03:55:59,920 --> 03:56:01,840
what they need

5632
03:56:01,840 --> 03:56:04,718
whether it's about a tool or a report or

5633
03:56:04,718 --> 03:56:06,718
some sort of dashboard you need to go

5634
03:56:06,718 --> 03:56:07,920
talk to them and make sure that they

5635
03:56:07,920 --> 03:56:09,520
understand it

5636
03:56:09,520 --> 03:56:11,520
that they know what is required of them

5637
03:56:11,520 --> 03:56:13,680
don't make assumptions that they

5638
03:56:13,680 --> 03:56:16,320
understand what's on there

5639
03:56:16,320 --> 03:56:19,199
just go talk to them

5640
03:56:19,440 --> 03:56:21,200
we really just

5641
03:56:21,200 --> 03:56:22,718
as a

5642
03:56:22,718 --> 03:56:23,760
you know

5643
03:56:23,760 --> 03:56:25,440
an engineering function

5644
03:56:25,440 --> 03:56:27,440
or whatever we are security just needs

5645
03:56:27,440 --> 03:56:29,600
to stop telling people to build secure

5646
03:56:29,600 --> 03:56:33,600
products telling does not help anyone

5647
03:56:33,600 --> 03:56:35,360
if you want to be scalable if you want

5648
03:56:35,360 --> 03:56:36,480
to be effective

5649
03:56:36,480 --> 03:56:38,798
you need to start enabling people to

5650
03:56:38,798 --> 03:56:42,240
build secure products

5651
03:56:42,560 --> 03:56:45,877
that's the end

5652
03:56:48,450 --> 03:56:53,319
[Applause]

5653
03:56:54,718 --> 03:56:57,280
thank you very much candice

5654
03:56:57,280 --> 03:56:59,920
right lunchtime uh we're running about

5655
03:56:59,920 --> 03:57:02,480
10 15 behind schedule so we'll push the

5656
03:57:02,480 --> 03:57:04,718
lunch break out to make it now long

5657
03:57:04,718 --> 03:57:06,560
so we'll be coming back at

5658
03:57:06,560 --> 03:57:08,560
what does it say one

5659
03:57:08,560 --> 03:57:10,240
what do we say on the schedule 50

5660
03:57:10,240 --> 03:57:12,638
minutes behind that

5661
03:57:12,638 --> 03:57:15,600
we said 145 so probably

5662
03:57:15,600 --> 03:57:18,320
two at this point but anyway go forth

5663
03:57:18,320 --> 03:57:20,240
get some fresh air go outside see your

5664
03:57:20,240 --> 03:57:21,920
friends eat a snack

5665
03:57:21,920 --> 03:57:25,638
and we'll see you back soon

5666
05:05:47,840 --> 05:05:50,160
hello

5667
05:05:50,558 --> 05:05:52,080
hi

5668
05:05:52,080 --> 05:05:54,030
hello

5669
05:05:54,030 --> 05:05:55,680
[Applause]

5670
05:05:55,680 --> 05:05:57,680
hopefully

5671
05:05:57,680 --> 05:05:59,200
hopefully everyone had a pretty good

5672
05:05:59,200 --> 05:06:00,080
lunch

5673
05:06:00,080 --> 05:06:02,160
um the next round of talks that we're

5674
05:06:02,160 --> 05:06:03,440
going to be getting into are what we

5675
05:06:03,440 --> 05:06:05,120
call our lightning talks so it's going

5676
05:06:05,120 --> 05:06:06,958
to go really really fast

5677
05:06:06,958 --> 05:06:08,958
15 minutes back to back

5678
05:06:08,958 --> 05:06:12,320
some sparkly warnings will come up

5679
05:06:12,320 --> 05:06:13,840
when people are going over time or too

5680
05:06:13,840 --> 05:06:15,680
close to time

5681
05:06:15,680 --> 05:06:17,280
and the thing i really like about these

5682
05:06:17,280 --> 05:06:19,600
next seven talks is that we'll see a few

5683
05:06:19,600 --> 05:06:21,120
familiar faces

5684
05:06:21,120 --> 05:06:22,400
from previous

5685
05:06:22,400 --> 05:06:24,080
kiwicon fame

5686
05:06:24,080 --> 05:06:26,240
but we'll also see some new faces

5687
05:06:26,240 --> 05:06:28,080
some faces that we might you know

5688
05:06:28,080 --> 05:06:29,440
definitely have not seen in previous

5689
05:06:29,440 --> 05:06:31,680
cowboy cons or kiwicons but some new

5690
05:06:31,680 --> 05:06:32,958
speakers to

5691
05:06:32,958 --> 05:06:35,440
speaking in general which includes our

5692
05:06:35,440 --> 05:06:37,440
um first speaker who i think has a

5693
05:06:37,440 --> 05:06:39,200
little what i called a fan club but

5694
05:06:39,200 --> 05:06:40,718
maybe it's more of a heckling squad

5695
05:06:40,718 --> 05:06:42,160
somewhere down here

5696
05:06:42,160 --> 05:06:44,558
um and perhaps also on the live stream

5697
05:06:44,558 --> 05:06:46,240
but introducing our first lightning

5698
05:06:46,240 --> 05:06:49,410
round speaker kento

5699
05:06:49,410 --> 05:06:55,680
[Applause]

5700
05:06:55,680 --> 05:06:57,280
okay cured everyone hope you had a good

5701
05:06:57,280 --> 05:06:59,600
lunch managed to get a good feed in i'm

5702
05:06:59,600 --> 05:07:00,878
stoked to be starting this round of

5703
05:07:00,878 --> 05:07:02,320
lighting talks actually i do have a bit

5704
05:07:02,320 --> 05:07:03,680
to cover though so i'll get straight

5705
05:07:03,680 --> 05:07:05,520
into it with a quick intro

5706
05:07:05,520 --> 05:07:07,680
um so hey i'm kento bit of a cyber

5707
05:07:07,680 --> 05:07:09,440
security generalist at this point

5708
05:07:09,440 --> 05:07:11,440
currently i work for westpac bank up in

5709
05:07:11,440 --> 05:07:14,000
auckland so here is a photo from

5710
05:07:14,000 --> 05:07:15,440
auckland a couple weeks ago on a good

5711
05:07:15,440 --> 05:07:17,680
day and hey to my absolute amazement

5712
05:07:17,680 --> 05:07:18,798
we've had a couple of good days in

5713
05:07:18,798 --> 05:07:20,718
wellington as well so a bit of a bonus

5714
05:07:20,718 --> 05:07:22,798
there

5715
05:07:22,798 --> 05:07:24,480
now

5716
05:07:24,480 --> 05:07:26,798
thank you for that one uh now like

5717
05:07:26,798 --> 05:07:28,240
pretty much everyone can relate to at

5718
05:07:28,240 --> 05:07:30,240
this point uh i also spent a lot of last

5719
05:07:30,240 --> 05:07:32,558
year in lockdowns right and for me

5720
05:07:32,558 --> 05:07:34,320
personally i didn't have too much going

5721
05:07:34,320 --> 05:07:36,480
on i got pretty bored and i ended up

5722
05:07:36,480 --> 05:07:38,160
spending way more time than i really

5723
05:07:38,160 --> 05:07:40,160
should have on twitter now on most

5724
05:07:40,160 --> 05:07:41,920
occasions i didn't find too much

5725
05:07:41,920 --> 05:07:43,600
interesting on there but on this one

5726
05:07:43,600 --> 05:07:45,600
particular day august of last year i

5727
05:07:45,600 --> 05:07:47,360
came across this tweet by a username

5728
05:07:47,360 --> 05:07:48,558
john hat

5729
05:07:48,558 --> 05:07:49,840
so talk you may have seen this one

5730
05:07:49,840 --> 05:07:51,520
actually it kind of went semi-viral but

5731
05:07:51,520 --> 05:07:53,280
it basically talks about a local

5732
05:07:53,280 --> 05:07:55,200
privilege escalation you could get by

5733
05:07:55,200 --> 05:07:57,600
having access to a razer device now for

5734
05:07:57,600 --> 05:07:59,760
those who don't know razer is a company

5735
05:07:59,760 --> 05:08:01,680
that make pc peripherals for video

5736
05:08:01,680 --> 05:08:04,160
gamers so these are things like gaming

5737
05:08:04,160 --> 05:08:06,718
mice keyboards and headsets

5738
05:08:06,718 --> 05:08:07,920
what was happening here is you would

5739
05:08:07,920 --> 05:08:10,160
plug in a razer device to your pc that

5740
05:08:10,160 --> 05:08:11,840
would automatically start to install

5741
05:08:11,840 --> 05:08:14,080
this razer gaming software and that was

5742
05:08:14,080 --> 05:08:15,680
actually installing with system so from

5743
05:08:15,680 --> 05:08:17,280
there you could change the install

5744
05:08:17,280 --> 05:08:19,200
location of the software get a file

5745
05:08:19,200 --> 05:08:21,120
explorer session and then you go shift

5746
05:08:21,120 --> 05:08:23,520
right click open powershell window here

5747
05:08:23,520 --> 05:08:26,160
and you get a system shell

5748
05:08:26,160 --> 05:08:27,200
this is kind of what that looks like

5749
05:08:27,200 --> 05:08:28,958
just from a very basic sort of diagram

5750
05:08:28,958 --> 05:08:31,120
view you've got me like low level kind

5751
05:08:31,120 --> 05:08:33,360
of user pretty sad can't do too much

5752
05:08:33,360 --> 05:08:35,600
plugs in a razor mouse two windows

5753
05:08:35,600 --> 05:08:37,520
windows then automatically loads this

5754
05:08:37,520 --> 05:08:39,440
razer gaming software with system

5755
05:08:39,440 --> 05:08:41,200
privileges and then you just convert

5756
05:08:41,200 --> 05:08:43,680
that pretty easily into a system shell

5757
05:08:43,680 --> 05:08:44,798
once you have that you're pretty much

5758
05:08:44,798 --> 05:08:47,280
free to do whatever you want right

5759
05:08:47,280 --> 05:08:49,200
now i had a razer mouse lying around at

5760
05:08:49,200 --> 05:08:50,480
home and you know i thought this is

5761
05:08:50,480 --> 05:08:52,240
pretty interesting so i recreated it

5762
05:08:52,240 --> 05:08:53,920
plugged it in it worked totally well

5763
05:08:53,920 --> 05:08:56,400
like super easily and if anything that

5764
05:08:56,400 --> 05:08:58,240
actually made me more interested like i

5765
05:08:58,240 --> 05:08:59,600
wanted to really understand what was

5766
05:08:59,600 --> 05:09:00,958
going on here

5767
05:09:00,958 --> 05:09:02,480
so there are these two areas that kind

5768
05:09:02,480 --> 05:09:04,718
of like really picked my interest the

5769
05:09:04,718 --> 05:09:06,878
first is this section in the red this is

5770
05:09:06,878 --> 05:09:09,120
the how aspect to all of this like how

5771
05:09:09,120 --> 05:09:11,840
does windows actually identify what usb

5772
05:09:11,840 --> 05:09:13,840
device was plugged in and how does it

5773
05:09:13,840 --> 05:09:16,080
then know what drivers or applications

5774
05:09:16,080 --> 05:09:18,160
need to be installed

5775
05:09:18,160 --> 05:09:19,840
and the second section is the section in

5776
05:09:19,840 --> 05:09:21,840
blue this is the kind of why aspect just

5777
05:09:21,840 --> 05:09:23,760
by saying well why does all of this get

5778
05:09:23,760 --> 05:09:25,520
to run with system privileges with such

5779
05:09:25,520 --> 05:09:27,360
a high level of privilege on the local

5780
05:09:27,360 --> 05:09:28,718
machine

5781
05:09:28,718 --> 05:09:30,240
so wanting to understand this how and

5782
05:09:30,240 --> 05:09:31,920
the why is what really kicked off my

5783
05:09:31,920 --> 05:09:33,280
journey down this rabbit hole where i

5784
05:09:33,280 --> 05:09:35,600
came to realize just how much of a mess

5785
05:09:35,600 --> 05:09:38,320
this entire ecosystem of usb devices and

5786
05:09:38,320 --> 05:09:40,480
windows really is and how easily you can

5787
05:09:40,480 --> 05:09:41,920
actually exploit that with just an

5788
05:09:41,920 --> 05:09:43,920
android phone

5789
05:09:43,920 --> 05:09:46,400
okay so let's talk usb devices now i

5790
05:09:46,400 --> 05:09:47,840
don't have enough time to get into the

5791
05:09:47,840 --> 05:09:49,600
full details of this one but the most

5792
05:09:49,600 --> 05:09:51,120
important thing to understand is this

5793
05:09:51,120 --> 05:09:54,160
concept of vendor ids and product ids

5794
05:09:54,160 --> 05:09:55,760
now these are just two values that are

5795
05:09:55,760 --> 05:09:57,440
embedded onto the usb device during

5796
05:09:57,440 --> 05:09:59,600
creation that are used to identify that

5797
05:09:59,600 --> 05:10:01,920
device to windows

5798
05:10:01,920 --> 05:10:03,760
so when a device gets plugged in a

5799
05:10:03,760 --> 05:10:05,280
service called windows plug and play

5800
05:10:05,280 --> 05:10:07,120
actually reads those two values off and

5801
05:10:07,120 --> 05:10:08,638
then fetches the relevant setup

5802
05:10:08,638 --> 05:10:10,320
information file and that's the

5803
05:10:10,320 --> 05:10:12,240
information file is what specifies the

5804
05:10:12,240 --> 05:10:13,760
drivers or the applications that need to

5805
05:10:13,760 --> 05:10:15,520
be installed in order for that device to

5806
05:10:15,520 --> 05:10:16,558
work

5807
05:10:16,558 --> 05:10:18,558
so the vendor id this is actually static

5808
05:10:18,558 --> 05:10:20,320
and specific to a vendor that creates

5809
05:10:20,320 --> 05:10:22,558
usb devices now you can actually get one

5810
05:10:22,558 --> 05:10:24,320
of these for yourself it costs about six

5811
05:10:24,320 --> 05:10:25,920
thousand us dollars you make an

5812
05:10:25,920 --> 05:10:27,680
application to the usb implementers

5813
05:10:27,680 --> 05:10:29,680
forum and then they will assign you a

5814
05:10:29,680 --> 05:10:32,558
vendor id once you have that vendor id

5815
05:10:32,558 --> 05:10:34,080
the product id you just set that to be

5816
05:10:34,080 --> 05:10:35,680
whatever you want maybe increment that

5817
05:10:35,680 --> 05:10:37,200
up by one for each new device that you

5818
05:10:37,200 --> 05:10:38,878
make because it's the combination of

5819
05:10:38,878 --> 05:10:40,718
these two that would be used to identify

5820
05:10:40,718 --> 05:10:42,480
your unique devices

5821
05:10:42,480 --> 05:10:43,680
so just to really feel that illustrate

5822
05:10:43,680 --> 05:10:45,760
that here is the razer mouse that i had

5823
05:10:45,760 --> 05:10:48,080
lying around this is a razer naga hex

5824
05:10:48,080 --> 05:10:49,280
version 2.

5825
05:10:49,280 --> 05:10:50,400
i had this from when i thought i was

5826
05:10:50,400 --> 05:10:52,400
going to make it as a pro gamer

5827
05:10:52,400 --> 05:10:54,080
but it still worked and this has a

5828
05:10:54,080 --> 05:10:56,958
combination of 1532 for the vendor id so

5829
05:10:56,958 --> 05:10:59,360
that is the comment that v vendor id for

5830
05:10:59,360 --> 05:11:00,798
all razer products

5831
05:11:00,798 --> 05:11:02,080
and then the product id for this one

5832
05:11:02,080 --> 05:11:04,240
specifically is zero zero eight four and

5833
05:11:04,240 --> 05:11:05,840
the combination of these two values then

5834
05:11:05,840 --> 05:11:08,480
identifies this mouse specifically

5835
05:11:08,480 --> 05:11:10,080
okay so once i kind of understood that i

5836
05:11:10,080 --> 05:11:11,600
just started thinking well

5837
05:11:11,600 --> 05:11:13,200
is there some way that i can control

5838
05:11:13,200 --> 05:11:15,040
these two values for myself

5839
05:11:15,040 --> 05:11:16,718
so they maybe control the behavior or

5840
05:11:16,718 --> 05:11:18,160
the actions that windows takes as a

5841
05:11:18,160 --> 05:11:19,520
result of that

5842
05:11:19,520 --> 05:11:21,280
and the answer to that is yeah this is

5843
05:11:21,280 --> 05:11:23,120
actually pretty easy to do all you

5844
05:11:23,120 --> 05:11:25,520
really need is an android phone

5845
05:11:25,520 --> 05:11:27,680
specifically though you do need root

5846
05:11:27,680 --> 05:11:29,840
access to your android phone um android

5847
05:11:29,840 --> 05:11:31,120
phones are essentially just linux

5848
05:11:31,120 --> 05:11:33,120
machines so once you have root access to

5849
05:11:33,120 --> 05:11:34,480
that you're free to make whatever

5850
05:11:34,480 --> 05:11:36,480
changes to the settings that you'd like

5851
05:11:36,480 --> 05:11:37,360
right

5852
05:11:37,360 --> 05:11:39,120
um so i had an android phone obviously

5853
05:11:39,120 --> 05:11:40,878
and i got root access on that

5854
05:11:40,878 --> 05:11:42,480
and i went into a thing went into a

5855
05:11:42,480 --> 05:11:44,320
thing called the config fs and there

5856
05:11:44,320 --> 05:11:45,840
were two products like properties that

5857
05:11:45,840 --> 05:11:47,520
kind of caught my eye these are the id

5858
05:11:47,520 --> 05:11:49,920
product and id vendor properties now as

5859
05:11:49,920 --> 05:11:51,520
you might expect these properties just

5860
05:11:51,520 --> 05:11:53,920
hold the two values that are the vid and

5861
05:11:53,920 --> 05:11:55,760
the pid which get reflected back to

5862
05:11:55,760 --> 05:11:56,718
windows

5863
05:11:56,718 --> 05:11:58,240
so i've got these very very basic echo

5864
05:11:58,240 --> 05:11:59,280
commands you might be able to see these

5865
05:11:59,280 --> 05:12:01,120
on the screen they're essentially just

5866
05:12:01,120 --> 05:12:02,878
overwriting whatever value was already

5867
05:12:02,878 --> 05:12:05,120
there for the id vendor and id product

5868
05:12:05,120 --> 05:12:07,200
with the values one five three two and

5869
05:12:07,200 --> 05:12:08,798
zero zero eight four which you might

5870
05:12:08,798 --> 05:12:10,638
recall is the combination for my razer

5871
05:12:10,638 --> 05:12:11,760
mouse

5872
05:12:11,760 --> 05:12:13,360
once i'd done that i could plug my

5873
05:12:13,360 --> 05:12:15,360
android phone into my pc and that would

5874
05:12:15,360 --> 05:12:16,558
automatically start to install this

5875
05:12:16,558 --> 05:12:18,080
razer gaming software and i could

5876
05:12:18,080 --> 05:12:20,240
recreate that privilege escalation

5877
05:12:20,240 --> 05:12:22,798
without actually using a physical razer

5878
05:12:22,798 --> 05:12:24,480
mouse right just by using this android

5879
05:12:24,480 --> 05:12:25,520
phone

5880
05:12:25,520 --> 05:12:26,958
so that was pretty nifty like i had a

5881
05:12:26,958 --> 05:12:29,120
way that i could get my android phone to

5882
05:12:29,120 --> 05:12:30,878
act as a razer mouse in the eyes of

5883
05:12:30,878 --> 05:12:33,840
windows and get this privesque

5884
05:12:33,840 --> 05:12:35,760
and then i started thinking okay well

5885
05:12:35,760 --> 05:12:37,200
now that i do have control over these

5886
05:12:37,200 --> 05:12:38,160
values

5887
05:12:38,160 --> 05:12:39,840
what other combinations are out there

5888
05:12:39,840 --> 05:12:41,360
that might do you know similar sort of

5889
05:12:41,360 --> 05:12:43,120
things or maybe just other stuff

5890
05:12:43,120 --> 05:12:44,958
entirely so i've got a few examples for

5891
05:12:44,958 --> 05:12:46,400
you here

5892
05:12:46,400 --> 05:12:48,558
steel series now steel series is a

5893
05:12:48,558 --> 05:12:50,798
competitor to razer they also make pc

5894
05:12:50,798 --> 05:12:52,320
peripherals and they had a similar sort

5895
05:12:52,320 --> 05:12:54,240
of thing going on you could plug in a

5896
05:12:54,240 --> 05:12:56,000
steel series mouse or in my case an

5897
05:12:56,000 --> 05:12:57,360
android phone

5898
05:12:57,360 --> 05:12:59,040
and that would load the steel series

5899
05:12:59,040 --> 05:13:00,878
gaming software from there there was a

5900
05:13:00,878 --> 05:13:02,480
link to view their privacy policy and

5901
05:13:02,480 --> 05:13:04,558
that would actually load a web browser

5902
05:13:04,558 --> 05:13:06,000
because that web browser has system

5903
05:13:06,000 --> 05:13:07,840
privileges now you can save that web

5904
05:13:07,840 --> 05:13:10,000
page get the file explorer session and

5905
05:13:10,000 --> 05:13:13,200
convert that into a system shell

5906
05:13:13,200 --> 05:13:14,718
here's a slightly like more obscure

5907
05:13:14,718 --> 05:13:16,718
example this is like a third-party

5908
05:13:16,718 --> 05:13:18,320
external graphics driver that loaded

5909
05:13:18,320 --> 05:13:20,958
with that like install shield gui

5910
05:13:20,958 --> 05:13:22,320
if you get to the terms and licenses

5911
05:13:22,320 --> 05:13:23,760
section there's a there's an option to

5912
05:13:23,760 --> 05:13:25,840
print the terms and licenses and you

5913
05:13:25,840 --> 05:13:27,200
click on that that gets you the word

5914
05:13:27,200 --> 05:13:28,958
processor because the word process is

5915
05:13:28,958 --> 05:13:30,718
running a system now you save the word

5916
05:13:30,718 --> 05:13:32,878
document get your file explorer session

5917
05:13:32,878 --> 05:13:34,840
and you can have a system shell that way

5918
05:13:34,840 --> 05:13:37,280
too now of course this is not going to

5919
05:13:37,280 --> 05:13:39,280
be just limited to privilege escalations

5920
05:13:39,280 --> 05:13:40,958
although they are pretty cool to be fair

5921
05:13:40,958 --> 05:13:42,160
there's all sorts of weird and wacky

5922
05:13:42,160 --> 05:13:44,000
stuff going on in this area

5923
05:13:44,000 --> 05:13:46,000
here's an example of that this is like a

5924
05:13:46,000 --> 05:13:47,840
strange on-screen keyboard application

5925
05:13:47,840 --> 05:13:49,760
that was installed on my pc

5926
05:13:49,760 --> 05:13:51,280
it was really buggy it would crash out

5927
05:13:51,280 --> 05:13:52,878
all the time windows didn't seem to know

5928
05:13:52,878 --> 05:13:54,718
what was going on with it

5929
05:13:54,718 --> 05:13:56,480
and neither did i to be fair so i

5930
05:13:56,480 --> 05:13:59,360
uninstalled this one pretty quickly

5931
05:13:59,360 --> 05:14:00,718
and then as this is pretty obvious in

5932
05:14:00,718 --> 05:14:02,080
hindsight but you know do this enough

5933
05:14:02,080 --> 05:14:04,000
times install enough weird drivers weird

5934
05:14:04,000 --> 05:14:05,840
applications and you just give yourself

5935
05:14:05,840 --> 05:14:07,840
a blue screen of death

5936
05:14:07,840 --> 05:14:09,680
so again there's no real practical

5937
05:14:09,680 --> 05:14:11,200
application to this one maybe you can

5938
05:14:11,200 --> 05:14:12,958
prank your mates or something like that

5939
05:14:12,958 --> 05:14:14,798
but um it was a bit of a lesson learned

5940
05:14:14,798 --> 05:14:17,520
for me and a bit of a headache

5941
05:14:17,520 --> 05:14:19,120
okay so that kind of covers the section

5942
05:14:19,120 --> 05:14:21,520
in the red this is sort of how aspect i

5943
05:14:21,520 --> 05:14:22,958
want to talk a little bit more about

5944
05:14:22,958 --> 05:14:24,718
this section in the blue that could sort

5945
05:14:24,718 --> 05:14:26,480
of answer this question of well why does

5946
05:14:26,480 --> 05:14:28,000
all of this get to run with system

5947
05:14:28,000 --> 05:14:29,760
privileges

5948
05:14:29,760 --> 05:14:31,520
and the answer to that is actually

5949
05:14:31,520 --> 05:14:33,360
pretty straightforward it's just because

5950
05:14:33,360 --> 05:14:35,440
microsoft wants them to

5951
05:14:35,440 --> 05:14:37,760
like i talked previously about this

5952
05:14:37,760 --> 05:14:39,280
thing called windows plug and play very

5953
05:14:39,280 --> 05:14:40,718
briefly you may have heard of this

5954
05:14:40,718 --> 05:14:43,200
already like if not it's a very very

5955
05:14:43,200 --> 05:14:45,120
rare occasion of microsoft getting the

5956
05:14:45,120 --> 05:14:47,840
naming convention like 100 spot on

5957
05:14:47,840 --> 05:14:50,000
because this is what allows users to

5958
05:14:50,000 --> 05:14:52,400
purchase a usb device off the shelf plug

5959
05:14:52,400 --> 05:14:53,920
that into the machine and just start

5960
05:14:53,920 --> 05:14:55,600
playing around with it right

5961
05:14:55,600 --> 05:14:57,200
and that makes perfect sense because the

5962
05:14:57,200 --> 05:14:59,440
vast vast majority of users don't want

5963
05:14:59,440 --> 05:15:01,040
to have to be manually installing their

5964
05:15:01,040 --> 05:15:03,120
own drivers or applications in order to

5965
05:15:03,120 --> 05:15:04,878
get their device to work they just want

5966
05:15:04,878 --> 05:15:06,798
to be able to buy a keyboard a mouse or

5967
05:15:06,798 --> 05:15:09,040
a headset plug that in and start using

5968
05:15:09,040 --> 05:15:11,200
it the way they expect it to work

5969
05:15:11,200 --> 05:15:13,120
so in order for this like seamless user

5970
05:15:13,120 --> 05:15:15,280
experience this integration to happen

5971
05:15:15,280 --> 05:15:16,718
microsoft has a program called the

5972
05:15:16,718 --> 05:15:19,280
windows hardware compatibility program

5973
05:15:19,280 --> 05:15:20,798
now this is where vendors who make these

5974
05:15:20,798 --> 05:15:22,320
devices essentially present them to

5975
05:15:22,320 --> 05:15:24,160
microsoft and say hey i've got this

5976
05:15:24,160 --> 05:15:25,760
really awesome product customers are

5977
05:15:25,760 --> 05:15:27,520
going to love it we want this to work

5978
05:15:27,520 --> 05:15:29,120
with windows in order for it to work

5979
05:15:29,120 --> 05:15:30,638
though it needs you know these drivers

5980
05:15:30,638 --> 05:15:32,480
and these applications to be installed

5981
05:15:32,480 --> 05:15:33,680
and then microsoft has a look at that

5982
05:15:33,680 --> 05:15:35,840
and they go yeah this seems pretty legit

5983
05:15:35,840 --> 05:15:37,120
like we want this to work with windows

5984
05:15:37,120 --> 05:15:40,080
as well passes the vibe check so here is

5985
05:15:40,080 --> 05:15:41,840
a signed microsoft certificate for your

5986
05:15:41,840 --> 05:15:44,080
drivers and your applications

5987
05:15:44,080 --> 05:15:45,600
these can then go ahead and install a

5988
05:15:45,600 --> 05:15:47,040
system of course they don't run into any

5989
05:15:47,040 --> 05:15:49,600
permissions issues you're good to go

5990
05:15:49,600 --> 05:15:51,360
so it's really microsoft's way of

5991
05:15:51,360 --> 05:15:52,558
trusting these drivers in these

5992
05:15:52,558 --> 05:15:54,718
applications to install and perform

5993
05:15:54,718 --> 05:15:56,480
whatever setup actions are required on

5994
05:15:56,480 --> 05:15:58,320
behalf of the user

5995
05:15:58,320 --> 05:16:00,320
now if that sounds like a bit of a

5996
05:16:00,320 --> 05:16:02,480
recipe for disaster or at the very least

5997
05:16:02,480 --> 05:16:03,760
there's room for things to go a little

5998
05:16:03,760 --> 05:16:05,120
bit wrong here

5999
05:16:05,120 --> 05:16:07,440
it'd be totally correct right here are

6000
05:16:07,440 --> 05:16:09,600
two news articles from last year one in

6001
05:16:09,600 --> 05:16:11,520
june and one in october

6002
05:16:11,520 --> 05:16:12,798
where these drivers that had gone

6003
05:16:12,798 --> 05:16:14,000
through the hardware compatibility

6004
05:16:14,000 --> 05:16:15,920
program had signed microsoft

6005
05:16:15,920 --> 05:16:17,840
certificates were actually just

6006
05:16:17,840 --> 05:16:19,680
malicious rootkits

6007
05:16:19,680 --> 05:16:21,120
and because they had gone through this

6008
05:16:21,120 --> 05:16:22,558
and they'd been integrated so nicely

6009
05:16:22,558 --> 05:16:23,920
with windows they could install

6010
05:16:23,920 --> 05:16:25,760
themselves pretty easily on windows

6011
05:16:25,760 --> 05:16:28,240
machines bypass most defenses and then

6012
05:16:28,240 --> 05:16:29,760
just start performing all sorts of

6013
05:16:29,760 --> 05:16:32,080
malicious actions from there

6014
05:16:32,080 --> 05:16:33,840
now as a result of this microsoft gave a

6015
05:16:33,840 --> 05:16:35,600
pretty sort of generic statement oh hey

6016
05:16:35,600 --> 05:16:36,718
you know we're going to review our

6017
05:16:36,718 --> 05:16:38,480
process on this one make sure it doesn't

6018
05:16:38,480 --> 05:16:39,920
happen again

6019
05:16:39,920 --> 05:16:41,680
i have no real like insight into what

6020
05:16:41,680 --> 05:16:42,958
those changes might have looked like so

6021
05:16:42,958 --> 05:16:44,878
i can't really confirm but there were a

6022
05:16:44,878 --> 05:16:46,160
few other things that came out of this

6023
05:16:46,160 --> 05:16:48,320
as a result

6024
05:16:48,320 --> 05:16:49,920
in december of last year microsoft

6025
05:16:49,920 --> 05:16:51,920
actually opened up a specific driver

6026
05:16:51,920 --> 05:16:53,600
reporting center this is a place where

6027
05:16:53,600 --> 05:16:55,440
researchers can who find these sort of

6028
05:16:55,440 --> 05:16:56,558
drivers can actually submit them

6029
05:16:56,558 --> 05:16:58,480
directly to microsoft and a dedicated

6030
05:16:58,480 --> 05:17:00,160
team who's that's been spun up there

6031
05:17:00,160 --> 05:17:02,000
will take those down analyze them and

6032
05:17:02,000 --> 05:17:03,280
then make whatever changes need to be

6033
05:17:03,280 --> 05:17:04,558
made after that

6034
05:17:04,558 --> 05:17:06,160
now i can confirm this one does work

6035
05:17:06,160 --> 05:17:07,520
because i've been in contact with the

6036
05:17:07,520 --> 05:17:09,120
team at microsoft through this and

6037
05:17:09,120 --> 05:17:10,320
submitted some of the stuff we've looked

6038
05:17:10,320 --> 05:17:12,240
at previously uh the only thing i would

6039
05:17:12,240 --> 05:17:13,920
say though is it's taken a really long

6040
05:17:13,920 --> 05:17:15,840
turnaround time on the stuff but um hey

6041
05:17:15,840 --> 05:17:17,360
the team's there and you know we're back

6042
05:17:17,360 --> 05:17:18,638
and forth and they're doing their best

6043
05:17:18,638 --> 05:17:21,840
so that's pretty cool

6044
05:17:21,840 --> 05:17:23,120
and then finally a little bit more

6045
05:17:23,120 --> 05:17:26,000
recently in sort of march of this year

6046
05:17:26,000 --> 05:17:27,840
microsoft actually released a specific

6047
05:17:27,840 --> 05:17:29,920
function within windows 10 and windows

6048
05:17:29,920 --> 05:17:31,600
11 where you can actually go ahead and

6049
05:17:31,600 --> 05:17:33,680
block drivers from being installed

6050
05:17:33,680 --> 05:17:35,440
so this might be in response to some

6051
05:17:35,440 --> 05:17:37,360
threat intelligence or you know like

6052
05:17:37,360 --> 05:17:38,638
some of the news articles like we looked

6053
05:17:38,638 --> 05:17:40,080
at previously

6054
05:17:40,080 --> 05:17:41,760
you could actually say oh yeah you know

6055
05:17:41,760 --> 05:17:43,520
these these drivers actually yeah nah

6056
05:17:43,520 --> 05:17:44,638
not all good

6057
05:17:44,638 --> 05:17:45,920
they can't be installed under any

6058
05:17:45,920 --> 05:17:47,600
circumstance

6059
05:17:47,600 --> 05:17:49,440
i'm not really sure how practical this

6060
05:17:49,440 --> 05:17:51,840
would be in an enterprise setting but

6061
05:17:51,840 --> 05:17:53,040
the features there and it does actually

6062
05:17:53,040 --> 05:17:56,400
work really really well so that's cool

6063
05:17:56,480 --> 05:17:58,798
okay i just wanted to sort of summarize

6064
05:17:58,798 --> 05:17:59,920
what i've been talking about here by

6065
05:17:59,920 --> 05:18:02,878
reiterating a few key points

6066
05:18:02,878 --> 05:18:05,360
by allowing users to plug in usb devices

6067
05:18:05,360 --> 05:18:06,958
to their windows systems that is

6068
05:18:06,958 --> 05:18:09,200
allowing every single usb device to be

6069
05:18:09,200 --> 05:18:10,638
plugged in

6070
05:18:10,638 --> 05:18:12,718
now in terms of vendor ids alone there's

6071
05:18:12,718 --> 05:18:14,718
currently over 12 000 different unique

6072
05:18:14,718 --> 05:18:16,638
vendor ids that are valid that means

6073
05:18:16,638 --> 05:18:18,558
there's 12 000 different vendors that

6074
05:18:18,558 --> 05:18:20,000
could be making a huge huge range of

6075
05:18:20,000 --> 05:18:22,558
their own unique usb devices

6076
05:18:22,558 --> 05:18:24,320
so really there's you know tens of

6077
05:18:24,320 --> 05:18:25,920
thousands of different devices out there

6078
05:18:25,920 --> 05:18:27,680
but that means it's potentially tens of

6079
05:18:27,680 --> 05:18:29,280
thousands different drivers and

6080
05:18:29,280 --> 05:18:30,718
applications that could be installed on

6081
05:18:30,718 --> 05:18:32,718
machines as a result of a device being

6082
05:18:32,718 --> 05:18:33,840
plugged in

6083
05:18:33,840 --> 05:18:35,120
so when you take a step back and think

6084
05:18:35,120 --> 05:18:36,480
about the scope and the scale of this

6085
05:18:36,480 --> 05:18:38,160
problem you know really starts to become

6086
05:18:38,160 --> 05:18:39,840
quite massive

6087
05:18:39,840 --> 05:18:41,360
and microsoft trusts all of these

6088
05:18:41,360 --> 05:18:43,280
through their compatibility program but

6089
05:18:43,280 --> 05:18:44,798
that doesn't necessarily mean we should

6090
05:18:44,798 --> 05:18:46,718
be trusting them right

6091
05:18:46,718 --> 05:18:48,478
because in a sense i think this entire

6092
05:18:48,478 --> 05:18:51,280
ecosystem of usb devices and windows is

6093
05:18:51,280 --> 05:18:53,440
actually a huge contradiction because on

6094
05:18:53,440 --> 05:18:54,878
the one hand they are what you know

6095
05:18:54,878 --> 05:18:57,920
should be considered untrusted external

6096
05:18:57,920 --> 05:19:00,638
third-party usb devices that are

6097
05:19:00,638 --> 05:19:02,160
simultaneously being trusted by

6098
05:19:02,160 --> 05:19:03,920
microsoft and the internal windows

6099
05:19:03,920 --> 05:19:05,840
operating system so that's a bit of a

6100
05:19:05,840 --> 05:19:07,120
disconnect

6101
05:19:07,120 --> 05:19:08,878
and i think it's important to be sort of

6102
05:19:08,878 --> 05:19:10,718
aware of this reality and just to be

6103
05:19:10,718 --> 05:19:12,638
aware of how much room there really is

6104
05:19:12,638 --> 05:19:15,520
for things to go quite badly wrong here

6105
05:19:15,520 --> 05:19:16,878
and android phones in particular well

6106
05:19:16,878 --> 05:19:18,240
hey you know these don't necessarily

6107
05:19:18,240 --> 05:19:20,320
have to just be an android phone plugged

6108
05:19:20,320 --> 05:19:22,160
in for some extra battery charge

6109
05:19:22,160 --> 05:19:24,080
they themselves could be masquerading as

6110
05:19:24,080 --> 05:19:26,478
a huge range of devices themselves so

6111
05:19:26,478 --> 05:19:28,080
i mean all i can say on this one is well

6112
05:19:28,080 --> 05:19:29,760
depending on your role you know approach

6113
05:19:29,760 --> 05:19:31,440
with caution or use to your own

6114
05:19:31,440 --> 05:19:34,080
advantage i guess

6115
05:19:34,080 --> 05:19:35,120
cool that's everything i had to talk

6116
05:19:35,120 --> 05:19:37,040
about today here's my contact details

6117
05:19:37,040 --> 05:19:39,560
please get in touch thanks

6118
05:19:39,560 --> 05:19:43,939
[Applause]

6119
05:19:44,558 --> 05:19:45,840
thanks very much

6120
05:19:45,840 --> 05:19:47,200
i think we can all agree that usb was a

6121
05:19:47,200 --> 05:19:48,558
mistake we should have stuck with apple

6122
05:19:48,558 --> 05:19:50,320
desktop bus that would have been a fast

6123
05:19:50,320 --> 05:19:52,000
spirit choice all right we're going to

6124
05:19:52,000 --> 05:19:53,600
keep it on moving

6125
05:19:53,600 --> 05:19:55,440
it's my great pleasure to introduce our

6126
05:19:55,440 --> 05:19:57,440
next lightning speaker

6127
05:19:57,440 --> 05:19:59,090
denise

6128
05:19:59,090 --> 05:20:06,130
[Applause]

6129
05:20:07,200 --> 05:20:09,520
hopefully that doesn't spill

6130
05:20:09,520 --> 05:20:12,558
on kendo's computer

6131
05:20:20,000 --> 05:20:21,520
i'm not a cat

6132
05:20:21,520 --> 05:20:22,958
i swear

6133
05:20:22,958 --> 05:20:25,680
i'm not a cat

6134
05:20:25,760 --> 05:20:26,558
so

6135
05:20:26,558 --> 05:20:28,240
as the title of my talk is it's about

6136
05:20:28,240 --> 05:20:30,638
lockdowns writing and kid wrangling how

6137
05:20:30,638 --> 05:20:33,840
i got into security now if any of you

6138
05:20:33,840 --> 05:20:36,478
guys remember the first lockdown there

6139
05:20:36,478 --> 05:20:38,478
was that recording somebody was a court

6140
05:20:38,478 --> 05:20:41,280
session over zoom and the lawyer

6141
05:20:41,280 --> 05:20:42,718
couldn't take the cap filter off and he

6142
05:20:42,718 --> 05:20:44,160
kept on saying i'm not a cat i'm not a

6143
05:20:44,160 --> 05:20:46,400
kid

6144
05:20:46,798 --> 05:20:49,360
yeah so i'm going to talk about how

6145
05:20:49,360 --> 05:20:52,558
i got into security because mine is a

6146
05:20:52,558 --> 05:20:56,320
little bit of a unique story

6147
05:20:56,320 --> 05:20:59,120
i was going to do a heap of memes and i

6148
05:20:59,120 --> 05:21:01,760
tried practicing but it just didn't flow

6149
05:21:01,760 --> 05:21:03,760
very naturally i think the sort of story

6150
05:21:03,760 --> 05:21:04,798
that i have it's not something that you

6151
05:21:04,798 --> 05:21:05,920
can really

6152
05:21:05,920 --> 05:21:08,080
rehearse i kind of have to speak from

6153
05:21:08,080 --> 05:21:09,840
the heart

6154
05:21:09,840 --> 05:21:11,600
because i've been through

6155
05:21:11,600 --> 05:21:12,718
a lot

6156
05:21:12,718 --> 05:21:15,200
so cured everyone i'm denise i work as a

6157
05:21:15,200 --> 05:21:18,400
cybersecurity analyst for datacom

6158
05:21:18,400 --> 05:21:21,280
i'm a mum to a human child and a fair

6159
05:21:21,280 --> 05:21:22,718
child

6160
05:21:22,718 --> 05:21:25,040
i'm a proud jasper

6161
05:21:25,040 --> 05:21:26,478
i'm also very open about my

6162
05:21:26,478 --> 05:21:27,920
neurodivergence as well i'm both

6163
05:21:27,920 --> 05:21:30,400
autistic and adhd and i do a lot of

6164
05:21:30,400 --> 05:21:32,798
advocacy work around that so some of you

6165
05:21:32,798 --> 05:21:34,878
may know me on fate on facebook as

6166
05:21:34,878 --> 05:21:37,280
neurodiverse af because

6167
05:21:37,280 --> 05:21:38,400
every now and then i might post

6168
05:21:38,400 --> 05:21:39,200
something

6169
05:21:39,200 --> 05:21:41,520
about it but i'm too busy with work

6170
05:21:41,520 --> 05:21:42,400
um

6171
05:21:42,400 --> 05:21:45,440
and i'm also a massive nerd as well like

6172
05:21:45,440 --> 05:21:46,638
if you know me personally if you know me

6173
05:21:46,638 --> 05:21:48,160
really well you know that i can talk for

6174
05:21:48,160 --> 05:21:50,240
hours about anything to do with science

6175
05:21:50,240 --> 05:21:52,958
you know that sort of stuff

6176
05:21:52,958 --> 05:21:55,200
excites me

6177
05:21:55,200 --> 05:21:56,638
but

6178
05:21:56,638 --> 05:21:58,840
overall my journey into security has

6179
05:21:58,840 --> 05:22:01,680
been i think it actually started when i

6180
05:22:01,680 --> 05:22:05,040
was a child i taught myself um a couple

6181
05:22:05,040 --> 05:22:07,200
of programming languages actually

6182
05:22:07,200 --> 05:22:08,400
started off because the teacher could

6183
05:22:08,400 --> 05:22:10,718
see in class that i was really bored

6184
05:22:10,718 --> 05:22:13,040
and at the age of nine he challenged me

6185
05:22:13,040 --> 05:22:14,958
to to learn

6186
05:22:14,958 --> 05:22:17,680
basic and he gave me a book

6187
05:22:17,680 --> 05:22:19,600
and i took it away that was to be my

6188
05:22:19,600 --> 05:22:21,280
term project

6189
05:22:21,280 --> 05:22:23,440
and i taught myself

6190
05:22:23,440 --> 05:22:24,798
basic

6191
05:22:24,798 --> 05:22:27,040
and wrote my first programming language

6192
05:22:27,040 --> 05:22:28,958
at the age of nine

6193
05:22:28,958 --> 05:22:30,320
from that point onwards i kind of taught

6194
05:22:30,320 --> 05:22:32,160
myself other things this is like the

6195
05:22:32,160 --> 05:22:33,760
very early 90s so you know we didn't

6196
05:22:33,760 --> 05:22:34,558
have the

6197
05:22:34,558 --> 05:22:36,160
internet back then already had were

6198
05:22:36,160 --> 05:22:38,080
books in the library and i read a lot

6199
05:22:38,080 --> 05:22:40,478
and that's how i learned

6200
05:22:40,478 --> 05:22:41,680
obviously

6201
05:22:41,680 --> 05:22:42,878
growing up

6202
05:22:42,878 --> 05:22:45,440
during the 90s is that you know i saw

6203
05:22:45,440 --> 05:22:47,440
how much technology changed over the

6204
05:22:47,440 --> 05:22:48,878
years

6205
05:22:48,878 --> 05:22:50,400
i didn't really know security was a

6206
05:22:50,400 --> 05:22:52,080
thing back then

6207
05:22:52,080 --> 05:22:53,600
but the sort of person i am of a very

6208
05:22:53,600 --> 05:22:55,760
very curious mind i

6209
05:22:55,760 --> 05:22:58,320
you know decided to

6210
05:22:58,320 --> 05:23:00,400
look into things a bit more you know the

6211
05:23:00,400 --> 05:23:02,320
internet was booming pete more people

6212
05:23:02,320 --> 05:23:04,160
were having internet connections

6213
05:23:04,160 --> 05:23:06,160
and it was like a good way of trying to

6214
05:23:06,160 --> 05:23:08,320
meet other people who were like myself

6215
05:23:08,320 --> 05:23:12,320
as well but also at the same time

6216
05:23:12,320 --> 05:23:14,718
because of who i am as a person and

6217
05:23:14,718 --> 05:23:17,200
being autistic society at that time made

6218
05:23:17,200 --> 05:23:19,200
me feel like that i had to try and act

6219
05:23:19,200 --> 05:23:21,680
as normal as possible and i did i masked

6220
05:23:21,680 --> 05:23:24,000
extremely well most people didn't really

6221
05:23:24,000 --> 05:23:26,080
pack up that you know i am autistic i

6222
05:23:26,080 --> 05:23:27,040
thought maybe you know i'm a little bit

6223
05:23:27,040 --> 05:23:29,440
weird maybe a little bit quirky

6224
05:23:29,440 --> 05:23:30,798
but i tried really really hard to

6225
05:23:30,798 --> 05:23:35,280
present myself as like a normal person

6226
05:23:35,280 --> 05:23:37,760
going through that i went to university

6227
05:23:37,760 --> 05:23:42,160
at the time i didn't know i had adhd but

6228
05:23:42,160 --> 05:23:43,280
that

6229
05:23:43,280 --> 05:23:44,240
really

6230
05:23:44,240 --> 05:23:46,240
intense need

6231
05:23:46,240 --> 05:23:48,558
to kind of hyper focus on things if if

6232
05:23:48,558 --> 05:23:50,718
you are if anyone in here has adhd

6233
05:23:50,718 --> 05:23:52,878
you'll know what i'm talking about i

6234
05:23:52,878 --> 05:23:54,558
tend to get quite obsessive over things

6235
05:23:54,558 --> 05:23:55,920
that really pique my interest and i need

6236
05:23:55,920 --> 05:23:57,680
to know everything right there and then

6237
05:23:57,680 --> 05:24:00,400
at once about that particular topic

6238
05:24:00,400 --> 05:24:02,320
and so because of that

6239
05:24:02,320 --> 05:24:04,798
i learnt more and more

6240
05:24:04,798 --> 05:24:06,638
you know about how to do certain things

6241
05:24:06,638 --> 05:24:08,558
you know but it was kind of i think that

6242
05:24:08,558 --> 05:24:10,878
of the age of lan parties if anybody

6243
05:24:10,878 --> 05:24:12,478
remembers during the early 2000s at

6244
05:24:12,478 --> 05:24:13,920
universities it was quite a big thing

6245
05:24:13,920 --> 05:24:15,440
that you know lots of people would go to

6246
05:24:15,440 --> 05:24:17,280
land parties we would all take along our

6247
05:24:17,280 --> 05:24:19,280
laptops some people take the big huge

6248
05:24:19,280 --> 05:24:21,360
desktop towers and we would share files

6249
05:24:21,360 --> 05:24:23,040
between us and

6250
05:24:23,040 --> 05:24:24,958
kind of learn things as well

6251
05:24:24,958 --> 05:24:25,760
and

6252
05:24:25,760 --> 05:24:27,280
i really liked being in that space

6253
05:24:27,280 --> 05:24:28,958
because i could just be me i didn't have

6254
05:24:28,958 --> 05:24:31,200
to put on a mask i didn't have to act

6255
05:24:31,200 --> 05:24:33,840
what society deemed to be normal and i

6256
05:24:33,840 --> 05:24:36,478
had a lot of fun as well

6257
05:24:36,478 --> 05:24:38,798
along the way in my second year

6258
05:24:38,798 --> 05:24:39,680
at the end of my second year of

6259
05:24:39,680 --> 05:24:42,080
university i got my first full-time job

6260
05:24:42,080 --> 05:24:44,558
working as a public servant

6261
05:24:44,558 --> 05:24:46,718
and i got seconded into an

6262
05:24:46,718 --> 05:24:49,200
investigations role

6263
05:24:49,200 --> 05:24:50,320
now the things that i learned to that

6264
05:24:50,320 --> 05:24:53,440
role i now realize is what we call osint

6265
05:24:53,440 --> 05:24:56,240
and i learned a lot i learned how people

6266
05:24:56,240 --> 05:24:58,718
try to hide themselves people i know

6267
05:24:58,718 --> 05:25:00,558
every single trick in the book

6268
05:25:00,558 --> 05:25:02,240
but my job was to try and find people

6269
05:25:02,240 --> 05:25:04,000
that were trying to run away from their

6270
05:25:04,000 --> 05:25:07,280
legal responsibilities

6271
05:25:07,600 --> 05:25:10,878
from there i got married had a kid

6272
05:25:10,878 --> 05:25:12,080
kind of

6273
05:25:12,080 --> 05:25:14,718
didn't really do much more in that sort

6274
05:25:14,718 --> 05:25:17,040
of space

6275
05:25:17,040 --> 05:25:19,040
and you know things happen in my life

6276
05:25:19,040 --> 05:25:20,718
got divorced

6277
05:25:20,718 --> 05:25:23,040
went through a lot of my life and

6278
05:25:23,040 --> 05:25:24,400
during the time when i was a

6279
05:25:24,400 --> 05:25:26,638
stay-at-home mum

6280
05:25:26,638 --> 05:25:28,000
you know society

6281
05:25:28,000 --> 05:25:29,760
tries to make you feel like you're a

6282
05:25:29,760 --> 05:25:31,680
failure as a stay-at-home mom they don't

6283
05:25:31,680 --> 05:25:33,760
really see the value

6284
05:25:33,760 --> 05:25:34,718
that

6285
05:25:34,718 --> 05:25:36,798
you provide to society by trying to

6286
05:25:36,798 --> 05:25:38,240
raise your child you know i was going

6287
05:25:38,240 --> 05:25:39,840
through you know i've been through a lot

6288
05:25:39,840 --> 05:25:41,600
of traumatic experiences going through a

6289
05:25:41,600 --> 05:25:42,958
divorce is quite

6290
05:25:42,958 --> 05:25:45,200
quite taxing on me

6291
05:25:45,200 --> 05:25:48,400
and i had to quit the job that i had

6292
05:25:48,400 --> 05:25:50,878
been working at at that time

6293
05:25:50,878 --> 05:25:53,760
at the time i went from working

6294
05:25:53,760 --> 05:25:56,320
from one government organisation to

6295
05:25:56,320 --> 05:25:58,240
another worked as a research librarian

6296
05:25:58,240 --> 05:25:59,600
for a number of years so i was able to

6297
05:25:59,600 --> 05:26:01,040
use those

6298
05:26:01,040 --> 05:26:03,520
ocean skills that i picked up earlier in

6299
05:26:03,520 --> 05:26:04,958
that role as well and even learn even

6300
05:26:04,958 --> 05:26:08,320
more on how to find the most obscure

6301
05:26:08,320 --> 05:26:10,400
bits of information on the internet i

6302
05:26:10,400 --> 05:26:12,878
can find it

6303
05:26:12,878 --> 05:26:14,000
but

6304
05:26:14,000 --> 05:26:15,360
there was a period of time especially

6305
05:26:15,360 --> 05:26:17,200
during my son's formative years where i

6306
05:26:17,200 --> 05:26:18,798
just felt like a complete nut of failure

6307
05:26:18,798 --> 05:26:20,558
and i didn't know what i was going to do

6308
05:26:20,558 --> 05:26:23,040
career career-wise

6309
05:26:23,040 --> 05:26:24,558
and i went through a lot i went through

6310
05:26:24,558 --> 05:26:26,558
a really bad bout of depression

6311
05:26:26,558 --> 05:26:27,840
i went through two mental breakdowns

6312
05:26:27,840 --> 05:26:29,520
again i'm very open about mental health

6313
05:26:29,520 --> 05:26:30,638
i think it's really important that we

6314
05:26:30,638 --> 05:26:32,638
are open about it because it forms part

6315
05:26:32,638 --> 05:26:35,120
of my story and part of my journey into

6316
05:26:35,120 --> 05:26:36,958
security

6317
05:26:36,958 --> 05:26:38,558
uh during that lowest point of my life i

6318
05:26:38,558 --> 05:26:41,760
actually met someone who's probably

6319
05:26:41,760 --> 05:26:43,120
you know the bestest friend that i have

6320
05:26:43,120 --> 05:26:46,240
the person i probably trust the most

6321
05:26:46,240 --> 05:26:48,080
and

6322
05:26:48,080 --> 05:26:51,840
that person you know works in security

6323
05:26:51,840 --> 05:26:53,920
and just hearing them talk about what

6324
05:26:53,920 --> 05:26:55,680
they were doing

6325
05:26:55,680 --> 05:26:57,120
i was like oh

6326
05:26:57,120 --> 05:26:59,200
you can actually get a job doing this

6327
05:26:59,200 --> 05:27:00,878
professionally i didn't know that and

6328
05:27:00,878 --> 05:27:02,160
you know i was thinking about all the

6329
05:27:02,160 --> 05:27:03,520
things that i've learned over the years

6330
05:27:03,520 --> 05:27:05,760
but i never felt good enough

6331
05:27:05,760 --> 05:27:08,160
because i don't have a formal

6332
05:27:08,160 --> 05:27:10,558
qualification and i think well i do now

6333
05:27:10,558 --> 05:27:13,360
but back then i didn't

6334
05:27:13,360 --> 05:27:16,718
um you know i had a university degree in

6335
05:27:16,718 --> 05:27:19,040
science but it was nothing to do with it

6336
05:27:19,040 --> 05:27:20,400
unless you count like the two java

6337
05:27:20,400 --> 05:27:23,760
papers that i did many many years ago

6338
05:27:23,760 --> 05:27:25,600
but i just never felt like i was good

6339
05:27:25,600 --> 05:27:27,360
enough because i looked at all of these

6340
05:27:27,360 --> 05:27:28,958
people in the space and i looked at what

6341
05:27:28,958 --> 05:27:30,478
they were doing and i looked at myself

6342
05:27:30,478 --> 05:27:32,160
and i'm like i'm not good enough to do

6343
05:27:32,160 --> 05:27:35,600
this i'm not smart enough

6344
05:27:35,600 --> 05:27:37,120
during that time though

6345
05:27:37,120 --> 05:27:41,200
i'm also a very resilient person and

6346
05:27:41,200 --> 05:27:43,840
i had to learn to pick myself up i tried

6347
05:27:43,840 --> 05:27:45,680
so many different things and i failed so

6348
05:27:45,680 --> 05:27:47,120
many different

6349
05:27:47,120 --> 05:27:48,958
like so many times

6350
05:27:48,958 --> 05:27:50,718
and every time i failed i would even

6351
05:27:50,718 --> 05:27:52,320
feel worse about myself like i'm an

6352
05:27:52,320 --> 05:27:54,160
absolute failure what am i doing i'm

6353
05:27:54,160 --> 05:27:56,798
never going to succeed in life because

6354
05:27:56,798 --> 05:27:58,400
again people

6355
05:27:58,400 --> 05:27:59,840
you know at the time and even now still

6356
05:27:59,840 --> 05:28:01,280
don't really value

6357
05:28:01,280 --> 05:28:03,280
your role as a mother and kind of all

6358
05:28:03,280 --> 05:28:04,878
the hard work that goes into being a

6359
05:28:04,878 --> 05:28:06,400
parent especially as a single parent as

6360
05:28:06,400 --> 05:28:08,320
well

6361
05:28:08,320 --> 05:28:09,920
but i

6362
05:28:09,920 --> 05:28:12,798
pushed harder and harder and harder

6363
05:28:12,798 --> 05:28:16,240
during the first lockdown in march 2020

6364
05:28:16,240 --> 05:28:17,840
you know obviously the whole world came

6365
05:28:17,840 --> 05:28:20,080
to a standstill now up until that point

6366
05:28:20,080 --> 05:28:22,478
i have been doing bits of work um as a

6367
05:28:22,478 --> 05:28:24,400
writer and as an editor so again if you

6368
05:28:24,400 --> 05:28:25,520
google my name you'll see some of the

6369
05:28:25,520 --> 05:28:27,280
articles that i've written

6370
05:28:27,280 --> 05:28:28,878
um but you know did a lot of editing

6371
05:28:28,878 --> 05:28:29,920
work done a lot of social media

6372
05:28:29,920 --> 05:28:32,400
consulting work as well

6373
05:28:32,400 --> 05:28:35,520
when that first knock down happened that

6374
05:28:35,520 --> 05:28:37,840
pretty much cut off that work because a

6375
05:28:37,840 --> 05:28:39,840
lot of businesses were cutting back on

6376
05:28:39,840 --> 05:28:42,718
their budgets i

6377
05:28:43,280 --> 05:28:45,120
probably felt even worse

6378
05:28:45,120 --> 05:28:47,280
felt even more as a failure you know i

6379
05:28:47,280 --> 05:28:49,120
was spending a lot down trying to decide

6380
05:28:49,120 --> 05:28:51,600
what to do

6381
05:28:51,680 --> 05:28:53,600
and

6382
05:28:53,600 --> 05:28:55,920
i was thinking about it a bit more and i

6383
05:28:55,920 --> 05:28:57,520
was like but you know i'm i'm the sort

6384
05:28:57,520 --> 05:28:58,558
of person

6385
05:28:58,558 --> 05:28:59,840
my friends they come to me if i've got

6386
05:28:59,840 --> 05:29:01,840
any issues with with their computer they

6387
05:29:01,840 --> 05:29:03,200
bring it to me i'll fix it for them i

6388
05:29:03,200 --> 05:29:04,878
know i know how to do it i love

6389
05:29:04,878 --> 05:29:06,160
tinkering around with things i like to

6390
05:29:06,160 --> 05:29:09,200
know how things work

6391
05:29:09,200 --> 05:29:11,760
after that first lockdown

6392
05:29:11,760 --> 05:29:15,200
again my best friend they sent me a link

6393
05:29:15,200 --> 05:29:17,920
to the woman in tech talk in 2020. and

6394
05:29:17,920 --> 05:29:19,120
said oh you should submit a talk i

6395
05:29:19,120 --> 05:29:20,638
didn't think i was going to get anywhere

6396
05:29:20,638 --> 05:29:22,400
with it i thought okay i want to talk

6397
05:29:22,400 --> 05:29:23,600
about something that i know a lot about

6398
05:29:23,600 --> 05:29:24,958
and i do a lot of work around and that's

6399
05:29:24,958 --> 05:29:26,798
around neurodivision people i wanted to

6400
05:29:26,798 --> 05:29:28,320
talk about neurodiversity in the tech

6401
05:29:28,320 --> 05:29:31,920
industry and the appalling statistics

6402
05:29:31,920 --> 05:29:34,240
uh when it comes to neurodivergent

6403
05:29:34,240 --> 05:29:35,680
people

6404
05:29:35,680 --> 05:29:36,958
in tech

6405
05:29:36,958 --> 05:29:38,400
you know i think it's safe to say that a

6406
05:29:38,400 --> 05:29:40,400
majority of us who work in security are

6407
05:29:40,400 --> 05:29:41,760
neurodiversion you may not realize it

6408
05:29:41,760 --> 05:29:43,840
yourself but honestly i'll if i talk to

6409
05:29:43,840 --> 05:29:45,040
you i can probably tell within 10

6410
05:29:45,040 --> 05:29:46,638
seconds

6411
05:29:46,638 --> 05:29:49,200
if if you're like me or part of the

6412
05:29:49,200 --> 05:29:51,600
neurodiversion community

6413
05:29:51,600 --> 05:29:53,200
so i submitted my talk i didn't think

6414
05:29:53,200 --> 05:29:54,798
anything of it i don't even think they

6415
05:29:54,798 --> 05:29:56,798
want to get back to me but you know

6416
05:29:56,798 --> 05:29:59,040
there's no harm in trying

6417
05:29:59,040 --> 05:30:02,320
uh and then i got i got an email back

6418
05:30:02,320 --> 05:30:03,600
and

6419
05:30:03,600 --> 05:30:05,280
i was like oh congratulations you know

6420
05:30:05,280 --> 05:30:06,400
we want to offer you a space as well i

6421
05:30:06,400 --> 05:30:08,160
was like oh great and then i read

6422
05:30:08,160 --> 05:30:09,360
further down oh you're going to be our

6423
05:30:09,360 --> 05:30:11,600
keynote speaker and holy crap

6424
05:30:11,600 --> 05:30:13,040
i was like oh dear

6425
05:30:13,040 --> 05:30:14,320
this is

6426
05:30:14,320 --> 05:30:17,120
i was like oh no this is bad

6427
05:30:17,120 --> 05:30:18,958
like do people actually want to hear me

6428
05:30:18,958 --> 05:30:21,040
talk for about you know 45 minutes to an

6429
05:30:21,040 --> 05:30:22,160
hour about

6430
05:30:22,160 --> 05:30:26,160
neurodiversity within the tech industry

6431
05:30:27,040 --> 05:30:28,718
but i thought to myself this is going to

6432
05:30:28,718 --> 05:30:30,478
be an opportunity to try and meet other

6433
05:30:30,478 --> 05:30:31,920
women who

6434
05:30:31,920 --> 05:30:32,718
work

6435
05:30:32,718 --> 05:30:34,638
work within the tech industry but in

6436
05:30:34,638 --> 05:30:36,080
particular people who work in security

6437
05:30:36,080 --> 05:30:37,840
because i knew at the time zx were

6438
05:30:37,840 --> 05:30:40,798
sponsoring the event

6439
05:30:40,798 --> 05:30:42,000
and

6440
05:30:42,000 --> 05:30:45,600
i presented at women in tech and

6441
05:30:45,600 --> 05:30:46,878
during that

6442
05:30:46,878 --> 05:30:49,200
conference i got the amazing opportunity

6443
05:30:49,200 --> 05:30:51,200
to meet a wide variety of women who work

6444
05:30:51,200 --> 05:30:54,080
in security

6445
05:30:54,240 --> 05:30:56,558
and they may not realise it but erica

6446
05:30:56,558 --> 05:30:57,360
and

6447
05:30:57,360 --> 05:30:59,120
kate

6448
05:30:59,120 --> 05:31:01,440
they came and spoke to me quite a bit

6449
05:31:01,440 --> 05:31:04,240
after i went up to talk and i got to

6450
05:31:04,240 --> 05:31:05,760
connect with them

6451
05:31:05,760 --> 05:31:07,840
that was really cool and

6452
05:31:07,840 --> 05:31:10,160
believing like youtube really helped

6453
05:31:10,160 --> 05:31:11,840
push me

6454
05:31:11,840 --> 05:31:13,440
into security and to actually think of

6455
05:31:13,440 --> 05:31:16,000
it as a serious career choice

6456
05:31:16,000 --> 05:31:17,840
but again i didn't think i was good

6457
05:31:17,840 --> 05:31:19,040
enough

6458
05:31:19,040 --> 05:31:20,958
and i needed a way of like getting into

6459
05:31:20,958 --> 05:31:23,280
the industry and trying to show people

6460
05:31:23,280 --> 05:31:25,600
the technical skills that i do have

6461
05:31:25,600 --> 05:31:28,558
skills that i've learned over the years

6462
05:31:28,558 --> 05:31:30,478
towards the end of the year

6463
05:31:30,478 --> 05:31:31,920
someone told me

6464
05:31:31,920 --> 05:31:33,360
about a

6465
05:31:33,360 --> 05:31:34,878
funding scheme where the government were

6466
05:31:34,878 --> 05:31:38,000
going to fully fund a whole range of

6467
05:31:38,000 --> 05:31:39,920
diplomas and certificates

6468
05:31:39,920 --> 05:31:41,440
as part of

6469
05:31:41,440 --> 05:31:44,080
covert you know recovery trying to

6470
05:31:44,080 --> 05:31:45,760
improve a lot of industries where there

6471
05:31:45,760 --> 05:31:48,478
is a serious lack of skills

6472
05:31:48,478 --> 05:31:50,478
i had looked at doing uh this particular

6473
05:31:50,478 --> 05:31:52,878
diploma in cyber security but i was like

6474
05:31:52,878 --> 05:31:54,240
i'd have to get a student loan i

6475
05:31:54,240 --> 05:31:55,360
certainly aren't going to give me any

6476
05:31:55,360 --> 05:31:57,520
more money and this i saw this as an

6477
05:31:57,520 --> 05:31:59,120
opportunity to

6478
05:31:59,120 --> 05:32:01,120
get into the industry to try and get my

6479
05:32:01,120 --> 05:32:03,040
foot into the door

6480
05:32:03,040 --> 05:32:05,040
i sent off my application

6481
05:32:05,040 --> 05:32:07,600
and i really have to thank dealer for

6482
05:32:07,600 --> 05:32:09,520
taking a chance on me

6483
05:32:09,520 --> 05:32:11,440
she was such a lovely person and she

6484
05:32:11,440 --> 05:32:13,680
could see my potential as part of the

6485
05:32:13,680 --> 05:32:16,798
diploma i had to do a internship

6486
05:32:16,798 --> 05:32:18,878
as part of it and i think i was one of

6487
05:32:18,878 --> 05:32:20,080
the first people that they interviewed

6488
05:32:20,080 --> 05:32:21,360
that year

6489
05:32:21,360 --> 05:32:22,878
and i was offered an internship pretty

6490
05:32:22,878 --> 05:32:26,000
much same day after my interview

6491
05:32:26,000 --> 05:32:28,478
but tim who interviewed me who was

6492
05:32:28,478 --> 05:32:30,718
managing the sock team at datacom at the

6493
05:32:30,718 --> 05:32:33,680
time he saw my potential

6494
05:32:33,680 --> 05:32:35,200
i was really nervous i thought he was

6495
05:32:35,200 --> 05:32:36,240
going to look at me and think i wasn't

6496
05:32:36,240 --> 05:32:38,400
good enough but he saw my potential and

6497
05:32:38,400 --> 05:32:40,958
he gave me that opportunity

6498
05:32:40,958 --> 05:32:42,798
from that internship i

6499
05:32:42,798 --> 05:32:45,280
worked so incredibly hard people who are

6500
05:32:45,280 --> 05:32:47,600
close to me know how hard i worked

6501
05:32:47,600 --> 05:32:49,360
i'm a very resilient person i'm quite

6502
05:32:49,360 --> 05:32:51,040
stubborn as well and when i put my mind

6503
05:32:51,040 --> 05:32:53,120
to something i will do everything in my

6504
05:32:53,120 --> 05:32:55,280
power to be able to meet that particular

6505
05:32:55,280 --> 05:32:58,718
goal and that's what i did last year

6506
05:32:58,718 --> 05:33:00,558
i took the opportunity to apply for a

6507
05:33:00,558 --> 05:33:02,000
full-time position

6508
05:33:02,000 --> 05:33:04,878
within the sock team at datacom

6509
05:33:04,878 --> 05:33:06,718
again thinking i'm not good enough

6510
05:33:06,718 --> 05:33:09,760
they're not going to offer me a job

6511
05:33:09,760 --> 05:33:11,360
i was interviewed

6512
05:33:11,360 --> 05:33:12,638
and

6513
05:33:12,638 --> 05:33:14,798
uh i was really i don't i don't know if

6514
05:33:14,798 --> 05:33:15,920
my managers realized i was actually

6515
05:33:15,920 --> 05:33:17,520
really really nervous during that that

6516
05:33:17,520 --> 05:33:19,040
interview i thought i was going to stuff

6517
05:33:19,040 --> 05:33:21,440
up i thought i didn't know anything

6518
05:33:21,440 --> 05:33:23,280
but i can confidently say i did really

6519
05:33:23,280 --> 05:33:24,718
well in that interview i was able to

6520
05:33:24,718 --> 05:33:27,040
demonstrate my technical skills

6521
05:33:27,040 --> 05:33:28,240
uh one of the managers wanted to know

6522
05:33:28,240 --> 05:33:31,840
okay how would you hack into datacom

6523
05:33:31,840 --> 05:33:33,360
you know do you really want to know how

6524
05:33:33,360 --> 05:33:34,958
i would do it and i started talking

6525
05:33:34,958 --> 05:33:36,400
about it and he had to stop me halfway

6526
05:33:36,400 --> 05:33:38,638
through because he could tell i knew

6527
05:33:38,638 --> 05:33:41,360
what i was talking about

6528
05:33:41,360 --> 05:33:42,878
but because people were willing to give

6529
05:33:42,878 --> 05:33:45,200
me a chance

6530
05:33:45,200 --> 05:33:47,520
and i worked so incredibly hard i've

6531
05:33:47,520 --> 05:33:49,280
networked so incredibly hard as well

6532
05:33:49,280 --> 05:33:50,798
this is the reason why i managed to get

6533
05:33:50,798 --> 05:33:52,638
into the industry i got my first

6534
05:33:52,638 --> 05:33:54,320
professional job in security without a

6535
05:33:54,320 --> 05:33:56,400
formal iq qualification and without any

6536
05:33:56,400 --> 05:33:59,360
professional certifications as well

6537
05:33:59,360 --> 05:34:00,718
because there's a huge emphasis that

6538
05:34:00,718 --> 05:34:01,920
people think you need all the degrees

6539
05:34:01,920 --> 05:34:03,360
and all of the certifications to be able

6540
05:34:03,360 --> 05:34:04,878
to get a job but what you need is you

6541
05:34:04,878 --> 05:34:05,680
need

6542
05:34:05,680 --> 05:34:07,360
one or two people to actually believe in

6543
05:34:07,360 --> 05:34:08,478
you enough

6544
05:34:08,478 --> 05:34:10,638
to help and support you

6545
05:34:10,638 --> 05:34:12,958
and to give you the opportunities that

6546
05:34:12,958 --> 05:34:14,638
you need

6547
05:34:14,638 --> 05:34:18,080
but all of this is that i

6548
05:34:18,080 --> 05:34:20,798
want to use my experience to inspire

6549
05:34:20,798 --> 05:34:22,718
other women in color

6550
05:34:22,718 --> 05:34:24,400
with me being an indigenous person i am

6551
05:34:24,400 --> 05:34:25,600
maori

6552
05:34:25,600 --> 05:34:27,360
i am extremely passionate about trying

6553
05:34:27,360 --> 05:34:29,360
to get more women of color into this

6554
05:34:29,360 --> 05:34:31,840
industry because we have a serious issue

6555
05:34:31,840 --> 05:34:35,200
of a lack of diversity it is improving

6556
05:34:35,200 --> 05:34:37,200
but there is still this image out there

6557
05:34:37,200 --> 05:34:38,718
that it's a bro culture and that really

6558
05:34:38,718 --> 05:34:40,558
needs to change and i'm willing to put

6559
05:34:40,558 --> 05:34:42,080
in that hard work

6560
05:34:42,080 --> 05:34:44,400
to try it and get more people into this

6561
05:34:44,400 --> 05:34:45,840
industry people have got the skills that

6562
05:34:45,840 --> 05:34:47,680
we need it's not all about just

6563
05:34:47,680 --> 05:34:49,440
computers you know people who've got

6564
05:34:49,440 --> 05:34:52,000
fantastic communication skills it all

6565
05:34:52,000 --> 05:34:53,920
helps within this

6566
05:34:53,920 --> 05:34:55,040
within this industry in all the

6567
05:34:55,040 --> 05:34:56,478
different areas you know people just

6568
05:34:56,478 --> 05:34:58,958
don't come and be an analyst like me you

6569
05:34:58,958 --> 05:35:00,400
could go off and be a red team though

6570
05:35:00,400 --> 05:35:02,840
you could do grc stuff you could do

6571
05:35:02,840 --> 05:35:06,558
devops but i want my story to inspire

6572
05:35:06,558 --> 05:35:08,000
others

6573
05:35:08,000 --> 05:35:10,000
that yes i have put in a lot of hard

6574
05:35:10,000 --> 05:35:11,120
work but you know i also need to

6575
05:35:11,120 --> 05:35:13,520
acknowledge the help of others

6576
05:35:13,520 --> 05:35:15,040
and the fact that i feel like i'm

6577
05:35:15,040 --> 05:35:17,520
finally like at home i'm surrounded by

6578
05:35:17,520 --> 05:35:19,680
people that understand who i am

6579
05:35:19,680 --> 05:35:21,670
as a person thank you

6580
05:35:21,670 --> 05:35:24,720
[Applause]

6581
05:35:24,720 --> 05:35:27,270
[Music]

6582
05:35:27,270 --> 05:35:30,679
[Applause]

6583
05:35:33,840 --> 05:35:36,320
awesome thank you so much denise

6584
05:35:36,320 --> 05:35:38,320
um our next speaker we've had a few

6585
05:35:38,320 --> 05:35:40,000
talks recently around disclosing

6586
05:35:40,000 --> 05:35:41,760
vulnerabilities more from the researcher

6587
05:35:41,760 --> 05:35:43,520
side so our next speaker is going to be

6588
05:35:43,520 --> 05:35:44,638
sharing

6589
05:35:44,638 --> 05:35:46,000
points of view from the person who

6590
05:35:46,000 --> 05:35:47,760
actually looks after and manages an open

6591
05:35:47,760 --> 05:35:49,680
source project so introducing our next

6592
05:35:49,680 --> 05:35:53,160
speaker christina

6593
05:36:13,200 --> 05:36:16,160
oh since i

6594
05:36:26,878 --> 05:36:29,840
thanks

6595
05:37:04,000 --> 05:37:07,040
over the years of kiwicon and kawaiicon

6596
05:37:07,040 --> 05:37:09,760
we've heard lots of stories where

6597
05:37:09,760 --> 05:37:12,160
organizations did not respect

6598
05:37:12,160 --> 05:37:14,958
independent security researchers who

6599
05:37:14,958 --> 05:37:17,760
privately disclosed vulnerabilities

6600
05:37:17,760 --> 05:37:19,600
that often meant organizations didn't

6601
05:37:19,600 --> 05:37:20,878
respond

6602
05:37:20,878 --> 05:37:23,360
were dismissive when they did reply

6603
05:37:23,360 --> 05:37:24,478
or didn't

6604
05:37:24,478 --> 05:37:27,200
fix serious issues which then resulted

6605
05:37:27,200 --> 05:37:29,600
in the dreaded zero day of which one

6606
05:37:29,600 --> 05:37:31,840
almost was dropped yesterday by my

6607
05:37:31,840 --> 05:37:34,000
colleague andrew

6608
05:37:34,000 --> 05:37:35,520
on the flip side

6609
05:37:35,520 --> 05:37:37,440
there are many organizations that are

6610
05:37:37,440 --> 05:37:39,760
grateful to information security

6611
05:37:39,760 --> 05:37:41,840
researchers like you

6612
05:37:41,840 --> 05:37:44,320
who share their findings and contribute

6613
05:37:44,320 --> 05:37:46,638
to a more secure experience using

6614
05:37:46,638 --> 05:37:48,878
software applications

6615
05:37:48,878 --> 05:37:50,878
these organizations often follow good

6616
05:37:50,878 --> 05:37:53,760
practice for example they engage with

6617
05:37:53,760 --> 05:37:56,798
the researchers give them public credit

6618
05:37:56,798 --> 05:37:58,718
create cbe numbers

6619
05:37:58,718 --> 05:38:00,878
and also communicate about resolution

6620
05:38:00,878 --> 05:38:02,798
time frames

6621
05:38:02,798 --> 05:38:05,120
sometimes rookie mistakes are made

6622
05:38:05,120 --> 05:38:08,080
though that can lead to frustrations on

6623
05:38:08,080 --> 05:38:09,760
both sides

6624
05:38:09,760 --> 05:38:12,718
when expectations aren't met

6625
05:38:12,718 --> 05:38:14,558
the scenarios that you will see here

6626
05:38:14,558 --> 05:38:16,798
today are all that i've experienced over

6627
05:38:16,798 --> 05:38:18,958
the last 12 years

6628
05:38:18,958 --> 05:38:21,040
to preserve anonymity

6629
05:38:21,040 --> 05:38:24,080
all identifiable personal and also

6630
05:38:24,080 --> 05:38:25,920
organizational information has been

6631
05:38:25,920 --> 05:38:27,520
removed

6632
05:38:27,520 --> 05:38:30,718
and they may also have been shortened

6633
05:38:30,718 --> 05:38:34,240
slightly for privacy

6634
05:38:34,240 --> 05:38:36,080
so i recruited a good friend of all of

6635
05:38:36,080 --> 05:38:39,920
us here to help me out today

6636
05:38:40,400 --> 05:38:44,558
hey philly monster where are you

6637
05:38:45,520 --> 05:38:47,360
hi

6638
05:38:47,360 --> 05:38:49,680
do i hear my name

6639
05:38:49,680 --> 05:38:50,638
oh

6640
05:38:50,638 --> 05:38:52,718
hi philly how are you doing very well

6641
05:38:52,718 --> 05:38:55,840
thank you hello hackers

6642
05:38:55,920 --> 05:38:58,240
it's so good to see you again

6643
05:38:58,240 --> 05:39:01,798
it's great to be here

6644
05:39:02,000 --> 05:39:03,760
okay shall we get started

6645
05:39:03,760 --> 05:39:06,320
let's do it okay let's look at scenario

6646
05:39:06,320 --> 05:39:08,320
number one

6647
05:39:08,320 --> 05:39:11,320
dearfaily.monster.net

6648
05:39:12,958 --> 05:39:17,840
i found a vulnerability at wwe

6649
05:39:18,638 --> 05:39:20,718
here the steps to reproduce the problem

6650
05:39:20,718 --> 05:39:24,320
the references and mitigations

6651
05:39:24,320 --> 05:39:25,680
so

6652
05:39:25,680 --> 05:39:27,520
what's really good is there's a clear

6653
05:39:27,520 --> 05:39:29,120
description of the issue

6654
05:39:29,120 --> 05:39:31,520
details to replicate replicated and

6655
05:39:31,520 --> 05:39:33,520
proposed mitigations

6656
05:39:33,520 --> 05:39:35,440
what's not so good it's a mass scan of

6657
05:39:35,440 --> 05:39:38,000
websites sent with a mail merge

6658
05:39:38,000 --> 05:39:41,280
and it discloses to the wrong team

6659
05:39:41,280 --> 05:39:43,360
so our tip really is

6660
05:39:43,360 --> 05:39:45,760
please do not disclose other people's

6661
05:39:45,760 --> 05:39:48,760
vulnerabilities

6662
05:39:49,120 --> 05:39:51,680
number two

6663
05:39:53,360 --> 05:39:56,000
dear fairly monster all your open source

6664
05:39:56,000 --> 05:39:57,760
community town hall meeting minutes are

6665
05:39:57,760 --> 05:40:00,160
publicly visible these may contain

6666
05:40:00,160 --> 05:40:02,320
sensitive information

6667
05:40:02,320 --> 05:40:04,478
so in general of course that is really

6668
05:40:04,478 --> 05:40:06,798
pretty good advice because we do want to

6669
05:40:06,798 --> 05:40:08,798
keep information private

6670
05:40:08,798 --> 05:40:11,120
however unfortunately in this case the

6671
05:40:11,120 --> 05:40:13,840
researcher failed to see that these were

6672
05:40:13,840 --> 05:40:15,520
public meetings

6673
05:40:15,520 --> 05:40:17,280
and therefore minutes are publicly

6674
05:40:17,280 --> 05:40:18,878
available because that's part of the

6675
05:40:18,878 --> 05:40:20,400
community service

6676
05:40:20,400 --> 05:40:23,280
so our tip don't just rely on automated

6677
05:40:23,280 --> 05:40:24,240
tools

6678
05:40:24,240 --> 05:40:26,000
to find stuff but kind of check the

6679
05:40:26,000 --> 05:40:28,478
context there may be a very good

6680
05:40:28,478 --> 05:40:32,000
explanation why an organization makes

6681
05:40:32,000 --> 05:40:34,478
certain information public that is

6682
05:40:34,478 --> 05:40:37,600
otherwise privileged

6683
05:40:37,760 --> 05:40:41,360
dearly monster 2 30 a.m

6684
05:40:41,360 --> 05:40:43,600
hello i found a vulnerability

6685
05:40:43,600 --> 05:40:47,600
3 56 a.m hi can i please get a response

6686
05:40:47,600 --> 05:40:49,760
6 19 am

6687
05:40:49,760 --> 05:40:52,000
hi i haven't heard from you

6688
05:40:52,000 --> 05:40:54,000
8 27 a.m

6689
05:40:54,000 --> 05:40:56,558
can i please have a reply

6690
05:40:56,558 --> 05:40:58,080
so in this case the researcher really

6691
05:40:58,080 --> 05:41:00,478
did find a vulnerability which was good

6692
05:41:00,478 --> 05:41:02,638
and they did disclose it privately

6693
05:41:02,638 --> 05:41:05,440
but they were a bit too impatient

6694
05:41:05,440 --> 05:41:07,840
and sending numerous emails within a

6695
05:41:07,840 --> 05:41:11,680
short period of time on the same day

6696
05:41:11,680 --> 05:41:13,120
so our tip here

6697
05:41:13,120 --> 05:41:15,440
give the team some time to respond

6698
05:41:15,440 --> 05:41:17,680
because they might actually be asleep

6699
05:41:17,680 --> 05:41:20,000
while you're working

6700
05:41:20,000 --> 05:41:21,680
and they might also have some response

6701
05:41:21,680 --> 05:41:24,000
time frames published

6702
05:41:24,000 --> 05:41:25,200
they might also be at a hacker

6703
05:41:25,200 --> 05:41:26,240
conference

6704
05:41:26,240 --> 05:41:28,080
oh really yeah

6705
05:41:28,080 --> 05:41:30,160
or a hacker conference

6706
05:41:30,160 --> 05:41:32,718
all right dearly monster

6707
05:41:32,718 --> 05:41:35,520
i ran an automated penetration test

6708
05:41:35,520 --> 05:41:39,040
suite on demo dot philly dot monster and

6709
05:41:39,040 --> 05:41:41,920
found number one two three all the way

6710
05:41:41,920 --> 05:41:43,520
down to twenty

6711
05:41:43,520 --> 05:41:46,958
please fix and design cves

6712
05:41:46,958 --> 05:41:49,120
so the good bit about this

6713
05:41:49,120 --> 05:41:51,680
is they reported the problems

6714
05:41:51,680 --> 05:41:54,160
privately they're not so good is they

6715
05:41:54,160 --> 05:41:55,280
used infrastructure they weren't

6716
05:41:55,280 --> 05:41:57,920
supposed to test on and no proof of

6717
05:41:57,920 --> 05:42:00,080
concept 95 of the results are false

6718
05:42:00,080 --> 05:42:02,080
positives

6719
05:42:02,080 --> 05:42:02,878
so

6720
05:42:02,878 --> 05:42:05,200
kind of probably pretty obvious our tip

6721
05:42:05,200 --> 05:42:08,080
here review the security info and

6722
05:42:08,080 --> 05:42:10,558
responsible disclosure policy

6723
05:42:10,558 --> 05:42:13,840
and any associated information you might

6724
05:42:13,840 --> 05:42:16,798
also find a list of certain

6725
05:42:16,798 --> 05:42:19,120
previously reported issues that aren't

6726
05:42:19,120 --> 05:42:21,360
actually problems and therefore you can

6727
05:42:21,360 --> 05:42:23,360
kind of cut down on for those false

6728
05:42:23,360 --> 05:42:25,920
positives

6729
05:42:28,798 --> 05:42:31,360
dear feely monster this is an email not

6730
05:42:31,360 --> 05:42:34,320
sent by the security researcher

6731
05:42:34,320 --> 05:42:35,878
i stumbled upon

6732
05:42:35,878 --> 05:42:38,000
repository.git and was wondering if you

6733
05:42:38,000 --> 05:42:40,320
knew about the issue it has a cve number

6734
05:42:40,320 --> 05:42:41,680
assigned

6735
05:42:41,680 --> 05:42:44,000
so again in this case the researcher did

6736
05:42:44,000 --> 05:42:46,000
find a legitimate issue and again they

6737
05:42:46,000 --> 05:42:48,638
reported it privately

6738
05:42:48,638 --> 05:42:50,400
sorry the researcher found the

6739
05:42:50,400 --> 05:42:52,240
legitimate issue

6740
05:42:52,240 --> 05:42:54,240
but it was not

6741
05:42:54,240 --> 05:42:56,958
disclosed by them so they did not

6742
05:42:56,958 --> 05:42:59,120
communicate with the team and therefore

6743
05:42:59,120 --> 05:43:01,440
didn't do a responsible disclosure

6744
05:43:01,440 --> 05:43:04,320
instead they immediately published the

6745
05:43:04,320 --> 05:43:06,638
problem therefore putting a lot of

6746
05:43:06,638 --> 05:43:09,760
organizations around the world at risk

6747
05:43:09,760 --> 05:43:11,360
so our tip

6748
05:43:11,360 --> 05:43:13,440
get in touch with the team privately to

6749
05:43:13,440 --> 05:43:15,600
do a responsible disclosure

6750
05:43:15,600 --> 05:43:18,240
and also the issue that you

6751
05:43:18,240 --> 05:43:21,280
may have seen might actually have wider

6752
05:43:21,280 --> 05:43:23,840
implication than you can see at first

6753
05:43:23,840 --> 05:43:25,280
therefore kind of giving the team a

6754
05:43:25,280 --> 05:43:27,520
little bit of time to figure out what is

6755
05:43:27,520 --> 05:43:30,320
actually going on

6756
05:43:30,478 --> 05:43:32,558
so to summarize

6757
05:43:32,558 --> 05:43:34,240
we'd like to

6758
05:43:34,240 --> 05:43:38,000
offer those five tips for you as failies

6759
05:43:38,000 --> 05:43:39,280
tips for

6760
05:43:39,280 --> 05:43:42,840
security researchers

6761
05:43:43,600 --> 05:43:44,718
number one

6762
05:43:44,718 --> 05:43:46,878
don't rely solely on automated tools

6763
05:43:46,878 --> 05:43:49,840
check the context

6764
05:43:49,920 --> 05:43:51,120
number two

6765
05:43:51,120 --> 05:43:54,878
don't disclose others vulnerabilities

6766
05:43:54,878 --> 05:43:57,600
number three read published security

6767
05:43:57,600 --> 05:43:59,920
information

6768
05:43:59,920 --> 05:44:03,920
number four get in touch privately

6769
05:44:04,160 --> 05:44:05,600
i'm out of fingers

6770
05:44:05,600 --> 05:44:07,680
number five give the team time to

6771
05:44:07,680 --> 05:44:10,160
respond

6772
05:44:10,160 --> 05:44:12,080
but of course since information security

6773
05:44:12,080 --> 05:44:15,360
researchers are not the only party in a

6774
05:44:15,360 --> 05:44:18,080
vulnerability disclosure conversation

6775
05:44:18,080 --> 05:44:20,718
we'd also like to offer some advice to

6776
05:44:20,718 --> 05:44:25,280
organizations here are philly's steps

6777
05:44:25,440 --> 05:44:27,520
number one don't panic when you are

6778
05:44:27,520 --> 05:44:29,920
contacted

6779
05:44:29,920 --> 05:44:32,878
number two read resources and guidelines

6780
05:44:32,878 --> 05:44:34,638
yeah so here in our theater or for

6781
05:44:34,638 --> 05:44:37,680
example you can find information about

6782
05:44:37,680 --> 05:44:40,798
responsible disclosures and much more on

6783
05:44:40,798 --> 05:44:43,360
the websites from cert inset and the

6784
05:44:43,360 --> 05:44:46,320
privacy commission

6785
05:44:46,558 --> 05:44:47,840
number three

6786
05:44:47,840 --> 05:44:49,920
have a responsible disclosure policy and

6787
05:44:49,920 --> 05:44:50,840
a

6788
05:44:50,840 --> 05:44:52,478
contact

6789
05:44:52,478 --> 05:44:54,558
number four consider outsourcing the

6790
05:44:54,558 --> 05:44:56,320
handling of disclosures

6791
05:44:56,320 --> 05:44:58,478
and so for example you can use services

6792
05:44:58,478 --> 05:45:02,320
such as backroad and hacker one

6793
05:45:02,638 --> 05:45:04,000
number five

6794
05:45:04,000 --> 05:45:06,638
respond in a timely fashion and engage

6795
05:45:06,638 --> 05:45:09,280
with the researcher

6796
05:45:09,280 --> 05:45:12,000
so these are our five tips for

6797
05:45:12,000 --> 05:45:14,478
information security researchers and

6798
05:45:14,478 --> 05:45:17,040
organizations alike when communicating

6799
05:45:17,040 --> 05:45:19,520
about security vulnerabilities and how

6800
05:45:19,520 --> 05:45:21,680
to work together to fix them

6801
05:45:21,680 --> 05:45:24,000
we'd like to invite all of you now to

6802
05:45:24,000 --> 05:45:26,878
check your workflows and also policies

6803
05:45:26,878 --> 05:45:29,440
to help you being taken more seriously

6804
05:45:29,440 --> 05:45:31,200
by the other party

6805
05:45:31,200 --> 05:45:33,150
kiara

6806
05:45:33,150 --> 05:45:39,169
[Applause]

6807
05:45:48,160 --> 05:45:49,760
old mate failure monster back on the

6808
05:45:49,760 --> 05:45:52,160
stage number fourth appearance yeah adam

6809
05:45:52,160 --> 05:45:53,200
here we gone

6810
05:45:53,200 --> 05:45:57,120
now moving on quickly um

6811
05:45:57,120 --> 05:45:58,558
it's probably not the first time we've

6812
05:45:58,558 --> 05:46:01,440
had the bureau on stage at kawaiicon i

6813
05:46:01,440 --> 05:46:02,400
remember the first time was a little

6814
05:46:02,400 --> 05:46:03,680
more contentious it's become less

6815
05:46:03,680 --> 05:46:05,600
contentious over time and i always used

6816
05:46:05,600 --> 05:46:08,240
to think that the spooks had stolen my

6817
05:46:08,240 --> 05:46:10,638
hobby and used it for geopolitics but it

6818
05:46:10,638 --> 05:46:11,920
actually turns out the spooks were doing

6819
05:46:11,920 --> 05:46:14,478
this 25 years before i was born

6820
05:46:14,478 --> 05:46:17,040
and are actually pretty good at it um so

6821
05:46:17,040 --> 05:46:18,558
that's been rather a hard pill to

6822
05:46:18,558 --> 05:46:20,638
swallow to be honest uh they knew about

6823
05:46:20,638 --> 05:46:22,638
mem corruption like 20 years before we

6824
05:46:22,638 --> 05:46:25,120
did it's very rude anyway it's my great

6825
05:46:25,120 --> 05:46:27,120
pleasure to welcome the stage

6826
05:46:27,120 --> 05:46:29,280
from the government here to help as

6827
05:46:29,280 --> 05:46:32,878
always yogs

6828
05:46:37,580 --> 05:46:40,759
[Applause]

6829
05:46:41,840 --> 05:46:45,200
tina koto tina koto

6830
05:46:56,718 --> 05:46:59,920
tongawangoa or commonly known as yags

6831
05:46:59,920 --> 05:47:01,680
and i'm here representing the national

6832
05:47:01,680 --> 05:47:03,280
cyber security center

6833
05:47:03,280 --> 05:47:05,360
i started working for the ncsc in around

6834
05:47:05,360 --> 05:47:07,520
2016. i've been privileged to do a lot

6835
05:47:07,520 --> 05:47:09,520
of cool stuff but i never thought that

6836
05:47:09,520 --> 05:47:11,680
i'd be up on stage at quaicon after the

6837
05:47:11,680 --> 05:47:13,600
cookie monster so you never know what's

6838
05:47:13,600 --> 05:47:15,200
going to happen

6839
05:47:15,200 --> 05:47:17,200
so the kawaikon organizers pride

6840
05:47:17,200 --> 05:47:18,558
themselves on bringing together the

6841
05:47:18,558 --> 05:47:20,958
entire infosec community at this event

6842
05:47:20,958 --> 05:47:23,040
their website serves here you'll see

6843
05:47:23,040 --> 05:47:25,280
suits spooks hobbyists researchers

6844
05:47:25,280 --> 05:47:27,600
consultants engineers analysts testers

6845
05:47:27,600 --> 05:47:29,600
and management so i'm very proud to be

6846
05:47:29,600 --> 05:47:31,280
representing an entire part of that

6847
05:47:31,280 --> 05:47:34,080
demographic but i'm sure actually most

6848
05:47:34,080 --> 05:47:35,840
of you wouldn't be surprised to know i'm

6849
05:47:35,840 --> 05:47:38,160
not actually the only spook here

6850
05:47:38,160 --> 05:47:40,080
just this is a really important event on

6851
05:47:40,080 --> 05:47:42,080
the new zealand infosec calendar it's a

6852
05:47:42,080 --> 05:47:44,240
really important event for us too and

6853
05:47:44,240 --> 05:47:46,000
there are a lot of my colleagues from

6854
05:47:46,000 --> 05:47:48,080
the ncsc here scattered amongst you in

6855
05:47:48,080 --> 05:47:49,440
the audience

6856
05:47:49,440 --> 05:47:50,958
it is good to see though they have all

6857
05:47:50,958 --> 05:47:52,718
been diligently following security

6858
05:47:52,718 --> 05:47:54,878
advice and been ignoring me for two days

6859
05:47:54,878 --> 05:47:57,040
straight

6860
05:47:57,040 --> 05:47:58,718
this is a really important community for

6861
05:47:58,718 --> 05:48:00,638
us to be a part of not only to be here

6862
05:48:00,638 --> 05:48:02,320
to listen or learn or be lucky enough to

6863
05:48:02,320 --> 05:48:04,878
be here up on stage but actually for us

6864
05:48:04,878 --> 05:48:06,638
to find people that we need to work with

6865
05:48:06,638 --> 05:48:07,520
because

6866
05:48:07,520 --> 05:48:09,200
we've realized that collaboration is the

6867
05:48:09,200 --> 05:48:11,040
key to building a cyber resilient new

6868
05:48:11,040 --> 05:48:13,200
zealand and the development and delivery

6869
05:48:13,200 --> 05:48:15,120
of our malware free networks capability

6870
05:48:15,120 --> 05:48:16,878
is a key example of that so that's what

6871
05:48:16,878 --> 05:48:18,878
i'll focus on for my talk

6872
05:48:18,878 --> 05:48:20,320
i think one of the challenges for us

6873
05:48:20,320 --> 05:48:21,600
moving forward over the next couple

6874
05:48:21,600 --> 05:48:24,798
years is actually to be less spooky

6875
05:48:24,798 --> 05:48:26,160
so we're working on that and my

6876
05:48:26,160 --> 05:48:27,760
presentation here is part of that

6877
05:48:27,760 --> 05:48:28,718
approach

6878
05:48:28,718 --> 05:48:30,478
so before i start i do need to thank the

6879
05:48:30,478 --> 05:48:32,638
kuwaicon crew for having me here today

6880
05:48:32,638 --> 05:48:34,558
i'm actually moving health today and so

6881
05:48:34,558 --> 05:48:36,080
anyone who's moved house in wellington

6882
05:48:36,080 --> 05:48:37,920
knows that that means a lot of stairs

6883
05:48:37,920 --> 05:48:39,680
and a lot of work so there's quite a lot

6884
05:48:39,680 --> 05:48:42,400
of negotiation with my wife who is

6885
05:48:42,400 --> 05:48:44,558
thankfully at home looking after my baby

6886
05:48:44,558 --> 05:48:47,360
and i'm doing the rest of the packing so

6887
05:48:47,360 --> 05:48:49,760
that's one of the really good benefits

6888
05:48:49,760 --> 05:48:51,360
of working where i do whenever you want

6889
05:48:51,360 --> 05:48:53,360
to get out of some some chores you just

6890
05:48:53,360 --> 05:48:55,200
pull the i'm sorry love it's a matter of

6891
05:48:55,200 --> 05:48:57,520
national security card and then here i

6892
05:48:57,520 --> 05:48:59,680
am today

6893
05:48:59,680 --> 05:49:01,680
so the national cyber security center so

6894
05:49:01,680 --> 05:49:03,360
we focus on the cyber resilience of

6895
05:49:03,360 --> 05:49:05,600
nationally significant organizations

6896
05:49:05,600 --> 05:49:07,040
these are organizations across the

6897
05:49:07,040 --> 05:49:09,200
public and private sector of which new

6898
05:49:09,200 --> 05:49:11,520
zealand depends on for security or

6899
05:49:11,520 --> 05:49:13,760
well-being we're primarily focused on

6900
05:49:13,760 --> 05:49:16,000
what we call national level harms and

6901
05:49:16,000 --> 05:49:17,600
these are particularly state-sponsored

6902
05:49:17,600 --> 05:49:19,280
actors but really any threat or

6903
05:49:19,280 --> 05:49:22,000
vulnerability that has an impact to

6904
05:49:22,000 --> 05:49:23,920
impact the economic or social well-being

6905
05:49:23,920 --> 05:49:25,360
of new zealand

6906
05:49:25,360 --> 05:49:27,120
we fulfill our responsibilities for a

6907
05:49:27,120 --> 05:49:29,200
range of cyber security functions

6908
05:49:29,200 --> 05:49:30,878
ranging from protection of classified

6909
05:49:30,878 --> 05:49:33,440
information regulation over certain

6910
05:49:33,440 --> 05:49:35,600
sectors providing advice threat

6911
05:49:35,600 --> 05:49:37,760
detection disruption and when all else

6912
05:49:37,760 --> 05:49:40,160
fails instant response

6913
05:49:40,160 --> 05:49:41,920
and we do all of this by grouping all of

6914
05:49:41,920 --> 05:49:43,840
our services under four key headings

6915
05:49:43,840 --> 05:49:46,400
advise detect deter and disrupt

6916
05:49:46,400 --> 05:49:48,080
but these aren't mutually exclusive

6917
05:49:48,080 --> 05:49:49,760
areas and in fact i prefer to think of

6918
05:49:49,760 --> 05:49:51,680
them as a circle so we detect

6919
05:49:51,680 --> 05:49:53,680
indications of malicious activity

6920
05:49:53,680 --> 05:49:55,840
vulnerabilities or weaknesses throughout

6921
05:49:55,840 --> 05:49:57,600
new zealand we do that through both

6922
05:49:57,600 --> 05:49:59,520
technical capabilities but equally

6923
05:49:59,520 --> 05:50:01,920
through extensive customer relationships

6924
05:50:01,920 --> 05:50:03,440
we then disrupt these threats from

6925
05:50:03,440 --> 05:50:04,878
having a harm on our customer

6926
05:50:04,878 --> 05:50:06,798
environment this can range all the way

6927
05:50:06,798 --> 05:50:09,360
from incident response or releasing an

6928
05:50:09,360 --> 05:50:11,200
advisory on our website or through our

6929
05:50:11,200 --> 05:50:12,718
mailing list

6930
05:50:12,718 --> 05:50:14,400
we also have our active disruption

6931
05:50:14,400 --> 05:50:16,160
capabilities which i'll focus on more

6932
05:50:16,160 --> 05:50:18,080
towards the end of the talk

6933
05:50:18,080 --> 05:50:19,280
through all of this detection and

6934
05:50:19,280 --> 05:50:21,200
disruption activities we gain a really

6935
05:50:21,200 --> 05:50:22,718
good understanding of the new zealand

6936
05:50:22,718 --> 05:50:24,718
landscape and we use this to create

6937
05:50:24,718 --> 05:50:27,280
advice which helps our customers focus

6938
05:50:27,280 --> 05:50:29,520
in their security efforts what we learn

6939
05:50:29,520 --> 05:50:31,520
from an incident or threat in one place

6940
05:50:31,520 --> 05:50:33,680
we turn into advice to reduce the

6941
05:50:33,680 --> 05:50:35,360
likelihood of that having an impact

6942
05:50:35,360 --> 05:50:37,760
elsewhere and we also maintain the

6943
05:50:37,760 --> 05:50:39,360
friendly neighborhood new zealand

6944
05:50:39,360 --> 05:50:41,440
information security manual

6945
05:50:41,440 --> 05:50:43,200
as a result of all of our efforts we

6946
05:50:43,200 --> 05:50:45,360
uplift security throughout new zealand

6947
05:50:45,360 --> 05:50:47,520
which in turn deters our adversary

6948
05:50:47,520 --> 05:50:49,040
because we're raising the cost of

6949
05:50:49,040 --> 05:50:50,558
targeting new zealand

6950
05:50:50,558 --> 05:50:52,798
however the cycle continues because as

6951
05:50:52,798 --> 05:50:54,798
we raise security our adversaries

6952
05:50:54,798 --> 05:50:56,798
develop their own capabilities and use

6953
05:50:56,798 --> 05:50:59,040
new techniques which we must then detect

6954
05:50:59,040 --> 05:51:02,240
and disrupt and so the cycle continues

6955
05:51:02,240 --> 05:51:04,000
so our service offering represents a

6956
05:51:04,000 --> 05:51:06,160
multi-layered approach is required to

6957
05:51:06,160 --> 05:51:08,080
combat cyber security and we encourage

6958
05:51:08,080 --> 05:51:09,680
all of our customers to think of cyber

6959
05:51:09,680 --> 05:51:13,040
security in the same way

6960
05:51:13,200 --> 05:51:14,718
one of our roles is to provide

6961
05:51:14,718 --> 05:51:16,478
intelligence or assessments for new

6962
05:51:16,478 --> 05:51:17,920
zealand government on the cyber threat

6963
05:51:17,920 --> 05:51:19,360
so before i talk about our efforts to

6964
05:51:19,360 --> 05:51:21,680
stop threats i only need to talk about

6965
05:51:21,680 --> 05:51:23,840
some of the our view of the cyber threat

6966
05:51:23,840 --> 05:51:25,520
escape

6967
05:51:25,520 --> 05:51:28,320
so firstly we're seeing actors evolve

6968
05:51:28,320 --> 05:51:29,600
the way in which they conduct their

6969
05:51:29,600 --> 05:51:31,200
malicious activity some of the key

6970
05:51:31,200 --> 05:51:33,360
trends here are that we see an increase

6971
05:51:33,360 --> 05:51:35,680
in the speed and scale of scanning and

6972
05:51:35,680 --> 05:51:38,240
mass exploitation of recently disclosed

6973
05:51:38,240 --> 05:51:40,478
vulnerabilities malicious actors quickly

6974
05:51:40,478 --> 05:51:42,798
take advantage of this by targeting

6975
05:51:42,798 --> 05:51:44,798
every device and organization that could

6976
05:51:44,798 --> 05:51:46,798
be vulnerable they establish footholds

6977
05:51:46,798 --> 05:51:48,160
in these networks and then they

6978
05:51:48,160 --> 05:51:49,920
selectively return to targets for

6979
05:51:49,920 --> 05:51:51,680
further compromise

6980
05:51:51,680 --> 05:51:53,600
actors are also becoming more savvy with

6981
05:51:53,600 --> 05:51:55,760
their extortion techniques

6982
05:51:55,760 --> 05:51:57,600
and the way in which they exert pressure

6983
05:51:57,600 --> 05:51:59,840
on organizations techniques that make

6984
05:51:59,840 --> 05:52:01,760
money survive and are amplified or

6985
05:52:01,760 --> 05:52:03,600
copied by others

6986
05:52:03,600 --> 05:52:05,280
actors are using making more use of

6987
05:52:05,280 --> 05:52:07,200
disposable infrastructure and

6988
05:52:07,200 --> 05:52:09,280
sophisticated actors are

6989
05:52:09,280 --> 05:52:11,040
repeatedly compromising the same

6990
05:52:11,040 --> 05:52:13,920
organizations and ignoring containment

6991
05:52:13,920 --> 05:52:16,160
act efforts especially the sophisticated

6992
05:52:16,160 --> 05:52:17,680
state actors

6993
05:52:17,680 --> 05:52:19,440
to make all of this more complex we're

6994
05:52:19,440 --> 05:52:20,878
also seeing

6995
05:52:20,878 --> 05:52:22,638
the nature of the threat actor evolved

6996
05:52:22,638 --> 05:52:24,878
in particular the blurring of the lines

6997
05:52:24,878 --> 05:52:27,600
between state and non-state actors so

6998
05:52:27,600 --> 05:52:29,680
financially motivated groups now have

6999
05:52:29,680 --> 05:52:31,360
access to sophisticated tools and

7000
05:52:31,360 --> 05:52:33,360
techniques that will once exclusively

7001
05:52:33,360 --> 05:52:35,120
the control of the state

7002
05:52:35,120 --> 05:52:36,798
so the malwa free network's capability

7003
05:52:36,798 --> 05:52:39,040
is a key way for us to combat this

7004
05:52:39,040 --> 05:52:42,240
ever-changing threat scape

7005
05:52:46,320 --> 05:52:48,240
so before i talk more about malware free

7006
05:52:48,240 --> 05:52:49,680
networks i first have to talk a little

7007
05:52:49,680 --> 05:52:51,280
bit about the whakapapa of our cyber

7008
05:52:51,280 --> 05:52:53,840
defense capabilities so project cortex

7009
05:52:53,840 --> 05:52:55,200
delivered a suite of cyber defense

7010
05:52:55,200 --> 05:52:57,280
capabilities to private and public

7011
05:52:57,280 --> 05:52:59,680
sector organizations where ncsc can make

7012
05:52:59,680 --> 05:53:01,600
use of our unique insight and

7013
05:53:01,600 --> 05:53:03,920
intelligence to detect advanced threats

7014
05:53:03,920 --> 05:53:05,840
our goal here is to complement existing

7015
05:53:05,840 --> 05:53:07,600
security services

7016
05:53:07,600 --> 05:53:09,200
we provide these organizations to

7017
05:53:09,200 --> 05:53:11,280
consent in fact when i first joined the

7018
05:53:11,280 --> 05:53:14,400
gcsb my my role was part of the cortex

7019
05:53:14,400 --> 05:53:16,478
rollout team where me and my team we

7020
05:53:16,478 --> 05:53:18,080
went around the country talking to a lot

7021
05:53:18,080 --> 05:53:20,638
of people sort of along the lines of hey

7022
05:53:20,638 --> 05:53:22,798
we're from the gcsb you may have heard

7023
05:53:22,798 --> 05:53:25,040
of us from fun times such as kim.com or

7024
05:53:25,040 --> 05:53:27,040
the edward snowden links how do you feel

7025
05:53:27,040 --> 05:53:29,440
about giving us some of your data

7026
05:53:29,440 --> 05:53:32,400
very very fun times

7027
05:53:32,400 --> 05:53:34,320
so our cyber defense capabilities allow

7028
05:53:34,320 --> 05:53:36,000
the ncsc to find

7029
05:53:36,000 --> 05:53:37,760
evidence of known malicious activity and

7030
05:53:37,760 --> 05:53:39,600
we leverage our unique position as an

7031
05:53:39,600 --> 05:53:41,600
intelligence agency in our international

7032
05:53:41,600 --> 05:53:43,840
partnerships to understand the ttps of

7033
05:53:43,840 --> 05:53:46,080
malicious actors and use this to focus

7034
05:53:46,080 --> 05:53:48,320
our detection efforts in a typical month

7035
05:53:48,320 --> 05:53:51,360
we detect around 15 to 20 incidents

7036
05:53:51,360 --> 05:53:53,520
when malicious activity is identified we

7037
05:53:53,520 --> 05:53:55,040
produce an incident report for a

7038
05:53:55,040 --> 05:53:57,280
customer or deploy our responders

7039
05:53:57,280 --> 05:53:59,360
depending on the severity and where we

7040
05:53:59,360 --> 05:54:01,040
see threats impacting multiple

7041
05:54:01,040 --> 05:54:03,200
organizations will produce more general

7042
05:54:03,200 --> 05:54:05,120
advisories so that other organizations

7043
05:54:05,120 --> 05:54:07,120
can protect themselves too

7044
05:54:07,120 --> 05:54:08,400
crucially though through these

7045
05:54:08,400 --> 05:54:10,160
capabilities we've developed a really

7046
05:54:10,160 --> 05:54:11,920
good awareness of the types of threats

7047
05:54:11,920 --> 05:54:14,718
new zealand organizations are facing

7048
05:54:14,718 --> 05:54:16,558
our swedish cyber defence capabilities

7049
05:54:16,558 --> 05:54:17,840
though are quite technical

7050
05:54:17,840 --> 05:54:20,080
technologically complex and require a

7051
05:54:20,080 --> 05:54:22,478
lot of effort to maintain and even more

7052
05:54:22,478 --> 05:54:25,280
effort to keep pace with changes in our

7053
05:54:25,280 --> 05:54:27,920
customer i.t environment so from day one

7054
05:54:27,920 --> 05:54:30,160
we knew we needed to look at alternative

7055
05:54:30,160 --> 05:54:32,478
mechanisms for scaling beyond our kind

7056
05:54:32,478 --> 05:54:34,958
of one-to-one customer relationships

7057
05:54:34,958 --> 05:54:37,440
so in 2017 we worked with vodafone and

7058
05:54:37,440 --> 05:54:38,958
developed the initial malware free

7059
05:54:38,958 --> 05:54:41,120
networks pilot this produced some really

7060
05:54:41,120 --> 05:54:43,600
successful results in terms of us being

7061
05:54:43,600 --> 05:54:45,600
able to disrupt our high volumes of

7062
05:54:45,600 --> 05:54:47,520
activity but also getting some feedback

7063
05:54:47,520 --> 05:54:49,280
about the uniqueness of our indicators

7064
05:54:49,280 --> 05:54:50,958
that we were producing

7065
05:54:50,958 --> 05:54:52,320
it was really pleasing to make some of

7066
05:54:52,320 --> 05:54:54,160
these breakthroughs but it also helped

7067
05:54:54,160 --> 05:54:56,478
us identify two key flaws

7068
05:54:56,478 --> 05:54:57,920
first floor was that the original

7069
05:54:57,920 --> 05:55:00,240
solution was built and operated by us

7070
05:55:00,240 --> 05:55:02,878
which effectively led to us operating as

7071
05:55:02,878 --> 05:55:04,558
a managed service provider which isn't

7072
05:55:04,558 --> 05:55:07,040
necessarily our area of expertise and

7073
05:55:07,040 --> 05:55:08,798
secondly we didn't receive any feedback

7074
05:55:08,798 --> 05:55:10,798
on our service it essentially left us

7075
05:55:10,798 --> 05:55:12,718
blind we were pumping our intelligence

7076
05:55:12,718 --> 05:55:14,878
out into the world but were uncited as

7077
05:55:14,878 --> 05:55:17,200
to the utility or value it was providing

7078
05:55:17,200 --> 05:55:20,478
to our partners or customers

7079
05:55:20,478 --> 05:55:22,320
so all of that leads us to the malware

7080
05:55:22,320 --> 05:55:24,638
free networks of today we realized that

7081
05:55:24,638 --> 05:55:26,320
we needed to evolve beyond the

7082
05:55:26,320 --> 05:55:28,240
development of secret capabilities

7083
05:55:28,240 --> 05:55:30,320
within our secure facilities and work

7084
05:55:30,320 --> 05:55:32,558
more collaboratively with partners

7085
05:55:32,558 --> 05:55:35,440
luckily the gcsb pride ourselves on

7086
05:55:35,440 --> 05:55:37,760
pride ourselves on our ability to listen

7087
05:55:37,760 --> 05:55:39,120
so we went and talked to experts

7088
05:55:39,120 --> 05:55:40,958
throughout the country to identify the

7089
05:55:40,958 --> 05:55:43,120
most effective way of providing threat

7090
05:55:43,120 --> 05:55:44,958
protections at scale

7091
05:55:44,958 --> 05:55:46,478
and we recognized the key here was to

7092
05:55:46,478 --> 05:55:48,558
partner with private sector and to

7093
05:55:48,558 --> 05:55:50,320
develop a service that complemented what

7094
05:55:50,320 --> 05:55:52,240
they were already doing so instead of

7095
05:55:52,240 --> 05:55:54,400
developing and deploying our own tech we

7096
05:55:54,400 --> 05:55:56,478
found a way to add our unique value to

7097
05:55:56,478 --> 05:55:58,558
what was already out there

7098
05:55:58,558 --> 05:56:00,240
so malware free networks is a cyber

7099
05:56:00,240 --> 05:56:02,240
threat disruption service which we

7100
05:56:02,240 --> 05:56:04,240
deliver in partnership with the private

7101
05:56:04,240 --> 05:56:07,280
sector we generate iocs and disseminate

7102
05:56:07,280 --> 05:56:09,840
this to our partners our partners span

7103
05:56:09,840 --> 05:56:11,760
the new zealand telecommunications

7104
05:56:11,760 --> 05:56:13,520
managed service provider and cyber

7105
05:56:13,520 --> 05:56:15,040
security markets

7106
05:56:15,040 --> 05:56:16,558
our partners then use this threat

7107
05:56:16,558 --> 05:56:19,040
intelligence to detect and disrupt cyber

7108
05:56:19,040 --> 05:56:20,798
threats to their customers

7109
05:56:20,798 --> 05:56:23,200
information regarding disruptions of

7110
05:56:23,200 --> 05:56:25,440
this threat is sent back to ncsc as a

7111
05:56:25,440 --> 05:56:27,600
telemetry feed this enables us to

7112
05:56:27,600 --> 05:56:29,600
continuously improve our intelligence

7113
05:56:29,600 --> 05:56:31,440
but it equally gives us that situational

7114
05:56:31,440 --> 05:56:33,200
awareness about the threats facing

7115
05:56:33,200 --> 05:56:34,638
aotearoa

7116
05:56:34,638 --> 05:56:36,320
we provide us through intelligence via

7117
05:56:36,320 --> 05:56:38,240
industry standard protocols and our

7118
05:56:38,240 --> 05:56:40,320
partners make use of it to integrate it

7119
05:56:40,320 --> 05:56:42,400
within the existing security services

7120
05:56:42,400 --> 05:56:44,878
that they offer customers so malwa free

7121
05:56:44,878 --> 05:56:47,680
networks requires no ncsc owned or

7122
05:56:47,680 --> 05:56:49,920
operated technology to be deployed into

7123
05:56:49,920 --> 05:56:51,600
customer environments

7124
05:56:51,600 --> 05:56:53,280
pretty simple right

7125
05:56:53,280 --> 05:56:55,520
the key to our service is therefore our

7126
05:56:55,520 --> 05:56:57,440
threat intelligence which is made up of

7127
05:56:57,440 --> 05:56:59,200
iocs which we receive from our

7128
05:56:59,200 --> 05:57:01,520
international partnerships but also and

7129
05:57:01,520 --> 05:57:04,558
predominantly domestically sourced iocs

7130
05:57:04,558 --> 05:57:06,160
these may be indicators that we become

7131
05:57:06,160 --> 05:57:07,680
aware of through our incident response

7132
05:57:07,680 --> 05:57:10,160
engagement engagement or there might be

7133
05:57:10,160 --> 05:57:12,000
indicators generated through our other

7134
05:57:12,000 --> 05:57:14,558
cyber defense capabilities

7135
05:57:14,558 --> 05:57:17,440
importantly for every indicator we run a

7136
05:57:17,440 --> 05:57:19,920
robust validation process to make sure

7137
05:57:19,920 --> 05:57:21,760
that the indicators are of high quality

7138
05:57:21,760 --> 05:57:23,680
and are not going to disrupt legitimate

7139
05:57:23,680 --> 05:57:24,638
traffic

7140
05:57:24,638 --> 05:57:26,798
all iocs are run through a list of

7141
05:57:26,798 --> 05:57:28,638
safeguard checks and then through an

7142
05:57:28,638 --> 05:57:31,120
input impact assessment process where we

7143
05:57:31,120 --> 05:57:33,040
use the visibility gained for our other

7144
05:57:33,040 --> 05:57:34,878
capabilities to understand the

7145
05:57:34,878 --> 05:57:36,878
likelihood of an ioc being a false

7146
05:57:36,878 --> 05:57:38,080
positive

7147
05:57:38,080 --> 05:57:39,680
another key part of this validation

7148
05:57:39,680 --> 05:57:41,360
process is that telemetry that we

7149
05:57:41,360 --> 05:57:43,360
receive back from our partners for each

7150
05:57:43,360 --> 05:57:46,000
disruption event generated by mfn our

7151
05:57:46,000 --> 05:57:48,638
analysts receive a telem a telemetry

7152
05:57:48,638 --> 05:57:51,360
receipt containing uh which ioc caused

7153
05:57:51,360 --> 05:57:53,440
the disruption the time and date and the

7154
05:57:53,440 --> 05:57:55,440
five tuple and this means we get near

7155
05:57:55,440 --> 05:57:57,040
real-time visibility of our

7156
05:57:57,040 --> 05:57:59,360
effectiveness and can react quickly to

7157
05:57:59,360 --> 05:58:01,440
any issues

7158
05:58:01,440 --> 05:58:03,120
so a lot of this happens automatically

7159
05:58:03,120 --> 05:58:05,120
and 24 7.

7160
05:58:05,120 --> 05:58:07,120
in fact malwa free networks is doing the

7161
05:58:07,120 --> 05:58:09,120
mahi right now even though i could

7162
05:58:09,120 --> 05:58:11,360
neither confirm nor deny how many of my

7163
05:58:11,360 --> 05:58:14,160
colleagues happen to be in the audience

7164
05:58:14,160 --> 05:58:16,400
we are very aware that our iscs have a

7165
05:58:16,400 --> 05:58:18,080
limited shelf life and as such

7166
05:58:18,080 --> 05:58:19,840
throughout this project we've had a real

7167
05:58:19,840 --> 05:58:21,200
focus on the generation and

7168
05:58:21,200 --> 05:58:23,600
dissemination processes our classified

7169
05:58:23,600 --> 05:58:25,760
alerts and iocs can now be moved out of

7170
05:58:25,760 --> 05:58:27,840
our classified systems and shared to our

7171
05:58:27,840 --> 05:58:31,120
partners within minutes

7172
05:58:31,600 --> 05:58:33,120
when we launched malware free networks

7173
05:58:33,120 --> 05:58:35,120
in november last year we knew this would

7174
05:58:35,120 --> 05:58:37,520
be a real step change for how for new

7175
05:58:37,520 --> 05:58:39,200
zealand's cyber security posture and

7176
05:58:39,200 --> 05:58:41,360
particularly how we could have impact at

7177
05:58:41,360 --> 05:58:42,478
scale

7178
05:58:42,478 --> 05:58:44,240
the most common type of activity that we

7179
05:58:44,240 --> 05:58:46,000
are disrupting is remote scanning or

7180
05:58:46,000 --> 05:58:47,680
exploitation and this is really

7181
05:58:47,680 --> 05:58:49,280
important because we know even the most

7182
05:58:49,280 --> 05:58:51,520
sophisticated actors are looking to take

7183
05:58:51,520 --> 05:58:53,520
advantage of known vulnerabilities

7184
05:58:53,520 --> 05:58:55,520
through this work we're taking away any

7185
05:58:55,520 --> 05:58:57,920
easy wins from our adversaries

7186
05:58:57,920 --> 05:58:59,680
we monitor for threats and we keep our

7187
05:58:59,680 --> 05:59:01,280
service up to date with the latest

7188
05:59:01,280 --> 05:59:03,520
developments for example at work we have

7189
05:59:03,520 --> 05:59:05,200
a current heightened focus on the

7190
05:59:05,200 --> 05:59:08,000
russian invasion of ukraine and our mfn

7191
05:59:08,000 --> 05:59:10,478
iocs reflect that we quickly push

7192
05:59:10,478 --> 05:59:12,080
indicators to mfn when a major

7193
05:59:12,080 --> 05:59:14,400
vulnerability is released top of mind

7194
05:59:14,400 --> 05:59:18,558
are log4j bazaar iced id and flubot

7195
05:59:18,558 --> 05:59:20,478
so if you are seeing a threat in the

7196
05:59:20,478 --> 05:59:23,120
news or in the infosec community or

7197
05:59:23,120 --> 05:59:25,120
slack then you can expect that those

7198
05:59:25,120 --> 05:59:27,200
iocs are included within malware free

7199
05:59:27,200 --> 05:59:28,718
networks

7200
05:59:28,718 --> 05:59:30,558
one of our key findings so far is that

7201
05:59:30,558 --> 05:59:33,040
geographic relevance really matters the

7202
05:59:33,040 --> 05:59:36,000
mfn ioc iocs are highly unique and

7203
05:59:36,000 --> 05:59:38,080
relevant to the new zealand context in

7204
05:59:38,080 --> 05:59:40,080
contrast to a lot of other threat feeds

7205
05:59:40,080 --> 05:59:41,760
which often focused on the northern

7206
05:59:41,760 --> 05:59:43,280
hemisphere

7207
05:59:43,280 --> 05:59:44,958
we receive feedback from our partners

7208
05:59:44,958 --> 05:59:47,120
constantly who compare our intelligence

7209
05:59:47,120 --> 05:59:48,878
to feeds they receive from others and

7210
05:59:48,878 --> 05:59:51,760
find that our iocs are largely unique in

7211
05:59:51,760 --> 05:59:54,240
fact over 95 percent of the indic the

7212
05:59:54,240 --> 05:59:55,440
threats that are disrupted through

7213
05:59:55,440 --> 05:59:57,200
malware free networks come from an

7214
05:59:57,200 --> 05:59:59,280
indicator that we have generated at the

7215
05:59:59,280 --> 06:00:01,200
ncsc and this is because those

7216
06:00:01,200 --> 06:00:03,600
indicators are specifically generated

7217
06:00:03,600 --> 06:00:05,440
based on our visibility of threats in

7218
06:00:05,440 --> 06:00:07,120
new zealand

7219
06:00:07,120 --> 06:00:08,718
we have a huge amount of confidence in

7220
06:00:08,718 --> 06:00:10,798
the iocs we are producing

7221
06:00:10,798 --> 06:00:12,478
and we aren't always able to share the

7222
06:00:12,478 --> 06:00:14,320
context behind an indicator but you can

7223
06:00:14,320 --> 06:00:15,760
be assured that we're using the breadth

7224
06:00:15,760 --> 06:00:18,160
of the ncsc capabilities insights and

7225
06:00:18,160 --> 06:00:20,000
relationships to fuel this ioc

7226
06:00:20,000 --> 06:00:21,120
production

7227
06:00:21,120 --> 06:00:22,638
importantly that is why malwa free

7228
06:00:22,638 --> 06:00:24,718
networks is a disruption service and not

7229
06:00:24,718 --> 06:00:26,798
a hunting feed we are definitely most

7230
06:00:26,798 --> 06:00:28,478
effective when we can prevent harm

7231
06:00:28,478 --> 06:00:31,840
before it happens

7232
06:00:32,080 --> 06:00:33,760
so malware free networks hasn't happened

7233
06:00:33,760 --> 06:00:35,840
overnight and our partnerships are key

7234
06:00:35,840 --> 06:00:38,638
to getting us to where we are now

7235
06:00:38,638 --> 06:00:40,080
our teams have worked hard to get

7236
06:00:40,080 --> 06:00:42,160
systems integrated and now we're working

7237
06:00:42,160 --> 06:00:44,478
together to make sure that the insights

7238
06:00:44,478 --> 06:00:46,638
we gain through mfn are usable from our

7239
06:00:46,638 --> 06:00:48,638
partners and our customers to improve

7240
06:00:48,638 --> 06:00:51,280
cyber security throughout the country

7241
06:00:51,280 --> 06:00:53,520
we're really proud to be part of this

7242
06:00:53,520 --> 06:00:55,680
cyber security industry alongside our

7243
06:00:55,680 --> 06:00:58,680
partners

7244
06:00:59,520 --> 06:01:01,680
so where to from here so through malware

7245
06:01:01,680 --> 06:01:03,520
networks we've learnt a lot about how to

7246
06:01:03,520 --> 06:01:05,760
achieve major impact for new zealand to

7247
06:01:05,760 --> 06:01:07,680
build our cyber defense capabilities

7248
06:01:07,680 --> 06:01:08,958
we've established a good set of

7249
06:01:08,958 --> 06:01:10,718
relationships across the country and

7250
06:01:10,718 --> 06:01:12,080
proven that people are really keen to

7251
06:01:12,080 --> 06:01:14,320
work with us to help protect new zealand

7252
06:01:14,320 --> 06:01:16,320
we look forward to building off this

7253
06:01:16,320 --> 06:01:18,000
model and applying the lessons to other

7254
06:01:18,000 --> 06:01:19,440
parts of our work

7255
06:01:19,440 --> 06:01:21,360
as the heart of aotearoa's cyber defence

7256
06:01:21,360 --> 06:01:23,280
we're a group of passionate people and

7257
06:01:23,280 --> 06:01:25,040
we're at the center of a lot of work and

7258
06:01:25,040 --> 06:01:26,798
have a lot of experience and knowledge

7259
06:01:26,798 --> 06:01:28,718
but we can't do it all and we recognize

7260
06:01:28,718 --> 06:01:30,400
our work has the greatest impact when we

7261
06:01:30,400 --> 06:01:32,080
combine with others

7262
06:01:32,080 --> 06:01:33,440
it's all of our responsibility as

7263
06:01:33,440 --> 06:01:35,360
security professionals to be on the same

7264
06:01:35,360 --> 06:01:37,040
page when we talk about why cyber

7265
06:01:37,040 --> 06:01:38,958
security is important and what people

7266
06:01:38,958 --> 06:01:40,400
should be focusing on

7267
06:01:40,400 --> 06:01:42,320
it's been an honor to represent the ncsc

7268
06:01:42,320 --> 06:01:43,920
up here today as part of the kwaikon

7269
06:01:43,920 --> 06:01:45,760
whanau maybe next year you'll see

7270
06:01:45,760 --> 06:01:48,320
another spook up here too

7271
06:01:48,320 --> 06:01:52,680
equinoa we are all in this together

7272
06:02:04,000 --> 06:02:06,000
thanks very much one of the downsides of

7273
06:02:06,000 --> 06:02:07,520
lightning talk is it's not really long

7274
06:02:07,520 --> 06:02:09,840
enough to train like an audio deep fake

7275
06:02:09,840 --> 06:02:11,520
engine so that we could like over dub

7276
06:02:11,520 --> 06:02:13,120
him from offside of the stage so in his

7277
06:02:13,120 --> 06:02:14,080
mind they would have to run out and

7278
06:02:14,080 --> 06:02:16,320
spear tackle him but yeah downside

7279
06:02:16,320 --> 06:02:19,200
didn't manage to do that in time um

7280
06:02:19,200 --> 06:02:21,360
it is actually really great having the

7281
06:02:21,360 --> 06:02:24,080
spooks here and you know amongst us they

7282
06:02:24,080 --> 06:02:25,840
have been amongst us all along but you

7283
06:02:25,840 --> 06:02:27,120
you know at least now they're a little

7284
06:02:27,120 --> 06:02:29,200
more open about it but the importance of

7285
06:02:29,200 --> 06:02:31,360
involving you know the hacker community

7286
06:02:31,360 --> 06:02:32,638
the research community the the

7287
06:02:32,638 --> 06:02:34,878
commercial security academics and the

7288
06:02:34,878 --> 06:02:36,798
spooks yeah we are all in this uh

7289
06:02:36,798 --> 06:02:39,440
together as the man says so um i

7290
06:02:39,440 --> 06:02:40,958
remember when the first spook started

7291
06:02:40,958 --> 06:02:42,958
coming along to uh

7292
06:02:42,958 --> 06:02:45,920
2600 and isaac meetings um back in the

7293
06:02:45,920 --> 06:02:47,360
old days when paul mckittrick was really

7294
06:02:47,360 --> 06:02:50,000
influential in you know the outreach uh

7295
06:02:50,000 --> 06:02:52,638
from the spook world to us hackers um

7296
06:02:52,638 --> 06:02:54,080
and yeah we've built relationships over

7297
06:02:54,080 --> 06:02:55,360
the years and those relationships

7298
06:02:55,360 --> 06:02:58,080
especially in a country this size uh do

7299
06:02:58,080 --> 06:02:59,440
get things done

7300
06:02:59,440 --> 06:03:00,478
um

7301
06:03:00,478 --> 06:03:02,638
so moving on we're all you're good to go

7302
06:03:02,638 --> 06:03:04,638
excellent so my pleasure to introduce to

7303
06:03:04,638 --> 06:03:06,958
you our next speaker who once upon a

7304
06:03:06,958 --> 06:03:08,240
time

7305
06:03:08,240 --> 06:03:10,400
made like machine learned videos of the

7306
06:03:10,400 --> 06:03:12,878
day in the life of a bus

7307
06:03:12,878 --> 06:03:14,718
which is interesting interesting stuff

7308
06:03:14,718 --> 06:03:16,878
it was interesting bus rides anyway mr

7309
06:03:16,878 --> 06:03:19,840
douglas bagnall

7310
06:03:23,920 --> 06:03:26,080
carolla um

7311
06:03:26,080 --> 06:03:27,600
this talk is going to be a little bit

7312
06:03:27,600 --> 06:03:29,840
technical but it won't be too long so

7313
06:03:29,840 --> 06:03:32,160
don't worry

7314
06:03:32,160 --> 06:03:34,478
i'm talking about fuzzing

7315
06:03:34,478 --> 06:03:36,478
especially with regard to open source

7316
06:03:36,478 --> 06:03:39,440
software which has got

7317
06:03:39,440 --> 06:03:40,638
incredibly

7318
06:03:40,638 --> 06:03:43,840
better in the last

7319
06:03:44,400 --> 06:03:47,200
decade or so or two decades maybe now

7320
06:03:47,200 --> 06:03:49,520
um so fuzzing is testing software with

7321
06:03:49,520 --> 06:03:52,320
random input

7322
06:03:52,878 --> 06:03:55,440
um it's immensely more effective as i

7323
06:03:55,440 --> 06:03:56,400
just said

7324
06:03:56,400 --> 06:03:58,478
if you have the source code

7325
06:03:58,478 --> 06:04:00,080
because

7326
06:04:00,080 --> 06:04:01,200
well you'll see

7327
06:04:01,200 --> 06:04:03,200
and it's supported by the industry for

7328
06:04:03,200 --> 06:04:05,360
open source code and when i say industry

7329
06:04:05,360 --> 06:04:07,200
i'm really in google but i don't really

7330
06:04:07,200 --> 06:04:09,840
want to say google in case that offends

7331
06:04:09,840 --> 06:04:11,440
red hat or somebody who else who does a

7332
06:04:11,440 --> 06:04:12,840
little bit

7333
06:04:12,840 --> 06:04:15,040
um so

7334
06:04:15,040 --> 06:04:18,080
the the term and the concept

7335
06:04:18,080 --> 06:04:20,718
comes from the late 80s

7336
06:04:20,718 --> 06:04:22,080
when

7337
06:04:22,080 --> 06:04:23,360
in those days

7338
06:04:23,360 --> 06:04:26,478
to work remotely you'd

7339
06:04:26,558 --> 06:04:29,760
log into your vax machine or something

7340
06:04:29,760 --> 06:04:32,558
through a phone modem and

7341
06:04:32,558 --> 06:04:34,798
then the weather would put extra

7342
06:04:34,798 --> 06:04:37,120
characters in the stream and that would

7343
06:04:37,120 --> 06:04:38,878
sometimes make things crash on the other

7344
06:04:38,878 --> 06:04:40,000
end

7345
06:04:40,000 --> 06:04:40,840
and

7346
06:04:40,840 --> 06:04:44,400
um some people in texas

7347
06:04:44,400 --> 06:04:46,160
they suddenly thought

7348
06:04:46,160 --> 06:04:48,718
maybe that shouldn't happen maybe

7349
06:04:48,718 --> 06:04:49,520
um

7350
06:04:49,520 --> 06:04:51,280
unexpected input shouldn't make things

7351
06:04:51,280 --> 06:04:53,360
crash it could make them fail but not

7352
06:04:53,360 --> 06:04:54,320
crash

7353
06:04:54,320 --> 06:04:56,878
and then they started testing

7354
06:04:56,878 --> 06:04:59,120
uh software with random input to see

7355
06:04:59,120 --> 06:05:01,520
what crashed and like about a third of

7356
06:05:01,520 --> 06:05:03,680
the unix utilities that they

7357
06:05:03,680 --> 06:05:05,760
tried did in their own papers over the

7358
06:05:05,760 --> 06:05:08,000
years they read a whole lot more

7359
06:05:08,000 --> 06:05:10,080
so the kind of

7360
06:05:10,080 --> 06:05:11,840
the ways you can do it

7361
06:05:11,840 --> 06:05:13,280
with

7362
06:05:13,280 --> 06:05:15,280
the old ways of doing it is you can just

7363
06:05:15,280 --> 06:05:18,478
pipe random noise into a program like

7364
06:05:18,478 --> 06:05:22,958
with ls in this example it won't um

7365
06:05:22,958 --> 06:05:24,478
actually do anything because ls doesn't

7366
06:05:24,478 --> 06:05:26,638
listen on standard input as far as i

7367
06:05:26,638 --> 06:05:27,600
know

7368
06:05:27,600 --> 06:05:30,080
and um you can

7369
06:05:30,080 --> 06:05:33,520
pass the random noise as a as

7370
06:05:33,520 --> 06:05:34,798
the main argument

7371
06:05:34,798 --> 06:05:36,558
um except that will actually be fixing

7372
06:05:36,558 --> 06:05:39,040
the kernel not the ls program because

7373
06:05:39,040 --> 06:05:41,840
that path name is passed by

7374
06:05:41,840 --> 06:05:44,400
the kernel i think um

7375
06:05:44,400 --> 06:05:46,718
you can make a whole lot of random

7376
06:05:46,718 --> 06:05:48,798
options in the gonna

7377
06:05:48,798 --> 06:05:50,400
ls there's

7378
06:05:50,400 --> 06:05:52,558
about 40 options and

7379
06:05:52,558 --> 06:05:55,200
some of them take arguments so that is

7380
06:05:55,200 --> 06:05:57,360
a huge space to search

7381
06:05:57,360 --> 06:05:59,600
or you can so do things like

7382
06:05:59,600 --> 06:06:02,079
set the

7383
06:06:02,160 --> 06:06:04,400
environment variables that alice will

7384
06:06:04,400 --> 06:06:06,478
then pass and this is for ls that's

7385
06:06:06,478 --> 06:06:08,400
probably the the

7386
06:06:08,400 --> 06:06:11,360
richest way to find bugs

7387
06:06:11,360 --> 06:06:12,558
that i can

7388
06:06:12,558 --> 06:06:14,558
i can imagine but um

7389
06:06:14,558 --> 06:06:17,040
it's also not probably a good attack

7390
06:06:17,040 --> 06:06:18,718
vector setting environment variables if

7391
06:06:18,718 --> 06:06:20,320
you can do that you can already do other

7392
06:06:20,320 --> 06:06:21,280
things

7393
06:06:21,280 --> 06:06:22,558
i imagine

7394
06:06:22,558 --> 06:06:23,840
um

7395
06:06:23,840 --> 06:06:25,760
so the the main thing that's made it

7396
06:06:25,760 --> 06:06:26,798
better

7397
06:06:26,798 --> 06:06:28,798
apart from computers being a hundred

7398
06:06:28,798 --> 06:06:30,558
thousand times faster

7399
06:06:30,558 --> 06:06:32,160
um

7400
06:06:32,160 --> 06:06:34,558
which does help um

7401
06:06:34,558 --> 06:06:36,400
the main thing that's made it better is

7402
06:06:36,400 --> 06:06:39,280
coverage based fuzzing

7403
06:06:39,280 --> 06:06:40,160
and

7404
06:06:40,160 --> 06:06:42,958
that is using an instrumented compiler a

7405
06:06:42,958 --> 06:06:45,040
special compiler that kind of

7406
06:06:45,040 --> 06:06:46,160
um

7407
06:06:46,160 --> 06:06:47,680
when it compiles it doesn't just make it

7408
06:06:47,680 --> 06:06:50,958
the fastest machine code it can it it

7409
06:06:50,958 --> 06:06:55,440
keeps track of what it's doing and um

7410
06:06:55,440 --> 06:06:56,878
and notices

7411
06:06:56,878 --> 06:06:59,120
where you're going through the code

7412
06:06:59,120 --> 06:07:00,400
and then

7413
06:07:00,400 --> 06:07:01,440
when

7414
06:07:01,440 --> 06:07:02,478
when the

7415
06:07:02,478 --> 06:07:04,958
fuzz whenever the random string

7416
06:07:04,958 --> 06:07:06,558
finds a new

7417
06:07:06,558 --> 06:07:09,040
edge or new pathway through the code

7418
06:07:09,040 --> 06:07:10,878
just like takes a different branch and

7419
06:07:10,878 --> 06:07:12,878
one of the ifs or something

7420
06:07:12,878 --> 06:07:17,040
then it um

7421
06:07:17,040 --> 06:07:19,520
makes new inputs it uses that as a

7422
06:07:19,520 --> 06:07:22,240
parent to mutate to make new inputs so

7423
06:07:22,240 --> 06:07:25,600
it has the generations has evolution so

7424
06:07:25,600 --> 06:07:27,520
it's still a random process but it's an

7425
06:07:27,520 --> 06:07:31,040
evolutionary random process rather than

7426
06:07:31,040 --> 06:07:34,958
just making up noise now

7427
06:07:34,958 --> 06:07:36,478
i'm going to explain

7428
06:07:36,478 --> 06:07:38,320
why this

7429
06:07:38,320 --> 06:07:40,798
speeds things up like

7430
06:07:40,798 --> 06:07:41,600
by

7431
06:07:41,600 --> 06:07:43,280
a number that you can't even give a name

7432
06:07:43,280 --> 06:07:47,200
to so here's a function that might crash

7433
06:07:47,200 --> 06:07:49,280
now it takes a

7434
06:07:49,280 --> 06:07:51,760
a string and a length

7435
06:07:51,760 --> 06:07:53,840
and it returns nothing

7436
06:07:53,840 --> 06:07:56,160
now if the length is not five

7437
06:07:56,160 --> 06:07:59,520
it returns nothing it just that's it

7438
06:07:59,520 --> 06:08:00,478
the

7439
06:08:00,478 --> 06:08:03,360
function's over then it says

7440
06:08:03,360 --> 06:08:06,000
if those five bytes that you do have if

7441
06:08:06,000 --> 06:08:08,638
they're not these it is samba

7442
06:08:08,638 --> 06:08:10,958
um there's a project to work on the old

7443
06:08:10,958 --> 06:08:12,958
slides um

7444
06:08:12,958 --> 06:08:16,080
if it's not that it'll crash

7445
06:08:16,080 --> 06:08:18,160
abort means crash it's the way you can

7446
06:08:18,160 --> 06:08:20,080
make yourself crash

7447
06:08:20,080 --> 06:08:22,400
so this function will crash if it gets

7448
06:08:22,400 --> 06:08:25,200
to there so if you hadn't given it um

7449
06:08:25,200 --> 06:08:27,200
random input

7450
06:08:27,200 --> 06:08:29,040
you've got

7451
06:08:29,040 --> 06:08:31,200
you've got if you five bytes is 40 bits

7452
06:08:31,200 --> 06:08:33,120
so that means you got one chance and a

7453
06:08:33,120 --> 06:08:35,680
trillion of picking the right numbers

7454
06:08:35,680 --> 06:08:38,080
but only if you pick a thing of means

7455
06:08:38,080 --> 06:08:39,440
five and we don't know what the chance

7456
06:08:39,440 --> 06:08:41,600
of picking the length of five is just by

7457
06:08:41,600 --> 06:08:44,320
saying we're giving it random input um

7458
06:08:44,320 --> 06:08:46,798
you know if it's a random size t it

7459
06:08:46,798 --> 06:08:48,160
could be

7460
06:08:48,160 --> 06:08:52,000
it's very low um if it's

7461
06:08:52,320 --> 06:08:53,360
if it's

7462
06:08:53,360 --> 06:08:54,718
you know probably skewed towards small

7463
06:08:54,718 --> 06:08:56,000
numbers so maybe you've got a better

7464
06:08:56,000 --> 06:08:57,200
better chance

7465
06:08:57,200 --> 06:08:59,840
so um we can say there's just a really

7466
06:08:59,840 --> 06:09:02,160
low chance of this function crashing

7467
06:09:02,160 --> 06:09:05,520
with general random noise now with

7468
06:09:05,520 --> 06:09:09,320
coverage-based fizzing

7469
06:09:13,040 --> 06:09:15,200
the framework that's doing this it works

7470
06:09:15,200 --> 06:09:16,638
out um

7471
06:09:16,638 --> 06:09:18,558
some pathways through the code and it

7472
06:09:18,558 --> 06:09:20,000
says

7473
06:09:20,000 --> 06:09:21,200
um

7474
06:09:21,200 --> 06:09:22,558
it goes for a little while and it finds

7475
06:09:22,558 --> 06:09:25,040
that when it chooses a five it opens up

7476
06:09:25,040 --> 06:09:28,478
a new pathway and so it

7477
06:09:28,478 --> 06:09:31,120
starts concentrating more on that

7478
06:09:31,120 --> 06:09:31,920
but

7479
06:09:31,920 --> 06:09:34,160
this isn't actually how it looks

7480
06:09:34,160 --> 06:09:36,878
this is how it really looks but the the

7481
06:09:36,878 --> 06:09:38,558
because

7482
06:09:38,558 --> 06:09:41,520
it knows that to compare

7483
06:09:41,520 --> 06:09:44,000
as a string

7484
06:09:44,000 --> 06:09:45,360
um

7485
06:09:45,360 --> 06:09:47,360
five bytes in a row it can compare them

7486
06:09:47,360 --> 06:09:49,680
one at a time so it can if it's five

7487
06:09:49,680 --> 06:09:52,000
letters

7488
06:09:52,160 --> 06:09:54,240
then it says is it an s is it an a isn't

7489
06:09:54,240 --> 06:09:56,958
it m it's whatever it knows how to spell

7490
06:09:56,958 --> 06:09:58,080
i don't

7491
06:09:58,080 --> 06:10:00,080
um

7492
06:10:00,080 --> 06:10:02,320
and so rather than being one in a

7493
06:10:02,320 --> 06:10:05,680
trillion it's like one in

7494
06:10:05,680 --> 06:10:07,520
1280

7495
06:10:07,520 --> 06:10:08,400
um

7496
06:10:08,400 --> 06:10:10,958
and so it finds its way to the abort

7497
06:10:10,958 --> 06:10:13,120
just like like that where's the other

7498
06:10:13,120 --> 06:10:14,000
one

7499
06:10:14,000 --> 06:10:17,520
you just i mean 40 bits is not

7500
06:10:17,520 --> 06:10:19,040
a good encryption but you don't want to

7501
06:10:19,040 --> 06:10:21,520
wait for it

7502
06:10:24,878 --> 06:10:26,798
and

7503
06:10:26,798 --> 06:10:28,878
it's not trying to find the abort it's

7504
06:10:28,878 --> 06:10:31,520
just trying to it's a skeleton in

7505
06:10:31,520 --> 06:10:33,840
this diagram colors in the edges red as

7506
06:10:33,840 --> 06:10:35,840
it crosses them so it's just trying to

7507
06:10:35,840 --> 06:10:37,360
cover them all in so

7508
06:10:37,360 --> 06:10:41,680
coverage based fuzzing has just made

7509
06:10:41,680 --> 06:10:43,760
fuzzing immensely better

7510
06:10:43,760 --> 06:10:46,478
and and this contrived example is

7511
06:10:46,478 --> 06:10:48,718
contrived to make it look not as good as

7512
06:10:48,718 --> 06:10:50,000
it really is because in the real world

7513
06:10:50,000 --> 06:10:52,000
it's even better than that so it's it's

7514
06:10:52,000 --> 06:10:53,360
like there's numbers that you can't even

7515
06:10:53,360 --> 06:10:54,160
name

7516
06:10:54,160 --> 06:10:56,240
because you know who knows what's past

7517
06:10:56,240 --> 06:10:57,520
quintillions

7518
06:10:57,520 --> 06:10:58,958
but um

7519
06:10:58,958 --> 06:11:00,718
then the other thing another thing

7520
06:11:00,718 --> 06:11:02,478
second thing that has made fuzzing much

7521
06:11:02,478 --> 06:11:05,280
better is sanitizers i'm talking mainly

7522
06:11:05,280 --> 06:11:06,240
about the

7523
06:11:06,240 --> 06:11:08,000
address sanitizer because i don't have

7524
06:11:08,000 --> 06:11:09,680
time to talk about other ones

7525
06:11:09,680 --> 06:11:12,080
um so imagine

7526
06:11:12,080 --> 06:11:14,958
you've got an array of 700 bytes which

7527
06:11:14,958 --> 06:11:16,080
is

7528
06:11:16,080 --> 06:11:19,200
the size has been chosen to make it look

7529
06:11:19,200 --> 06:11:20,240
like it

7530
06:11:20,240 --> 06:11:24,000
visible on the 4k page because memory is

7531
06:11:24,000 --> 06:11:27,280
arranged in pages usually the 4k

7532
06:11:27,280 --> 06:11:29,440
and

7533
06:11:29,440 --> 06:11:31,920
now access outside of your array if you

7534
06:11:31,920 --> 06:11:34,478
go a little bit out either end

7535
06:11:34,478 --> 06:11:37,280
it won't sig fault right

7536
06:11:37,280 --> 06:11:39,920
and if you go too far out you'll land in

7537
06:11:39,920 --> 06:11:41,600
some other memory and you can change

7538
06:11:41,600 --> 06:11:44,320
things there or read them whatever

7539
06:11:44,320 --> 06:11:46,000
and no one will know until something

7540
06:11:46,000 --> 06:11:47,360
tries to use it

7541
06:11:47,360 --> 06:11:49,040
or until you read the secret and you've

7542
06:11:49,040 --> 06:11:50,958
got the password whatever

7543
06:11:50,958 --> 06:11:53,200
um and then there's other places where

7544
06:11:53,200 --> 06:11:55,760
you will crash so you can crash with it

7545
06:11:55,760 --> 06:11:57,920
you can't seek fault by doing out of

7546
06:11:57,920 --> 06:12:01,040
bounds access but you usually don't

7547
06:12:01,040 --> 06:12:03,120
and but it's what a sanitizer does the

7548
06:12:03,120 --> 06:12:05,360
address sanitizer does is it just says

7549
06:12:05,360 --> 06:12:07,440
anything that is out of bounds

7550
06:12:07,440 --> 06:12:10,320
will make that crash

7551
06:12:10,320 --> 06:12:11,920
and so

7552
06:12:11,920 --> 06:12:14,240
um it slows things down but it actually

7553
06:12:14,240 --> 06:12:15,440
makes things

7554
06:12:15,440 --> 06:12:18,958
infinitely faster because there are

7555
06:12:18,958 --> 06:12:21,840
there are bugs like feeding one pasta

7556
06:12:21,840 --> 06:12:24,400
um

7557
06:12:24,400 --> 06:12:26,080
and a

7558
06:12:26,080 --> 06:12:28,718
something that isn't eight bytes long

7559
06:12:28,718 --> 06:12:31,280
it's never it's never going to um

7560
06:12:31,280 --> 06:12:33,120
actually go over the page boundary

7561
06:12:33,120 --> 06:12:35,120
everything is aligned in a certain way

7562
06:12:35,120 --> 06:12:36,080
that you just

7563
06:12:36,080 --> 06:12:37,280
you just

7564
06:12:37,280 --> 06:12:39,360
can't crash sometimes of the without

7565
06:12:39,360 --> 06:12:40,798
answer rate

7566
06:12:40,798 --> 06:12:42,798
um

7567
06:12:42,798 --> 06:12:43,920
now

7568
06:12:43,920 --> 06:12:44,798
so

7569
06:12:44,798 --> 06:12:45,760
before

7570
06:12:45,760 --> 06:12:46,878
we were using

7571
06:12:46,878 --> 06:12:49,680
i was trying ls as an example alice is a

7572
06:12:49,680 --> 06:12:53,040
bad thing to try and fuzz because

7573
06:12:53,040 --> 06:12:55,360
um

7574
06:12:55,360 --> 06:12:56,638
it doesn't really take inputs in the

7575
06:12:56,638 --> 06:12:58,878
ways that you want but so what you do is

7576
06:12:58,878 --> 06:13:01,680
you you write a first target that wraps

7577
06:13:01,680 --> 06:13:03,760
parts of your

7578
06:13:03,760 --> 06:13:04,958
code

7579
06:13:04,958 --> 06:13:08,877
and fuzzes like manageable chunks

7580
06:13:09,760 --> 06:13:11,440
you make you make little programs that

7581
06:13:11,440 --> 06:13:13,520
use your program and you can fuzz them

7582
06:13:13,520 --> 06:13:15,680
and you can find

7583
06:13:15,680 --> 06:13:18,240
a good size part of your problem space

7584
06:13:18,240 --> 06:13:19,600
and fuzz it if you try and find

7585
06:13:19,600 --> 06:13:21,920
everything like i work on samba it's a

7586
06:13:21,920 --> 06:13:24,638
it's like a

7587
06:13:24,718 --> 06:13:27,360
it's a terrible project it tries to be

7588
06:13:27,360 --> 06:13:29,040
windows

7589
06:13:29,040 --> 06:13:29,840
it

7590
06:13:29,840 --> 06:13:31,680
talks windows protocols

7591
06:13:31,680 --> 06:13:33,280
and so it looks like to the other

7592
06:13:33,280 --> 06:13:34,558
computers like it's a windows machine

7593
06:13:34,558 --> 06:13:36,400
but it's really the linux machine

7594
06:13:36,400 --> 06:13:37,600
pretending

7595
06:13:37,600 --> 06:13:39,440
um

7596
06:13:39,440 --> 06:13:40,958
and it's got so many

7597
06:13:40,958 --> 06:13:42,558
holes that

7598
06:13:42,558 --> 06:13:44,160
data comes in and out and so many

7599
06:13:44,160 --> 06:13:45,920
processes and everything

7600
06:13:45,920 --> 06:13:49,040
is so huge that um i've got i've been

7601
06:13:49,040 --> 06:13:50,240
working on it for years and years i've

7602
06:13:50,240 --> 06:13:51,760
got no idea what all these things are

7603
06:13:51,760 --> 06:13:53,920
all the ways that data comes in and out

7604
06:13:53,920 --> 06:13:55,360
and all the configuration there's

7605
06:13:55,360 --> 06:13:57,600
there's like um

7606
06:13:57,600 --> 06:13:58,958
i don't know it's megabytes of

7607
06:13:58,958 --> 06:14:00,958
documentation even i think

7608
06:14:00,958 --> 06:14:03,360
um

7609
06:14:03,360 --> 06:14:05,120
and if

7610
06:14:05,120 --> 06:14:06,240
so

7611
06:14:06,240 --> 06:14:08,240
it's easy if you've got an api that's

7612
06:14:08,240 --> 06:14:10,478
writing a fizz target it's not very easy

7613
06:14:10,478 --> 06:14:12,718
if you've got lots of global state

7614
06:14:12,718 --> 06:14:14,718
if you've got things like

7615
06:14:14,718 --> 06:14:16,320
if you put an exit all the way through

7616
06:14:16,320 --> 06:14:17,280
the code

7617
06:14:17,280 --> 06:14:19,120
um like a lot of programs do if they

7618
06:14:19,120 --> 06:14:20,638
read they just

7619
06:14:20,638 --> 06:14:22,558
read some more of standard and halfway

7620
06:14:22,558 --> 06:14:24,558
through in the middle of some function

7621
06:14:24,558 --> 06:14:26,558
if everything's in one file if you've

7622
06:14:26,558 --> 06:14:29,120
got crazy event loops

7623
06:14:29,120 --> 06:14:30,958
databases would be down there on the

7624
06:14:30,958 --> 06:14:33,520
bottom of that um so the way if you're

7625
06:14:33,520 --> 06:14:35,200
starting a new open source project or

7626
06:14:35,200 --> 06:14:37,520
even a closed source project you would

7627
06:14:37,520 --> 06:14:38,400
be

7628
06:14:38,400 --> 06:14:40,240
you should be making your source

7629
06:14:40,240 --> 06:14:42,958
directory test directory and also a fuzz

7630
06:14:42,958 --> 06:14:45,280
directory that has fuzz targets and and

7631
06:14:45,280 --> 06:14:46,240
start thinking about it from the

7632
06:14:46,240 --> 06:14:48,160
beginning or you can just add one on

7633
06:14:48,160 --> 06:14:49,680
later so

7634
06:14:49,680 --> 06:14:51,120
that's

7635
06:14:51,120 --> 06:14:54,558
through the third thing it was um

7636
06:14:54,558 --> 06:14:57,200
writing fuzz targets has made fuzzing

7637
06:14:57,200 --> 06:15:00,080
much more tractable than trying to fuss

7638
06:15:00,080 --> 06:15:01,600
the whole program especially when the

7639
06:15:01,600 --> 06:15:04,320
whole program is something like samba

7640
06:15:04,320 --> 06:15:05,040
that

7641
06:15:05,040 --> 06:15:06,160
um

7642
06:15:06,160 --> 06:15:07,760
it forks 100 times before it does

7643
06:15:07,760 --> 06:15:09,120
anything anyway

7644
06:15:09,120 --> 06:15:12,120
um

7645
06:15:12,320 --> 06:15:14,558
persistent fuzzing

7646
06:15:14,558 --> 06:15:16,320
is an extension of that so your first

7647
06:15:16,320 --> 06:15:18,558
target if it's got

7648
06:15:18,558 --> 06:15:19,840
a special

7649
06:15:19,840 --> 06:15:21,840
um specially named function or special

7650
06:15:21,840 --> 06:15:22,798
function

7651
06:15:22,798 --> 06:15:23,920
it

7652
06:15:23,920 --> 06:15:25,840
loads it as a library rather than

7653
06:15:25,840 --> 06:15:28,400
loading it as

7654
06:15:28,400 --> 06:15:29,920
like running the whole thing and then it

7655
06:15:29,920 --> 06:15:32,000
just fuzzes that

7656
06:15:32,000 --> 06:15:34,080
runs that function over and over again

7657
06:15:34,080 --> 06:15:35,120
or and

7658
06:15:35,120 --> 06:15:36,638
in python you can do it a different way

7659
06:15:36,638 --> 06:15:38,000
you you know there's all these

7660
06:15:38,000 --> 06:15:39,920
decorators and stuff there's actually

7661
06:15:39,920 --> 06:15:41,760
different ways to do fuzzing and python

7662
06:15:41,760 --> 06:15:43,200
there's more than one way to do it of

7663
06:15:43,200 --> 06:15:44,798
course with python

7664
06:15:44,798 --> 06:15:46,080
um

7665
06:15:46,080 --> 06:15:48,798
and so like this is

7666
06:15:48,798 --> 06:15:50,718
this is nominating this function to be

7667
06:15:50,718 --> 06:15:52,878
loaded in the library and and fuzzed in

7668
06:15:52,878 --> 06:15:55,280
and function first now so

7669
06:15:55,280 --> 06:15:57,200
in python fuzzing

7670
06:15:57,200 --> 06:15:58,958
what you normally do is

7671
06:15:58,958 --> 06:16:01,360
and a lot of other languages

7672
06:16:01,360 --> 06:16:06,798
um but python is one example you you um

7673
06:16:07,040 --> 06:16:10,638
any uncaught exception is an error

7674
06:16:10,638 --> 06:16:12,400
and so you catch the exception that you

7675
06:16:12,400 --> 06:16:14,798
want that you expect like if you're

7676
06:16:14,798 --> 06:16:16,958
doing in this one you're doing and which

7677
06:16:16,958 --> 06:16:19,120
you wouldn't normally be fussing

7678
06:16:19,120 --> 06:16:20,798
because

7679
06:16:20,798 --> 06:16:22,558
as part of the

7680
06:16:22,558 --> 06:16:25,360
python itself it's not your function but

7681
06:16:25,360 --> 06:16:26,558
if you were

7682
06:16:26,558 --> 06:16:28,400
um

7683
06:16:28,400 --> 06:16:30,400
you expect to get a value error if you

7684
06:16:30,400 --> 06:16:31,520
give it the

7685
06:16:31,520 --> 06:16:33,200
something that doesn't make sense if you

7686
06:16:33,200 --> 06:16:35,440
read it as an integer but any other

7687
06:16:35,440 --> 06:16:37,680
exception there's something wrong with

7688
06:16:37,680 --> 06:16:39,600
python right

7689
06:16:39,600 --> 06:16:40,798
um

7690
06:16:40,798 --> 06:16:42,878
and you can also do things that you can

7691
06:16:42,878 --> 06:16:44,798
pull apart to the data that you get

7692
06:16:44,798 --> 06:16:46,478
under like this example

7693
06:16:46,478 --> 06:16:48,638
is um

7694
06:16:48,638 --> 06:16:50,638
taking the first byte if there is more

7695
06:16:50,638 --> 06:16:51,840
than one byte

7696
06:16:51,840 --> 06:16:53,760
and using it as the base so you if you

7697
06:16:53,760 --> 06:16:56,160
can say does this pass this as an in

7698
06:16:56,160 --> 06:16:57,600
base 32

7699
06:16:57,600 --> 06:16:59,200
or something

7700
06:16:59,200 --> 06:17:01,520
um

7701
06:17:01,760 --> 06:17:02,878
okay

7702
06:17:02,878 --> 06:17:04,878
so now back to the

7703
06:17:04,878 --> 06:17:06,958
earlier example where

7704
06:17:06,958 --> 06:17:08,478
i was trying to match the string samba

7705
06:17:08,478 --> 06:17:11,200
for doing that in python

7706
06:17:11,200 --> 06:17:13,520
and

7707
06:17:13,520 --> 06:17:14,798
um

7708
06:17:14,798 --> 06:17:17,040
that data is

7709
06:17:17,040 --> 06:17:19,600
compressed with zidlib

7710
06:17:19,600 --> 06:17:21,200
now it will never

7711
06:17:21,200 --> 06:17:23,520
get through this it'll just be

7712
06:17:23,520 --> 06:17:25,520
you'd be fuzzing zedlib but you already

7713
06:17:25,520 --> 06:17:27,680
trusted them because if you didn't trust

7714
06:17:27,680 --> 06:17:29,760
them nothing in the world would work for

7715
06:17:29,760 --> 06:17:32,558
you um

7716
06:17:32,558 --> 06:17:34,558
so you don't and and it will never get

7717
06:17:34,558 --> 06:17:36,878
past that so and if it does it wouldn't

7718
06:17:36,878 --> 06:17:38,398
won't get past the next part because

7719
06:17:38,398 --> 06:17:39,920
it's just trying to you know randomly

7720
06:17:39,920 --> 06:17:42,558
picking things in syndrome so

7721
06:17:42,558 --> 06:17:44,798
what you do is you have

7722
06:17:44,798 --> 06:17:46,558
your mutation function you change it so

7723
06:17:46,558 --> 06:17:48,080
you have a custom mutation function that

7724
06:17:48,080 --> 06:17:50,080
decompresses then does the

7725
06:17:50,080 --> 06:17:51,840
mutation that it would have done inside

7726
06:17:51,840 --> 06:17:53,760
the compression and then compresses it

7727
06:17:53,760 --> 06:17:56,320
again and that means you can like

7728
06:17:56,320 --> 06:17:57,760
transparently see through things like

7729
06:17:57,760 --> 06:17:59,360
that so there's that kind of thing you

7730
06:17:59,360 --> 06:18:01,360
need to do so

7731
06:18:01,360 --> 06:18:03,040
yeah

7732
06:18:03,040 --> 06:18:04,478
in summary

7733
06:18:04,478 --> 06:18:06,958
or this is a midpoint kind of thing and

7734
06:18:06,958 --> 06:18:08,398
it's quintillions

7735
06:18:08,398 --> 06:18:09,120
or

7736
06:18:09,120 --> 06:18:12,320
an unnamed number times infinity times

7737
06:18:12,320 --> 06:18:14,878
other smaller numbers but like you know

7738
06:18:14,878 --> 06:18:17,840
millions better than it used to be right

7739
06:18:17,840 --> 06:18:20,240
after you've got the source code

7740
06:18:20,240 --> 06:18:24,000
um oss fuzz which is run by google

7741
06:18:24,000 --> 06:18:25,680
if you write fuzzers for your open

7742
06:18:25,680 --> 06:18:27,360
source project

7743
06:18:27,360 --> 06:18:28,798
uh

7744
06:18:28,798 --> 06:18:31,360
they'll run them for you

7745
06:18:31,360 --> 06:18:32,958
for free forever

7746
06:18:32,958 --> 06:18:35,280
or until they've lost interest

7747
06:18:35,280 --> 06:18:37,920
um they're doing it in there you know

7748
06:18:37,920 --> 06:18:40,320
your enemies are fuzzing your code if

7749
06:18:40,320 --> 06:18:42,798
you're not and they're finding the bugs

7750
06:18:42,798 --> 06:18:44,558
the funding they're finding

7751
06:18:44,558 --> 06:18:45,680
millions of

7752
06:18:45,680 --> 06:18:47,120
crappy bags that you don't care about

7753
06:18:47,120 --> 06:18:49,520
but some good ones and you will yeah you

7754
06:18:49,520 --> 06:18:51,200
will find bucks

7755
06:18:51,200 --> 06:18:52,558
i've got about a minute so i'll go

7756
06:18:52,558 --> 06:18:55,520
through how would you really fix ls

7757
06:18:55,520 --> 06:18:57,600
um

7758
06:18:57,600 --> 06:18:59,040
it's got all kinds of things like main

7759
06:18:59,040 --> 06:19:01,040
of course exit or exquisite board so

7760
06:19:01,040 --> 06:19:03,600
what you need to do is you

7761
06:19:03,600 --> 06:19:06,080
you have your fuzzing target you include

7762
06:19:06,080 --> 06:19:09,680
the ls source code you redefine main to

7763
06:19:09,680 --> 06:19:10,398
be

7764
06:19:10,398 --> 06:19:11,920
not so main now

7765
06:19:11,920 --> 06:19:14,478
so then the main won't be called when

7766
06:19:14,478 --> 06:19:16,080
you're doing it it will jump to your

7767
06:19:16,080 --> 06:19:19,200
function then you redefine exit to be a

7768
06:19:19,200 --> 06:19:20,558
long jump which is like an exception

7769
06:19:20,558 --> 06:19:22,840
that you can do in c

7770
06:19:22,840 --> 06:19:24,558
and um

7771
06:19:24,558 --> 06:19:26,398
and then you do your

7772
06:19:26,398 --> 06:19:27,680
you call this thing you turn the past

7773
06:19:27,680 --> 06:19:30,000
the parts let's colors or or you you do

7774
06:19:30,000 --> 06:19:31,120
the main

7775
06:19:31,120 --> 06:19:33,280
you need to make up an arc see an angry

7776
06:19:33,280 --> 06:19:35,840
and that's all the truth is you'll find

7777
06:19:35,840 --> 06:19:38,558
lots of crappy bugs and there's eight

7778
06:19:38,558 --> 06:19:43,878
seven six seconds until the sparkles

7779
06:19:44,510 --> 06:19:55,520
[Applause]

7780
06:19:55,520 --> 06:19:58,320
thanks very much

7781
06:19:59,200 --> 06:20:02,080
in the old days

7782
06:20:02,398 --> 06:20:03,760
computers are pretty simple and if you

7783
06:20:03,760 --> 06:20:05,360
want to think about the security of them

7784
06:20:05,360 --> 06:20:06,558
you know you could kind of reason about

7785
06:20:06,558 --> 06:20:07,440
it in your head but in a pretty

7786
06:20:07,440 --> 06:20:09,440
straightforward way and you know if i'm

7787
06:20:09,440 --> 06:20:11,200
on a unix box and i think like i you

7788
06:20:11,200 --> 06:20:12,718
know what do i want i want root access

7789
06:20:12,718 --> 06:20:14,160
how many ways do i get there right i can

7790
06:20:14,160 --> 06:20:16,240
go through a syscall i can go through

7791
06:20:16,240 --> 06:20:18,320
pseudo i can go through a service that's

7792
06:20:18,320 --> 06:20:19,440
already running

7793
06:20:19,440 --> 06:20:20,958
like i can sit there and think here are

7794
06:20:20,958 --> 06:20:22,398
the number of privileged gates i can go

7795
06:20:22,398 --> 06:20:24,160
through to go from low privilege to high

7796
06:20:24,160 --> 06:20:25,200
privilege

7797
06:20:25,200 --> 06:20:28,080
now we don't run unix anymore now we run

7798
06:20:28,080 --> 06:20:30,000
aws

7799
06:20:30,000 --> 06:20:32,240
and i don't know how aws works and i

7800
06:20:32,240 --> 06:20:33,760
can't reason about it and that makes

7801
06:20:33,760 --> 06:20:34,958
dealing with the complexity and

7802
06:20:34,958 --> 06:20:36,080
understanding which bits you have to

7803
06:20:36,080 --> 06:20:37,120
look at

7804
06:20:37,120 --> 06:20:38,638
to understand where the controls are and

7805
06:20:38,638 --> 06:20:41,360
what they actually do is very difficult

7806
06:20:41,360 --> 06:20:42,958
and the process by which we have to go

7807
06:20:42,958 --> 06:20:44,958
through is called threat modeling

7808
06:20:44,958 --> 06:20:46,320
and i understand how i think modern ux

7809
06:20:46,320 --> 06:20:47,840
box but i don't understand how to threat

7810
06:20:47,840 --> 06:20:51,040
model crazy cloud future madness which

7811
06:20:51,040 --> 06:20:52,320
is why

7812
06:20:52,320 --> 06:20:54,870
we have taran

7813
06:20:54,870 --> 06:21:05,999
[Applause]

7814
06:21:06,638 --> 06:21:08,000
cool

7815
06:21:08,000 --> 06:21:10,320
hi everyone thanks for taking some time

7816
06:21:10,320 --> 06:21:12,558
to listen to my talk uh for those of you

7817
06:21:12,558 --> 06:21:14,798
who are still there um online watching

7818
06:21:14,798 --> 06:21:17,760
this talk um i really appreciate it uh i

7819
06:21:17,760 --> 06:21:19,680
know this is day two probably coming

7820
06:21:19,680 --> 06:21:21,200
towards the end of the conference uh

7821
06:21:21,200 --> 06:21:23,280
pretty close so yeah thanks for taking

7822
06:21:23,280 --> 06:21:25,200
some time to listen to this um so my

7823
06:21:25,200 --> 06:21:27,520
name is tarun i work in the security

7824
06:21:27,520 --> 06:21:29,440
risk and compliance space

7825
06:21:29,440 --> 06:21:30,718
but don't worry i'm going to talk to you

7826
06:21:30,718 --> 06:21:32,558
about iso requirements not going to talk

7827
06:21:32,558 --> 06:21:35,200
to you about soccer uh nzism or all

7828
06:21:35,200 --> 06:21:36,558
those kind of things because what i get

7829
06:21:36,558 --> 06:21:38,878
to do is something really exciting i

7830
06:21:38,878 --> 06:21:40,798
think it's really exciting because i get

7831
06:21:40,798 --> 06:21:42,320
to work in the risk and compliance space

7832
06:21:42,320 --> 06:21:43,760
but also get to do a lot of threat

7833
06:21:43,760 --> 06:21:45,840
modeling and risk management so i get to

7834
06:21:45,840 --> 06:21:47,680
work with engineers get to work with

7835
06:21:47,680 --> 06:21:50,160
developers and then see actually how

7836
06:21:50,160 --> 06:21:52,558
does our organizational requirement fit

7837
06:21:52,558 --> 06:21:55,120
into their day-to-day activity

7838
06:21:55,120 --> 06:21:58,558
so i've been to tvcon a few times but

7839
06:21:58,558 --> 06:22:00,160
i've never given a talk so i'm slightly

7840
06:22:00,160 --> 06:22:01,600
nervous so hope you're a bit more

7841
06:22:01,600 --> 06:22:02,798
forgiving

7842
06:22:02,798 --> 06:22:04,718
but the topic that i thought might be

7843
06:22:04,718 --> 06:22:07,120
really relevant for today is making

7844
06:22:07,120 --> 06:22:09,440
threat modeling easy and scalable using

7845
06:22:09,440 --> 06:22:11,120
the stride framework

7846
06:22:11,120 --> 06:22:14,478
so what this talk is really about so if

7847
06:22:14,478 --> 06:22:16,878
you were expecting something like this

7848
06:22:16,878 --> 06:22:19,440
and i'd show you how to do that

7849
06:22:19,440 --> 06:22:20,878
i'm sorry to disappoint you that's not

7850
06:22:20,878 --> 06:22:23,040
what this talk is about

7851
06:22:23,040 --> 06:22:24,718
what this talk really is about it's

7852
06:22:24,718 --> 06:22:26,558
about my story

7853
06:22:26,558 --> 06:22:28,638
it's about what i've learned so far and

7854
06:22:28,638 --> 06:22:30,718
what worked for me i'm really hoping

7855
06:22:30,718 --> 06:22:32,718
after my talk you can take at least

7856
06:22:32,718 --> 06:22:35,120
something away and use and make it a

7857
06:22:35,120 --> 06:22:36,798
success story in your organization as

7858
06:22:36,798 --> 06:22:39,440
well so what is my story about

7859
06:22:39,440 --> 06:22:42,240
two years ago i was given the task in a

7860
06:22:42,240 --> 06:22:44,398
really big company that

7861
06:22:44,398 --> 06:22:45,840
i need to implement a threat modeling

7862
06:22:45,840 --> 06:22:47,520
process that is

7863
06:22:47,520 --> 06:22:50,638
widely adopted that is super easy to do

7864
06:22:50,638 --> 06:22:53,280
i thought that was easy but it's not um

7865
06:22:53,280 --> 06:22:55,440
so i work in a company which has got a

7866
06:22:55,440 --> 06:22:57,840
global footprint i think we've got about

7867
06:22:57,840 --> 06:23:01,200
4500 staff across the world um more more

7868
06:23:01,200 --> 06:23:02,398
than half of them are developers and

7869
06:23:02,398 --> 06:23:05,120
engineers and i'm not even an engineer

7870
06:23:05,120 --> 06:23:06,878
i'm a risk guy so i'm not that technical

7871
06:23:06,878 --> 06:23:10,638
either so it was 10 times harder um but

7872
06:23:10,638 --> 06:23:14,080
i thought it's doable i give it a lo

7873
06:23:14,080 --> 06:23:17,360
a lot of tries um i failed sometimes it

7874
06:23:17,360 --> 06:23:19,600
worked out for me eventually at least i

7875
06:23:19,600 --> 06:23:22,558
hope it worked out so in this talk i'll

7876
06:23:22,558 --> 06:23:24,718
be sharing that experience with you

7877
06:23:24,718 --> 06:23:26,320
i'll be talking about at a very high

7878
06:23:26,320 --> 06:23:28,958
level what threat modeling is what is

7879
06:23:28,958 --> 06:23:30,878
the stride word actually

7880
06:23:30,878 --> 06:23:32,478
i won't go into too much detail about

7881
06:23:32,478 --> 06:23:34,638
that because there's lots of other talks

7882
06:23:34,638 --> 06:23:36,478
lots of other resources online that you

7883
06:23:36,478 --> 06:23:37,520
can look up

7884
06:23:37,520 --> 06:23:38,798
so i'm not going to try to replicate

7885
06:23:38,798 --> 06:23:40,478
that and in my story i'm going to tell

7886
06:23:40,478 --> 06:23:43,360
you why do people or companies find it

7887
06:23:43,360 --> 06:23:45,200
hard sometimes why do they sometimes

7888
06:23:45,200 --> 06:23:46,160
struggle

7889
06:23:46,160 --> 06:23:48,160
and then what is my way of making it

7890
06:23:48,160 --> 06:23:50,240
easy and scalable so like i said this

7891
06:23:50,240 --> 06:23:52,160
works for me maybe it works for you

7892
06:23:52,160 --> 06:23:53,600
maybe it doesn't you might have to tweak

7893
06:23:53,600 --> 06:23:56,958
a few things and it might work for you

7894
06:23:56,958 --> 06:23:57,760
so

7895
06:23:57,760 --> 06:23:59,520
moving on to

7896
06:23:59,520 --> 06:24:01,200
the first part what actually threat

7897
06:24:01,200 --> 06:24:02,718
modeling is i know a few speakers have

7898
06:24:02,718 --> 06:24:04,638
already touched on that but if you

7899
06:24:04,638 --> 06:24:06,160
haven't heard about threat modeling

7900
06:24:06,160 --> 06:24:07,120
before

7901
06:24:07,120 --> 06:24:08,718
there's a few dictionary definitions out

7902
06:24:08,718 --> 06:24:09,680
there

7903
06:24:09,680 --> 06:24:12,320
in a nutshell threat modelling is about

7904
06:24:12,320 --> 06:24:14,080
looking at threats looking at thinking

7905
06:24:14,080 --> 06:24:16,000
about your threat actors so maybe people

7906
06:24:16,000 --> 06:24:18,080
outside your company maybe inside your

7907
06:24:18,080 --> 06:24:19,920
company your third-party supply chain

7908
06:24:19,920 --> 06:24:21,600
and all those kind of things and then

7909
06:24:21,600 --> 06:24:22,878
thinking about vulnerabilities that they

7910
06:24:22,878 --> 06:24:24,558
could exploit and then how are you going

7911
06:24:24,558 --> 06:24:26,160
to stop them what are the mitigations

7912
06:24:26,160 --> 06:24:27,840
you're going to have so basically threat

7913
06:24:27,840 --> 06:24:30,398
modeling is this exercise

7914
06:24:30,398 --> 06:24:32,240
and then what is stride so stride is

7915
06:24:32,240 --> 06:24:34,080
really a framework um there's lots of

7916
06:24:34,080 --> 06:24:36,000
other frameworks i'm not saying stride

7917
06:24:36,000 --> 06:24:38,160
is the best framework um what i'm saying

7918
06:24:38,160 --> 06:24:40,240
is stride work in my scenario

7919
06:24:40,240 --> 06:24:41,600
there's maybe another framework that you

7920
06:24:41,600 --> 06:24:43,600
can use um or you can use things like

7921
06:24:43,600 --> 06:24:45,200
attack trees or just playing cards if

7922
06:24:45,200 --> 06:24:47,600
that's that's what you fancy um but

7923
06:24:47,600 --> 06:24:48,878
stride worked for me so if you haven't

7924
06:24:48,878 --> 06:24:50,958
heard about stride before strider this

7925
06:24:50,958 --> 06:24:53,200
framework which was i think developed in

7926
06:24:53,200 --> 06:24:55,360
1990s by a couple of people back in the

7927
06:24:55,360 --> 06:24:58,160
microsoft and essentially what it really

7928
06:24:58,160 --> 06:25:00,080
addresses is it helps you under answer

7929
06:25:00,080 --> 06:25:01,200
the question

7930
06:25:01,200 --> 06:25:03,120
what can go wrong with the product or

7931
06:25:03,120 --> 06:25:04,798
the feature that you're building that's

7932
06:25:04,798 --> 06:25:07,280
it it's really simple it is an acronym

7933
06:25:07,280 --> 06:25:08,398
so it does

7934
06:25:08,398 --> 06:25:11,360
have a sort of meaning to it um

7935
06:25:11,360 --> 06:25:12,798
and like i said i'm not going to go into

7936
06:25:12,798 --> 06:25:14,240
too much detail about stride but i'll

7937
06:25:14,240 --> 06:25:16,080
tell you what the acronym stands for so

7938
06:25:16,080 --> 06:25:18,240
it stands for spoofing tampering

7939
06:25:18,240 --> 06:25:20,558
repudiation information disclosure

7940
06:25:20,558 --> 06:25:22,080
denial of service elevation or

7941
06:25:22,080 --> 06:25:23,200
privileges

7942
06:25:23,200 --> 06:25:25,200
maybe that's too much to remember maybe

7943
06:25:25,200 --> 06:25:27,040
not you're already familiar whatever the

7944
06:25:27,040 --> 06:25:28,320
cases that's okay you don't have to

7945
06:25:28,320 --> 06:25:29,920
remember the whole thing for this talk

7946
06:25:29,920 --> 06:25:31,360
but what i really want you to remember

7947
06:25:31,360 --> 06:25:34,320
is spoofing so basically pretending to

7948
06:25:34,320 --> 06:25:36,798
be something or someone that you're not

7949
06:25:36,798 --> 06:25:38,558
and denial of service which is taking

7950
06:25:38,558 --> 06:25:40,558
actions to uh to make something

7951
06:25:40,558 --> 06:25:41,920
unavailable and the reason i'm asking

7952
06:25:41,920 --> 06:25:43,600
you to remember these two is because

7953
06:25:43,600 --> 06:25:45,040
i'll be sharing an example about these

7954
06:25:45,040 --> 06:25:48,080
two later down in my presentation

7955
06:25:48,080 --> 06:25:49,440
so

7956
06:25:49,440 --> 06:25:51,200
why is it actually hard so coming back

7957
06:25:51,200 --> 06:25:53,600
to my story now um when i started my

7958
06:25:53,600 --> 06:25:54,558
journey

7959
06:25:54,558 --> 06:25:55,600
um

7960
06:25:55,600 --> 06:25:58,958
i was someone like this in this photo

7961
06:25:58,958 --> 06:26:00,638
where i had all my sticky notes ready in

7962
06:26:00,638 --> 06:26:02,398
a workshop i was standing next to a

7963
06:26:02,398 --> 06:26:05,520
whiteboard with an engineering pod a

7964
06:26:05,520 --> 06:26:07,200
whole bunch of developers in there

7965
06:26:07,200 --> 06:26:08,558
telling me about their product and i

7966
06:26:08,558 --> 06:26:11,280
said cool so what's the threat should we

7967
06:26:11,280 --> 06:26:12,878
start with i've got lots of sticky notes

7968
06:26:12,878 --> 06:26:14,240
so i'm hoping we come up with a lot of

7969
06:26:14,240 --> 06:26:16,638
them um but we really struggled

7970
06:26:16,638 --> 06:26:18,080
and then that happened again and it

7971
06:26:18,080 --> 06:26:20,320
happened again and again and i said why

7972
06:26:20,320 --> 06:26:22,000
is it actually so hard i thought threat

7973
06:26:22,000 --> 06:26:24,240
modeling is really easy i mean i think i

7974
06:26:24,240 --> 06:26:25,520
figured out the strike framework so

7975
06:26:25,520 --> 06:26:27,760
maybe it is easy um and there were a lot

7976
06:26:27,760 --> 06:26:30,240
of things so i thought there was maybe

7977
06:26:30,240 --> 06:26:32,080
tools like maybe i actually didn't have

7978
06:26:32,080 --> 06:26:34,558
a good tool that could help me

7979
06:26:34,558 --> 06:26:36,878
push out a really good diagram tell me

7980
06:26:36,878 --> 06:26:38,718
what my boundaries are what i need to

7981
06:26:38,718 --> 06:26:40,798
protect what i really need to worry

7982
06:26:40,798 --> 06:26:42,718
about as a threat

7983
06:26:42,718 --> 06:26:44,398
for thread actors and all those kind of

7984
06:26:44,398 --> 06:26:46,558
things so maybe tools

7985
06:26:46,558 --> 06:26:48,320
maybe there's not enough training in my

7986
06:26:48,320 --> 06:26:49,520
company

7987
06:26:49,520 --> 06:26:51,600
i know people have to complete modules

7988
06:26:51,600 --> 06:26:53,360
when they join the company there's

7989
06:26:53,360 --> 06:26:55,840
annual refreshers um i've put out

7990
06:26:55,840 --> 06:26:58,558
confluence pages um and i think

7991
06:26:58,558 --> 06:27:00,478
there's also like training videos so is

7992
06:27:00,478 --> 06:27:02,160
it actually training or is it tools is

7993
06:27:02,160 --> 06:27:03,920
it something else or is the process

7994
06:27:03,920 --> 06:27:06,320
really actually complicated

7995
06:27:06,320 --> 06:27:08,000
i i actually don't know where to start

7996
06:27:08,000 --> 06:27:09,520
do i start

7997
06:27:09,520 --> 06:27:12,000
looking at my ui which is open to the

7998
06:27:12,000 --> 06:27:14,000
public or do i start with my database

7999
06:27:14,000 --> 06:27:16,558
layer do i start somewhere else um do i

8000
06:27:16,558 --> 06:27:18,000
which threat actor do i think about

8001
06:27:18,000 --> 06:27:18,878
first

8002
06:27:18,878 --> 06:27:20,878
so it's really hard when you actually

8003
06:27:20,878 --> 06:27:22,000
sit down

8004
06:27:22,000 --> 06:27:23,840
in a workshop and you think about what's

8005
06:27:23,840 --> 06:27:25,360
the first thing i'm going to

8006
06:27:25,360 --> 06:27:26,798
think about and you can't just start

8007
06:27:26,798 --> 06:27:28,320
with things like man in the middle

8008
06:27:28,320 --> 06:27:30,080
because where is that man in the middle

8009
06:27:30,080 --> 06:27:31,600
is that is that man sitting in your

8010
06:27:31,600 --> 06:27:34,160
office is that actually a person sitting

8011
06:27:34,160 --> 06:27:35,840
on your cloud in your browser somewhere

8012
06:27:35,840 --> 06:27:38,878
else so it can get really complicated

8013
06:27:38,878 --> 06:27:40,558
really easily as well

8014
06:27:40,558 --> 06:27:42,558
and then there's always this question

8015
06:27:42,558 --> 06:27:44,958
how long should i spend on it um how

8016
06:27:44,958 --> 06:27:46,558
long should i book a workshop for half

8017
06:27:46,558 --> 06:27:49,600
an hour one hour two hours four hours

8018
06:27:49,600 --> 06:27:51,520
um and that's really a good question

8019
06:27:51,520 --> 06:27:52,398
because

8020
06:27:52,398 --> 06:27:54,240
a lot of the time people were asking me

8021
06:27:54,240 --> 06:27:56,478
how much effort should i really spend on

8022
06:27:56,478 --> 06:27:58,000
thread modeling so to put that into

8023
06:27:58,000 --> 06:28:00,160
perspective imagine at the bottom of the

8024
06:28:00,160 --> 06:28:02,320
scale we've got time on the left you've

8025
06:28:02,320 --> 06:28:03,840
got the value of the exercise of doing

8026
06:28:03,840 --> 06:28:06,080
threat modeling so the more about amount

8027
06:28:06,080 --> 06:28:08,160
of time you spend um you'll come start

8028
06:28:08,160 --> 06:28:09,760
coming up with threads but there will be

8029
06:28:09,760 --> 06:28:12,000
a time after a while you'd say okay i've

8030
06:28:12,000 --> 06:28:13,680
spent a lot of time but i've still only

8031
06:28:13,680 --> 06:28:15,440
got three or four relevant threats so

8032
06:28:15,440 --> 06:28:17,840
maybe that's good enough but that sweet

8033
06:28:17,840 --> 06:28:20,240
spot which is where you want to be where

8034
06:28:20,240 --> 06:28:22,958
does that actually sit and the answer is

8035
06:28:22,958 --> 06:28:25,200
it depends so something really simple

8036
06:28:25,200 --> 06:28:27,360
where you've got a user interface an api

8037
06:28:27,360 --> 06:28:29,440
below it or maybe a bff

8038
06:28:29,440 --> 06:28:31,360
and that's a simple application maybe

8039
06:28:31,360 --> 06:28:33,200
half an hour maybe one hour but if

8040
06:28:33,200 --> 06:28:34,878
you've got something really complicated

8041
06:28:34,878 --> 06:28:36,718
a really complex architecture you've got

8042
06:28:36,718 --> 06:28:38,798
multiple endpoints multiple external

8043
06:28:38,798 --> 06:28:40,398
integrations with a government agency

8044
06:28:40,398 --> 06:28:43,040
with a bank with someone else maybe two

8045
06:28:43,040 --> 06:28:44,718
hours so it depends on your architecture

8046
06:28:44,718 --> 06:28:47,920
and how complicated your feature is

8047
06:28:47,920 --> 06:28:51,040
so then how do we actually make this

8048
06:28:51,040 --> 06:28:53,280
really easy and scalable because there's

8049
06:28:53,280 --> 06:28:54,398
a whole bunch of questions we went

8050
06:28:54,398 --> 06:28:55,200
through

8051
06:28:55,200 --> 06:28:57,920
i haven't given you an answer yet so i

8052
06:28:57,920 --> 06:28:59,680
think maybe the best way to address the

8053
06:28:59,680 --> 06:29:02,080
answer is to put into two categories one

8054
06:29:02,080 --> 06:29:04,798
is have a really cool tool

8055
06:29:04,798 --> 06:29:06,160
and then second

8056
06:29:06,160 --> 06:29:08,160
is have a really good culture a really

8057
06:29:08,160 --> 06:29:11,200
strong culture around it and so

8058
06:29:11,200 --> 06:29:12,478
i'm not going to ask you to go and spend

8059
06:29:12,478 --> 06:29:14,398
some money and buy a really cool tool i

8060
06:29:14,398 --> 06:29:15,680
didn't do that i couldn't afford that

8061
06:29:15,680 --> 06:29:17,440
anyway um so

8062
06:29:17,440 --> 06:29:19,280
what i'm going to talk you through is in

8063
06:29:19,280 --> 06:29:21,200
my story how i work through these two

8064
06:29:21,200 --> 06:29:22,160
things

8065
06:29:22,160 --> 06:29:23,200
so

8066
06:29:23,200 --> 06:29:24,718
i'm going to talk to you about how to

8067
06:29:24,718 --> 06:29:26,558
build the tool um

8068
06:29:26,558 --> 06:29:28,160
so you can go to the market you can

8069
06:29:28,160 --> 06:29:29,280
spend a lot of money you can get

8070
06:29:29,280 --> 06:29:30,958
something really flash

8071
06:29:30,958 --> 06:29:33,200
that will spit out um a lot of diagrams

8072
06:29:33,200 --> 06:29:35,120
based on your infrastructure code and

8073
06:29:35,120 --> 06:29:36,478
they'll tell you what are your

8074
06:29:36,478 --> 06:29:39,440
boundaries be it aws or azure or gcp and

8075
06:29:39,440 --> 06:29:41,040
then it'll tell you these other relevant

8076
06:29:41,040 --> 06:29:42,398
threats you need to think about that's

8077
06:29:42,398 --> 06:29:45,600
cool um i don't want to start there so

8078
06:29:45,600 --> 06:29:46,878
my tool is just a lightweight

8079
06:29:46,878 --> 06:29:48,240
questionnaire it's a bunch of questions

8080
06:29:48,240 --> 06:29:50,000
that's it it's it's actually sitting on

8081
06:29:50,000 --> 06:29:51,440
a document that's that's probably it

8082
06:29:51,440 --> 06:29:53,040
that's my template that's my tool so

8083
06:29:53,040 --> 06:29:54,958
when i talk about the tool imagine a

8084
06:29:54,958 --> 06:29:56,638
questionnaire that's that's how i

8085
06:29:56,638 --> 06:29:58,000
started

8086
06:29:58,000 --> 06:29:59,920
so how do you actually build one

8087
06:29:59,920 --> 06:30:01,440
and why do you need one

8088
06:30:01,440 --> 06:30:02,718
so

8089
06:30:02,718 --> 06:30:04,160
there's different ways you can build one

8090
06:30:04,160 --> 06:30:05,280
and the first one i would highly

8091
06:30:05,280 --> 06:30:07,040
recommend is starting small

8092
06:30:07,040 --> 06:30:10,240
so my first attempt where i failed i

8093
06:30:10,240 --> 06:30:11,840
went in with a really complex

8094
06:30:11,840 --> 06:30:13,840
questionnaire i think i had about 60

8095
06:30:13,840 --> 06:30:15,840
questions for an engineering team to

8096
06:30:15,840 --> 06:30:17,680
answer to say hey have you done this

8097
06:30:17,680 --> 06:30:19,600
have you done that and

8098
06:30:19,600 --> 06:30:21,120
at the end of the day i sort of didn't

8099
06:30:21,120 --> 06:30:22,478
get any value out of it i know they

8100
06:30:22,478 --> 06:30:23,360
didn't

8101
06:30:23,360 --> 06:30:25,520
so it was basically garbage in a garbage

8102
06:30:25,520 --> 06:30:26,718
out

8103
06:30:26,718 --> 06:30:28,320
so what i really recommend is you start

8104
06:30:28,320 --> 06:30:30,798
small so when i started small eventually

8105
06:30:30,798 --> 06:30:32,478
i said i'm going to only ask you five

8106
06:30:32,478 --> 06:30:34,718
questions or maybe six and these are

8107
06:30:34,718 --> 06:30:37,200
going to be basic questions tell me how

8108
06:30:37,200 --> 06:30:39,280
do you encrypt your data tell me how

8109
06:30:39,280 --> 06:30:41,520
does authentication work on the feature

8110
06:30:41,520 --> 06:30:42,798
what's the worst case scenario and

8111
06:30:42,798 --> 06:30:43,840
that's it

8112
06:30:43,840 --> 06:30:45,760
and i was really fascinated to see some

8113
06:30:45,760 --> 06:30:46,958
of the answers because it was an eye

8114
06:30:46,958 --> 06:30:48,558
opener about how engineers and

8115
06:30:48,558 --> 06:30:50,320
developers really think about threats

8116
06:30:50,320 --> 06:30:51,840
and how does security

8117
06:30:51,840 --> 06:30:53,280
think about threat how does the risk

8118
06:30:53,280 --> 06:30:54,718
person think about a threat so it's

8119
06:30:54,718 --> 06:30:55,920
quite interesting so i'd recommend

8120
06:30:55,920 --> 06:30:57,600
starting small and having practical

8121
06:30:57,600 --> 06:31:00,718
expectations so my expectation was

8122
06:31:00,718 --> 06:31:02,398
not saying telling them this is a

8123
06:31:02,398 --> 06:31:04,398
security requirement my expectation was

8124
06:31:04,398 --> 06:31:06,240
i just want you to have a crack at this

8125
06:31:06,240 --> 06:31:07,440
if you can't come up with a single

8126
06:31:07,440 --> 06:31:09,760
threat that's good enough but have a

8127
06:31:09,760 --> 06:31:11,840
fair and honest crack at it and see if

8128
06:31:11,840 --> 06:31:13,040
you can come out at least with one

8129
06:31:13,040 --> 06:31:15,200
threat and then make it relevant i

8130
06:31:15,200 --> 06:31:17,760
didn't i started with questions on blogs

8131
06:31:17,760 --> 06:31:19,600
and external resources but i started

8132
06:31:19,600 --> 06:31:21,280
making them more relevant i said hey by

8133
06:31:21,280 --> 06:31:22,878
the way we use this build and deploy

8134
06:31:22,878 --> 06:31:24,478
tool i'm going to ask you a specific

8135
06:31:24,478 --> 06:31:26,000
threat question related to this tool

8136
06:31:26,000 --> 06:31:27,920
what do you think now so start making it

8137
06:31:27,920 --> 06:31:30,000
more relevant and most importantly focus

8138
06:31:30,000 --> 06:31:32,798
on consistency and speed so use a

8139
06:31:32,798 --> 06:31:34,718
framework that works for you and to make

8140
06:31:34,718 --> 06:31:36,718
it really consistent but make sure

8141
06:31:36,718 --> 06:31:38,558
you're still doing it really quickly

8142
06:31:38,558 --> 06:31:40,878
you're not asking for people uh to jump

8143
06:31:40,878 --> 06:31:42,398
into two or three different workshops

8144
06:31:42,398 --> 06:31:44,798
and you're not getting in their way

8145
06:31:44,798 --> 06:31:46,478
and then

8146
06:31:46,478 --> 06:31:48,160
as you keep doing that keep on providing

8147
06:31:48,160 --> 06:31:49,600
more training keep on taking more

8148
06:31:49,600 --> 06:31:51,280
feedback keep on sharpening your

8149
06:31:51,280 --> 06:31:52,478
questions

8150
06:31:52,478 --> 06:31:54,398
i've had times where people have told me

8151
06:31:54,398 --> 06:31:56,718
um this process is garbage and your

8152
06:31:56,718 --> 06:31:58,638
questions are wrong and that's okay so

8153
06:31:58,638 --> 06:31:59,920
i've taken that on board and i said you

8154
06:31:59,920 --> 06:32:01,600
tell me what would you like to see and

8155
06:32:01,600 --> 06:32:03,040
they've spoken to me about really good

8156
06:32:03,040 --> 06:32:04,558
sort of threats and relevant questions

8157
06:32:04,558 --> 06:32:06,080
so i keep on sharpening the questions i

8158
06:32:06,080 --> 06:32:07,920
keep on building that tool i keep on

8159
06:32:07,920 --> 06:32:09,920
expanding it taking on questions and

8160
06:32:09,920 --> 06:32:12,240
adding more and more specific context it

8161
06:32:12,240 --> 06:32:14,478
does take time but it really works

8162
06:32:14,478 --> 06:32:16,160
and so eventually what i'm saying is

8163
06:32:16,160 --> 06:32:17,440
through all these steps keep on

8164
06:32:17,440 --> 06:32:18,958
providing support keep on talking to

8165
06:32:18,958 --> 06:32:21,360
your team see what really is working but

8166
06:32:21,360 --> 06:32:23,040
always make sure you're going

8167
06:32:23,040 --> 06:32:24,638
lightweight you're not going in with a

8168
06:32:24,638 --> 06:32:26,478
bloated process which is going to take

8169
06:32:26,478 --> 06:32:28,398
too much time too too long

8170
06:32:28,398 --> 06:32:30,320
and you spend a lot of time with minimal

8171
06:32:30,320 --> 06:32:31,600
value so make sure you always go

8172
06:32:31,600 --> 06:32:32,958
lightweight

8173
06:32:32,958 --> 06:32:34,798
so when i talk about my tool i'll take

8174
06:32:34,798 --> 06:32:37,040
you to a quick example so if you

8175
06:32:37,040 --> 06:32:38,240
remember spoofing when i spoke about

8176
06:32:38,240 --> 06:32:40,478
stride early on spoofing

8177
06:32:40,478 --> 06:32:42,000
threat talks about basically

8178
06:32:42,000 --> 06:32:43,920
authentication threats so ask questions

8179
06:32:43,920 --> 06:32:45,520
like how does authentication work on a

8180
06:32:45,520 --> 06:32:46,478
feature

8181
06:32:46,478 --> 06:32:49,280
how does um customer identity work how

8182
06:32:49,280 --> 06:32:51,040
do you use our own internal identity

8183
06:32:51,040 --> 06:32:53,120
service can something go wrong there for

8184
06:32:53,120 --> 06:32:55,360
your product um are you using any

8185
06:32:55,360 --> 06:32:57,280
hard-coded secrets or secrets which

8186
06:32:57,280 --> 06:32:58,958
shouldn't be in the place where they're

8187
06:32:58,958 --> 06:33:00,558
not meant to be and by the way when i'm

8188
06:33:00,558 --> 06:33:02,000
asking all these questions i'm saying

8189
06:33:02,000 --> 06:33:03,680
think about these tools this is what we

8190
06:33:03,680 --> 06:33:05,200
use in our company does this apply to

8191
06:33:05,200 --> 06:33:07,040
you does this apply to your feature so

8192
06:33:07,040 --> 06:33:09,120
it could be things like team city or it

8193
06:33:09,120 --> 06:33:11,280
could be our storage

8194
06:33:11,280 --> 06:33:12,958
buckets uh s3 buckets or storage

8195
06:33:12,958 --> 06:33:14,478
accounts on azure

8196
06:33:14,478 --> 06:33:16,398
and all those kind of things so the same

8197
06:33:16,398 --> 06:33:18,240
applies for denial of service when i'm

8198
06:33:18,240 --> 06:33:19,840
talking about denial of service i'm not

8199
06:33:19,840 --> 06:33:21,520
just saying a distributed denial of

8200
06:33:21,520 --> 06:33:23,520
service attack i'm saying have you done

8201
06:33:23,520 --> 06:33:25,360
the bare minimum at least have you put

8202
06:33:25,360 --> 06:33:26,718
your thing behind a web application

8203
06:33:26,718 --> 06:33:28,478
firewall but by the way have you if

8204
06:33:28,478 --> 06:33:31,120
you've done that what about the other

8205
06:33:31,120 --> 06:33:33,440
defense and debt mitigations can things

8206
06:33:33,440 --> 06:33:36,718
go wrong there can an authenticated user

8207
06:33:36,718 --> 06:33:38,718
still exploit the uh

8208
06:33:38,718 --> 06:33:40,160
function of your feature if you're

8209
06:33:40,160 --> 06:33:42,478
sending out emails text messages or

8210
06:33:42,478 --> 06:33:43,920
maybe just allowing people to upload

8211
06:33:43,920 --> 06:33:47,280
csvs can someone exploit that can an

8212
06:33:47,280 --> 06:33:49,280
um login user actually explore your

8213
06:33:49,280 --> 06:33:51,520
functionality to still cause some harm

8214
06:33:51,520 --> 06:33:53,200
so think about these things and then

8215
06:33:53,200 --> 06:33:54,558
think about things like ransomware

8216
06:33:54,558 --> 06:33:57,440
scenarios is can your feature easily be

8217
06:33:57,440 --> 06:33:59,600
restored can you restore customer data

8218
06:33:59,600 --> 06:34:02,080
if we get crypto locked um and that

8219
06:34:02,080 --> 06:34:03,840
really gets people thinking because now

8220
06:34:03,840 --> 06:34:05,200
you've given them a starting point

8221
06:34:05,200 --> 06:34:06,398
you've given them a set of questions to

8222
06:34:06,398 --> 06:34:08,160
think about so you've given them

8223
06:34:08,160 --> 06:34:10,160
something to work with

8224
06:34:10,160 --> 06:34:12,160
so that was

8225
06:34:12,160 --> 06:34:14,240
a quick sort of run on how i went and

8226
06:34:14,240 --> 06:34:16,320
tried to make my tool how i keep working

8227
06:34:16,320 --> 06:34:17,680
on it and the next thing i want to talk

8228
06:34:17,680 --> 06:34:19,200
about culture and so when i talk about

8229
06:34:19,200 --> 06:34:20,958
culture i'm talking about security

8230
06:34:20,958 --> 06:34:22,638
culture and this is something that is

8231
06:34:22,638 --> 06:34:24,320
really close to my heart and there's

8232
06:34:24,320 --> 06:34:25,520
three key things i want to highlight

8233
06:34:25,520 --> 06:34:26,478
here

8234
06:34:26,478 --> 06:34:27,760
the first thing i want to highlight is

8235
06:34:27,760 --> 06:34:29,920
having realistic expectations

8236
06:34:29,920 --> 06:34:31,920
i don't know everything about security

8237
06:34:31,920 --> 06:34:33,360
i've never met someone who knows

8238
06:34:33,360 --> 06:34:35,680
everything about security and for me

8239
06:34:35,680 --> 06:34:38,160
security is really hard

8240
06:34:38,160 --> 06:34:39,920
so but there are people who understand

8241
06:34:39,920 --> 06:34:41,760
how a web application firewall works

8242
06:34:41,760 --> 06:34:43,600
there are people who understand how key

8243
06:34:43,600 --> 06:34:45,360
management and encryption works and

8244
06:34:45,360 --> 06:34:47,440
that's okay so you can't have the same

8245
06:34:47,440 --> 06:34:48,798
expectation from your developers or

8246
06:34:48,798 --> 06:34:50,240
engineers in your company that they

8247
06:34:50,240 --> 06:34:51,600
should know everything after doing a

8248
06:34:51,600 --> 06:34:52,958
risk assessment or threat modeling

8249
06:34:52,958 --> 06:34:55,360
exercise so have realistic expectations

8250
06:34:55,360 --> 06:34:57,600
with uh people that are actually doing

8251
06:34:57,600 --> 06:35:00,000
this exercise the second thing is don't

8252
06:35:00,000 --> 06:35:01,680
get in the way

8253
06:35:01,680 --> 06:35:03,120
there's a twitter account to follow and

8254
06:35:03,120 --> 06:35:05,360
they shared this text message online

8255
06:35:05,360 --> 06:35:07,120
from one of the tech

8256
06:35:07,120 --> 06:35:08,718
engineers in another company and it was

8257
06:35:08,718 --> 06:35:10,798
really fascinating and this person was

8258
06:35:10,798 --> 06:35:13,040
saying basically now there's 300 reviews

8259
06:35:13,040 --> 06:35:14,718
um you know before i can have a product

8260
06:35:14,718 --> 06:35:17,040
launch don't take this text message

8261
06:35:17,040 --> 06:35:18,958
literally because what they said was hey

8262
06:35:18,958 --> 06:35:20,798
remember the time where you used to be

8263
06:35:20,798 --> 06:35:22,718
you know have an idea and then be able

8264
06:35:22,718 --> 06:35:24,240
to ship it the same day maybe that's not

8265
06:35:24,240 --> 06:35:26,080
good for your stability or security but

8266
06:35:26,080 --> 06:35:28,478
like that that really spoke to me as

8267
06:35:28,478 --> 06:35:30,478
well and i thought are we getting in the

8268
06:35:30,478 --> 06:35:32,080
way like

8269
06:35:32,080 --> 06:35:33,360
um one of the speakers mentioned

8270
06:35:33,360 --> 06:35:35,360
shifting left and i truly believe that

8271
06:35:35,360 --> 06:35:37,600
but then when you try to shift left

8272
06:35:37,600 --> 06:35:40,320
don't shift left along with your 20-step

8273
06:35:40,320 --> 06:35:42,160
approval process not with all your

8274
06:35:42,160 --> 06:35:43,440
spreadsheets not with your ticketing

8275
06:35:43,440 --> 06:35:44,958
system that's not shifting left that's

8276
06:35:44,958 --> 06:35:46,240
just moving the problem from one end to

8277
06:35:46,240 --> 06:35:48,398
another so make it really easy and stop

8278
06:35:48,398 --> 06:35:50,398
getting in the way remove the blockers

8279
06:35:50,398 --> 06:35:52,240
and any admin overhead

8280
06:35:52,240 --> 06:35:53,840
and last but not the least don't be the

8281
06:35:53,840 --> 06:35:56,080
bad guy i work in risk and compliance

8282
06:35:56,080 --> 06:35:58,000
and was an eye opener when i remember in

8283
06:35:58,000 --> 06:35:59,840
my first workshop i said hey i'm a risk

8284
06:35:59,840 --> 06:36:01,840
income plans guys and the response i got

8285
06:36:01,840 --> 06:36:03,920
was oh here we go uh this guy's going to

8286
06:36:03,920 --> 06:36:05,680
start waving his compliance stick at me

8287
06:36:05,680 --> 06:36:07,520
and so if you get that sort of reaction

8288
06:36:07,520 --> 06:36:09,120
you probably need to work on that

8289
06:36:09,120 --> 06:36:12,320
because security is only as good as uh

8290
06:36:12,320 --> 06:36:14,320
what what's in your product so when i

8291
06:36:14,320 --> 06:36:16,320
saw this tweet i said that's really good

8292
06:36:16,320 --> 06:36:19,200
because um difficult things you can't

8293
06:36:19,200 --> 06:36:20,638
just check them in a risk register and

8294
06:36:20,638 --> 06:36:23,440
expect that you know risk accepted and

8295
06:36:23,440 --> 06:36:25,040
everything is good enough so the reality

8296
06:36:25,040 --> 06:36:27,120
is you have to work with people you have

8297
06:36:27,120 --> 06:36:28,638
to have difficult conversations you have

8298
06:36:28,638 --> 06:36:30,878
to take the feedback on board and really

8299
06:36:30,878 --> 06:36:32,160
just help them

8300
06:36:32,160 --> 06:36:34,958
so in summary

8301
06:36:34,958 --> 06:36:36,718
in summary

8302
06:36:36,718 --> 06:36:38,478
make sure you've got a really good tool

8303
06:36:38,478 --> 06:36:40,878
start small have realistic expectations

8304
06:36:40,878 --> 06:36:42,558
build a strong culture

8305
06:36:42,558 --> 06:36:44,240
and then that's how you can really make

8306
06:36:44,240 --> 06:36:46,240
threat modeling easy and scalable last

8307
06:36:46,240 --> 06:36:47,760
but not least i just wanted to give a

8308
06:36:47,760 --> 06:36:48,878
really good shout out to some of the

8309
06:36:48,878 --> 06:36:50,958
people if you know them that's cool they

8310
06:36:50,958 --> 06:36:53,040
are still here and they really helped me

8311
06:36:53,040 --> 06:36:55,520
along this journey the last two years so

8312
06:36:55,520 --> 06:36:57,600
if you see them go and say hello

8313
06:36:57,600 --> 06:36:59,040
but yeah that's my story hope you

8314
06:36:59,040 --> 06:37:01,040
enjoyed it and thanks very much for

8315
06:37:01,040 --> 06:37:04,440
listening to me

8316
06:37:08,558 --> 06:37:10,398
awesome thank you tune

8317
06:37:10,398 --> 06:37:12,878
um speaking of threats um what are the

8318
06:37:12,878 --> 06:37:14,718
more common or scarier threats

8319
06:37:14,718 --> 06:37:16,638
especially for those of us who work in

8320
06:37:16,638 --> 06:37:18,000
software development or application

8321
06:37:18,000 --> 06:37:20,240
security um are supply chain or

8322
06:37:20,240 --> 06:37:21,840
dependency

8323
06:37:21,840 --> 06:37:23,760
vulnerabilities so our next speaker is

8324
06:37:23,760 --> 06:37:26,478
going to be talking about just that so

8325
06:37:26,478 --> 06:37:30,730
introducing our next speaker nf

8326
06:37:30,730 --> 06:37:36,540
[Applause]

8327
06:37:40,558 --> 06:37:41,600
cool

8328
06:37:41,600 --> 06:37:43,360
all right um

8329
06:37:43,360 --> 06:37:45,600
so this talks basically about nougat and

8330
06:37:45,600 --> 06:37:47,600
dependency confusion within the nuget

8331
06:37:47,600 --> 06:37:49,760
environments

8332
06:37:49,760 --> 06:37:51,600
during it i'm going to just do some

8333
06:37:51,600 --> 06:37:52,878
quick demonstrations of what the

8334
06:37:52,878 --> 06:37:54,958
exploit's like and also talk about some

8335
06:37:54,958 --> 06:37:57,120
bug bounty experiences i've had uh using

8336
06:37:57,120 --> 06:37:59,520
this particular exploit so my name is

8337
06:37:59,520 --> 06:38:02,718
matt evans or nf i've been doing it for

8338
06:38:02,718 --> 06:38:05,440
about 20 years now uh security probably

8339
06:38:05,440 --> 06:38:07,680
for six and the more important thing is

8340
06:38:07,680 --> 06:38:10,798
apparently i look like beaker here

8341
06:38:10,798 --> 06:38:12,878
this is also how i'm feeling up here at

8342
06:38:12,878 --> 06:38:15,840
the moment so first talk

8343
06:38:15,840 --> 06:38:16,798
so

8344
06:38:16,798 --> 06:38:19,120
the reason i decided to do this talk is

8345
06:38:19,120 --> 06:38:21,760
in february 2001 i read this article

8346
06:38:21,760 --> 06:38:24,080
from alex person

8347
06:38:24,080 --> 06:38:25,920
and as i went through it a lot of what

8348
06:38:25,920 --> 06:38:27,760
he was talking about with the dependency

8349
06:38:27,760 --> 06:38:30,160
confusion attack with an mpm started to

8350
06:38:30,160 --> 06:38:31,520
remind me of some work that i actually

8351
06:38:31,520 --> 06:38:34,000
looked at a couple years ago

8352
06:38:34,000 --> 06:38:34,718
so

8353
06:38:34,718 --> 06:38:36,638
nuget suffers from the same sorts of

8354
06:38:36,638 --> 06:38:38,478
issues but the difference is uh nougat

8355
06:38:38,478 --> 06:38:40,638
doesn't really get talked about so i

8356
06:38:40,638 --> 06:38:42,798
thought i'd actually go through show

8357
06:38:42,798 --> 06:38:44,160
what it's like and

8358
06:38:44,160 --> 06:38:46,240
yeah pretty much bring it to the broader

8359
06:38:46,240 --> 06:38:47,760
attention of people

8360
06:38:47,760 --> 06:38:49,840
so uh first just quickly what's new

8361
06:38:49,840 --> 06:38:53,280
nuget is essentially like npm with uh uh

8362
06:38:53,280 --> 06:38:55,600
sorry npm but for the dot net

8363
06:38:55,600 --> 06:38:58,160
environment so it's package uh system

8364
06:38:58,160 --> 06:39:01,120
it's used widely powershell also uses it

8365
06:39:01,120 --> 06:39:02,320
um

8366
06:39:02,320 --> 06:39:04,558
so the packages themselves are just

8367
06:39:04,558 --> 06:39:06,958
compressed files that contain things

8368
06:39:06,958 --> 06:39:08,958
like your binaries your static content

8369
06:39:08,958 --> 06:39:09,840
um

8370
06:39:09,840 --> 06:39:11,840
in some cases they can contain

8371
06:39:11,840 --> 06:39:13,600
additional build instructions for when

8372
06:39:13,600 --> 06:39:16,160
you bring those packages in

8373
06:39:16,160 --> 06:39:18,878
so this is just what nougat.org looks

8374
06:39:18,878 --> 06:39:21,600
like this is the largest largest package

8375
06:39:21,600 --> 06:39:24,320
repository that's actually used

8376
06:39:24,320 --> 06:39:26,840
as you can see up there

8377
06:39:26,840 --> 06:39:28,638
newtonsoft.json it's got about two

8378
06:39:28,638 --> 06:39:30,320
billion downloads so that's quite a big

8379
06:39:30,320 --> 06:39:32,000
deal

8380
06:39:32,000 --> 06:39:35,040
so what is dependency confusion so the

8381
06:39:35,040 --> 06:39:36,558
the best way to think about is if you

8382
06:39:36,558 --> 06:39:38,240
have an application that's building and

8383
06:39:38,240 --> 06:39:39,440
it's pulling in

8384
06:39:39,440 --> 06:39:41,120
an external package but it's got the

8385
06:39:41,120 --> 06:39:43,520
option to pull in two it gets confused

8386
06:39:43,520 --> 06:39:46,160
so that's that's that's the

8387
06:39:46,160 --> 06:39:48,320
simpler way of thinking another way that

8388
06:39:48,320 --> 06:39:50,000
i like to think of it is um if i'm

8389
06:39:50,000 --> 06:39:51,440
getting off the plane or going to the

8390
06:39:51,440 --> 06:39:53,440
airport and i go to pick up my red bag

8391
06:39:53,440 --> 06:39:54,840
this is what i come

8392
06:39:54,840 --> 06:39:57,360
across going to pick up the wrong one

8393
06:39:57,360 --> 06:40:00,240
probably get something that i don't need

8394
06:40:00,240 --> 06:40:02,638
so what's impacted by this vulnerability

8395
06:40:02,638 --> 06:40:04,398
so it's mostly build environments but

8396
06:40:04,398 --> 06:40:07,040
it's also developer uh like workstations

8397
06:40:07,040 --> 06:40:09,200
in their environments it's

8398
06:40:09,200 --> 06:40:11,920
it's a bigger risk in your cloud um in

8399
06:40:11,920 --> 06:40:13,520
the cloud basically

8400
06:40:13,520 --> 06:40:15,280
due to um some stuff that i'm going to

8401
06:40:15,280 --> 06:40:17,840
talk about briefly

8402
06:40:17,840 --> 06:40:19,520
so

8403
06:40:19,520 --> 06:40:21,680
what what what are the steps or what are

8404
06:40:21,680 --> 06:40:23,920
the requirements for this vulnerability

8405
06:40:23,920 --> 06:40:26,160
so in nuget you've got these things

8406
06:40:26,160 --> 06:40:28,320
called package feeds so the first

8407
06:40:28,320 --> 06:40:30,478
requirement is to be using more than one

8408
06:40:30,478 --> 06:40:32,160
so in this case we've got nuget and then

8409
06:40:32,160 --> 06:40:33,840
we've got a private

8410
06:40:33,840 --> 06:40:34,958
feed here

8411
06:40:34,958 --> 06:40:36,638
the next one would be

8412
06:40:36,638 --> 06:40:39,280
within those feeds a package that is

8413
06:40:39,280 --> 06:40:41,520
used by the application that's being

8414
06:40:41,520 --> 06:40:44,398
built is only in one of the feeds so if

8415
06:40:44,398 --> 06:40:46,320
you look at the bottom here you can see

8416
06:40:46,320 --> 06:40:47,920
nest v7

8417
06:40:47,920 --> 06:40:50,638
so what i would do as an attacker is go

8418
06:40:50,638 --> 06:40:52,000
and have a look to see if it's in both

8419
06:40:52,000 --> 06:40:53,840
feeds and for example

8420
06:40:53,840 --> 06:40:56,080
it's not sitting here in nougat so

8421
06:40:56,080 --> 06:40:57,680
another requirement is

8422
06:40:57,680 --> 06:40:59,200
you need to be able to upload to the

8423
06:40:59,200 --> 06:41:02,000
feed that it doesn't exist in nuget dot

8424
06:41:02,000 --> 06:41:04,398
org is quite easily you know the one

8425
06:41:04,398 --> 06:41:06,160
that we're going to be going for anyone

8426
06:41:06,160 --> 06:41:07,920
can just sign in get an account and

8427
06:41:07,920 --> 06:41:09,040
actually

8428
06:41:09,040 --> 06:41:11,360
upload a package that they want

8429
06:41:11,360 --> 06:41:13,360
there is one last condition

8430
06:41:13,360 --> 06:41:16,000
nuget is really iffy in the way it works

8431
06:41:16,000 --> 06:41:17,920
with packages so

8432
06:41:17,920 --> 06:41:19,360
when it's pulling down packages from

8433
06:41:19,360 --> 06:41:21,680
multiple feeds it's a race condition the

8434
06:41:21,680 --> 06:41:23,840
fastest package that's responding is the

8435
06:41:23,840 --> 06:41:26,240
one that will get pulled down so when

8436
06:41:26,240 --> 06:41:28,080
you're working with cloud you may have

8437
06:41:28,080 --> 06:41:30,798
packages sitting somewhere in azure but

8438
06:41:30,798 --> 06:41:32,558
generally nougat.org is going to be

8439
06:41:32,558 --> 06:41:34,160
faster because it's just built to be

8440
06:41:34,160 --> 06:41:37,520
faster for the ecosystem

8441
06:41:37,520 --> 06:41:39,520
so i'm quickly going to go through and

8442
06:41:39,520 --> 06:41:40,320
do

8443
06:41:40,320 --> 06:41:42,798
and show what the demonstration of this

8444
06:41:42,798 --> 06:41:44,718
particular vulnerability looks like but

8445
06:41:44,718 --> 06:41:46,320
beforehand i'm just going to talk about

8446
06:41:46,320 --> 06:41:48,958
the actual payload that i use so this is

8447
06:41:48,958 --> 06:41:49,840
a

8448
06:41:49,840 --> 06:41:52,080
net.target file this is

8449
06:41:52,080 --> 06:41:53,920
a file that allows you to add additional

8450
06:41:53,920 --> 06:41:55,600
build instructions

8451
06:41:55,600 --> 06:41:57,440
this particular file's got some embedded

8452
06:41:57,440 --> 06:41:59,040
code and all that code is doing is

8453
06:41:59,040 --> 06:42:00,558
making a dns

8454
06:42:00,558 --> 06:42:02,798
call to a server that i set up so during

8455
06:42:02,798 --> 06:42:05,200
the uh the demo that i'm going to play

8456
06:42:05,200 --> 06:42:07,360
you'll see uh just some dns requests

8457
06:42:07,360 --> 06:42:09,520
proving that this is actually executed

8458
06:42:09,520 --> 06:42:10,798
the other thing is

8459
06:42:10,798 --> 06:42:12,638
with these

8460
06:42:12,638 --> 06:42:14,240
target files you can set up when they

8461
06:42:14,240 --> 06:42:16,478
execute so this is not executing when

8462
06:42:16,478 --> 06:42:18,240
the package is installed but on the

8463
06:42:18,240 --> 06:42:21,120
pre-build event of the application being

8464
06:42:21,120 --> 06:42:24,520
built itself

8465
06:42:31,200 --> 06:42:32,160
so

8466
06:42:32,160 --> 06:42:35,280
the way that this has been set up is um

8467
06:42:35,280 --> 06:42:37,200
to do the live demonstration i'd

8468
06:42:37,200 --> 06:42:39,520
actually have to push a nougat package

8469
06:42:39,520 --> 06:42:41,600
up but nougat actually has like a 10 to

8470
06:42:41,600 --> 06:42:44,160
30 minute time before a package becomes

8471
06:42:44,160 --> 06:42:46,638
available in a feed so i

8472
06:42:46,638 --> 06:42:48,638
pre-loaded the package and in this

8473
06:42:48,638 --> 06:42:50,320
demonstration

8474
06:42:50,320 --> 06:42:52,638
i've also got a set my secondary feed

8475
06:42:52,638 --> 06:42:54,240
which is showing here

8476
06:42:54,240 --> 06:42:56,558
just my get and this is the happy

8477
06:42:56,558 --> 06:42:58,638
package this is the one that we want to

8478
06:42:58,638 --> 06:43:00,798
run

8479
06:43:04,558 --> 06:43:06,240
so that's the bad package sitting on

8480
06:43:06,240 --> 06:43:07,920
nuget that's not what we're going to get

8481
06:43:07,920 --> 06:43:09,280
initially

8482
06:43:09,280 --> 06:43:10,240
what this

8483
06:43:10,240 --> 06:43:11,280
what this

8484
06:43:11,280 --> 06:43:13,520
uh right here this is the

8485
06:43:13,520 --> 06:43:14,798
feeds that we're actually going to use

8486
06:43:14,798 --> 06:43:16,558
and this is just a basic application

8487
06:43:16,558 --> 06:43:18,320
that is pulling in that

8488
06:43:18,320 --> 06:43:20,878
xamarin lives quick on uh package that i

8489
06:43:20,878 --> 06:43:22,320
set up previously

8490
06:43:22,320 --> 06:43:24,478
so all we're going to do here is run the

8491
06:43:24,478 --> 06:43:28,397
happy path this is a good package

8492
06:43:29,760 --> 06:43:31,360
and you can see it's pulling down from

8493
06:43:31,360 --> 06:43:33,520
nougat now the important thing to note

8494
06:43:33,520 --> 06:43:35,600
i'm sorry it's pulling down from my get

8495
06:43:35,600 --> 06:43:37,040
uh the important thing to note is the

8496
06:43:37,040 --> 06:43:39,120
actual timings here so to pull down the

8497
06:43:39,120 --> 06:43:40,878
actual package it's taken 300

8498
06:43:40,878 --> 06:43:43,280
milliseconds essentially

8499
06:43:43,280 --> 06:43:46,160
now we do the build

8500
06:43:46,958 --> 06:43:48,000
now

8501
06:43:48,000 --> 06:43:50,000
this piece here is just the end point

8502
06:43:50,000 --> 06:43:53,760
that is monitoring for any dns calls

8503
06:43:53,760 --> 06:43:56,240
and so i've checked no dns calls that

8504
06:43:56,240 --> 06:43:57,760
was the happy path

8505
06:43:57,760 --> 06:44:00,000
so next we're going to use the malicious

8506
06:44:00,000 --> 06:44:02,878
package so we add the feed that's had

8507
06:44:02,878 --> 06:44:07,000
the package pre-loaded up

8508
06:44:08,160 --> 06:44:10,798
we clear the nuget cache

8509
06:44:10,798 --> 06:44:13,120
we do a restore

8510
06:44:13,120 --> 06:44:14,718
and you can see that's already pulling

8511
06:44:14,718 --> 06:44:16,240
in a whole lot of different packages

8512
06:44:16,240 --> 06:44:17,840
compared to the myget one so it's

8513
06:44:17,840 --> 06:44:21,638
because it's going off to nougat

8514
06:44:27,760 --> 06:44:29,600
the next thing to note is at the bottom

8515
06:44:29,600 --> 06:44:32,000
it's actually taken 10 milliseconds

8516
06:44:32,000 --> 06:44:34,000
compared to the 300 so that's why the

8517
06:44:34,000 --> 06:44:36,958
race conditions there generally new gets

8518
06:44:36,958 --> 06:44:38,638
always going to be faster unless your

8519
06:44:38,638 --> 06:44:40,080
build server's right next to your

8520
06:44:40,080 --> 06:44:42,878
repository

8521
06:44:44,240 --> 06:44:46,478
so that's the package being restored but

8522
06:44:46,478 --> 06:44:48,718
we haven't done the build yet

8523
06:44:48,718 --> 06:44:51,520
that's just the target file

8524
06:44:51,520 --> 06:44:55,760
that was used same dns entries

8525
06:44:55,920 --> 06:44:59,280
and now we build the solution

8526
06:44:59,360 --> 06:45:01,040
so now that's built that malicious code

8527
06:45:01,040 --> 06:45:02,478
should have executed

8528
06:45:02,478 --> 06:45:04,798
we go back to well we will go back to

8529
06:45:04,798 --> 06:45:06,080
that dns

8530
06:45:06,080 --> 06:45:08,080
server

8531
06:45:08,080 --> 06:45:10,638
we check for any entries

8532
06:45:10,638 --> 06:45:12,240
and we can see that the request has been

8533
06:45:12,240 --> 06:45:15,240
made

8534
06:45:21,360 --> 06:45:24,398
and i've lost my place

8535
06:45:24,718 --> 06:45:27,360
oh there we go

8536
06:45:27,440 --> 06:45:28,320
cool

8537
06:45:28,320 --> 06:45:30,558
so using that vulnerability

8538
06:45:30,558 --> 06:45:32,398
i've actually done a couple of bug

8539
06:45:32,398 --> 06:45:34,320
bounties just during covert so i'm just

8540
06:45:34,320 --> 06:45:35,680
going to talk about

8541
06:45:35,680 --> 06:45:38,000
what they were and the particular uh use

8542
06:45:38,000 --> 06:45:39,760
cases that they were so the first one

8543
06:45:39,760 --> 06:45:42,557
was jetbrains

8544
06:45:42,958 --> 06:45:44,798
what we're looking at here is it's got

8545
06:45:44,798 --> 06:45:47,360
three feeds and we can see the ones that

8546
06:45:47,360 --> 06:45:49,600
are highlighted is this unic test libs

8547
06:45:49,600 --> 06:45:51,760
so the piece of code at the bottom is

8548
06:45:51,760 --> 06:45:53,360
that the package that they're using but

8549
06:45:53,360 --> 06:45:55,360
the interesting case here is they were

8550
06:45:55,360 --> 06:45:57,760
actually dynamically building their

8551
06:45:57,760 --> 06:46:00,160
application and code as part of the test

8552
06:46:00,160 --> 06:46:03,200
for this uh resharper unity extension so

8553
06:46:03,200 --> 06:46:06,080
when that was executing um

8554
06:46:06,080 --> 06:46:08,398
it wasn't in a normal build environment

8555
06:46:08,398 --> 06:46:10,000
but because they're still using the same

8556
06:46:10,000 --> 06:46:11,920
mechanism such as the

8557
06:46:11,920 --> 06:46:15,360
feeds and the nuget restore on this code

8558
06:46:15,360 --> 06:46:16,398
that they're

8559
06:46:16,398 --> 06:46:18,080
building here i was able to get code

8560
06:46:18,080 --> 06:46:20,638
execution

8561
06:46:22,558 --> 06:46:24,638
then there was octopus deploy so this

8562
06:46:24,638 --> 06:46:27,600
was a different use case so

8563
06:46:27,600 --> 06:46:30,958
there's a concept on yougo.org it's

8564
06:46:30,958 --> 06:46:33,760
prefixes so for example if you register

8565
06:46:33,760 --> 06:46:35,520
a prefix no one else can actually upload

8566
06:46:35,520 --> 06:46:38,240
a package with that prefix

8567
06:46:38,240 --> 06:46:39,920
the best example would be like a

8568
06:46:39,920 --> 06:46:42,240
microsoft no one cannot upload packages

8569
06:46:42,240 --> 06:46:44,878
with microsoft dot whatever because that

8570
06:46:44,878 --> 06:46:48,240
prefix is owned by microsoft

8571
06:46:48,240 --> 06:46:50,958
so in the case of octopus deploy their

8572
06:46:50,958 --> 06:46:53,280
prefix is octopus you can see that it's

8573
06:46:53,280 --> 06:46:54,478
registered

8574
06:46:54,478 --> 06:46:56,320
i went through some of the source code

8575
06:46:56,320 --> 06:46:57,840
on github

8576
06:46:57,840 --> 06:46:59,600
had a look at a couple of these packages

8577
06:46:59,600 --> 06:47:00,320
and

8578
06:47:00,320 --> 06:47:02,000
just ran a script just to check if they

8579
06:47:02,000 --> 06:47:03,520
were registered

8580
06:47:03,520 --> 06:47:06,398
and apparently they weren't so with that

8581
06:47:06,398 --> 06:47:08,840
information i was able to go and

8582
06:47:08,840 --> 06:47:11,040
register um

8583
06:47:11,040 --> 06:47:13,760
seven packages belonging to octopus and

8584
06:47:13,760 --> 06:47:16,080
just drop in some payloads just to do

8585
06:47:16,080 --> 06:47:18,398
some dns calls and provide information

8586
06:47:18,398 --> 06:47:20,958
back to them so that you can actually do

8587
06:47:20,958 --> 06:47:22,958
that so that was um for whatever reason

8588
06:47:22,958 --> 06:47:25,280
their prefix and nuget.org was not

8589
06:47:25,280 --> 06:47:28,160
registered correctly

8590
06:47:28,240 --> 06:47:29,200
so

8591
06:47:29,200 --> 06:47:30,558
elastic

8592
06:47:30,558 --> 06:47:32,878
they had a mitigation in place already

8593
06:47:32,878 --> 06:47:34,558
um but we're going to see that the

8594
06:47:34,558 --> 06:47:36,398
mitigation

8595
06:47:36,398 --> 06:47:39,280
had to deal with the people element

8596
06:47:39,280 --> 06:47:41,760
so uh what you can do is with your

8597
06:47:41,760 --> 06:47:43,440
packages you can use something called a

8598
06:47:43,440 --> 06:47:46,080
packages.log file and what that does is

8599
06:47:46,080 --> 06:47:48,398
it takes a hash of the packages that

8600
06:47:48,398 --> 06:47:50,000
you're going to be using or you've

8601
06:47:50,000 --> 06:47:50,798
already

8602
06:47:50,798 --> 06:47:52,878
pre-built so that when you try and

8603
06:47:52,878 --> 06:47:54,798
rebuild again if any of those hashes

8604
06:47:54,798 --> 06:47:57,360
changed or have changed the build will

8605
06:47:57,360 --> 06:47:59,200
actually break so

8606
06:47:59,200 --> 06:48:01,280
if you've been a developer and the build

8607
06:48:01,280 --> 06:48:02,798
breaks and you're trying to get work

8608
06:48:02,798 --> 06:48:04,558
through one of the first things you do

8609
06:48:04,558 --> 06:48:05,840
is you check to see if you can just get

8610
06:48:05,840 --> 06:48:08,240
it working again in this case they

8611
06:48:08,240 --> 06:48:10,718
regenerated the package lock file

8612
06:48:10,718 --> 06:48:11,920
so

8613
06:48:11,920 --> 06:48:14,080
because this is now

8614
06:48:14,080 --> 06:48:16,320
working with my malicious package

8615
06:48:16,320 --> 06:48:18,478
i was able to get code execution again

8616
06:48:18,478 --> 06:48:21,840
within their build environment

8617
06:48:24,558 --> 06:48:25,600
the last

8618
06:48:25,600 --> 06:48:27,200
smaller examples are just some stuff

8619
06:48:27,200 --> 06:48:28,878
from microsoft

8620
06:48:28,878 --> 06:48:31,200
so the first one is extremely popular

8621
06:48:31,200 --> 06:48:32,958
power bi powershell

8622
06:48:32,958 --> 06:48:35,600
application so this is interesting

8623
06:48:35,600 --> 06:48:36,478
because

8624
06:48:36,478 --> 06:48:38,240
while they were using nuget they're also

8625
06:48:38,240 --> 06:48:40,558
using powershell.gallery as one of the

8626
06:48:40,558 --> 06:48:41,478
feeds

8627
06:48:41,478 --> 06:48:44,080
powershell.gallery is normally

8628
06:48:44,080 --> 06:48:45,120
excuse me

8629
06:48:45,120 --> 06:48:47,360
powershell.gallery is used to host

8630
06:48:47,360 --> 06:48:49,360
powershell scripts and and store modules

8631
06:48:49,360 --> 06:48:51,120
and not normally um

8632
06:48:51,120 --> 06:48:52,798
the same sort of packages as you would

8633
06:48:52,798 --> 06:48:54,958
expect as nougat however powershell

8634
06:48:54,958 --> 06:48:56,798
gallery is built on top of the new get

8635
06:48:56,798 --> 06:48:58,798
technology which means if you've got a

8636
06:48:58,798 --> 06:49:00,638
um a feed like this you're actually

8637
06:49:00,638 --> 06:49:03,120
introducing

8638
06:49:03,120 --> 06:49:05,360
dependency confusion so in this case

8639
06:49:05,360 --> 06:49:08,080
that bottom package platy ps is just a

8640
06:49:08,080 --> 06:49:10,718
powershell package

8641
06:49:10,718 --> 06:49:12,478
so while it was registered on powershell

8642
06:49:12,478 --> 06:49:14,160
gallery it wasn't registered on

8643
06:49:14,160 --> 06:49:17,200
nuget.org so again it's a case of just

8644
06:49:17,200 --> 06:49:19,840
changing uploading a package and because

8645
06:49:19,840 --> 06:49:21,920
you get is faster than powershell

8646
06:49:21,920 --> 06:49:24,000
gallery that race condition gets you

8647
06:49:24,000 --> 06:49:26,000
code execution

8648
06:49:26,000 --> 06:49:27,920
so

8649
06:49:27,920 --> 06:49:30,398
for this microsoft gave me nada

8650
06:49:30,398 --> 06:49:32,558
um nothing not it's not worth it

8651
06:49:32,558 --> 06:49:33,680
apparently

8652
06:49:33,680 --> 06:49:35,680
um the next one

8653
06:49:35,680 --> 06:49:38,320
slightly more interesting so the

8654
06:49:38,320 --> 06:49:40,478
powershell source code

8655
06:49:40,478 --> 06:49:41,440
so

8656
06:49:41,440 --> 06:49:43,440
again they're using powershell.gallery

8657
06:49:43,440 --> 06:49:45,440
but they've got a private feed for

8658
06:49:45,440 --> 06:49:47,280
additional packages

8659
06:49:47,280 --> 06:49:49,200
what's more interesting is this ps

8660
06:49:49,200 --> 06:49:51,920
desired state configuration is quite an

8661
06:49:51,920 --> 06:49:54,000
important package and it had not been

8662
06:49:54,000 --> 06:49:56,478
registered on ps gallery this is used

8663
06:49:56,478 --> 06:49:58,558
for dcs stuff if you've done devops

8664
06:49:58,558 --> 06:50:00,080
you've probably used this in powershell

8665
06:50:00,080 --> 06:50:02,080
in the last five years

8666
06:50:02,080 --> 06:50:04,240
because that wasn't registered again i

8667
06:50:04,240 --> 06:50:07,440
was able to upload to this and this time

8668
06:50:07,440 --> 06:50:10,478
it was on powershell.gallery

8669
06:50:10,478 --> 06:50:12,558
after this bug bounty uh you can see at

8670
06:50:12,558 --> 06:50:14,398
the bottom that is roughly when they um

8671
06:50:14,398 --> 06:50:17,360
took over the gallery from me

8672
06:50:17,360 --> 06:50:18,478
so

8673
06:50:18,478 --> 06:50:19,760
for this one

8674
06:50:19,760 --> 06:50:23,160
i got a sticker

8675
06:50:28,878 --> 06:50:32,160
that's much better than money

8676
06:50:32,398 --> 06:50:34,478
um and the last one probably not as

8677
06:50:34,478 --> 06:50:37,600
interesting um azure so

8678
06:50:37,600 --> 06:50:40,320
i managed to get a code execution on the

8679
06:50:40,320 --> 06:50:42,240
azure function host which apparently is

8680
06:50:42,240 --> 06:50:45,600
what all their zur functions sit on

8681
06:50:45,600 --> 06:50:46,558
so

8682
06:50:46,558 --> 06:50:48,718
if we look at there you get feed you can

8683
06:50:48,718 --> 06:50:51,280
see you know again lots of internal ones

8684
06:50:51,280 --> 06:50:52,080
but

8685
06:50:52,080 --> 06:50:55,360
at the very top nougat.org

8686
06:50:55,360 --> 06:50:56,240
so

8687
06:50:56,240 --> 06:50:58,320
while most of their packages looked fine

8688
06:50:58,320 --> 06:51:00,478
there was this one that was just an

8689
06:51:00,478 --> 06:51:02,798
outlier this app insights dot test

8690
06:51:02,798 --> 06:51:05,199
logger

8691
06:51:05,280 --> 06:51:06,240
this is

8692
06:51:06,240 --> 06:51:07,840
this this shouldn't have been in there

8693
06:51:07,840 --> 06:51:09,200
at all um

8694
06:51:09,200 --> 06:51:11,520
so this is a package that all it was

8695
06:51:11,520 --> 06:51:13,200
doing was when they were running their

8696
06:51:13,200 --> 06:51:15,680
build it would just give an update um on

8697
06:51:15,680 --> 06:51:17,920
how long it took to at bayer

8698
06:51:17,920 --> 06:51:19,600
even though they weren't using at vaya

8699
06:51:19,600 --> 06:51:20,958
at the time

8700
06:51:20,958 --> 06:51:22,558
so this this thing had been sitting

8701
06:51:22,558 --> 06:51:25,120
around in my uh github for five years uh

8702
06:51:25,120 --> 06:51:26,958
no one had touched it

8703
06:51:26,958 --> 06:51:28,160
um

8704
06:51:28,160 --> 06:51:30,080
yeah

8705
06:51:30,080 --> 06:51:32,558
so managed to actually uh

8706
06:51:32,558 --> 06:51:34,958
upload that get some code execution and

8707
06:51:34,958 --> 06:51:36,638
azure

8708
06:51:36,638 --> 06:51:38,958
uh sorry in the azure build for this

8709
06:51:38,958 --> 06:51:40,240
function host

8710
06:51:40,240 --> 06:51:44,000
uh for this one i got a pair of socks

8711
06:51:44,000 --> 06:51:47,040
actually this was within scope so um

8712
06:51:47,040 --> 06:51:48,398
this was a

8713
06:51:48,398 --> 06:51:51,120
a big payout so yeah but i think the

8714
06:51:51,120 --> 06:51:53,280
upwards of the azure

8715
06:51:53,280 --> 06:51:54,878
bounties at the time was roughly about

8716
06:51:54,878 --> 06:51:57,760
40 grand so i got somewhere close to

8717
06:51:57,760 --> 06:52:00,478
that but not quite

8718
06:52:00,478 --> 06:52:01,520
so

8719
06:52:01,520 --> 06:52:02,958
there are mitigations for this there's

8720
06:52:02,958 --> 06:52:04,478
lots of them uh

8721
06:52:04,478 --> 06:52:06,958
i would say the best one if you can do

8722
06:52:06,958 --> 06:52:08,798
it is the bottom one just use a single

8723
06:52:08,798 --> 06:52:11,360
nuget feed just eliminates the issues

8724
06:52:11,360 --> 06:52:13,120
the problem is you have got operational

8725
06:52:13,120 --> 06:52:14,798
overhead because you need someone to go

8726
06:52:14,798 --> 06:52:16,398
in and curate that and make sure that

8727
06:52:16,398 --> 06:52:17,680
the package being pulled aren't

8728
06:52:17,680 --> 06:52:20,558
malicious themselves

8729
06:52:20,558 --> 06:52:22,080
there is another

8730
06:52:22,080 --> 06:52:23,120
uh so

8731
06:52:23,120 --> 06:52:24,320
sorry

8732
06:52:24,320 --> 06:52:27,040
register uh the packages on nugets the

8733
06:52:27,040 --> 06:52:28,638
the prefix if you're going to use them

8734
06:52:28,638 --> 06:52:31,680
so if you're building internal packages

8735
06:52:31,680 --> 06:52:33,600
just you can register the prefix without

8736
06:52:33,600 --> 06:52:35,200
uploading your packages it's just

8737
06:52:35,200 --> 06:52:37,200
another way to protect yourself

8738
06:52:37,200 --> 06:52:40,000
i would avoid the package.lock.json file

8739
06:52:40,000 --> 06:52:42,080
it just seems brittle

8740
06:52:42,080 --> 06:52:42,878
i

8741
06:52:42,878 --> 06:52:45,360
it causes a lot of overhead

8742
06:52:45,360 --> 06:52:47,680
and the nugets actually introduced

8743
06:52:47,680 --> 06:52:50,160
something specifically for dependency

8744
06:52:50,160 --> 06:52:51,520
confusion

8745
06:52:51,520 --> 06:52:54,398
and that's source pinning

8746
06:52:54,398 --> 06:52:56,958
so with source printing all you do is

8747
06:52:56,958 --> 06:52:58,878
you get your feeds so you can see those

8748
06:52:58,878 --> 06:53:00,478
top two ones and you can actually

8749
06:53:00,478 --> 06:53:02,558
specify which feed to pull the packages

8750
06:53:02,558 --> 06:53:05,760
from so yeah

8751
06:53:05,760 --> 06:53:08,478
cool um that's all

8752
06:53:08,478 --> 06:53:11,798
hope you enjoy

8753
06:53:16,000 --> 06:53:17,520
thanks very much

8754
06:53:17,520 --> 06:53:19,360
right uh it's afternoon break time we're

8755
06:53:19,360 --> 06:53:20,878
running a little bit behind schedule so

8756
06:53:20,878 --> 06:53:22,320
we'll push the break out to i don't know

8757
06:53:22,320 --> 06:53:25,040
maybe 4 20. uh so we'll see you back

8758
06:53:25,040 --> 06:53:26,320
then uh we are going to need you to

8759
06:53:26,320 --> 06:53:27,440
clear the auditorium just because we

8760
06:53:27,440 --> 06:53:28,638
have a little bit of setup to do for the

8761
06:53:28,638 --> 06:53:30,958
next you know last three set of talks so

8762
06:53:30,958 --> 06:53:32,878
go forth fresh air

8763
06:53:32,878 --> 06:53:37,320
and see you back here at 4 20.

8764
07:30:50,878 --> 07:30:53,280
all right good afternoon welcome back

8765
07:30:53,280 --> 07:30:56,240
final segment of kawaiicon 2.

8766
07:30:56,240 --> 07:30:58,558
now our next speaker

8767
07:30:58,558 --> 07:31:00,878
is actually one of my colleagues at

8768
07:31:00,878 --> 07:31:04,000
cyber cx and he runs our hardware

8769
07:31:04,000 --> 07:31:06,478
hacking team uh we're increasingly doing

8770
07:31:06,478 --> 07:31:08,080
work where you know with internet of

8771
07:31:08,080 --> 07:31:10,160
things devices and embedded systems and

8772
07:31:10,160 --> 07:31:12,000
scatter and control systems you know

8773
07:31:12,000 --> 07:31:13,520
where the integration and the

8774
07:31:13,520 --> 07:31:15,520
intersection between hardware

8775
07:31:15,520 --> 07:31:17,120
opera embedded operating system

8776
07:31:17,120 --> 07:31:19,040
applications running on a better systems

8777
07:31:19,040 --> 07:31:20,798
is super important and being able to uh

8778
07:31:20,798 --> 07:31:22,958
you know explore and use those in a

8779
07:31:22,958 --> 07:31:25,600
blended manner is increasingly important

8780
07:31:25,600 --> 07:31:27,680
so ben's are really really passionate

8781
07:31:27,680 --> 07:31:29,360
about this subject and really the wants

8782
07:31:29,360 --> 07:31:31,760
to help you all get into hack and

8783
07:31:31,760 --> 07:31:33,360
hardware so

8784
07:31:33,360 --> 07:31:35,120
i hope you enjoy his talk please welcome

8785
07:31:35,120 --> 07:31:38,000
mr ben knight

8786
07:31:40,798 --> 07:31:44,039
dear middle

8787
07:31:45,120 --> 07:31:47,040
hi everyone

8788
07:31:47,040 --> 07:31:48,798
um so as

8789
07:31:48,798 --> 07:31:50,318
middle said um

8790
07:31:50,318 --> 07:31:52,958
i'm ben working at cyber cx

8791
07:31:52,958 --> 07:31:54,798
um first of all thanks for sticking

8792
07:31:54,798 --> 07:31:56,798
around uh i appreciate you know it's day

8793
07:31:56,798 --> 07:31:58,878
two it's the afternoon

8794
07:31:58,878 --> 07:32:00,318
um

8795
07:32:00,318 --> 07:32:01,520
by the way

8796
07:32:01,520 --> 07:32:04,398
did anyone notice the crazy weird

8797
07:32:04,398 --> 07:32:06,000
flashing light

8798
07:32:06,000 --> 07:32:07,920
maybe there's something something there

8799
07:32:07,920 --> 07:32:09,360
saying to keep an eye

8800
07:32:09,360 --> 07:32:10,840
something to think

8801
07:32:10,840 --> 07:32:14,558
about so a lot of you may recognize it

8802
07:32:14,558 --> 07:32:15,520
from

8803
07:32:15,520 --> 07:32:16,958
the internet

8804
07:32:16,958 --> 07:32:19,200
from the i.t crowd so if there's anyone

8805
07:32:19,200 --> 07:32:20,878
in the audience that doesn't recognize

8806
07:32:20,878 --> 07:32:25,240
us here's some context for you

8807
07:32:29,680 --> 07:32:32,680
uh

8808
07:32:45,920 --> 07:32:48,318
so now i've got the internet

8809
07:32:48,318 --> 07:32:51,360
and as middle said i'm a hardware hacker

8810
07:32:51,360 --> 07:32:54,558
so how what could go wrong

8811
07:32:54,558 --> 07:32:58,000
so um kiwi con 3 was the first security

8812
07:32:58,000 --> 07:33:00,000
conference there i attended

8813
07:33:00,000 --> 07:33:01,680
it was also the same

8814
07:33:01,680 --> 07:33:02,958
kiwi con

8815
07:33:02,958 --> 07:33:05,760
when this infamous poster

8816
07:33:05,760 --> 07:33:07,920
came out this this post is probably in a

8817
07:33:07,920 --> 07:33:09,520
bunch of your offices printed out

8818
07:33:09,520 --> 07:33:10,478
somewhere

8819
07:33:10,478 --> 07:33:12,718
um so i just want to say you know i feel

8820
07:33:12,718 --> 07:33:14,478
very privileged to get to speak to you

8821
07:33:14,478 --> 07:33:18,240
all today um so i i set sort of security

8822
07:33:18,240 --> 07:33:20,478
adjacent for a number of years in

8823
07:33:20,478 --> 07:33:22,718
forensics roles

8824
07:33:22,718 --> 07:33:24,240
and i

8825
07:33:24,240 --> 07:33:26,000
started working at insomnia just over

8826
07:33:26,000 --> 07:33:28,878
five years ago now cyber cx

8827
07:33:28,878 --> 07:33:31,520
and also as middle introduced

8828
07:33:31,520 --> 07:33:32,558
i'm now

8829
07:33:32,558 --> 07:33:34,558
kind of leading the hardware iot and

8830
07:33:34,558 --> 07:33:36,638
beta system side of our pen testing

8831
07:33:36,638 --> 07:33:39,039
service

8832
07:33:40,398 --> 07:33:43,120
so i wanted to make just a small

8833
07:33:43,120 --> 07:33:45,760
change to this infamous poster that's

8834
07:33:45,760 --> 07:33:47,600
relevant to us here talking about

8835
07:33:47,600 --> 07:33:50,318
hardware so your hacker's going to hack

8836
07:33:50,318 --> 07:33:54,160
they're going to hack your hardware

8837
07:33:56,718 --> 07:33:58,080
so

8838
07:33:58,080 --> 07:34:01,520
why does hardware hacking matter well

8839
07:34:01,520 --> 07:34:05,200
hardware is your attack surface

8840
07:34:05,200 --> 07:34:07,600
you know you're a hacker might be

8841
07:34:07,600 --> 07:34:10,080
interested in extracting sensitive

8842
07:34:10,080 --> 07:34:11,920
information off your device

8843
07:34:11,920 --> 07:34:13,680
or maybe

8844
07:34:13,680 --> 07:34:15,520
they want to

8845
07:34:15,520 --> 07:34:17,600
sort of leverage it to gain access to

8846
07:34:17,600 --> 07:34:20,398
something that the device can do

8847
07:34:20,398 --> 07:34:22,718
but ultimately

8848
07:34:22,718 --> 07:34:25,040
hardware hacking is a means to opening

8849
07:34:25,040 --> 07:34:27,280
up the black box you know to understand

8850
07:34:27,280 --> 07:34:28,958
how something works

8851
07:34:28,958 --> 07:34:31,280
um to get to sort of as a parallel

8852
07:34:31,280 --> 07:34:33,600
example like a web application right

8853
07:34:33,600 --> 07:34:35,280
what is the attack surface of a web

8854
07:34:35,280 --> 07:34:37,920
application well it's the application

8855
07:34:37,920 --> 07:34:40,798
you talk to on a network socket you use

8856
07:34:40,798 --> 07:34:42,958
some tools like burp suite or even your

8857
07:34:42,958 --> 07:34:45,200
browser to find vulnerabilities in the

8858
07:34:45,200 --> 07:34:46,398
application

8859
07:34:46,398 --> 07:34:48,160
when it comes to hacking a device that

8860
07:34:48,160 --> 07:34:49,680
black box

8861
07:34:49,680 --> 07:34:51,280
the the hardware is the thing that

8862
07:34:51,280 --> 07:34:53,040
you're going to leverage to find some

8863
07:34:53,040 --> 07:34:55,520
sweet vulnerabilities so

8864
07:34:55,520 --> 07:34:58,958
to paraphrase joe fitzpatrick who for

8865
07:34:58,958 --> 07:35:00,240
those in the audience that don't know

8866
07:35:00,240 --> 07:35:02,318
he's a sort of well-known well-respected

8867
07:35:02,318 --> 07:35:04,318
hardware hacker he says something along

8868
07:35:04,318 --> 07:35:06,478
the lines of

8869
07:35:06,478 --> 07:35:09,760
today's hardware exploited issues

8870
07:35:09,760 --> 07:35:11,520
uh tomorrow's remote software

8871
07:35:11,520 --> 07:35:13,520
vulnerabilities you know it's this first

8872
07:35:13,520 --> 07:35:14,398
step

8873
07:35:14,398 --> 07:35:16,160
uh to really understand how something

8874
07:35:16,160 --> 07:35:20,000
works and define those vulnerabilities

8875
07:35:20,000 --> 07:35:22,080
but as we've also seen

8876
07:35:22,080 --> 07:35:25,200
um hardware attacks can be automated um

8877
07:35:25,200 --> 07:35:27,680
with you know jigs specific to a thing

8878
07:35:27,680 --> 07:35:30,638
or in the game industry we see a lot of

8879
07:35:30,638 --> 07:35:31,920
mod chips

8880
07:35:31,920 --> 07:35:34,318
that are able to replicate uh pretty

8881
07:35:34,318 --> 07:35:36,000
advanced attacks so things like the

8882
07:35:36,000 --> 07:35:37,680
nintendo switch

8883
07:35:37,680 --> 07:35:40,240
and the xbox 360 both had sort of cpu

8884
07:35:40,240 --> 07:35:42,878
glitch style attacks and it's just a

8885
07:35:42,878 --> 07:35:44,398
matter of soldering up some bits to the

8886
07:35:44,398 --> 07:35:47,840
right board and off you go

8887
07:35:48,478 --> 07:35:51,200
so you might get lucky um you know maybe

8888
07:35:51,200 --> 07:35:52,798
you get a firmware update image you

8889
07:35:52,798 --> 07:35:54,798
downloaded from the internet for the the

8890
07:35:54,798 --> 07:35:57,280
device you're looking at um but more

8891
07:35:57,280 --> 07:35:58,878
often than not you know it's encrypted

8892
07:35:58,878 --> 07:36:01,280
or or even more often than not they just

8893
07:36:01,280 --> 07:36:03,520
don't provide that so you know you you

8894
07:36:03,520 --> 07:36:05,760
need to open up the device to to get

8895
07:36:05,760 --> 07:36:08,717
that visibility

8896
07:36:08,798 --> 07:36:10,240
so when you think of hardware hacking

8897
07:36:10,240 --> 07:36:11,920
you might think of something like this

8898
07:36:11,920 --> 07:36:14,558
so this is actually a photo i took just

8899
07:36:14,558 --> 07:36:16,080
a few days ago

8900
07:36:16,080 --> 07:36:18,638
of me trying to dump this flashy brom

8901
07:36:18,638 --> 07:36:20,878
from 1999

8902
07:36:20,878 --> 07:36:23,520
so i didn't have a socket that the

8903
07:36:23,520 --> 07:36:25,360
chip would sit into so i was kind of

8904
07:36:25,360 --> 07:36:26,718
left to

8905
07:36:26,718 --> 07:36:28,398
solder a bunch of magnet wire to all the

8906
07:36:28,398 --> 07:36:30,558
pins break it out to a breadboard

8907
07:36:30,558 --> 07:36:32,718
connect it to an arduino so

8908
07:36:32,718 --> 07:36:34,958
um you know

8909
07:36:34,958 --> 07:36:37,360
sometimes hardware hacking looks like

8910
07:36:37,360 --> 07:36:39,360
this it looks complicated you know it's

8911
07:36:39,360 --> 07:36:42,000
probably akin to say you know in

8912
07:36:42,000 --> 07:36:43,520
hollywood movies where they got the

8913
07:36:43,520 --> 07:36:46,318
scrolling text you know some program

8914
07:36:46,318 --> 07:36:48,398
codes you know it looks scary it looks

8915
07:36:48,398 --> 07:36:50,638
confusing it looks intimidating

8916
07:36:50,638 --> 07:36:52,478
but what i want to show you here today

8917
07:36:52,478 --> 07:36:54,398
is hardware hacking doesn't need to be

8918
07:36:54,398 --> 07:36:56,478
scary and intimidating it doesn't need

8919
07:36:56,478 --> 07:36:58,000
to be full of wires you know with the

8920
07:36:58,000 --> 07:36:59,600
right tools you can actually achieve

8921
07:36:59,600 --> 07:37:01,760
quite a bit and just understanding the

8922
07:37:01,760 --> 07:37:04,160
different interfaces that you are

8923
07:37:04,160 --> 07:37:06,160
potentially going to

8924
07:37:06,160 --> 07:37:09,600
sort of find as you open something up

8925
07:37:09,600 --> 07:37:10,558
also

8926
07:37:10,558 --> 07:37:12,638
you don't need to be an expert in

8927
07:37:12,638 --> 07:37:14,478
electronics to do hardware hacking i

8928
07:37:14,478 --> 07:37:17,200
certainly am not i just enjoy opening

8929
07:37:17,200 --> 07:37:20,318
things and understanding how they work

8930
07:37:20,318 --> 07:37:22,160
so some of the tools that i'm going to

8931
07:37:22,160 --> 07:37:24,160
use here today

8932
07:37:24,160 --> 07:37:26,718
and i am tempting the demo god so please

8933
07:37:26,718 --> 07:37:29,920
send me your good vibes

8934
07:37:29,920 --> 07:37:31,840
so i'm going to use the tie guard again

8935
07:37:31,840 --> 07:37:33,360
this was a device made by joe

8936
07:37:33,360 --> 07:37:34,718
fitzpatrick

8937
07:37:34,718 --> 07:37:36,478
i mentioned earlier

8938
07:37:36,478 --> 07:37:38,558
i call this a bit of a swiss army knife

8939
07:37:38,558 --> 07:37:42,478
style device so it has an ftdi uh chip

8940
07:37:42,478 --> 07:37:45,200
in the in the heart of it

8941
07:37:45,200 --> 07:37:48,240
so it will connect to things like jtag

8942
07:37:48,240 --> 07:37:50,878
interfaces jtag is a sort of test and

8943
07:37:50,878 --> 07:37:53,680
verify protocol for

8944
07:37:53,680 --> 07:37:55,040
talking to

8945
07:37:55,040 --> 07:37:57,840
sort of thing components on your pcb

8946
07:37:57,840 --> 07:37:59,920
it can be used for

8947
07:37:59,920 --> 07:38:01,520
like single step

8948
07:38:01,520 --> 07:38:04,318
cpu debugging you could use it to dump

8949
07:38:04,318 --> 07:38:07,440
memory uh you could use it to dump flash

8950
07:38:07,440 --> 07:38:11,120
chips um so the jtag can be an avenue

8951
07:38:11,120 --> 07:38:13,440
for you to get firmware off a device

8952
07:38:13,440 --> 07:38:16,718
um also the tie guard will um talk to

8953
07:38:16,718 --> 07:38:19,600
serial y debug interfaces which is

8954
07:38:19,600 --> 07:38:21,920
essentially just a two pin version of jp

8955
07:38:21,920 --> 07:38:24,718
tag what's jtag on top um but it's the

8956
07:38:24,718 --> 07:38:27,120
number of required pins has been

8957
07:38:27,120 --> 07:38:29,600
shrunk down and it's an arm standard so

8958
07:38:29,600 --> 07:38:31,840
it's just a bi-directional eye open and

8959
07:38:31,840 --> 07:38:33,600
a clock pin so it's a little bit easier

8960
07:38:33,600 --> 07:38:35,360
to discover if things aren't labeled for

8961
07:38:35,360 --> 07:38:36,398
example

8962
07:38:36,398 --> 07:38:38,958
and the last interface

8963
07:38:38,958 --> 07:38:40,558
that we're kind of going to look at is

8964
07:38:40,558 --> 07:38:42,240
the

8965
07:38:42,240 --> 07:38:44,398
uart serial which is it's typically

8966
07:38:44,398 --> 07:38:47,600
designed for device to

8967
07:38:47,600 --> 07:38:50,000
uh pc sort of serial communication so if

8968
07:38:50,000 --> 07:38:51,440
you're going to find things like debug

8969
07:38:51,440 --> 07:38:53,680
messages or maybe shell access if you're

8970
07:38:53,680 --> 07:38:55,040
the computer system you're looking at

8971
07:38:55,040 --> 07:38:57,360
has command line access

8972
07:38:57,360 --> 07:38:58,718
you might find that through a ur

8973
07:38:58,718 --> 07:39:00,558
interface and that's just two pins a

8974
07:39:00,558 --> 07:39:04,240
transmit and a reset pin

8975
07:39:05,840 --> 07:39:06,558
so

8976
07:39:06,558 --> 07:39:08,718
what devices you know may be

8977
07:39:08,718 --> 07:39:10,958
alternatives to the thai guard

8978
07:39:10,958 --> 07:39:12,718
so a lot of you probably recognize the

8979
07:39:12,718 --> 07:39:15,040
bus pirates very popular um in my

8980
07:39:15,040 --> 07:39:17,760
opinion it's just a little bit clunky to

8981
07:39:17,760 --> 07:39:19,520
use i feel like the thai guard is a

8982
07:39:19,520 --> 07:39:21,280
better hardware

8983
07:39:21,280 --> 07:39:24,240
tool and the jtagulator also

8984
07:39:24,240 --> 07:39:27,360
a good tool on its own right however it

8985
07:39:27,360 --> 07:39:29,120
is quite expensive so

8986
07:39:29,120 --> 07:39:30,240
um

8987
07:39:30,240 --> 07:39:32,398
you know i definitely recommend the tie

8988
07:39:32,398 --> 07:39:34,558
guard as a good

8989
07:39:34,558 --> 07:39:39,680
good sort of overall tool um so also

8990
07:39:39,680 --> 07:39:42,638
i highly highly recommend if you're

8991
07:39:42,638 --> 07:39:44,160
going to be doing about hardware hacking

8992
07:39:44,160 --> 07:39:48,160
is to save yourself a lot of pain so

8993
07:39:48,160 --> 07:39:50,638
jump on aliexpress and look for say like

8994
07:39:50,638 --> 07:39:52,798
the tl866

8995
07:39:52,798 --> 07:39:56,478
or the pro-man flash reader rider

8996
07:39:56,478 --> 07:39:57,760
programmer

8997
07:39:57,760 --> 07:40:01,040
these have extensive lists of

8998
07:40:01,040 --> 07:40:04,080
chips that they support um and so you

8999
07:40:04,080 --> 07:40:05,600
know doing it manually you pull the

9000
07:40:05,600 --> 07:40:07,280
thing off you figure out how the chip

9001
07:40:07,280 --> 07:40:08,878
works you read the data sheet can be

9002
07:40:08,878 --> 07:40:10,958
painstaking and what you could often

9003
07:40:10,958 --> 07:40:12,638
find is you plug it into one of these

9004
07:40:12,638 --> 07:40:15,360
readers and it just works so i highly

9005
07:40:15,360 --> 07:40:16,958
recommend looking at some of these

9006
07:40:16,958 --> 07:40:19,600
programmers

9007
07:40:20,080 --> 07:40:21,200
the other tool i'm going to show you

9008
07:40:21,200 --> 07:40:23,120
today is probably my favorite hardware

9009
07:40:23,120 --> 07:40:24,718
hacking tool and it's actually a very

9010
07:40:24,718 --> 07:40:28,398
simple idea it's just a pogo pin on the

9011
07:40:28,398 --> 07:40:31,280
end of a um so the arm is quite heavy it

9012
07:40:31,280 --> 07:40:33,280
sort of uses its weight to hold the

9013
07:40:33,280 --> 07:40:34,798
pogrip and down on something you're

9014
07:40:34,798 --> 07:40:36,798
trying to connect to and then you can

9015
07:40:36,798 --> 07:40:38,398
connect your wires up to your tool like

9016
07:40:38,398 --> 07:40:39,920
your tie guard or whatever you're using

9017
07:40:39,920 --> 07:40:41,680
so this is a pcb byte that we're going

9018
07:40:41,680 --> 07:40:43,600
to use so this is where i'm tempting the

9019
07:40:43,600 --> 07:40:45,200
demo gods a little bit because as you

9020
07:40:45,200 --> 07:40:46,798
can see in that picture it's a pretty

9021
07:40:46,798 --> 07:40:48,160
tight space

9022
07:40:48,160 --> 07:40:50,558
and you're watching me so you know it's

9023
07:40:50,558 --> 07:40:51,360
um

9024
07:40:51,360 --> 07:40:53,600
you know potentially but unnerving so

9025
07:40:53,600 --> 07:40:55,840
i'll give it a go and see how we get on

9026
07:40:55,840 --> 07:40:57,200
um so

9027
07:40:57,200 --> 07:41:00,638
i'm going to use the pcb bike to

9028
07:41:00,638 --> 07:41:02,558
talk to a couple

9029
07:41:02,558 --> 07:41:04,558
of the serial pins on a microcontroller

9030
07:41:04,558 --> 07:41:07,680
i'm going to use the tie guard to

9031
07:41:07,680 --> 07:41:10,080
to do that

9032
07:41:10,080 --> 07:41:12,398
all right so what i'm going to do now if

9033
07:41:12,398 --> 07:41:15,440
we can flick to just the the camera is

9034
07:41:15,440 --> 07:41:16,958
i'm going to open up the internet and

9035
07:41:16,958 --> 07:41:19,840
see what's inside

9036
07:41:21,840 --> 07:41:23,120
by the way did anyone notice the

9037
07:41:23,120 --> 07:41:25,760
flashing garden

9038
07:41:27,600 --> 07:41:30,079
all right

9039
07:41:30,398 --> 07:41:32,798
it's very light surprisingly for the

9040
07:41:32,798 --> 07:41:35,680
entire internet

9041
07:41:37,360 --> 07:41:39,600
all right just two screws just to make

9042
07:41:39,600 --> 07:41:43,160
it a little bit easier

9043
07:41:46,160 --> 07:41:49,760
i wonder what's in the internet

9044
07:41:49,840 --> 07:41:51,760
okay

9045
07:41:51,760 --> 07:41:53,760
we have

9046
07:41:53,760 --> 07:41:56,397
a battery

9047
07:41:57,600 --> 07:41:59,440
surprise the internet can run on such a

9048
07:41:59,440 --> 07:42:01,440
small battery we've got a battery and we

9049
07:42:01,440 --> 07:42:04,080
have this board um also interesting i'm

9050
07:42:04,080 --> 07:42:05,760
not sure how easy it is to see on the

9051
07:42:05,760 --> 07:42:07,040
video feed

9052
07:42:07,040 --> 07:42:08,958
but there's a strange number written

9053
07:42:08,958 --> 07:42:09,760
here

9054
07:42:09,760 --> 07:42:11,760
but okay so let's have a let's talk

9055
07:42:11,760 --> 07:42:13,360
about this board so often when you pull

9056
07:42:13,360 --> 07:42:14,878
something apart you first think your

9057
07:42:14,878 --> 07:42:16,558
first thought is going to be well what

9058
07:42:16,558 --> 07:42:17,920
components do i have how are they

9059
07:42:17,920 --> 07:42:20,718
connected you know are there test pads

9060
07:42:20,718 --> 07:42:22,398
that are broken out from you know could

9061
07:42:22,398 --> 07:42:23,680
be useful

9062
07:42:23,680 --> 07:42:26,160
you know um are there ports that you

9063
07:42:26,160 --> 07:42:28,558
connect cables into so let's have a look

9064
07:42:28,558 --> 07:42:29,920
at this board

9065
07:42:29,920 --> 07:42:31,920
so we've got a

9066
07:42:31,920 --> 07:42:33,360
usb

9067
07:42:33,360 --> 07:42:36,318
port that's kind of interesting

9068
07:42:36,318 --> 07:42:39,360
we've got here we've got a

9069
07:42:39,360 --> 07:42:40,878
microcontroller

9070
07:42:40,878 --> 07:42:42,398
it's you know the guts of it that's

9071
07:42:42,398 --> 07:42:44,718
where the cpu is we've got a flash eat

9072
07:42:44,718 --> 07:42:46,638
rom over here

9073
07:42:46,638 --> 07:42:48,398
and some you know battery terminal the

9074
07:42:48,398 --> 07:42:49,440
led

9075
07:42:49,440 --> 07:42:51,120
we've also got some you can see the

9076
07:42:51,120 --> 07:42:52,958
traces running from the microcontroller

9077
07:42:52,958 --> 07:42:54,958
down to these pads here

9078
07:42:54,958 --> 07:42:57,440
um so just in the interest of time and

9079
07:42:57,440 --> 07:42:59,520
demoing for you all i can tell you that

9080
07:42:59,520 --> 07:43:02,240
these are breakouts for jtech um so you

9081
07:43:02,240 --> 07:43:04,160
could use the pcb byte to connect to the

9082
07:43:04,160 --> 07:43:06,478
jtag also on the back side we've got

9083
07:43:06,478 --> 07:43:07,760
it's pretty simple

9084
07:43:07,760 --> 07:43:09,120
but a few more breakouts from the

9085
07:43:09,120 --> 07:43:11,200
microcontroller this is the serial wire

9086
07:43:11,200 --> 07:43:13,040
debug so we're not going to connect to

9087
07:43:13,040 --> 07:43:14,558
either of those

9088
07:43:14,558 --> 07:43:17,520
today but we are going to connect to a

9089
07:43:17,520 --> 07:43:18,958
non-broken out thing on the

9090
07:43:18,958 --> 07:43:21,840
microcontroller which is the uart serial

9091
07:43:21,840 --> 07:43:24,000
and then we've got the flash eeprom here

9092
07:43:24,000 --> 07:43:26,398
so we're going to use the tie guard to

9093
07:43:26,398 --> 07:43:28,160
dump the contents of

9094
07:43:28,160 --> 07:43:29,840
the flesh

9095
07:43:29,840 --> 07:43:31,920
one thing i want to point out to you

9096
07:43:31,920 --> 07:43:33,360
again it might be a little bit hard to

9097
07:43:33,360 --> 07:43:35,680
see on the video but

9098
07:43:35,680 --> 07:43:38,000
there's actually this

9099
07:43:38,000 --> 07:43:40,240
this usb connector's got four pins you

9100
07:43:40,240 --> 07:43:41,920
can actually see

9101
07:43:41,920 --> 07:43:43,440
the two running along the bottom of the

9102
07:43:43,440 --> 07:43:45,520
two data pins they're actually missing

9103
07:43:45,520 --> 07:43:46,798
resistors

9104
07:43:46,798 --> 07:43:50,000
uh here this is not an uncommon thing

9105
07:43:50,000 --> 07:43:53,360
for vendors to do to essentially disable

9106
07:43:53,360 --> 07:43:55,280
interfaces so

9107
07:43:55,280 --> 07:43:57,360
rather than actually disable it or

9108
07:43:57,360 --> 07:43:59,120
actually change they just remove simple

9109
07:43:59,120 --> 07:44:01,440
components from their production runs

9110
07:44:01,440 --> 07:44:02,878
onboard so that's something to keep an

9111
07:44:02,878 --> 07:44:05,040
eye on you know just look like look at

9112
07:44:05,040 --> 07:44:06,638
the traces see how everything's

9113
07:44:06,638 --> 07:44:08,958
connected kind of piece it together and

9114
07:44:08,958 --> 07:44:10,398
you're here

9115
07:44:10,398 --> 07:44:11,680
so just

9116
07:44:11,680 --> 07:44:13,120
head back over to

9117
07:44:13,120 --> 07:44:15,440
here

9118
07:44:19,200 --> 07:44:21,360
you pull up the slides again thank you

9119
07:44:21,360 --> 07:44:22,478
um

9120
07:44:22,478 --> 07:44:23,200
so

9121
07:44:23,200 --> 07:44:24,638
probably the one of the most important

9122
07:44:24,638 --> 07:44:27,680
components we we found when we um opened

9123
07:44:27,680 --> 07:44:28,558
it up

9124
07:44:28,558 --> 07:44:32,878
um was the microcontroller so how do you

9125
07:44:32,878 --> 07:44:34,878
identify what component you're looking

9126
07:44:34,878 --> 07:44:36,240
at well often you'll use something like

9127
07:44:36,240 --> 07:44:38,000
a microscope or just zoom in on your

9128
07:44:38,000 --> 07:44:40,000
phone and take a photo of the markings

9129
07:44:40,000 --> 07:44:42,240
on the top so we can see that this is a

9130
07:44:42,240 --> 07:44:43,760
nxp

9131
07:44:43,760 --> 07:44:45,440
lpc

9132
07:44:45,440 --> 07:44:47,920
it's a if we if we google for the data

9133
07:44:47,920 --> 07:44:50,478
sheet we can see it's the arm cortex m0

9134
07:44:50,478 --> 07:44:52,958
so pretty low power low speed

9135
07:44:52,958 --> 07:44:54,478
arm processor

9136
07:44:54,478 --> 07:44:55,440
um

9137
07:44:55,440 --> 07:44:59,360
it's a 64 pins along the outside style

9138
07:44:59,360 --> 07:45:01,120
footprint

9139
07:45:01,120 --> 07:45:02,558
it has

9140
07:45:02,558 --> 07:45:07,600
outputs for jtag serial wire uart

9141
07:45:08,080 --> 07:45:08,798
so

9142
07:45:08,798 --> 07:45:11,680
when you're looking at uart serial

9143
07:45:11,680 --> 07:45:13,760
a recommendation i have for you is just

9144
07:45:13,760 --> 07:45:15,520
be mindful that

9145
07:45:15,520 --> 07:45:17,920
you're more likely to see messages

9146
07:45:17,920 --> 07:45:19,040
through that

9147
07:45:19,040 --> 07:45:22,240
interface at boot time so if you're

9148
07:45:22,240 --> 07:45:24,318
probing around a bunch of pins and

9149
07:45:24,318 --> 07:45:26,718
trying to connect a serial adapter and i

9150
07:45:26,718 --> 07:45:28,398
just recommend just each time you go to

9151
07:45:28,398 --> 07:45:29,600
somewhere else

9152
07:45:29,600 --> 07:45:31,520
go about reboot the device because you

9153
07:45:31,520 --> 07:45:32,878
don't want to accidentally connect to

9154
07:45:32,878 --> 07:45:34,478
the right pin and not see anything

9155
07:45:34,478 --> 07:45:38,000
because it finished its boot process

9156
07:45:38,080 --> 07:45:40,558
so we've we've pulled up the um the

9157
07:45:40,558 --> 07:45:42,958
datasheet for this microcontroller and

9158
07:45:42,958 --> 07:45:44,318
i've just highlighted the pins that are

9159
07:45:44,318 --> 07:45:46,958
actually interesting to us as the hacker

9160
07:45:46,958 --> 07:45:49,040
you know we want to look for jtag serial

9161
07:45:49,040 --> 07:45:51,040
wire etc so yeah we're going to look at

9162
07:45:51,040 --> 07:45:53,920
these two through blue ones um and yeah

9163
07:45:53,920 --> 07:45:55,680
just emphasizing that

9164
07:45:55,680 --> 07:45:59,520
these are very small and the pcb bite is

9165
07:45:59,520 --> 07:46:02,798
fantastic job at you know getting into

9166
07:46:02,798 --> 07:46:05,360
these these small spaces

9167
07:46:05,360 --> 07:46:08,638
the other component that is

9168
07:46:08,638 --> 07:46:11,120
really interesting to us as a hacker is

9169
07:46:11,120 --> 07:46:13,920
the flesh eeprom so

9170
07:46:13,920 --> 07:46:16,798
again we took a photo of of the top we

9171
07:46:16,798 --> 07:46:18,160
looked at the markings and we can see

9172
07:46:18,160 --> 07:46:20,240
that it's a micro chip

9173
07:46:20,240 --> 07:46:23,520
so it's a fleshy prom it's a i squared c

9174
07:46:23,520 --> 07:46:25,280
uh cereal eprom

9175
07:46:25,280 --> 07:46:27,920
so i squid c is a kind of communication

9176
07:46:27,920 --> 07:46:30,160
serial communication bus so it's used

9177
07:46:30,160 --> 07:46:32,318
for intraboard

9178
07:46:32,318 --> 07:46:34,558
moving of data so components to

9179
07:46:34,558 --> 07:46:37,840
components uh serial communication so

9180
07:46:37,840 --> 07:46:39,280
you can have

9181
07:46:39,280 --> 07:46:41,600
a number of devices sharing the same bus

9182
07:46:41,600 --> 07:46:43,120
like maybe the microcontroller needs

9183
07:46:43,120 --> 07:46:45,440
some data from a flash um or maybe

9184
07:46:45,440 --> 07:46:48,638
there's a sensor or some other component

9185
07:46:48,638 --> 07:46:49,760
another

9186
07:46:49,760 --> 07:46:50,878
serial

9187
07:46:50,878 --> 07:46:52,878
intro board style

9188
07:46:52,878 --> 07:46:54,398
protocol you might see when hardware

9189
07:46:54,398 --> 07:46:56,240
hacking is spi

9190
07:46:56,240 --> 07:46:59,120
same deal again

9191
07:47:00,478 --> 07:47:03,600
so we are going to use the tie guard

9192
07:47:03,600 --> 07:47:06,239
to dump this

9193
07:47:06,558 --> 07:47:09,120
so just to sort of sum up what we found

9194
07:47:09,120 --> 07:47:11,840
when we opened up the internet um

9195
07:47:11,840 --> 07:47:13,280
there's the microcontroller sitting

9196
07:47:13,280 --> 07:47:15,440
there in the middle uh there's a couple

9197
07:47:15,440 --> 07:47:17,120
inputs to the battery led not

9198
07:47:17,120 --> 07:47:18,478
particularly interesting we found that

9199
07:47:18,478 --> 07:47:21,040
there was a breakout for jtag

9200
07:47:21,040 --> 07:47:23,040
and serial y debug we notice there's a

9201
07:47:23,040 --> 07:47:24,638
usb port

9202
07:47:24,638 --> 07:47:27,120
that's got some components missing again

9203
07:47:27,120 --> 07:47:28,558
in the interest of time i'm not going to

9204
07:47:28,558 --> 07:47:30,878
look at the usb but just so you're aware

9205
07:47:30,878 --> 07:47:32,398
that that's something that does happen

9206
07:47:32,398 --> 07:47:34,240
removing components

9207
07:47:34,240 --> 07:47:35,840
down the bottom there is the kind of

9208
07:47:35,840 --> 07:47:37,920
battery management chip for

9209
07:47:37,920 --> 07:47:39,440
uh because you can charge the battery

9210
07:47:39,440 --> 07:47:41,360
through the usb so yeah as a hacker we

9211
07:47:41,360 --> 07:47:42,958
don't really care about that that's just

9212
07:47:42,958 --> 07:47:45,600
power stuff we want to look for data um

9213
07:47:45,600 --> 07:47:47,120
so yeah we're gonna look at

9214
07:47:47,120 --> 07:47:48,638
look at the microcontroller and look at

9215
07:47:48,638 --> 07:47:50,958
the flash

9216
07:47:50,958 --> 07:47:54,080
cool so if we go back to

9217
07:47:54,080 --> 07:47:54,798
the

9218
07:47:54,798 --> 07:47:57,199
camera

9219
07:47:58,160 --> 07:48:01,040
i'll just bring up my

9220
07:48:01,040 --> 07:48:03,280
terminal

9221
07:48:03,280 --> 07:48:04,798
so the first thing i'm going to do is

9222
07:48:04,798 --> 07:48:06,958
dump the flash so

9223
07:48:06,958 --> 07:48:09,280
now it's time to say a pre-order

9224
07:48:09,280 --> 07:48:12,080
to the demo gods i guess um so what i'm

9225
07:48:12,080 --> 07:48:15,280
going to use is

9226
07:48:15,360 --> 07:48:17,440
i'm going to use this test clip so

9227
07:48:17,440 --> 07:48:19,760
essentially it clips on top of the the

9228
07:48:19,760 --> 07:48:21,280
flash chip

9229
07:48:21,280 --> 07:48:23,280
but it can be a little bit tricky to get

9230
07:48:23,280 --> 07:48:24,958
on

9231
07:48:24,958 --> 07:48:27,440
so looking at the tie guard just a bit

9232
07:48:27,440 --> 07:48:28,878
of a trick so

9233
07:48:28,878 --> 07:48:31,040
i'm going to power the chip

9234
07:48:31,040 --> 07:48:32,798
in circuit meaning i'm going to power it

9235
07:48:32,798 --> 07:48:35,280
normally like it is now

9236
07:48:35,280 --> 07:48:37,200
and i'm going to tell set the tie guard

9237
07:48:37,200 --> 07:48:38,398
to just

9238
07:48:38,398 --> 07:48:40,478
voltage target mode which means don't

9239
07:48:40,478 --> 07:48:44,000
provide any power on the vcc line

9240
07:48:44,000 --> 07:48:45,040
and a good

9241
07:48:45,040 --> 07:48:46,718
reason why that can be quite handy is

9242
07:48:46,718 --> 07:48:49,280
because um the led pops up i'm showing

9243
07:48:49,280 --> 07:48:51,440
you yep there's voltage on that line uh

9244
07:48:51,440 --> 07:48:53,120
when it's successfully connected because

9245
07:48:53,120 --> 07:48:54,878
like i said it can be a little bit a

9246
07:48:54,878 --> 07:48:56,318
little bit tricky so what i'm going to

9247
07:48:56,318 --> 07:49:00,798
do is i'm going to turn off the internet

9248
07:49:00,798 --> 07:49:05,360
sorry if your phone loses connection

9249
07:49:06,478 --> 07:49:09,040
i'm going to actually before i do that

9250
07:49:09,040 --> 07:49:11,600
um so the pcb bike comes with these

9251
07:49:11,600 --> 07:49:14,000
really nice

9252
07:49:14,000 --> 07:49:15,040
kind of

9253
07:49:15,040 --> 07:49:16,080
leg

9254
07:49:16,080 --> 07:49:18,398
holder devices i'm just going to set it

9255
07:49:18,398 --> 07:49:20,240
up just as a bit less

9256
07:49:20,240 --> 07:49:23,200
likelihood that if i um

9257
07:49:23,200 --> 07:49:26,558
do something a little bit

9258
07:49:26,878 --> 07:49:29,760
loses connection or whatever

9259
07:49:29,760 --> 07:49:32,958
so keep that in place

9260
07:49:39,760 --> 07:49:41,680
all right can you see that okay cool

9261
07:49:41,680 --> 07:49:42,878
that looks good

9262
07:49:42,878 --> 07:49:45,120
so i'm going to try and get this clip in

9263
07:49:45,120 --> 07:49:46,958
place just move these screws out of the

9264
07:49:46,958 --> 07:49:48,318
way

9265
07:49:48,318 --> 07:49:49,040
so

9266
07:49:49,040 --> 07:49:51,360
pin one

9267
07:49:51,360 --> 07:49:53,360
is indicated as a hot the highlighted

9268
07:49:53,360 --> 07:49:54,478
pin here

9269
07:49:54,478 --> 07:49:55,760
and i'm going to connect it to pin one

9270
07:49:55,760 --> 07:49:57,360
on the chip and then we'll see if it

9271
07:49:57,360 --> 07:49:59,200
connects

9272
07:49:59,200 --> 07:50:00,558
this is probably a good time to play

9273
07:50:00,558 --> 07:50:02,318
qriket stop wave as i try and get this

9274
07:50:02,318 --> 07:50:05,318
on

9275
07:50:13,440 --> 07:50:15,760
okay

9276
07:50:16,798 --> 07:50:18,638
the led didn't pop up it's on but the

9277
07:50:18,638 --> 07:50:20,958
led didn't pop up so that's why i feel

9278
07:50:20,958 --> 07:50:24,760
like that's quite a good trick

9279
07:50:40,240 --> 07:50:42,638
ah the led popped up that time fingers

9280
07:50:42,638 --> 07:50:44,070
crossed everyone

9281
07:50:44,070 --> 07:50:45,400
[Laughter]

9282
07:50:45,400 --> 07:50:50,638
[Applause]

9283
07:50:50,638 --> 07:50:52,080
all right so um

9284
07:50:52,080 --> 07:50:53,280
[Music]

9285
07:50:53,280 --> 07:50:56,638
first we are going to scan

9286
07:50:56,638 --> 07:50:59,600
the uh the serial bus to see if it can

9287
07:50:59,600 --> 07:51:00,958
find

9288
07:51:00,958 --> 07:51:04,877
the i squared c device

9289
07:51:04,958 --> 07:51:07,600
which it didn't um so we'll have to do

9290
07:51:07,600 --> 07:51:10,680
it again

9291
07:51:26,638 --> 07:51:29,440
all right let's try again

9292
07:51:32,840 --> 07:51:34,878
okay it doesn't want to work so what

9293
07:51:34,878 --> 07:51:36,558
i'll do is i'll just show you the video

9294
07:51:36,558 --> 07:51:37,840
of it working so

9295
07:51:37,840 --> 07:51:39,760
there's nothing else

9296
07:51:39,760 --> 07:51:41,200
how how

9297
07:51:41,200 --> 07:51:43,920
how can it be

9298
07:51:46,000 --> 07:51:49,160
all right

9299
07:51:49,520 --> 07:51:50,958
so

9300
07:51:50,958 --> 07:51:52,798
we scan the i squid c

9301
07:51:52,798 --> 07:51:54,878
serial bus and

9302
07:51:54,878 --> 07:51:56,638
magically it works when you play the

9303
07:51:56,638 --> 07:51:57,760
video

9304
07:51:57,760 --> 07:51:59,840
um and so we can see

9305
07:51:59,840 --> 07:52:04,160
it's detected the device at address 5.5

9306
07:52:04,160 --> 07:52:05,200
so

9307
07:52:05,200 --> 07:52:07,680
oh there we go it's popped off

9308
07:52:07,680 --> 07:52:09,120
so

9309
07:52:09,120 --> 07:52:10,398
so i'm going to use

9310
07:52:10,398 --> 07:52:12,478
the pi ftdi

9311
07:52:12,478 --> 07:52:14,000
library which allows you to talk i

9312
07:52:14,000 --> 07:52:14,840
squared

9313
07:52:14,840 --> 07:52:16,558
c um

9314
07:52:16,558 --> 07:52:18,958
with an ftdi chip which is the one on

9315
07:52:18,958 --> 07:52:21,280
the tie guard gonna see it tell it we're

9316
07:52:21,280 --> 07:52:24,638
using the tie guard what the address

9317
07:52:24,638 --> 07:52:27,120
of our i squared c devices

9318
07:52:27,120 --> 07:52:29,280
a little bit details about our device

9319
07:52:29,280 --> 07:52:32,318
the indian-ness of the bytes also the

9320
07:52:32,318 --> 07:52:34,798
length of our address and we can see

9321
07:52:34,798 --> 07:52:37,520
that it has um pulled off

9322
07:52:37,520 --> 07:52:39,840
um 10 bytes from the start of the chip

9323
07:52:39,840 --> 07:52:41,120
and there's looks like there's some data

9324
07:52:41,120 --> 07:52:42,798
there so it's a good sign so just going

9325
07:52:42,798 --> 07:52:45,440
to write it to a file

9326
07:52:45,440 --> 07:52:50,079
and see what's um what the file might be

9327
07:52:50,718 --> 07:52:54,240
so oh it's a compressed

9328
07:52:54,240 --> 07:52:57,200
bzip2 compressed file so just unpack

9329
07:52:57,200 --> 07:52:59,600
that

9330
07:52:59,600 --> 07:53:00,558
all right there must have been some

9331
07:53:00,558 --> 07:53:02,798
zeros at the end of the file which is

9332
07:53:02,798 --> 07:53:04,958
why it said something about garbage and

9333
07:53:04,958 --> 07:53:06,478
eof ignored

9334
07:53:06,478 --> 07:53:08,080
let's have a look at what's up okay it's

9335
07:53:08,080 --> 07:53:10,718
html file let's blindly open that in

9336
07:53:10,718 --> 07:53:12,080
your browser without seeing what's

9337
07:53:12,080 --> 07:53:14,718
inside right

9338
07:53:16,958 --> 07:53:19,359
all right

9339
07:53:20,718 --> 07:53:24,120
of course

9340
07:53:28,878 --> 07:53:30,958
i would expect nothing less

9341
07:53:30,958 --> 07:53:33,680
than from the elders of the internet

9342
07:53:33,680 --> 07:53:36,558
to rick roll us

9343
07:53:39,520 --> 07:53:41,120
all right

9344
07:53:41,120 --> 07:53:43,040
so the other other demo i want to show

9345
07:53:43,040 --> 07:53:45,120
you is the pcb byte so let's see if we

9346
07:53:45,120 --> 07:53:46,318
have a little bit more luck with that

9347
07:53:46,318 --> 07:53:48,478
one

9348
07:53:49,200 --> 07:53:50,558
all right this is a little bit um

9349
07:53:50,558 --> 07:53:54,080
simpler but um also requires a bit of

9350
07:53:54,080 --> 07:53:56,240
a bit of trickiness so i'm going to make

9351
07:53:56,240 --> 07:53:58,160
a few changes to the tie guard so i'm

9352
07:53:58,160 --> 07:54:00,160
going to remove remove the clip that

9353
07:54:00,160 --> 07:54:02,000
didn't work

9354
07:54:02,000 --> 07:54:04,798
and i'm going to so we're before we had

9355
07:54:04,798 --> 07:54:06,240
the tie guard

9356
07:54:06,240 --> 07:54:08,798
set up to not provide any voltage over

9357
07:54:08,798 --> 07:54:13,120
vcc i'm now going to set it to 3.3 volt

9358
07:54:13,120 --> 07:54:15,520
and i'm going to attach the

9359
07:54:15,520 --> 07:54:17,760
the wiring harness for

9360
07:54:17,760 --> 07:54:19,760
the gtag interface

9361
07:54:19,760 --> 07:54:24,397
um so just connect that up here

9362
07:54:29,120 --> 07:54:32,000
make sure it's the way right way around

9363
07:54:32,000 --> 07:54:34,000
shifts that way

9364
07:54:34,000 --> 07:54:35,840
all right so i'm only going to connect

9365
07:54:35,840 --> 07:54:39,280
two pins here um we need to ground

9366
07:54:39,280 --> 07:54:41,680
the tie guard with

9367
07:54:41,680 --> 07:54:43,280
our board so we're going to connect to

9368
07:54:43,280 --> 07:54:46,160
ground point so looking at the breakouts

9369
07:54:46,160 --> 07:54:47,040
here

9370
07:54:47,040 --> 07:54:48,798
from the microcontroller we know that

9371
07:54:48,798 --> 07:54:51,680
this pad here is a ground point so i'm

9372
07:54:51,680 --> 07:54:52,718
just going to use that because it's

9373
07:54:52,718 --> 07:54:54,718
quite easy to connect to the pcb bike

9374
07:54:54,718 --> 07:54:56,638
can just sit on top um the second

9375
07:54:56,638 --> 07:54:58,240
connection is a little bit harder

9376
07:54:58,240 --> 07:54:59,920
because it's the one on the side of the

9377
07:54:59,920 --> 07:55:01,840
microcontroller

9378
07:55:01,840 --> 07:55:03,760
and that's the

9379
07:55:03,760 --> 07:55:06,718
tx the transmit pin for the serial from

9380
07:55:06,718 --> 07:55:09,200
the microcontroller is going to go into

9381
07:55:09,200 --> 07:55:12,000
the receive pin on our tie guard so just

9382
07:55:12,000 --> 07:55:15,638
connect that up now

9383
07:55:18,718 --> 07:55:23,040
so first we've got our ground

9384
07:55:23,120 --> 07:55:27,040
so these pcb bite um

9385
07:55:27,040 --> 07:55:30,080
um see it just sort of clip and

9386
07:55:30,080 --> 07:55:33,440
like that

9387
07:55:33,440 --> 07:55:36,240
and then it's magnetic and it just

9388
07:55:36,240 --> 07:55:38,558
clips on there so this one can just

9389
07:55:38,558 --> 07:55:40,558
happily sit

9390
07:55:40,558 --> 07:55:43,878
on top there

9391
07:55:46,160 --> 07:55:48,478
just while i'm doing this i'm going to

9392
07:55:48,478 --> 07:55:52,000
um kill its power

9393
07:55:52,240 --> 07:55:54,878
so then we're going to connect our

9394
07:55:54,878 --> 07:55:56,318
receive

9395
07:55:56,318 --> 07:55:58,160
line to

9396
07:55:58,160 --> 07:56:01,398
this one

9397
07:56:02,558 --> 07:56:04,718
all right

9398
07:56:04,718 --> 07:56:06,958
and

9399
07:56:07,280 --> 07:56:09,200
much like the test clip this is a very

9400
07:56:09,200 --> 07:56:11,840
requires small and you probably do under

9401
07:56:11,840 --> 07:56:14,160
a microscope and not with you know house

9402
07:56:14,160 --> 07:56:17,200
lights blindingly blinding you but let's

9403
07:56:17,200 --> 07:56:19,840
give it a crack

9404
07:56:22,478 --> 07:56:24,878
all right move my hand out slowly

9405
07:56:24,878 --> 07:56:27,600
so what i'll do is i'll just get a

9406
07:56:27,600 --> 07:56:29,520
i'm just going to use picocom to talk

9407
07:56:29,520 --> 07:56:31,120
serial this end

9408
07:56:31,120 --> 07:56:32,558
um

9409
07:56:32,558 --> 07:56:35,840
i already know the the broad rate um

9410
07:56:35,840 --> 07:56:38,878
so let's get that on and let's see

9411
07:56:38,878 --> 07:56:42,840
if i got it in the right place

9412
07:56:49,280 --> 07:56:53,040
oh it's an arpanet terminal very old

9413
07:56:53,040 --> 07:56:56,318
oh anyone recognize that early malware

9414
07:56:56,318 --> 07:56:57,200
oh

9415
07:56:57,200 --> 07:56:58,478
of course

9416
07:56:58,478 --> 07:57:01,760
again they've wrecked rolled us

9417
07:57:01,760 --> 07:57:03,200
i'm starting to think that the elders of

9418
07:57:03,200 --> 07:57:07,638
the internet might be mega trolls

9419
07:57:17,440 --> 07:57:18,638
so

9420
07:57:18,638 --> 07:57:21,280
to wrap up

9421
07:57:21,440 --> 07:57:24,958
hardware is a fantastic attack surface

9422
07:57:24,958 --> 07:57:27,680
it allows you to open up the black box

9423
07:57:27,680 --> 07:57:31,520
understand it get the firmware out

9424
07:57:31,520 --> 07:57:34,718
which then ultimately allows you to find

9425
07:57:34,718 --> 07:57:36,080
those sweet software level

9426
07:57:36,080 --> 07:57:39,080
vulnerabilities

9427
07:57:39,280 --> 07:57:40,798
hardware hacking doesn't need to be

9428
07:57:40,798 --> 07:57:42,080
intimidating

9429
07:57:42,080 --> 07:57:44,000
um you know i've been able to connect

9430
07:57:44,000 --> 07:57:45,920
these things while one of them

9431
07:57:45,920 --> 07:57:48,240
in the time i was talking to you out

9432
07:57:48,240 --> 07:57:49,680
here you know it's

9433
07:57:49,680 --> 07:57:51,920
it's um you know probably one of the

9434
07:57:51,920 --> 07:57:53,360
worst environments to try and do

9435
07:57:53,360 --> 07:57:56,398
hardware hacking um you know the

9436
07:57:56,398 --> 07:57:58,638
pcb bike you know as long as it sits in

9437
07:57:58,638 --> 07:58:00,638
the right place it just works it allows

9438
07:58:00,638 --> 07:58:02,878
you to iterate fast you know you sort of

9439
07:58:02,878 --> 07:58:04,000
you're looking around the board you

9440
07:58:04,000 --> 07:58:05,840
think oh there's a bunch of pins here

9441
07:58:05,840 --> 07:58:07,840
maybe this is this maybe this is that

9442
07:58:07,840 --> 07:58:09,520
you know you connect up the pcb bike or

9443
07:58:09,520 --> 07:58:11,280
a test clip or something you use

9444
07:58:11,280 --> 07:58:13,760
something versatile like a tie guard and

9445
07:58:13,760 --> 07:58:15,440
that means you know if it didn't go

9446
07:58:15,440 --> 07:58:17,440
right that's fine just move on to

9447
07:58:17,440 --> 07:58:19,440
something else you know if you the

9448
07:58:19,440 --> 07:58:20,878
alternative what would have been the

9449
07:58:20,878 --> 07:58:22,878
alternative it would have been maybe

9450
07:58:22,878 --> 07:58:25,040
solder some magnet wire onto the the

9451
07:58:25,040 --> 07:58:26,798
chip you know by doing that maybe you

9452
07:58:26,798 --> 07:58:29,280
create a short somewhere maybe you a pin

9453
07:58:29,280 --> 07:58:30,878
comes off you know maybe it gets a bit

9454
07:58:30,878 --> 07:58:32,160
too hot

9455
07:58:32,160 --> 07:58:35,360
or whatever and um their iteration's

9456
07:58:35,360 --> 07:58:36,958
much harder because you know you've

9457
07:58:36,958 --> 07:58:38,558
spent all that time and effort you've

9458
07:58:38,558 --> 07:58:40,558
got it working oh no it wasn't the right

9459
07:58:40,558 --> 07:58:42,478
you know i didn't understand the you

9460
07:58:42,478 --> 07:58:43,920
know i didn't know the data sheet so i'm

9461
07:58:43,920 --> 07:58:45,600
sort of guessing as to what pins i think

9462
07:58:45,600 --> 07:58:48,080
are what um and just when it comes to

9463
07:58:48,080 --> 07:58:49,920
hardware hacking they understand the

9464
07:58:49,920 --> 07:58:53,840
interfaces like jtag serial wire you are

9465
07:58:53,840 --> 07:58:56,080
understand the protocols like the serial

9466
07:58:56,080 --> 07:58:58,080
protocols that are used on the board for

9467
07:58:58,080 --> 07:59:00,000
the chips to talk to each other you know

9468
07:59:00,000 --> 07:59:01,360
consider

9469
07:59:01,360 --> 07:59:02,958
using a logic analyzer or an

9470
07:59:02,958 --> 07:59:04,558
oscilloscope to try and troubleshoot you

9471
07:59:04,558 --> 07:59:06,160
know what am i looking at

9472
07:59:06,160 --> 07:59:10,000
understand that kind of stuff

9473
07:59:11,600 --> 07:59:12,718
so

9474
07:59:12,718 --> 07:59:14,718
if you're interested in hardware hacking

9475
07:59:14,718 --> 07:59:16,240
but you know maybe you haven't taken the

9476
07:59:16,240 --> 07:59:17,520
plunge of actually pulling something

9477
07:59:17,520 --> 07:59:19,440
apart um

9478
07:59:19,440 --> 07:59:21,200
i recommend you know look inside your

9479
07:59:21,200 --> 07:59:23,920
cupboard you i i'm sure you have a box

9480
07:59:23,920 --> 07:59:26,398
of you know cables and tech stuff find

9481
07:59:26,398 --> 07:59:29,200
your old router open it up you know get

9482
07:59:29,200 --> 07:59:31,680
a serial connector like just just start

9483
07:59:31,680 --> 07:59:34,878
just start looking around

9484
07:59:37,360 --> 07:59:38,558
also

9485
07:59:38,558 --> 07:59:40,080
did anyone figure out the flashing

9486
07:59:40,080 --> 07:59:42,000
pattern on the front

9487
07:59:42,000 --> 07:59:44,318
please uh maybe maybe send me a message

9488
07:59:44,318 --> 07:59:46,478
on twitter my handle's there if you

9489
07:59:46,478 --> 07:59:49,280
figured out what it is um

9490
07:59:49,280 --> 07:59:51,520
also if you are interested in hardware

9491
07:59:51,520 --> 07:59:54,718
hacking interested in electronics um you

9492
07:59:54,718 --> 07:59:56,718
know maybe you're doing an

9493
07:59:56,718 --> 07:59:59,520
electrical engineering degree

9494
07:59:59,520 --> 08:00:00,958
or just interested in hardware in

9495
08:00:00,958 --> 08:00:02,160
general maybe you don't have to have

9496
08:00:02,160 --> 08:00:04,558
high hacking experience please come and

9497
08:00:04,558 --> 08:00:08,718
talk to me about working cyber cx is

9498
08:00:08,718 --> 08:00:10,398
hiring

9499
08:00:10,398 --> 08:00:12,478
and you know i want to continue to grow

9500
08:00:12,478 --> 08:00:15,760
this the service um you know better

9501
08:00:15,760 --> 08:00:17,520
bigger and better at pen testing

9502
08:00:17,520 --> 08:00:19,440
hardware

9503
08:00:19,440 --> 08:00:23,717
and that's me thank you very much

9504
08:00:29,360 --> 08:00:31,600
thanks very much ben you're a brave man

9505
08:00:31,600 --> 08:00:33,920
doing the tiny tiny things

9506
08:00:33,920 --> 08:00:36,398
live on stage turn it off yeah turn off

9507
08:00:36,398 --> 08:00:37,760
the internet so that's that's an

9508
08:00:37,760 --> 08:00:39,360
excellent choice

9509
08:00:39,360 --> 08:00:42,080
excellent choice

9510
08:00:42,240 --> 08:00:43,520
and thank you brandon also for

9511
08:00:43,520 --> 08:00:45,200
activating the brand so i didn't have to

9512
08:00:45,200 --> 08:00:47,440
that's good work um

9513
08:00:47,440 --> 08:00:50,558
right let's move on to our next speaker

9514
08:00:50,558 --> 08:00:51,680
this

9515
08:00:51,680 --> 08:00:54,240
is his first kawaikon first kiwicon

9516
08:00:54,240 --> 08:00:55,680
first kawaii confession of the country

9517
08:00:55,680 --> 08:00:57,200
so we're going to have to

9518
08:00:57,200 --> 08:00:59,040
show them how we do it around here so we

9519
08:00:59,040 --> 08:01:02,420
have a big big welcome mr steve essler

9520
08:01:02,420 --> 08:01:10,240
[Applause]

9521
08:01:10,240 --> 08:01:12,958
um hi yeah i'm steve um

9522
08:01:12,958 --> 08:01:14,398
a little bit about myself because i

9523
08:01:14,398 --> 08:01:16,318
don't like to talk uh too much about

9524
08:01:16,318 --> 08:01:18,000
myself but um

9525
08:01:18,000 --> 08:01:19,440
i'm from the uk

9526
08:01:19,440 --> 08:01:21,760
i am 10 years a developer in the last

9527
08:01:21,760 --> 08:01:24,240
five years um i've swapped over to doing

9528
08:01:24,240 --> 08:01:26,798
application and security

9529
08:01:26,798 --> 08:01:30,318
and i like about it so i like it so um

9530
08:01:30,318 --> 08:01:32,240
i'm here today to talk to you about

9531
08:01:32,240 --> 08:01:35,200
application security and cheese so

9532
08:01:35,200 --> 08:01:37,120
first off a quick apology there was

9533
08:01:37,120 --> 08:01:38,798
meant to be some cheese boards going

9534
08:01:38,798 --> 08:01:41,120
around the auditorium but i spent all my

9535
08:01:41,120 --> 08:01:44,318
money on all the marketing budget on um

9536
08:01:44,318 --> 08:01:47,360
fancy graphics as you as you'll see

9537
08:01:47,360 --> 08:01:50,360
um

9538
08:02:00,160 --> 08:02:02,000
so yeah you're probably wondering what

9539
08:02:02,000 --> 08:02:04,878
application security has to do with with

9540
08:02:04,878 --> 08:02:06,240
cheese

9541
08:02:06,240 --> 08:02:08,478
so

9542
08:02:08,638 --> 08:02:11,520
meltdown that's not

9543
08:02:12,638 --> 08:02:15,200
there we go

9544
08:02:15,200 --> 08:02:16,000
so

9545
08:02:16,000 --> 08:02:17,680
yeah so we had a brief mention of swiss

9546
08:02:17,680 --> 08:02:19,680
cheese model from peter guttmann uh

9547
08:02:19,680 --> 08:02:20,958
first thing this morning so i'm going to

9548
08:02:20,958 --> 08:02:23,120
delve a little bit deeper into

9549
08:02:23,120 --> 08:02:25,760
what it is and how we can apply it to

9550
08:02:25,760 --> 08:02:27,200
application

9551
08:02:27,200 --> 08:02:29,440
security so just a quick brief of what

9552
08:02:29,440 --> 08:02:31,120
i'm going to talk about so and talk

9553
08:02:31,120 --> 08:02:32,160
about

9554
08:02:32,160 --> 08:02:34,478
what the swiss cheese model is i'm going

9555
08:02:34,478 --> 08:02:36,558
to cover some examples of where it's

9556
08:02:36,558 --> 08:02:40,558
been applied how we can relate it to

9557
08:02:40,558 --> 08:02:42,798
application security what good looks

9558
08:02:42,798 --> 08:02:45,040
like in terms of our cheese board

9559
08:02:45,040 --> 08:02:47,440
for application security and how things

9560
08:02:47,440 --> 08:02:49,440
can still go wrong and what can be done

9561
08:02:49,440 --> 08:02:52,318
to prevent them

9562
08:02:52,878 --> 08:02:54,318
so first off i'm going to explain a

9563
08:02:54,318 --> 08:02:55,840
little bit about high level of the model

9564
08:02:55,840 --> 08:02:59,040
and what it's been used for so in 1990

9565
08:02:59,040 --> 08:03:00,958
professor james reason came up with this

9566
08:03:00,958 --> 08:03:02,398
swiss cheese model

9567
08:03:02,398 --> 08:03:04,718
of accident causation to explain how

9568
08:03:04,718 --> 08:03:07,120
accidents can occur in complex systems

9569
08:03:07,120 --> 08:03:08,638
such as those who first studied in

9570
08:03:08,638 --> 08:03:10,240
healthcare environments

9571
08:03:10,240 --> 08:03:12,160
as with many complex systems medical

9572
08:03:12,160 --> 08:03:14,638
systems require some human input and

9573
08:03:14,638 --> 08:03:16,080
along with that human input comes

9574
08:03:16,080 --> 08:03:18,160
inevitable human errors as well

9575
08:03:18,160 --> 08:03:20,798
so reason saw that errors should be seen

9576
08:03:20,798 --> 08:03:23,120
as a failure of the system rather than

9577
08:03:23,120 --> 08:03:25,600
the result of one human's actions in the

9578
08:03:25,600 --> 08:03:27,680
system

9579
08:03:27,680 --> 08:03:29,760
so these system errors can be prevented

9580
08:03:29,760 --> 08:03:31,280
as you'll see on the screen there by a

9581
08:03:31,280 --> 08:03:33,120
series of defenses barriers and

9582
08:03:33,120 --> 08:03:35,200
safeguards these are the slices of

9583
08:03:35,200 --> 08:03:36,798
cheese

9584
08:03:36,798 --> 08:03:38,398
defenses are based on the assumption

9585
08:03:38,398 --> 08:03:40,160
that we cannot change the human

9586
08:03:40,160 --> 08:03:41,840
condition but we can change the

9587
08:03:41,840 --> 08:03:44,958
conditions in which humans work under

9588
08:03:44,958 --> 08:03:46,958
in an ideal world each one of these

9589
08:03:46,958 --> 08:03:49,440
defensive layers would be impenetrable

9590
08:03:49,440 --> 08:03:51,600
but in the real world they aren't so

9591
08:03:51,600 --> 08:03:54,000
reasoned likened each one of those to a

9592
08:03:54,000 --> 08:03:55,600
slice of swiss cheese

9593
08:03:55,600 --> 08:03:57,200
it has holes in it

9594
08:03:57,200 --> 08:03:59,520
if an error occurs and gets through one

9595
08:03:59,520 --> 08:04:00,878
hole in the slice of cheese then it

9596
08:04:00,878 --> 08:04:03,200
won't be a big problem as the next slice

9597
08:04:03,200 --> 08:04:04,878
will catch it however sometimes the

9598
08:04:04,878 --> 08:04:07,200
holes can align and cause losses in the

9599
08:04:07,200 --> 08:04:09,040
system or in the case of a healthcare

9600
08:04:09,040 --> 08:04:12,000
system harm to the patient

9601
08:04:12,000 --> 08:04:13,680
so as well as been used in medicine it's

9602
08:04:13,680 --> 08:04:15,520
been used to explain and investigate

9603
08:04:15,520 --> 08:04:17,360
aviation accidents such as the

9604
08:04:17,360 --> 08:04:19,600
challenger space shuttle disaster and

9605
08:04:19,600 --> 08:04:22,000
industrial accidents such as the bhopol

9606
08:04:22,000 --> 08:04:23,920
chemical disaster in india and the

9607
08:04:23,920 --> 08:04:26,160
chernobyl nuclear disaster

9608
08:04:26,160 --> 08:04:27,920
the post analysis of these virtually

9609
08:04:27,920 --> 08:04:29,920
always reveals that the root cause was a

9610
08:04:29,920 --> 08:04:31,360
failure of multiple layers in the

9611
08:04:31,360 --> 08:04:34,478
systems of defenses

9612
08:04:35,520 --> 08:04:37,200
so what can cause the holes in the

9613
08:04:37,200 --> 08:04:39,120
cheese what can cause those to widen to

9614
08:04:39,120 --> 08:04:40,478
move around

9615
08:04:40,478 --> 08:04:42,718
so there's two things active failures

9616
08:04:42,718 --> 08:04:44,478
and latent conditions

9617
08:04:44,478 --> 08:04:46,398
so active failures

9618
08:04:46,398 --> 08:04:48,478
unsafe acts committed by people who are

9619
08:04:48,478 --> 08:04:51,280
in direct contact with the system

9620
08:04:51,280 --> 08:04:52,718
slips

9621
08:04:52,718 --> 08:04:54,398
so these are broken down into these four

9622
08:04:54,398 --> 08:04:56,638
different um parts so slips this is

9623
08:04:56,638 --> 08:04:58,638
where the correct plan is made but is

9624
08:04:58,638 --> 08:05:01,520
incorrectly executed so this is perhaps

9625
08:05:01,520 --> 08:05:02,718
where you meant to drop the kids off at

9626
08:05:02,718 --> 08:05:04,958
school but went to autopilot and took

9627
08:05:04,958 --> 08:05:06,958
the route to work instead

9628
08:05:06,958 --> 08:05:09,040
lapses where you forget to do a step of

9629
08:05:09,040 --> 08:05:11,280
the plan so your home insurance perhaps

9630
08:05:11,280 --> 08:05:13,120
becomes inactive because you failed to

9631
08:05:13,120 --> 08:05:14,798
pay the bill

9632
08:05:14,798 --> 08:05:17,200
mistakes so these are misinterpretations

9633
08:05:17,200 --> 08:05:19,920
of relevant rules so you're interpreted

9634
08:05:19,920 --> 08:05:22,160
your flight checking time as 9 am but

9635
08:05:22,160 --> 08:05:23,680
arrive late

9636
08:05:23,680 --> 08:05:25,600
could be violations and this is where a

9637
08:05:25,600 --> 08:05:27,520
person knows the rules but doesn't

9638
08:05:27,520 --> 08:05:28,798
follow them

9639
08:05:28,798 --> 08:05:30,798
not intentionally to cause harm but

9640
08:05:30,798 --> 08:05:32,318
perhaps to save time or complete a

9641
08:05:32,318 --> 08:05:34,318
priority task

9642
08:05:34,318 --> 08:05:36,080
so example of this is at chernobyl the

9643
08:05:36,080 --> 08:05:38,160
operators wrongly violated plant

9644
08:05:38,160 --> 08:05:40,558
procedures and switched off successive

9645
08:05:40,558 --> 08:05:42,558
safety systems causing the initial

9646
08:05:42,558 --> 08:05:45,200
trigger for the accident

9647
08:05:45,200 --> 08:05:47,120
so the other part of it is latent

9648
08:05:47,120 --> 08:05:49,840
conditions so these latent conditions

9649
08:05:49,840 --> 08:05:52,240
arise from decisions made by designers

9650
08:05:52,240 --> 08:05:54,558
builders procedure writers and top level

9651
08:05:54,558 --> 08:05:55,680
management

9652
08:05:55,680 --> 08:05:58,080
they have two adverse effects that is

9653
08:05:58,080 --> 08:06:00,000
they can create error conditions in the

9654
08:06:00,000 --> 08:06:02,638
local workplace so this could be from

9655
08:06:02,638 --> 08:06:04,478
things like time pressures so you know

9656
08:06:04,478 --> 08:06:07,120
perhaps wanting to complete features and

9657
08:06:07,120 --> 08:06:10,960
not fix vulnerabilities under staffing

9658
08:06:10,960 --> 08:06:15,200
poor supervision or poor communications

9659
08:06:15,200 --> 08:06:17,520
on the other side there's creating the

9660
08:06:17,520 --> 08:06:19,040
latent conditions can create

9661
08:06:19,040 --> 08:06:21,520
long-standing holes in the system

9662
08:06:21,520 --> 08:06:23,520
so this could be deficiencies in the

9663
08:06:23,520 --> 08:06:26,000
design or construction uh ineffective

9664
08:06:26,000 --> 08:06:28,320
equipment unworkable procedures and

9665
08:06:28,320 --> 08:06:29,918
untrustworth worthy alarms and

9666
08:06:29,918 --> 08:06:31,200
indicators

9667
08:06:31,200 --> 08:06:33,122
that last one reminds me of the first

9668
08:06:33,122 --> 08:06:35,040
trial flying lesson that i took and as

9669
08:06:35,040 --> 08:06:37,758
we're we're sat on the on the runway and

9670
08:06:37,758 --> 08:06:39,520
the pilots taking off we just start to

9671
08:06:39,520 --> 08:06:42,000
take off and this alarm starts going and

9672
08:06:42,000 --> 08:06:44,320
i look puzzled at the puzzle of the

9673
08:06:44,320 --> 08:06:46,078
pilot thinking what's what's going on

9674
08:06:46,078 --> 08:06:48,878
here is that normal and um and they say

9675
08:06:48,878 --> 08:06:50,078
to me um

9676
08:06:50,078 --> 08:06:52,160
don't worry that's our stool warning

9677
08:06:52,160 --> 08:06:53,918
indicator and a stall is where you don't

9678
08:06:53,918 --> 08:06:56,160
have enough speed to enough lift to keep

9679
08:06:56,160 --> 08:06:58,558
going up you'll start going down since

9680
08:06:58,558 --> 08:07:00,078
that's perfectly normal on this type of

9681
08:07:00,078 --> 08:07:02,558
aircraft we just ignore that alarm

9682
08:07:02,558 --> 08:07:04,000
that filled me full of a lot of

9683
08:07:04,000 --> 08:07:06,558
confidence

9684
08:07:07,040 --> 08:07:09,438
so yeah the latent conditions

9685
08:07:09,438 --> 08:07:11,360
as perhaps the name suggests these lie

9686
08:07:11,360 --> 08:07:13,438
dormant in the system until they combine

9687
08:07:13,438 --> 08:07:15,438
with one of those active failures to

9688
08:07:15,438 --> 08:07:17,278
create an opportunity for an error to

9689
08:07:17,278 --> 08:07:20,078
occur so unlike active failures which

9690
08:07:20,078 --> 08:07:21,758
can be hard to foresee

9691
08:07:21,758 --> 08:07:24,320
these this dormancy allows us an

9692
08:07:24,320 --> 08:07:26,160
opportunity to spot them and try and

9693
08:07:26,160 --> 08:07:28,718
remove them

9694
08:07:29,918 --> 08:07:32,078
so back to cover as we mentioned a few

9695
08:07:32,078 --> 08:07:33,758
times today it's a good example and this

9696
08:07:33,758 --> 08:07:35,438
is one place where the swiss cheese

9697
08:07:35,438 --> 08:07:36,718
models

9698
08:07:36,718 --> 08:07:38,718
are being applied to

9699
08:07:38,718 --> 08:07:40,640
so as we all love and know and love

9700
08:07:40,640 --> 08:07:42,078
we've got these multiple layers built

9701
08:07:42,078 --> 08:07:44,800
into the defenses uh against covid so

9702
08:07:44,800 --> 08:07:47,598
things like mask wearing hand washing

9703
08:07:47,598 --> 08:07:50,078
testing and vaccines so what sort of

9704
08:07:50,078 --> 08:07:52,160
things could cause potential active

9705
08:07:52,160 --> 08:07:53,200
failures

9706
08:07:53,200 --> 08:07:54,878
people forget their masks perhaps

9707
08:07:54,878 --> 08:07:56,640
leaving them at home like that would be

9708
08:07:56,640 --> 08:07:58,558
an example of a lapse that makes that

9709
08:07:58,558 --> 08:08:00,398
part of the defense ineffective but then

9710
08:08:00,398 --> 08:08:02,398
we've got other layers in the defense

9711
08:08:02,398 --> 08:08:04,000
that'll help us with that

9712
08:08:04,000 --> 08:08:05,840
some possible examples of latent

9713
08:08:05,840 --> 08:08:07,840
conditions in here that could affect the

9714
08:08:07,840 --> 08:08:10,000
defenses so people not knowing to wash

9715
08:08:10,000 --> 08:08:12,320
their hands effectively so perhaps some

9716
08:08:12,320 --> 08:08:13,840
inadequate guidance around that i know

9717
08:08:13,840 --> 08:08:16,238
in the uk they got you to to sing happy

9718
08:08:16,238 --> 08:08:17,680
birthday whilst you were washing your

9719
08:08:17,680 --> 08:08:19,278
hands that you did it for at least 30

9720
08:08:19,278 --> 08:08:21,122
seconds

9721
08:08:21,122 --> 08:08:22,718
um or perhaps it could be um poor

9722
08:08:22,718 --> 08:08:24,640
communications around the different

9723
08:08:24,640 --> 08:08:26,398
covid level rules and obviously that's

9724
08:08:26,398 --> 08:08:28,000
something that here in new zealand you

9725
08:08:28,000 --> 08:08:30,480
know we got really right which is great

9726
08:08:30,480 --> 08:08:33,040
that's just one example of um how um the

9727
08:08:33,040 --> 08:08:37,480
swiss cheese model's been used recently

9728
08:08:37,680 --> 08:08:38,640
so

9729
08:08:38,640 --> 08:08:39,840
next i'm going to start to apply the

9730
08:08:39,840 --> 08:08:42,000
swiss cheese model to to upset so my

9731
08:08:42,000 --> 08:08:43,840
first question when i was looking for a

9732
08:08:43,840 --> 08:08:46,160
topic to talk about was could we apply

9733
08:08:46,160 --> 08:08:48,160
the swiss cheese model to appsec well

9734
08:08:48,160 --> 08:08:49,680
it's been applied in other areas of

9735
08:08:49,680 --> 08:08:51,360
cyber security so i thought it probably

9736
08:08:51,360 --> 08:08:53,438
could and i hope so otherwise this would

9737
08:08:53,438 --> 08:08:56,078
be a really short presentation

9738
08:08:56,078 --> 08:08:57,918
with the swiss cheese model reason was

9739
08:08:57,918 --> 08:08:59,680
trying to move people's thinking from

9740
08:08:59,680 --> 08:09:02,160
treating mistakes as individual errors

9741
08:09:02,160 --> 08:09:05,200
by bad people to a systems approach that

9742
08:09:05,200 --> 08:09:07,680
accepts humans are fallible and mistakes

9743
08:09:07,680 --> 08:09:10,078
are to be expected

9744
08:09:10,078 --> 08:09:11,598
well in application development is it

9745
08:09:11,598 --> 08:09:13,200
human designing the application is a

9746
08:09:13,200 --> 08:09:14,878
developer coding it it's someone

9747
08:09:14,878 --> 08:09:16,398
configuring infrastructure for the

9748
08:09:16,398 --> 08:09:18,320
application to run on and each one of

9749
08:09:18,320 --> 08:09:20,320
those things are prone to a person

9750
08:09:20,320 --> 08:09:22,000
making mistakes

9751
08:09:22,000 --> 08:09:24,000
and in cyber security we also have the

9752
08:09:24,000 --> 08:09:26,398
long standing concept of defense in

9753
08:09:26,398 --> 08:09:29,598
depth which the swiss cheese model talks

9754
08:09:29,598 --> 08:09:31,278
to

9755
08:09:31,278 --> 08:09:33,200
so how can we apply the swish teas model

9756
08:09:33,200 --> 08:09:34,718
to apsec and what would be looking to

9757
08:09:34,718 --> 08:09:38,480
achieve with our cheese slices

9758
08:09:39,758 --> 08:09:40,640
so

9759
08:09:40,640 --> 08:09:41,918
for me as you can see from the diagram

9760
08:09:41,918 --> 08:09:43,438
it's around reducing the risk of

9761
08:09:43,438 --> 08:09:45,438
vulnerabilities or security flaws being

9762
08:09:45,438 --> 08:09:47,122
introduced into that application or

9763
08:09:47,122 --> 08:09:49,122
system under development

9764
08:09:49,122 --> 08:09:50,640
why do we want to remove those risks

9765
08:09:50,640 --> 08:09:52,960
while reducing those risks reduces the

9766
08:09:52,960 --> 08:09:54,640
chance of those vulnerabilities being

9767
08:09:54,640 --> 08:09:56,640
present in the production application

9768
08:09:56,640 --> 08:09:58,640
for an attacker to then actively exploit

9769
08:09:58,640 --> 08:10:00,160
leading to a security incident that

9770
08:10:00,160 --> 08:10:01,840
compromises your assets and causes

9771
08:10:01,840 --> 08:10:04,238
losses

9772
08:10:05,598 --> 08:10:07,520
so what are those risks in an

9773
08:10:07,520 --> 08:10:09,200
application security context that we're

9774
08:10:09,200 --> 08:10:11,520
looking to reduce and what human factors

9775
08:10:11,520 --> 08:10:12,840
play a part in

9776
08:10:12,840 --> 08:10:15,520
them so there's a risk that someone

9777
08:10:15,520 --> 08:10:17,200
creates a security floor in the design

9778
08:10:17,200 --> 08:10:19,200
or architecture in the system so this

9779
08:10:19,200 --> 08:10:21,200
would be considered a latent condition

9780
08:10:21,200 --> 08:10:23,840
floor in the design opening up a hole in

9781
08:10:23,840 --> 08:10:26,878
that slice of cheese

9782
08:10:27,122 --> 08:10:29,040
another risk is that we accidentally

9783
08:10:29,040 --> 08:10:30,398
introduce security issue of

9784
08:10:30,398 --> 08:10:31,840
vulnerability into the code that we

9785
08:10:31,840 --> 08:10:32,718
write

9786
08:10:32,718 --> 08:10:34,000
so this could be down to an act of

9787
08:10:34,000 --> 08:10:36,480
failure perhaps a lapse by a developer

9788
08:10:36,480 --> 08:10:38,878
for getting to use an input sanitization

9789
08:10:38,878 --> 08:10:41,122
function or forgetting to remove a

9790
08:10:41,122 --> 08:10:43,918
hard-coded api key

9791
08:10:43,918 --> 08:10:45,520
or it could be a violation a developer

9792
08:10:45,520 --> 08:10:47,758
knew he needed to introduce a bit more

9793
08:10:47,758 --> 08:10:49,278
they needed to introduce a bit more code

9794
08:10:49,278 --> 08:10:51,122
into the function to secure it but they

9795
08:10:51,122 --> 08:10:52,878
were under time pressure so they didn't

9796
08:10:52,878 --> 08:10:54,398
which perhaps also talks to some of the

9797
08:10:54,398 --> 08:10:56,480
latent conditions around

9798
08:10:56,480 --> 08:10:58,800
those time pressures

9799
08:10:58,800 --> 08:11:00,398
another risk is that we bring in a

9800
08:11:00,398 --> 08:11:02,640
supply chain based vulnerability we've

9801
08:11:02,640 --> 08:11:04,160
talked about a few of those things in

9802
08:11:04,160 --> 08:11:05,598
the in the presentations today and

9803
08:11:05,598 --> 08:11:07,438
yesterday

9804
08:11:07,438 --> 08:11:09,598
this could be a slip by developer for

9805
08:11:09,598 --> 08:11:11,520
getting to upgrade to the latest version

9806
08:11:11,520 --> 08:11:13,438
of a dependency leading to an older

9807
08:11:13,438 --> 08:11:14,640
version being users perhaps has

9808
08:11:14,640 --> 08:11:16,160
vulnerabilities in it

9809
08:11:16,160 --> 08:11:18,160
it could be that you've selected an open

9810
08:11:18,160 --> 08:11:20,160
source project that does what it needs

9811
08:11:20,160 --> 08:11:22,480
you to do it needs the system to do from

9812
08:11:22,480 --> 08:11:24,398
a functionality point of view but isn't

9813
08:11:24,398 --> 08:11:25,918
that well maintained and doesn't get

9814
08:11:25,918 --> 08:11:28,238
security fixes in a timely manner

9815
08:11:28,238 --> 08:11:29,598
for me that's probably like a latent

9816
08:11:29,598 --> 08:11:31,360
condition the equivalent of choosing

9817
08:11:31,360 --> 08:11:34,160
poor equipment in the system

9818
08:11:34,160 --> 08:11:36,238
there's a risk that you inadvertently

9819
08:11:36,238 --> 08:11:38,640
put a security issue or vulnerability

9820
08:11:38,640 --> 08:11:40,000
into infrastructure setup and

9821
08:11:40,000 --> 08:11:42,480
configuration so that could be applied

9822
08:11:42,480 --> 08:11:44,398
to um traditional on premium

9823
08:11:44,398 --> 08:11:47,040
infrastructure or infrastructure as code

9824
08:11:47,040 --> 08:11:48,718
so in the infrastructure as code world

9825
08:11:48,718 --> 08:11:50,160
perhaps the

9826
08:11:50,160 --> 08:11:52,800
configure has elapsed and accidentally

9827
08:11:52,800 --> 08:11:55,040
set up an s3 bucket as public when

9828
08:11:55,040 --> 08:11:56,718
you're meant to set it to private or

9829
08:11:56,718 --> 08:11:59,200
perhaps a violation so not following the

9830
08:11:59,200 --> 08:12:01,278
correct procedure and removing unused

9831
08:12:01,278 --> 08:12:03,918
ports or services for the application

9832
08:12:03,918 --> 08:12:05,918
goes to production and that leads to one

9833
08:12:05,918 --> 08:12:09,122
being left open which is vulnerable

9834
08:12:09,122 --> 08:12:10,558
and then finally we've got a risk of

9835
08:12:10,558 --> 08:12:12,800
somebody maliciously introducing a

9836
08:12:12,800 --> 08:12:14,960
security issue so this could be you know

9837
08:12:14,960 --> 08:12:17,278
your malicious insider

9838
08:12:17,278 --> 08:12:18,878
it could also potentially be an attacker

9839
08:12:18,878 --> 08:12:21,040
that's already got um inside your

9840
08:12:21,040 --> 08:12:22,480
network

9841
08:12:22,480 --> 08:12:24,160
for me this probably like fits into a

9842
08:12:24,160 --> 08:12:27,122
violation under sort of the model

9843
08:12:27,122 --> 08:12:29,278
but with an intent to cause harm

9844
08:12:29,278 --> 08:12:30,800
and that talks as well i think the

9845
08:12:30,800 --> 08:12:32,718
latent conditions around what led to

9846
08:12:32,718 --> 08:12:34,878
that person wanting to maliciously

9847
08:12:34,878 --> 08:12:38,238
introduce a security issue

9848
08:12:38,558 --> 08:12:40,238
so what does the landscape look like in

9849
08:12:40,238 --> 08:12:43,122
applications and systems development so

9850
08:12:43,122 --> 08:12:45,122
in the top in orange there we've got the

9851
08:12:45,122 --> 08:12:48,078
typical waterfall kind of a longer kind

9852
08:12:48,078 --> 08:12:50,640
of development process uh longer

9853
08:12:50,640 --> 08:12:52,160
iterations

9854
08:12:52,160 --> 08:12:54,000
with the different phases

9855
08:12:54,000 --> 08:12:56,078
and then in the blue there we've got the

9856
08:12:56,078 --> 08:12:58,718
more modern kind of ci cd world

9857
08:12:58,718 --> 08:13:00,398
where the goal is to release features to

9858
08:13:00,398 --> 08:13:02,160
the customer faster and more frequently

9859
08:13:02,160 --> 08:13:04,640
in smaller iterations than waterfall so

9860
08:13:04,640 --> 08:13:06,878
we've got that continuing uh continuous

9861
08:13:06,878 --> 08:13:08,718
integration loop where you've got coding

9862
08:13:08,718 --> 08:13:10,320
building testing

9863
08:13:10,320 --> 08:13:12,878
if the test finds functional issues then

9864
08:13:12,878 --> 08:13:14,640
you code again you build again you test

9865
08:13:14,640 --> 08:13:16,238
it again and then once you're ready to

9866
08:13:16,238 --> 08:13:18,800
go to release once um your builds

9867
08:13:18,800 --> 08:13:21,200
succeed then you go towards releasing

9868
08:13:21,200 --> 08:13:22,718
deploying that and then once it's

9869
08:13:22,718 --> 08:13:24,960
released operating and monitoring that

9870
08:13:24,960 --> 08:13:26,558
and each one of those stages gives us

9871
08:13:26,558 --> 08:13:28,718
opportunities to introduce defenses

9872
08:13:28,718 --> 08:13:30,800
those slices of cheese to try and

9873
08:13:30,800 --> 08:13:33,278
mitigate or reduce these risks

9874
08:13:33,278 --> 08:13:34,800
this is the first really expensive

9875
08:13:34,800 --> 08:13:37,918
graphic that cost us a lot to to make so

9876
08:13:37,918 --> 08:13:39,200
um

9877
08:13:39,200 --> 08:13:40,640
i would say though it's still cheaper

9878
08:13:40,640 --> 08:13:42,800
than buying a block of actual cheese in

9879
08:13:42,800 --> 08:13:45,840
new zealand

9880
08:13:47,200 --> 08:13:49,680
so this is quite a busy slide so i'm

9881
08:13:49,680 --> 08:13:52,000
going to talk you through a couple of

9882
08:13:52,000 --> 08:13:54,878
scenarios um for this one

9883
08:13:54,878 --> 08:13:56,160
so i'm going to use a laser as well

9884
08:13:56,160 --> 08:13:57,438
there you go look at that

9885
08:13:57,438 --> 08:13:59,918
so we've got two two arrows here um

9886
08:13:59,918 --> 08:14:01,278
we've got the top arrow and the bottom

9887
08:14:01,278 --> 08:14:03,520
arrow so there's two scenarios that i'm

9888
08:14:03,520 --> 08:14:04,878
going to walk you through

9889
08:14:04,878 --> 08:14:08,480
and so the top arrow is where a

9890
08:14:08,480 --> 08:14:11,360
developer has

9891
08:14:11,360 --> 08:14:14,640
used a javascript eval function which is

9892
08:14:14,640 --> 08:14:16,238
the the root of a lot of evil in

9893
08:14:16,238 --> 08:14:18,000
javascript it's a horrible thing you

9894
08:14:18,000 --> 08:14:19,598
shouldn't be using it

9895
08:14:19,598 --> 08:14:21,278
perhaps they lapped and they forgot to

9896
08:14:21,278 --> 08:14:23,122
read your coding standards guide where

9897
08:14:23,122 --> 08:14:25,758
on page 70 out of 100 it told you you're

9898
08:14:25,758 --> 08:14:28,000
really not meant to use um that

9899
08:14:28,000 --> 08:14:29,680
particular function

9900
08:14:29,680 --> 08:14:31,360
so we've got two layers of cheese there

9901
08:14:31,360 --> 08:14:33,438
that could um help prevent

9902
08:14:33,438 --> 08:14:36,078
um that sort of vulnerability the first

9903
08:14:36,078 --> 08:14:38,320
two though they're more aimed at

9904
08:14:38,320 --> 08:14:40,480
preventing design floors creeping into

9905
08:14:40,480 --> 08:14:42,320
the system so threat modeling we saw a

9906
08:14:42,320 --> 08:14:44,398
really good presentation earlier um that

9907
08:14:44,398 --> 08:14:45,840
discussed what threat modeling is i'm a

9908
08:14:45,840 --> 08:14:47,278
really big advocate of it i think it's

9909
08:14:47,278 --> 08:14:49,680
really effective in working in working

9910
08:14:49,680 --> 08:14:51,278
with the team helping train the team up

9911
08:14:51,278 --> 08:14:52,238
as well

9912
08:14:52,238 --> 08:14:55,278
and and finding the possible threats um

9913
08:14:55,278 --> 08:14:57,360
to that system while it's still um under

9914
08:14:57,360 --> 08:14:59,598
design

9915
08:14:59,598 --> 08:15:01,840
but in this case yeah it's not meant to

9916
08:15:01,840 --> 08:15:03,758
prevent sort of those coding errors so

9917
08:15:03,758 --> 08:15:05,520
it goes through that slice of cheese the

9918
08:15:05,520 --> 08:15:07,438
next one we've got there is design

9919
08:15:07,438 --> 08:15:09,360
reviews so this is where a security

9920
08:15:09,360 --> 08:15:11,200
expert typically you know takes a step

9921
08:15:11,200 --> 08:15:13,200
back and a look at the

9922
08:15:13,200 --> 08:15:15,200
design of the system and looks at any

9923
08:15:15,200 --> 08:15:16,718
potential

9924
08:15:16,718 --> 08:15:19,520
for design flaws in that so again it's

9925
08:15:19,520 --> 08:15:20,878
not the right tool for the job in this

9926
08:15:20,878 --> 08:15:22,960
case but the first thing that will help

9927
08:15:22,960 --> 08:15:25,758
us in this situation is our sas and so

9928
08:15:25,758 --> 08:15:27,438
that's static application security

9929
08:15:27,438 --> 08:15:30,078
testing so that's white box with access

9930
08:15:30,078 --> 08:15:32,238
to the source code you've got a scanner

9931
08:15:32,238 --> 08:15:34,078
that's going through the your code and

9932
08:15:34,078 --> 08:15:34,960
checking for these sorts of

9933
08:15:34,960 --> 08:15:36,718
vulnerabilities

9934
08:15:36,718 --> 08:15:38,480
it's done this is the kind of the

9935
08:15:38,480 --> 08:15:40,480
earliest point to do it which is still

9936
08:15:40,480 --> 08:15:42,000
when you're writing code before you've

9937
08:15:42,000 --> 08:15:43,680
committed that code so this is where

9938
08:15:43,680 --> 08:15:45,360
it's done in your integrated development

9939
08:15:45,360 --> 08:15:47,360
environment so we're doing it early so

9940
08:15:47,360 --> 08:15:49,200
that whole shift left mentality and the

9941
08:15:49,200 --> 08:15:51,520
earlier we do it then that the more

9942
08:15:51,520 --> 08:15:53,040
effects we get out of it and the cheaper

9943
08:15:53,040 --> 08:15:55,758
it is to to fix and spot those flaws so

9944
08:15:55,758 --> 08:15:58,160
in this case we run around that tool it

9945
08:15:58,160 --> 08:16:00,160
found that javascript eval function it

9946
08:16:00,160 --> 08:16:02,000
flagged it up to the developer and then

9947
08:16:02,000 --> 08:16:03,438
the developer before he's committed the

9948
08:16:03,438 --> 08:16:05,438
code can go and fix that

9949
08:16:05,438 --> 08:16:07,758
so that's a win that's great

9950
08:16:07,758 --> 08:16:10,238
this second one is uh yeah i'm gonna use

9951
08:16:10,238 --> 08:16:12,160
a little bit of an edge case here um so

9952
08:16:12,160 --> 08:16:13,758
i totally agree with what um tim said

9953
08:16:13,758 --> 08:16:15,278
yesterday which is a lot of modern

9954
08:16:15,278 --> 08:16:17,360
frameworks help prevent um this sort of

9955
08:16:17,360 --> 08:16:19,840
thing which is that um

9956
08:16:19,840 --> 08:16:22,640
the developer has been tasked to write a

9957
08:16:22,640 --> 08:16:24,480
piece of functionality to enable rich

9958
08:16:24,480 --> 08:16:25,918
text areas in the system so this is

9959
08:16:25,918 --> 08:16:27,758
where they're going to be looking to

9960
08:16:27,758 --> 08:16:30,160
have like tags in your

9961
08:16:30,160 --> 08:16:32,078
text areas on on the page so like a text

9962
08:16:32,078 --> 08:16:34,718
editor and in order to do that they need

9963
08:16:34,718 --> 08:16:37,598
to change the rule set um that would

9964
08:16:37,598 --> 08:16:39,438
ordinarily prevent those kind of um

9965
08:16:39,438 --> 08:16:40,878
script potential sort of script

9966
08:16:40,878 --> 08:16:43,200
injection uh points for things like

9967
08:16:43,200 --> 08:16:47,598
injecting malicious sql or xsa xss data

9968
08:16:47,598 --> 08:16:49,040
and in this case they need to kind of

9969
08:16:49,040 --> 08:16:51,040
loosen the um

9970
08:16:51,040 --> 08:16:52,800
they need to create and allow us rather

9971
08:16:52,800 --> 08:16:54,480
to allow certain

9972
08:16:54,480 --> 08:16:55,598
of these

9973
08:16:55,598 --> 08:16:57,122
tags through

9974
08:16:57,122 --> 08:16:58,800
so again like before threat modeling and

9975
08:16:58,800 --> 08:17:00,878
design reviews as this is a risk that

9976
08:17:00,878 --> 08:17:02,320
we're introducing a vulnerability into

9977
08:17:02,320 --> 08:17:04,398
the code don't really help us here

9978
08:17:04,398 --> 08:17:06,078
but the the first thing that it will hit

9979
08:17:06,078 --> 08:17:07,918
is again that static application

9980
08:17:07,918 --> 08:17:09,520
security testing

9981
08:17:09,520 --> 08:17:11,122
well in this case you know typically

9982
08:17:11,122 --> 08:17:13,122
these tools don't look that deep into

9983
08:17:13,122 --> 08:17:14,398
the config of how

9984
08:17:14,398 --> 08:17:15,918
you've configured

9985
08:17:15,918 --> 08:17:16,640
that

9986
08:17:16,640 --> 08:17:18,000
that sort of validation that input

9987
08:17:18,000 --> 08:17:19,520
validation they just really check

9988
08:17:19,520 --> 08:17:21,278
they're there so in this case it's not

9989
08:17:21,278 --> 08:17:23,200
been that effective

9990
08:17:23,200 --> 08:17:25,200
the next slice of cheese we've got is

9991
08:17:25,200 --> 08:17:27,200
secret scanning and so secret scanning

9992
08:17:27,200 --> 08:17:29,598
perhaps using a tool like um truffle hog

9993
08:17:29,598 --> 08:17:31,680
um that that dylan spoke about um

9994
08:17:31,680 --> 08:17:33,122
yesterday

9995
08:17:33,122 --> 08:17:35,360
great tool for checking for the secrets

9996
08:17:35,360 --> 08:17:38,238
so things like um hardcoded api keys ssh

9997
08:17:38,238 --> 08:17:40,238
keys that sort of thing but again it's

9998
08:17:40,238 --> 08:17:42,000
not the right tool for the job to to

9999
08:17:42,000 --> 08:17:44,320
spot this um error uh this one

10000
08:17:44,320 --> 08:17:45,680
vulnerability has been put into

10001
08:17:45,680 --> 08:17:47,520
accidentally into the code

10002
08:17:47,520 --> 08:17:49,520
we've got code reviews next so this is

10003
08:17:49,520 --> 08:17:51,680
where you've got um eyes on other

10004
08:17:51,680 --> 08:17:53,122
colleagues of yours you're doing a peer

10005
08:17:53,122 --> 08:17:55,040
review of your code

10006
08:17:55,040 --> 08:17:57,122
and yeah great another great opportunity

10007
08:17:57,122 --> 08:18:00,480
to to spot this sort of vulnerability

10008
08:18:00,480 --> 08:18:02,000
but it takes a lot of training you know

10009
08:18:02,000 --> 08:18:04,640
it's um it's quite a specialist um sort

10010
08:18:04,640 --> 08:18:06,398
of subject to find you know these sort

10011
08:18:06,398 --> 08:18:07,758
of um

10012
08:18:07,758 --> 08:18:10,558
code flaws and so perhaps in this case

10013
08:18:10,558 --> 08:18:12,160
you know that team didn't have that sort

10014
08:18:12,160 --> 08:18:13,758
of training they were just looking more

10015
08:18:13,758 --> 08:18:15,840
for those functional um errors rather

10016
08:18:15,840 --> 08:18:17,598
than security errors so it goes through

10017
08:18:17,598 --> 08:18:20,640
that slice of cheese

10018
08:18:20,640 --> 08:18:22,800
now we've got the sas tool um running

10019
08:18:22,800 --> 08:18:24,320
again but we know that that you know

10020
08:18:24,320 --> 08:18:25,840
wasn't effective in the first place and

10021
08:18:25,840 --> 08:18:27,840
so this is where it's running in a build

10022
08:18:27,840 --> 08:18:30,160
pipeline so it's running automated and

10023
08:18:30,160 --> 08:18:31,840
then it's returning your result just

10024
08:18:31,840 --> 08:18:33,438
like with um

10025
08:18:33,438 --> 08:18:34,878
features where you get

10026
08:18:34,878 --> 08:18:37,200
errors with features it'll it'll stop

10027
08:18:37,200 --> 08:18:41,200
your um pipeline and and cause you to

10028
08:18:41,200 --> 08:18:43,360
you know down tools fix that and away we

10029
08:18:43,360 --> 08:18:45,200
go but in this case it doesn't work the

10030
08:18:45,200 --> 08:18:46,558
other thing that we can do at this point

10031
08:18:46,558 --> 08:18:48,558
again run as an automated tool is that

10032
08:18:48,558 --> 08:18:50,960
software composition analysis so this is

10033
08:18:50,960 --> 08:18:52,800
really good for catching those

10034
08:18:52,800 --> 08:18:54,320
dependencies that have pre-existing

10035
08:18:54,320 --> 08:18:56,320
vulnerabilities and again breaking your

10036
08:18:56,320 --> 08:18:57,918
build so that you can

10037
08:18:57,918 --> 08:19:01,360
fix those perhaps update them

10038
08:19:01,438 --> 08:19:03,438
container and image scanning again not

10039
08:19:03,438 --> 08:19:05,040
quite the right tool for the job so this

10040
08:19:05,040 --> 08:19:06,718
is really good at spotting those

10041
08:19:06,718 --> 08:19:08,640
infrastructure

10042
08:19:08,640 --> 08:19:10,238
and misconfigurations

10043
08:19:10,238 --> 08:19:12,878
in your infrastructure as code

10044
08:19:12,878 --> 08:19:14,960
sorry this is really good at spotting

10045
08:19:14,960 --> 08:19:16,720
where your containers have been

10046
08:19:16,720 --> 08:19:19,520
misconfigured and

10047
08:19:19,520 --> 08:19:20,880
allowing you again to change that

10048
08:19:20,880 --> 08:19:22,320
configuration

10049
08:19:22,320 --> 08:19:24,160
and then you've got policy as code so

10050
08:19:24,160 --> 08:19:26,080
policy as code is really good at

10051
08:19:26,080 --> 08:19:27,916
spotting those misconfigurations in your

10052
08:19:27,916 --> 08:19:31,040
infrastructure as code and yep again

10053
08:19:31,040 --> 08:19:33,436
getting the team to fix them

10054
08:19:33,436 --> 08:19:35,360
so what does catch

10055
08:19:35,360 --> 08:19:37,436
this particular vulnerability is your

10056
08:19:37,436 --> 08:19:39,360
dast which is your dynamic application

10057
08:19:39,360 --> 08:19:41,520
security testing so this is where you've

10058
08:19:41,520 --> 08:19:43,756
got a tool perhaps like the osap

10059
08:19:43,756 --> 08:19:45,520
that's

10060
08:19:45,520 --> 08:19:46,960
working like a hacker word to attacking

10061
08:19:46,960 --> 08:19:49,436
the application like a hacker would um

10062
08:19:49,436 --> 08:19:51,596
where it's running where it's um

10063
08:19:51,596 --> 08:19:53,840
and one of the things it does is it uh

10064
08:19:53,840 --> 08:19:55,436
fuzzes the inputs we had to talk about

10065
08:19:55,436 --> 08:19:57,360
fuzzing earlier so it fusses the inputs

10066
08:19:57,360 --> 08:19:58,880
and this sort of thing would find that

10067
08:19:58,880 --> 08:20:00,320
sort of vulnerability so this is going

10068
08:20:00,320 --> 08:20:02,640
to perhaps spot where that allow list

10069
08:20:02,640 --> 08:20:04,880
for the tags for this rich text area was

10070
08:20:04,880 --> 08:20:06,480
just a little bit too too wide too

10071
08:20:06,480 --> 08:20:09,040
permissive and it stops it

10072
08:20:09,040 --> 08:20:10,640
so it's gone through quite a few layers

10073
08:20:10,640 --> 08:20:12,080
of cheese ideally we want to catch that

10074
08:20:12,080 --> 08:20:14,400
earlier but we have eventually caught it

10075
08:20:14,400 --> 08:20:17,276
which is great i'm going to just briefly

10076
08:20:17,276 --> 08:20:19,360
talk about some of the other parts in

10077
08:20:19,360 --> 08:20:20,880
there so we've got

10078
08:20:20,880 --> 08:20:22,080
signing

10079
08:20:22,080 --> 08:20:24,160
which is where you're assigning the

10080
08:20:24,160 --> 08:20:26,080
container image or your xc of your

10081
08:20:26,080 --> 08:20:28,640
application and this is quite good at

10082
08:20:28,640 --> 08:20:31,360
spotting where and potentially like an

10083
08:20:31,360 --> 08:20:33,040
attacker or a malicious insider has

10084
08:20:33,040 --> 08:20:35,916
swapped out your container or xc for one

10085
08:20:35,916 --> 08:20:38,240
that has malicious software in it a

10086
08:20:38,240 --> 08:20:41,200
malicious code in it rather

10087
08:20:41,200 --> 08:20:42,960
we've got the network and container scan

10088
08:20:42,960 --> 08:20:44,800
so we can run container scanning again

10089
08:20:44,800 --> 08:20:47,436
just before we release and deploy that

10090
08:20:47,436 --> 08:20:49,520
it's cheap relatively cheap to run so

10091
08:20:49,520 --> 08:20:51,756
it's good point to run at we've also got

10092
08:20:51,756 --> 08:20:53,840
um the network scanning there so this is

10093
08:20:53,840 --> 08:20:56,160
using a tool perhaps like nessus

10094
08:20:56,160 --> 08:20:59,040
to check the infrastructure setup again

10095
08:20:59,040 --> 08:21:00,800
as an attacker words

10096
08:21:00,800 --> 08:21:02,480
black box this time

10097
08:21:02,480 --> 08:21:04,720
and and finding those flaws perhaps in

10098
08:21:04,720 --> 08:21:07,200
the infrastructure set up

10099
08:21:07,200 --> 08:21:09,276
the next one along is pen testing and

10100
08:21:09,276 --> 08:21:10,640
this again this would have been a

10101
08:21:10,640 --> 08:21:13,040
backstop if that dast hadn't caught that

10102
08:21:13,040 --> 08:21:15,120
issue in the code this is another point

10103
08:21:15,120 --> 08:21:16,800
where we've got those multiple layers of

10104
08:21:16,800 --> 08:21:18,800
cheese this one would have caught that

10105
08:21:18,800 --> 08:21:20,160
so that's where you've got you know

10106
08:21:20,160 --> 08:21:22,320
skilled um

10107
08:21:22,320 --> 08:21:23,436
security professionals you know

10108
08:21:23,436 --> 08:21:25,120
attacking the application again as an

10109
08:21:25,120 --> 08:21:26,880
attacker would and finding these sorts

10110
08:21:26,880 --> 08:21:27,916
of flaws

10111
08:21:27,916 --> 08:21:29,596
next one is you've got vulnerability

10112
08:21:29,596 --> 08:21:32,640
management um so this again is is around

10113
08:21:32,640 --> 08:21:34,480
your um software composition analysis

10114
08:21:34,480 --> 08:21:36,480
but this is more looking at your

10115
08:21:36,480 --> 08:21:38,240
operating system making sure that's been

10116
08:21:38,240 --> 08:21:40,560
patched and kept up to date

10117
08:21:40,560 --> 08:21:42,000
and perhaps some of the components that

10118
08:21:42,000 --> 08:21:44,880
make up that operating system as well

10119
08:21:44,880 --> 08:21:46,720
and then last but not least we've got um

10120
08:21:46,720 --> 08:21:48,400
compliance checks

10121
08:21:48,400 --> 08:21:51,120
so this is something like the aws ccr

10122
08:21:51,120 --> 08:21:52,240
for instance

10123
08:21:52,240 --> 08:21:54,480
running on on a continual basis as with

10124
08:21:54,480 --> 08:21:56,480
the vulnerability management before and

10125
08:21:56,480 --> 08:21:58,800
checking to ensure that your

10126
08:21:58,800 --> 08:22:00,720
infrastructure set up and meets best

10127
08:22:00,720 --> 08:22:03,276
security practices

10128
08:22:03,276 --> 08:22:05,520
so one of the things that this could be

10129
08:22:05,520 --> 08:22:08,240
used for as a model is for blameless

10130
08:22:08,240 --> 08:22:11,276
post-mortems so again the focus here

10131
08:22:11,276 --> 08:22:12,560
when you look at perhaps an incident

10132
08:22:12,560 --> 08:22:15,200
like that bottom arrows is why didn't

10133
08:22:15,200 --> 08:22:18,000
our defenses catch those vulnerabilities

10134
08:22:18,000 --> 08:22:19,520
rather than you know why did that

10135
08:22:19,520 --> 08:22:21,520
developer put that you know use that

10136
08:22:21,520 --> 08:22:22,480
particular

10137
08:22:22,480 --> 08:22:24,240
dangerous function in the first place or

10138
08:22:24,240 --> 08:22:25,916
why did they you know allow to

10139
08:22:25,916 --> 08:22:28,400
permissive allow list so that's probably

10140
08:22:28,400 --> 08:22:33,480
a really good use for this sort of model

10141
08:22:36,640 --> 08:22:37,360
so

10142
08:22:37,360 --> 08:22:39,040
we've done all that uh we've got all

10143
08:22:39,040 --> 08:22:41,040
those slices of cheese in place you know

10144
08:22:41,040 --> 08:22:42,960
what can still go wrong and how can we

10145
08:22:42,960 --> 08:22:45,360
um prevent that so one of the things is

10146
08:22:45,360 --> 08:22:47,680
is not considering early security early

10147
08:22:47,680 --> 08:22:49,120
or on changes

10148
08:22:49,120 --> 08:22:50,720
in the design so this is perhaps not

10149
08:22:50,720 --> 08:22:52,800
threat metal modeling early or

10150
08:22:52,800 --> 08:22:54,960
conducting system design security design

10151
08:22:54,960 --> 08:22:57,200
reviews early um meaning that one of

10152
08:22:57,200 --> 08:22:59,120
those security deficiencies you know

10153
08:22:59,120 --> 08:23:01,200
creeps in early in the design phase and

10154
08:23:01,200 --> 08:23:02,880
it's as mentioned before it's also there

10155
08:23:02,880 --> 08:23:04,560
where you get really most benefit from

10156
08:23:04,560 --> 08:23:05,840
shifting left so you're not ending up

10157
08:23:05,840 --> 08:23:07,916
having to redesign a system and because

10158
08:23:07,916 --> 08:23:10,080
you found that security floor um too

10159
08:23:10,080 --> 08:23:11,040
late

10160
08:23:11,040 --> 08:23:12,800
and then the next one is not considering

10161
08:23:12,800 --> 08:23:15,120
security on changes perhaps in your

10162
08:23:15,120 --> 08:23:16,480
stories

10163
08:23:16,480 --> 08:23:17,840
and one of the things i've seen here

10164
08:23:17,840 --> 08:23:20,480
work quite well is security guard rails

10165
08:23:20,480 --> 08:23:22,080
um which is where you have a set of

10166
08:23:22,080 --> 08:23:24,240
questions uh the team can ask themselves

10167
08:23:24,240 --> 08:23:26,480
when they're refining those stories um

10168
08:23:26,480 --> 08:23:27,916
so it could be things like you know does

10169
08:23:27,916 --> 08:23:29,596
this change uh

10170
08:23:29,596 --> 08:23:31,840
affect effective

10171
08:23:31,840 --> 08:23:34,080
access permissions or is it likely to

10172
08:23:34,080 --> 08:23:35,596
change a threat model or does it

10173
08:23:35,596 --> 08:23:37,916
introduce another attack surface and so

10174
08:23:37,916 --> 08:23:42,080
if so consult with a security specialist

10175
08:23:42,080 --> 08:23:45,040
the other thing i've seen in practice is

10176
08:23:45,040 --> 08:23:46,720
setting the threshold for the scanning

10177
08:23:46,720 --> 08:23:48,720
tools um too high

10178
08:23:48,720 --> 08:23:51,680
so this is um where

10179
08:23:51,680 --> 08:23:53,436
perhaps the focus has been on just

10180
08:23:53,436 --> 08:23:54,880
criticals and highs and they are not

10181
08:23:54,880 --> 08:23:56,720
looking at the mediums and as we know

10182
08:23:56,720 --> 08:23:58,640
quite often those mediums can be chained

10183
08:23:58,640 --> 08:24:00,560
together and you know be the equivalent

10184
08:24:00,560 --> 08:24:02,800
of a more serious vulnerability so make

10185
08:24:02,800 --> 08:24:04,560
sure you're setting those um those

10186
08:24:04,560 --> 08:24:06,640
thresholds similarly you know keep the

10187
08:24:06,640 --> 08:24:09,436
policies for that and the policy is code

10188
08:24:09,436 --> 08:24:11,916
checks and the compliance checks you

10189
08:24:11,916 --> 08:24:14,320
know up to date

10190
08:24:14,320 --> 08:24:15,840
and also here you know there's that need

10191
08:24:15,840 --> 08:24:17,916
as with any security tooling and the sas

10192
08:24:17,916 --> 08:24:20,320
tools the death tools the sca they will

10193
08:24:20,320 --> 08:24:22,720
find false positives so they do need

10194
08:24:22,720 --> 08:24:24,880
some investment in terms of tuning and

10195
08:24:24,880 --> 08:24:26,160
those scanning tools to remove those

10196
08:24:26,160 --> 08:24:29,120
false positives

10197
08:24:29,120 --> 08:24:30,800
lack of supervision and guidance for the

10198
08:24:30,800 --> 08:24:33,436
practice based activities so

10199
08:24:33,436 --> 08:24:34,720
some of the activities like threat

10200
08:24:34,720 --> 08:24:36,720
modelling you know they do require quite

10201
08:24:36,720 --> 08:24:38,400
a bit of training in those procedures

10202
08:24:38,400 --> 08:24:40,640
like stride and it's also something

10203
08:24:40,640 --> 08:24:42,800
that's a practice rather than a tool so

10204
08:24:42,800 --> 08:24:45,436
you can't really automate it

10205
08:24:45,436 --> 08:24:48,160
and so it's easily easy to forget to do

10206
08:24:48,160 --> 08:24:49,916
so perhaps having that as one of the

10207
08:24:49,916 --> 08:24:52,000
must haves that you need to do before

10208
08:24:52,000 --> 08:24:54,080
you're allowed to input code into

10209
08:24:54,080 --> 08:24:55,200
production

10210
08:24:55,200 --> 08:24:56,880
we'll help try and prevent that because

10211
08:24:56,880 --> 08:24:59,120
if the team knows it's a precondition

10212
08:24:59,120 --> 08:25:01,120
for going live then it'll benefit the

10213
08:25:01,120 --> 08:25:02,800
team to get it done early to prevent

10214
08:25:02,800 --> 08:25:05,200
delays and going live

10215
08:25:05,200 --> 08:25:07,276
training there yeah also plays a big

10216
08:25:07,276 --> 08:25:08,560
part in getting the most out of those

10217
08:25:08,560 --> 08:25:11,840
security code reviews that i mentioned

10218
08:25:12,320 --> 08:25:14,800
next up we've got a reliance on on

10219
08:25:14,800 --> 08:25:17,040
humans to fix the vulnerabilities so

10220
08:25:17,040 --> 08:25:17,916
those

10221
08:25:17,916 --> 08:25:19,436
and those humans are going to be subject

10222
08:25:19,436 --> 08:25:21,120
to those time pressures to deliver

10223
08:25:21,120 --> 08:25:22,400
functionality

10224
08:25:22,400 --> 08:25:23,916
and that might mean that those security

10225
08:25:23,916 --> 08:25:26,080
fixes get rushed or completely missed

10226
08:25:26,080 --> 08:25:29,040
which we've all seen in practice now now

10227
08:25:29,040 --> 08:25:30,560
so my suggestion here is is tracking the

10228
08:25:30,560 --> 08:25:32,320
work for those fixes you know just as

10229
08:25:32,320 --> 08:25:34,560
you would you know a fun

10230
08:25:34,560 --> 08:25:37,120
piece of functionality or a fix to a

10231
08:25:37,120 --> 08:25:38,800
piece of functionality that's broken and

10232
08:25:38,800 --> 08:25:40,640
give it that visibility flag those

10233
08:25:40,640 --> 08:25:42,480
stories as security specific or having

10234
08:25:42,480 --> 08:25:44,880
an impact on security so the trends in

10235
08:25:44,880 --> 08:25:47,040
time to close them can be spotted

10236
08:25:47,040 --> 08:25:48,720
and tooling can help out here often you

10237
08:25:48,720 --> 08:25:50,480
know some of the scanning tools you know

10238
08:25:50,480 --> 08:25:52,320
provide those sort of metrics as well

10239
08:25:52,320 --> 08:25:53,520
and the point here is that if you spot

10240
08:25:53,520 --> 08:25:54,960
those trends you know don't punish those

10241
08:25:54,960 --> 08:25:56,320
teams they're probably the ones that

10242
08:25:56,320 --> 08:25:57,436
need some help you know maybe they're

10243
08:25:57,436 --> 08:25:59,756
struggling to to on the best way to fix

10244
08:25:59,756 --> 08:26:01,596
those vulnerabilities to get a security

10245
08:26:01,596 --> 08:26:04,840
specialist in and help them fix

10246
08:26:04,840 --> 08:26:07,436
those so the lack of skilled security

10247
08:26:07,436 --> 08:26:08,640
specialists

10248
08:26:08,640 --> 08:26:10,320
um this is you know one of those latent

10249
08:26:10,320 --> 08:26:12,080
conditions you know not having adequate

10250
08:26:12,080 --> 08:26:14,640
um staffing

10251
08:26:14,640 --> 08:26:15,840
here's somewhere where security

10252
08:26:15,840 --> 08:26:17,596
champions programs can really help here

10253
08:26:17,596 --> 08:26:19,520
so this is getting volunteers from

10254
08:26:19,520 --> 08:26:21,520
within the organization from different

10255
08:26:21,520 --> 08:26:23,520
roles to be trained up in security and

10256
08:26:23,520 --> 08:26:27,200
to be the local focus for security and

10257
08:26:27,200 --> 08:26:28,800
someone who's got enough knowledge you

10258
08:26:28,800 --> 08:26:30,480
know to help hopefully on the spot but

10259
08:26:30,480 --> 08:26:32,560
if not you know engage with the security

10260
08:26:32,560 --> 08:26:35,040
specialists and security engineers

10261
08:26:35,040 --> 08:26:37,680
infosec consultants and where needed so

10262
08:26:37,680 --> 08:26:39,040
we're kind of making the best use of

10263
08:26:39,040 --> 08:26:40,720
their time as well

10264
08:26:40,720 --> 08:26:43,040
and the last one here is um

10265
08:26:43,040 --> 08:26:44,960
not doing software composition analysis

10266
08:26:44,960 --> 08:26:47,680
as part of ongoing vulnerability

10267
08:26:47,680 --> 08:26:49,680
monitoring and management so some

10268
08:26:49,680 --> 08:26:50,880
projects might still have quite

10269
08:26:50,880 --> 08:26:52,640
long-winded development phases and not

10270
08:26:52,640 --> 08:26:54,240
have regular releases

10271
08:26:54,240 --> 08:26:56,080
but as with patching the operating

10272
08:26:56,080 --> 08:26:57,840
system we need to monitor that the

10273
08:26:57,840 --> 08:27:01,040
dependencies used in our applications

10274
08:27:01,040 --> 08:27:02,080
over time they would have had

10275
08:27:02,080 --> 08:27:03,680
vulnerabilities found in them so we need

10276
08:27:03,680 --> 08:27:05,436
to keep them up to date and re-release

10277
08:27:05,436 --> 08:27:07,360
to perhaps re-release the application to

10278
08:27:07,360 --> 08:27:09,436
include those security fixes a few ways

10279
08:27:09,436 --> 08:27:10,720
around that you know you might want to

10280
08:27:10,720 --> 08:27:12,400
just continually run the pipeline you

10281
08:27:12,400 --> 08:27:14,400
know anyway even off

10282
08:27:14,400 --> 08:27:17,120
you're not deploying to live so you

10283
08:27:17,120 --> 08:27:18,800
catch those kind of you can run those

10284
08:27:18,800 --> 08:27:22,800
automated tools on a regular basis

10285
08:27:25,040 --> 08:27:27,360
so in summary um we looked at the swiss

10286
08:27:27,360 --> 08:27:29,276
cheese model we related it to

10287
08:27:29,276 --> 08:27:30,800
application security looking at the

10288
08:27:30,800 --> 08:27:32,480
active failures and some of the latent

10289
08:27:32,480 --> 08:27:34,480
conditions that might cause the holes in

10290
08:27:34,480 --> 08:27:36,080
the cheese

10291
08:27:36,080 --> 08:27:37,756
so the takeaway really here is that you

10292
08:27:37,756 --> 08:27:39,840
can't change the human condition but you

10293
08:27:39,840 --> 08:27:42,080
can change the conditions that humans

10294
08:27:42,080 --> 08:27:42,840
work

10295
08:27:42,840 --> 08:27:45,360
under so have those scanning tools to

10296
08:27:45,360 --> 08:27:47,360
support the humans and spotting those

10297
08:27:47,360 --> 08:27:49,040
potential vulnerabilities and allowing

10298
08:27:49,040 --> 08:27:51,120
the team to fix them take the time to

10299
08:27:51,120 --> 08:27:52,800
set those tools up and tune them so that

10300
08:27:52,800 --> 08:27:54,480
they're effective

10301
08:27:54,480 --> 08:27:56,000
and then with the latent conditions

10302
08:27:56,000 --> 08:27:58,160
those design flaws

10303
08:27:58,160 --> 08:27:59,916
support the developers with training and

10304
08:27:59,916 --> 08:28:02,400
guidance to close up those holes

10305
08:28:02,400 --> 08:28:03,840
give them that guidance and training to

10306
08:28:03,840 --> 08:28:06,640
be able to do threat modelling well

10307
08:28:06,640 --> 08:28:09,040
and and spot those design flaws and

10308
08:28:09,040 --> 08:28:11,200
early

10309
08:28:11,200 --> 08:28:13,436
so a couple of thank yous thank you for

10310
08:28:13,436 --> 08:28:16,000
quick on to um for allowing me to talk

10311
08:28:16,000 --> 08:28:17,756
at this conference

10312
08:28:17,756 --> 08:28:20,000
uh thank you to tayo to for giving me

10313
08:28:20,000 --> 08:28:21,916
the original inspiration for this talk

10314
08:28:21,916 --> 08:28:23,916
and thank you to jeremy stott for being

10315
08:28:23,916 --> 08:28:26,800
my rubber ducky on this one so

10316
08:28:26,800 --> 08:28:29,490
thanks a lot that's me

10317
08:28:29,490 --> 08:28:30,940

08:28:33,160 --> 08:28:37,559
[Applause]

10321
08:28:41,436 --> 08:28:43,596
oops cricket stop wave time again

10322
08:28:43,596 --> 08:28:46,160
running late

10323
08:28:47,840 --> 08:28:49,120
thank you very much

10324
08:28:49,120 --> 08:28:51,520
right we're gonna head onwards uh to the

10325
08:28:51,520 --> 08:28:54,320
final talk of the day

10326
08:28:54,320 --> 08:28:55,276
and

10327
08:28:55,276 --> 08:28:56,800
some of you may have been admiring the

10328
08:28:56,800 --> 08:28:59,120
fine piece of machinery on the stage how

10329
08:28:59,120 --> 08:29:00,160
many how many of you have been eyeing

10330
08:29:00,160 --> 08:29:01,120
that up

10331
08:29:01,120 --> 08:29:03,120
a few yeah yeah yeah

10332
08:29:03,120 --> 08:29:04,720
do you want to hear it

10333
08:29:04,720 --> 08:29:06,080
yeah that's what that's what i thought

10334
08:29:06,080 --> 08:29:07,276
right so

10335
08:29:07,276 --> 08:29:09,680
it's my great pleasure to introduce

10336
08:29:09,680 --> 08:29:11,360
probably the best dressed hack he said

10337
08:29:11,360 --> 08:29:12,560
he'd been consistently voted best

10338
08:29:12,560 --> 08:29:14,480
dressed hacker at previous chemicals and

10339
08:29:14,480 --> 08:29:16,800
we'll leave it to you to judge but

10340
08:29:16,800 --> 08:29:21,559
hailing from pulse security mr doi

10341
08:29:22,640 --> 08:29:25,275
thank you middle

10342
08:29:28,880 --> 08:29:31,520
okay we should hopefully have

10343
08:29:31,520 --> 08:29:34,000
huh yeah okay awesome it works

10344
08:29:34,000 --> 08:29:35,360
um

10345
08:29:35,360 --> 08:29:38,640
right appraisal time

10346
08:29:38,640 --> 08:29:39,436
okay

10347
08:29:39,436 --> 08:29:40,560
i'm going to be talking to you about

10348
08:29:40,560 --> 08:29:43,276
reverse engineering this ducati

10349
08:29:43,276 --> 08:29:45,916
for those of you that don't know who i

10350
08:29:45,916 --> 08:29:48,880
am my name is dennis uh and i'm a

10351
08:29:48,880 --> 08:29:51,040
security consultant with pulse security

10352
08:29:51,040 --> 08:29:52,960
we do things like ping testing and

10353
08:29:52,960 --> 08:29:54,960
attacker emulation security research

10354
08:29:54,960 --> 08:29:57,680
forensic analysis that kind of stuff

10355
08:29:57,680 --> 08:30:00,320
and i'm kind of like a offensive

10356
08:30:00,320 --> 08:30:03,040
security jack of all trades really um

10357
08:30:03,040 --> 08:30:05,436
you might remember me from previous car

10358
08:30:05,436 --> 08:30:09,436
icon and kiwi con talks this was qcon 7

10359
08:30:09,436 --> 08:30:11,200
i think 2013

10360
08:30:11,200 --> 08:30:13,520
and we were talking about enterprise

10361
08:30:13,520 --> 08:30:16,160
software security vulnerabilities

10362
08:30:16,160 --> 08:30:17,360
this talk is not about enterprise

10363
08:30:17,360 --> 08:30:19,360
software this talk is about automotive

10364
08:30:19,360 --> 08:30:20,240
junk

10365
08:30:20,240 --> 08:30:21,520
and specifically what i want to do with

10366
08:30:21,520 --> 08:30:22,960
this automotive junk is i want to be

10367
08:30:22,960 --> 08:30:24,800
able to go and tune the engine so i can

10368
08:30:24,800 --> 08:30:26,960
go and change some of the parameters of

10369
08:30:26,960 --> 08:30:29,520
how the bike runs and on most modern

10370
08:30:29,520 --> 08:30:31,200
vehicles that means dealing with

10371
08:30:31,200 --> 08:30:33,596
electronic fuel injection now electronic

10372
08:30:33,596 --> 08:30:35,200
fuel injection is basically a tiny

10373
08:30:35,200 --> 08:30:37,276
computer that goes and figures out how

10374
08:30:37,276 --> 08:30:39,596
long to hold fuel injectors on for and

10375
08:30:39,596 --> 08:30:41,276
when to fire the spark plugs this is

10376
08:30:41,276 --> 08:30:43,276
like the basic building blocks of what

10377
08:30:43,276 --> 08:30:45,916
you need to make an engine go but it is

10378
08:30:45,916 --> 08:30:48,480
a tiny computer so all the standard tiny

10379
08:30:48,480 --> 08:30:50,720
computer still applies and there's

10380
08:30:50,720 --> 08:30:52,560
a bunch of other tiny computers on this

10381
08:30:52,560 --> 08:30:54,720
motorcycle and if you just go and swap

10382
08:30:54,720 --> 08:30:57,120
out the factory ecu which you can see on

10383
08:30:57,120 --> 08:30:59,360
the left there with an aftermarket unit

10384
08:30:59,360 --> 08:31:01,360
like the max ecu street that is on the

10385
08:31:01,360 --> 08:31:03,596
right everything else stops working

10386
08:31:03,596 --> 08:31:05,520
and now i didn't want to go and replace

10387
08:31:05,520 --> 08:31:07,436
the dashboard and the abs module and all

10388
08:31:07,436 --> 08:31:08,800
that kind of stuff to make it work i

10389
08:31:08,800 --> 08:31:11,120
wanted the factory systems to be able to

10390
08:31:11,120 --> 08:31:13,436
work with my new aftermarket ecu but to

10391
08:31:13,436 --> 08:31:15,040
do that i had to figure out how to

10392
08:31:15,040 --> 08:31:16,720
control them and that's

10393
08:31:16,720 --> 08:31:18,320
really what this talk is about i think

10394
08:31:18,320 --> 08:31:20,480
this talk is about control and look

10395
08:31:20,480 --> 08:31:22,000
we're going to be talking about embedded

10396
08:31:22,000 --> 08:31:23,276
firmware reverse engineering and we're

10397
08:31:23,276 --> 08:31:24,480
going to be talking about can bus

10398
08:31:24,480 --> 08:31:26,640
protocol reverse engineering and we're

10399
08:31:26,640 --> 08:31:28,560
doing so under the guise of tuning

10400
08:31:28,560 --> 08:31:30,960
internal combustion stuff but this isn't

10401
08:31:30,960 --> 08:31:32,560
limited to only internal combustion

10402
08:31:32,560 --> 08:31:34,080
stuff anything that implements these

10403
08:31:34,080 --> 08:31:35,756
protocols the same techniques that we're

10404
08:31:35,756 --> 08:31:37,276
about to cover are going to apply so

10405
08:31:37,276 --> 08:31:40,160
this means evs industrial control

10406
08:31:40,160 --> 08:31:42,080
whatever

10407
08:31:42,080 --> 08:31:43,756
quick disclaimer before we get started

10408
08:31:43,756 --> 08:31:46,880
though uh working on vehicles can be

10409
08:31:46,880 --> 08:31:48,480
dangerous you can be a danger to

10410
08:31:48,480 --> 08:31:50,160
yourself and others so

10411
08:31:50,160 --> 08:31:51,680
if you don't know what you're doing and

10412
08:31:51,680 --> 08:31:53,200
you can't go and play with this stuff

10413
08:31:53,200 --> 08:31:54,880
safely

10414
08:31:54,880 --> 08:31:57,040
then please do go and upskill yourself

10415
08:31:57,040 --> 08:31:59,680
so you know you don't you don't die

10416
08:31:59,680 --> 08:32:01,436
basically

10417
08:32:01,436 --> 08:32:02,800
so here's the plan for the talk right

10418
08:32:02,800 --> 08:32:04,000
first we're going to look at the wiring

10419
08:32:04,000 --> 08:32:05,680
diagram and this is going to give us

10420
08:32:05,680 --> 08:32:08,400
some key input about some other stuff

10421
08:32:08,400 --> 08:32:09,596
later on

10422
08:32:09,596 --> 08:32:11,520
we're then going to reverse the factory

10423
08:32:11,520 --> 08:32:13,680
can bus protocol that runs the dashboard

10424
08:32:13,680 --> 08:32:14,960
after that we'll do some reverse

10425
08:32:14,960 --> 08:32:17,840
engineering of the stock ecu firmware to

10426
08:32:17,840 --> 08:32:19,276
find some fuel maps and some ignition

10427
08:32:19,276 --> 08:32:21,436
maps to give us a head start and we will

10428
08:32:21,436 --> 08:32:23,840
wrap this all up with a bonus round if

10429
08:32:23,840 --> 08:32:25,840
there is time so

10430
08:32:25,840 --> 08:32:28,640
i appreciate that this is the last talk

10431
08:32:28,640 --> 08:32:30,320
of the day at the end of a hacker

10432
08:32:30,320 --> 08:32:31,596
conference and you're all probably

10433
08:32:31,596 --> 08:32:32,960
lightly toasted from information

10434
08:32:32,960 --> 08:32:34,320
overload right now

10435
08:32:34,320 --> 08:32:38,080
so i'm gonna be glossing over a lot of

10436
08:32:38,080 --> 08:32:39,756
stuff

10437
08:32:39,756 --> 08:32:41,756
now if you find yourself wanting to get

10438
08:32:41,756 --> 08:32:43,520
really stuck into the nitty-gritty and

10439
08:32:43,520 --> 08:32:45,680
have all the specific technical details

10440
08:32:45,680 --> 08:32:48,320
and all that kind of stuff then uh i've

10441
08:32:48,320 --> 08:32:49,436
written up both the canvas reverse

10442
08:32:49,436 --> 08:32:50,800
engineering and the firmware reverse

10443
08:32:50,800 --> 08:32:52,240
engineering up on the pulse security

10444
08:32:52,240 --> 08:32:54,960
website there they go into depth if you

10445
08:32:54,960 --> 08:32:56,640
want like nitty gritty information

10446
08:32:56,640 --> 08:32:57,840
overload

10447
08:32:57,840 --> 08:33:00,080
have at it

10448
08:33:00,080 --> 08:33:02,480
so wiring diagram it looks like this fun

10449
08:33:02,480 --> 08:33:05,436
fact it's wrong uh but it's not

10450
08:33:05,436 --> 08:33:08,160
it's not entirely wrong uh

10451
08:33:08,160 --> 08:33:09,680
the wiring diagram is something that

10452
08:33:09,680 --> 08:33:12,240
ducati at least are still providing uh

10453
08:33:12,240 --> 08:33:13,680
through their owner's manual so this

10454
08:33:13,680 --> 08:33:14,720
isn't like a privileged piece of

10455
08:33:14,720 --> 08:33:16,000
information or part of the workshop

10456
08:33:16,000 --> 08:33:17,360
manual or anything like that this is

10457
08:33:17,360 --> 08:33:18,720
just what you get in the owner's

10458
08:33:18,720 --> 08:33:19,756
handbook

10459
08:33:19,756 --> 08:33:22,080
and the plan here is to go and figure

10460
08:33:22,080 --> 08:33:24,480
out where each sensor in each switch

10461
08:33:24,480 --> 08:33:26,080
goes to so there are three

10462
08:33:26,080 --> 08:33:28,000
microcontrollers on this bike there's

10463
08:33:28,000 --> 08:33:29,916
the dashboard on the left hand side

10464
08:33:29,916 --> 08:33:31,916
there there is the ecu which is that

10465
08:33:31,916 --> 08:33:34,080
bottom row of pins and then there's the

10466
08:33:34,080 --> 08:33:35,840
abs module so we want to figure out

10467
08:33:35,840 --> 08:33:38,960
where each sensor in each switch goes

10468
08:33:38,960 --> 08:33:40,880
it ends up looking like this after you

10469
08:33:40,880 --> 08:33:42,240
go and figure everything out and

10470
08:33:42,240 --> 08:33:44,960
eventually you get a list

10471
08:33:44,960 --> 08:33:46,800
and this is a list of what handles what

10472
08:33:46,800 --> 08:33:48,640
sensor and what switch and now this is

10473
08:33:48,640 --> 08:33:51,756
important because it gives us an idea of

10474
08:33:51,756 --> 08:33:53,596
what we should be looking for on the can

10475
08:33:53,596 --> 08:33:55,520
bus before we ever put any tools on the

10476
08:33:55,520 --> 08:33:56,960
motorcycle or even purchase the

10477
08:33:56,960 --> 08:34:00,000
motorcycle for example right

10478
08:34:00,000 --> 08:34:01,276
so here's a practical example of that

10479
08:34:01,276 --> 08:34:03,840
right the the neutral light is on the

10480
08:34:03,840 --> 08:34:05,680
dashboard but the neutral switch is

10481
08:34:05,680 --> 08:34:07,360
handled by the ecu

10482
08:34:07,360 --> 08:34:08,880
so the ecu needs to have some way of

10483
08:34:08,880 --> 08:34:10,640
reading that switch and then going and

10484
08:34:10,640 --> 08:34:12,320
communicating the information to the

10485
08:34:12,320 --> 08:34:14,080
dashboard about whether or not the bike

10486
08:34:14,080 --> 08:34:16,320
is currently in neutral and it works the

10487
08:34:16,320 --> 08:34:18,560
same the other way right uh the

10488
08:34:18,560 --> 08:34:20,160
immobilizer antenna goes to the

10489
08:34:20,160 --> 08:34:22,400
dashboard but the starter relay and the

10490
08:34:22,400 --> 08:34:24,240
status and the starter button go to the

10491
08:34:24,240 --> 08:34:26,480
ecu so the dash needs to have some way

10492
08:34:26,480 --> 08:34:28,400
of handling the immobilizer logic and

10493
08:34:28,400 --> 08:34:30,560
then going and communicating that state

10494
08:34:30,560 --> 08:34:32,880
back to the ecu so

10495
08:34:32,880 --> 08:34:34,400
no tools have been involved yet and we

10496
08:34:34,400 --> 08:34:36,160
kind of already have an idea of the sort

10497
08:34:36,160 --> 08:34:37,436
of information that we're going to be

10498
08:34:37,436 --> 08:34:40,000
looking for on the canvas

10499
08:34:40,000 --> 08:34:41,916
so can bus 101 we could talk about bit

10500
08:34:41,916 --> 08:34:44,080
timings and how this worked it doesn't

10501
08:34:44,080 --> 08:34:45,200
matter it doesn't really matter for what

10502
08:34:45,200 --> 08:34:47,200
we're doing here um what you need to

10503
08:34:47,200 --> 08:34:48,800
know about the canvas is that it is a

10504
08:34:48,800 --> 08:34:50,720
bus so everything that is wired into the

10505
08:34:50,720 --> 08:34:52,720
same physical two wires will be able to

10506
08:34:52,720 --> 08:34:54,480
see every message that is transmitted on

10507
08:34:54,480 --> 08:34:55,360
the bus

10508
08:34:55,360 --> 08:34:57,120
and it generally consists of a message

10509
08:34:57,120 --> 08:34:59,596
identifier in this case 100

10510
08:34:59,596 --> 08:35:01,680
and then a bunch of data bytes

10511
08:35:01,680 --> 08:35:03,756
so these data bytes are what we need to

10512
08:35:03,756 --> 08:35:05,360
figure out because they contain the

10513
08:35:05,360 --> 08:35:06,400
information that will drive the

10514
08:35:06,400 --> 08:35:08,320
dashboard or the ecu or whatever we need

10515
08:35:08,320 --> 08:35:09,916
to reverse engineer that so we can

10516
08:35:09,916 --> 08:35:12,480
re-implement it in the new shiny

10517
08:35:12,480 --> 08:35:13,200
so

10518
08:35:13,200 --> 08:35:15,120
let's let's just do that i'll show you

10519
08:35:15,120 --> 08:35:17,595
how to do that

10520
08:35:18,080 --> 08:35:20,000
provided i can remember how to drive

10521
08:35:20,000 --> 08:35:22,800
linux maybe

10522
08:35:22,800 --> 08:35:25,200
mirror

10523
08:35:25,680 --> 08:35:27,120
okay hopefully you can all see that

10524
08:35:27,120 --> 08:35:28,880
these extend and mirror script by the

10525
08:35:28,880 --> 08:35:30,240
way i did not come up with that that is

10526
08:35:30,240 --> 08:35:33,520
100 michael fisher

10527
08:35:34,000 --> 08:35:36,240
um

10528
08:35:36,240 --> 08:35:38,800
correct response yes

10529
08:35:38,800 --> 08:35:41,756
actually got av on linux working anyway

10530
08:35:41,756 --> 08:35:43,120
um

10531
08:35:43,120 --> 08:35:44,160
so

10532
08:35:44,160 --> 08:35:46,160
uh looking at the wiring diagram we

10533
08:35:46,160 --> 08:35:47,680
understand the dashboard and the can but

10534
08:35:47,680 --> 08:35:50,000
and the ecu live on the canvas and the

10535
08:35:50,000 --> 08:35:52,560
diagnostic connector underneath the seat

10536
08:35:52,560 --> 08:35:53,916
also lives on the canvas so i'm going to

10537
08:35:53,916 --> 08:35:55,436
plug something into that that'll let me

10538
08:35:55,436 --> 08:35:57,680
talk to it via my laptop right and what

10539
08:35:57,680 --> 08:36:01,200
i've got here is a 8 devices usb to can

10540
08:36:01,200 --> 08:36:03,520
interface which goes to odb2 which goes

10541
08:36:03,520 --> 08:36:05,120
to an adapter which goes to the ducati

10542
08:36:05,120 --> 08:36:07,040
diagnostic connector so we're going to

10543
08:36:07,040 --> 08:36:08,640
plug that in and have a little bit of a

10544
08:36:08,640 --> 08:36:10,880
play

10545
08:36:17,436 --> 08:36:19,680
okay

10546
08:36:20,320 --> 08:36:22,400
so i will remove the seat

10547
08:36:22,400 --> 08:36:24,640
if i can remember how to there we go

10548
08:36:24,640 --> 08:36:26,240
and i will not scratch my sweet

10549
08:36:26,240 --> 08:36:28,480
paintwork

10550
08:36:28,480 --> 08:36:29,840
careful careful

10551
08:36:29,840 --> 08:36:31,596
um

10552
08:36:31,596 --> 08:36:32,720
okay

10553
08:36:32,720 --> 08:36:34,000
i'm going to pop off the clip that i'm

10554
08:36:34,000 --> 08:36:35,360
going to put in my back pocket and

10555
08:36:35,360 --> 08:36:38,080
remember that i put it there

10556
08:36:38,080 --> 08:36:39,840
and then we will plug in

10557
08:36:39,840 --> 08:36:42,400
our canvas interface

10558
08:36:42,400 --> 08:36:44,240
thusly okay we now have access to the

10559
08:36:44,240 --> 08:36:45,756
can bus maybe

10560
08:36:45,756 --> 08:36:46,560
so

10561
08:36:46,560 --> 08:36:49,120
the cool thing about socket can

10562
08:36:49,120 --> 08:36:51,276
and modern can bus interfaces is they

10563
08:36:51,276 --> 08:36:53,916
turn up as an interface in linux so we

10564
08:36:53,916 --> 08:36:55,916
have this can zero interface here which

10565
08:36:55,916 --> 08:36:57,756
means that all the standard linux kernel

10566
08:36:57,756 --> 08:37:00,240
networking junk is what we can use to go

10567
08:37:00,240 --> 08:37:02,080
and inspect the canvas and figure out

10568
08:37:02,080 --> 08:37:03,680
what's going on so that means wireshark

10569
08:37:03,680 --> 08:37:05,520
tcp dump all that sort of stuff works

10570
08:37:05,520 --> 08:37:07,360
with canvas

10571
08:37:07,360 --> 08:37:11,680
you need to enable it first

10572
08:37:11,840 --> 08:37:13,436
which is

10573
08:37:13,436 --> 08:37:16,160
this command

10574
08:37:16,880 --> 08:37:19,840
okay

10575
08:37:25,120 --> 08:37:26,480
it's up there should be a blinky light

10576
08:37:26,480 --> 08:37:28,320
somewhere probably

10577
08:37:28,320 --> 08:37:29,756
all right and now what we're going to do

10578
08:37:29,756 --> 08:37:31,520
is we're going to use the can sniffer

10579
08:37:31,520 --> 08:37:33,200
command and this is part of the socket

10580
08:37:33,200 --> 08:37:35,436
can utilize package again this is super

10581
08:37:35,436 --> 08:37:37,200
easy it's in the in package repositories

10582
08:37:37,200 --> 08:37:38,720
it's in the ubuntu package repositories

10583
08:37:38,720 --> 08:37:40,160
you don't need to compile anything just

10584
08:37:40,160 --> 08:37:42,480
apt-get install it and it works so we go

10585
08:37:42,480 --> 08:37:44,560
can sniff it and we pass our can bus

10586
08:37:44,560 --> 08:37:46,640
interface and this is what we get

10587
08:37:46,640 --> 08:37:49,120
now i am going to

10588
08:37:49,120 --> 08:37:51,596
take my key

10589
08:37:51,596 --> 08:37:53,276
i'm going to plug this in

10590
08:37:53,276 --> 08:37:55,680
and have a look

10591
08:37:55,680 --> 08:37:58,080
we get some stuff right so now we have

10592
08:37:58,080 --> 08:37:59,680
these message identifiers and these data

10593
08:37:59,680 --> 08:38:01,200
bytes and the cool thing about can

10594
08:38:01,200 --> 08:38:03,276
sniffer is it shows you stuff that

10595
08:38:03,276 --> 08:38:05,276
changes right so if i roll the throttle

10596
08:38:05,276 --> 08:38:06,480
back and forth

10597
08:38:06,480 --> 08:38:08,400
thusly

10598
08:38:08,400 --> 08:38:09,596
right you can see that we have a

10599
08:38:09,596 --> 08:38:10,960
throttle position if i grab the front

10600
08:38:10,960 --> 08:38:12,000
brakes

10601
08:38:12,000 --> 08:38:13,680
nothing really happens if i grab the

10602
08:38:13,680 --> 08:38:14,960
clutch

10603
08:38:14,960 --> 08:38:16,960
right we see some bits changing

10604
08:38:16,960 --> 08:38:20,080
right if we pull the pass light

10605
08:38:20,080 --> 08:38:22,160
we have a small pulse that comes through

10606
08:38:22,160 --> 08:38:23,916
which is fantastic we can use that for a

10607
08:38:23,916 --> 08:38:26,840
nitrous solenoid if we need to

10608
08:38:26,840 --> 08:38:29,680
um and that's basically the process you

10609
08:38:29,680 --> 08:38:31,120
just go have a play and figure out what

10610
08:38:31,120 --> 08:38:34,239
works we can start the bike

10611
08:38:37,840 --> 08:38:39,840
and now what we're looking for is rpm

10612
08:38:39,840 --> 08:38:41,680
and that's a missus 100 like do you see

10613
08:38:41,680 --> 08:38:43,860
it do you see it there

10614
08:38:43,860 --> 08:38:46,980
[Music]

10615
08:38:47,276 --> 08:38:51,120
right so we want to use the bike

10616
08:38:51,120 --> 08:38:53,040
in these different conditions and get a

10617
08:38:53,040 --> 08:38:54,480
packet log i'm doing this with can

10618
08:38:54,480 --> 08:38:57,840
sniffer now because it's easy

10619
08:38:58,880 --> 08:39:01,360
but if you run can log or tcp dump you

10620
08:39:01,360 --> 08:39:03,200
can actually log all these packets do

10621
08:39:03,200 --> 08:39:04,400
that while you're actually going and

10622
08:39:04,400 --> 08:39:05,596
using the bike

10623
08:39:05,596 --> 08:39:07,520
and you can get a packet capture that

10624
08:39:07,520 --> 08:39:09,596
you can use standard pcap analysis tools

10625
08:39:09,596 --> 08:39:11,120
and start reverse engineering and figure

10626
08:39:11,120 --> 08:39:12,560
out uh

10627
08:39:12,560 --> 08:39:14,240
what's going on now our mission here is

10628
08:39:14,240 --> 08:39:16,560
to figure out what data frames the ecu

10629
08:39:16,560 --> 08:39:17,680
is sending

10630
08:39:17,680 --> 08:39:20,240
uh so we can go and replicate those in

10631
08:39:20,240 --> 08:39:22,000
the new ecu and the best way to figure

10632
08:39:22,000 --> 08:39:23,040
out

10633
08:39:23,040 --> 08:39:24,320
figure that out through the process of

10634
08:39:24,320 --> 08:39:26,400
elimination so what i'm going to do is

10635
08:39:26,400 --> 08:39:28,320
i'm going to yank out the ecu fuse which

10636
08:39:28,320 --> 08:39:31,360
is this bottom one here

10637
08:39:31,520 --> 08:39:32,720
i'm going to put that in my back pocket

10638
08:39:32,720 --> 08:39:35,916
too and not forget that it's there

10639
08:39:36,840 --> 08:39:39,520
okay and now

10640
08:39:39,520 --> 08:39:41,756
we can run the same thing can sniffer

10641
08:39:41,756 --> 08:39:43,520
in reality you'd be using can log but

10642
08:39:43,520 --> 08:39:45,436
same same by different

10643
08:39:45,436 --> 08:39:47,436
right i don't hear the fuel pump prime

10644
08:39:47,436 --> 08:39:49,596
which is good that means the ecu is off

10645
08:39:49,596 --> 08:39:50,640
and now we have these message

10646
08:39:50,640 --> 08:39:52,720
identifiers

10647
08:39:52,720 --> 08:39:55,680
and that's really handy right because

10648
08:39:55,680 --> 08:39:58,320
now we can go and diff our previous pcap

10649
08:39:58,320 --> 08:39:59,756
and we know what messages are being sent

10650
08:39:59,756 --> 08:40:01,840
by the ecu we know what messages they're

10651
08:40:01,840 --> 08:40:03,360
responsible for and these are the ones

10652
08:40:03,360 --> 08:40:05,436
that we really need to understand

10653
08:40:05,436 --> 08:40:07,276
now there's a few other tricks that you

10654
08:40:07,276 --> 08:40:09,040
can that you can use

10655
08:40:09,040 --> 08:40:10,880
if i go back to my

10656
08:40:10,880 --> 08:40:13,436
demo cheat sheet here right so you can

10657
08:40:13,436 --> 08:40:14,880
use can gen

10658
08:40:14,880 --> 08:40:17,520
to act actually transmit data on the

10659
08:40:17,520 --> 08:40:20,400
canvas so here i am going and sending id

10660
08:40:20,400 --> 08:40:23,360
100 with this set of data bytes and what

10661
08:40:23,360 --> 08:40:24,320
i'm doing is i'm looking at the

10662
08:40:24,320 --> 08:40:25,916
dashboard while i'm doing that right now

10663
08:40:25,916 --> 08:40:27,360
it has a check engine light on and it's

10664
08:40:27,360 --> 08:40:28,880
throwing a can bus error if i run this

10665
08:40:28,880 --> 08:40:30,800
command check engine light goes off and

10666
08:40:30,800 --> 08:40:32,320
something happens

10667
08:40:32,320 --> 08:40:33,756
the neutral light has come on i am

10668
08:40:33,756 --> 08:40:36,880
registering some kind of rpm

10669
08:40:36,880 --> 08:40:40,320
and i am seeing zero kilometers an hour

10670
08:40:40,320 --> 08:40:43,200
so we pick some of these data bytes like

10671
08:40:43,200 --> 08:40:44,560
zero for

10672
08:40:44,560 --> 08:40:46,880
dc which from the can sniffer we suspect

10673
08:40:46,880 --> 08:40:48,880
is the rpm and we change that to like

10674
08:40:48,880 --> 08:40:51,596
zero nine dc and take a look

10675
08:40:51,596 --> 08:40:54,800
more rpm great

10676
08:40:59,596 --> 08:41:01,276
zero fdc

10677
08:41:01,276 --> 08:41:03,840
yeah even more rpm perfect so the other

10678
08:41:03,840 --> 08:41:05,200
thing that you can do here is like we

10679
08:41:05,200 --> 08:41:06,960
have a really incomplete run file and we

10680
08:41:06,960 --> 08:41:08,160
don't know all the things that this

10681
08:41:08,160 --> 08:41:10,400
message id is responsible for so if we

10682
08:41:10,400 --> 08:41:12,240
go and remove

10683
08:41:12,240 --> 08:41:13,916
the data bytes

10684
08:41:13,916 --> 08:41:16,000
like so it'll just send random data

10685
08:41:16,000 --> 08:41:17,436
it'll just send random frames so the

10686
08:41:17,436 --> 08:41:18,800
trick here

10687
08:41:18,800 --> 08:41:21,276
is to set this up and pay attention to

10688
08:41:21,276 --> 08:41:24,000
what starts going bananas

10689
08:41:24,000 --> 08:41:26,640
so we run it

10690
08:41:27,520 --> 08:41:28,960
and now we can see whether like so the

10691
08:41:28,960 --> 08:41:30,640
dashboard has gone into all dashes which

10692
08:41:30,640 --> 08:41:32,640
is like it means it's going faster than

10693
08:41:32,640 --> 08:41:36,560
290 kilometers an hour uh we control rpm

10694
08:41:36,560 --> 08:41:38,240
we control the shift light in different

10695
08:41:38,240 --> 08:41:41,596
states we control the abs light we

10696
08:41:41,596 --> 08:41:43,200
head like flickering okay we have a

10697
08:41:43,200 --> 08:41:46,000
headlight kill there fantastic so just

10698
08:41:46,000 --> 08:41:48,080
by being a nuisance you can go and start

10699
08:41:48,080 --> 08:41:49,680
to figure out what these messages really

10700
08:41:49,680 --> 08:41:52,560
do and if if you don't have complete

10701
08:41:52,560 --> 08:41:54,960
packet captures that's a really really

10702
08:41:54,960 --> 08:41:59,840
handy tool uh to have in the toolkit

10703
08:41:59,916 --> 08:42:02,800
so we'll extend this back out i will go

10704
08:42:02,800 --> 08:42:04,560
turn this guy

10705
08:42:04,560 --> 08:42:06,800
off

10706
08:42:06,800 --> 08:42:09,040
okay

10707
08:42:11,040 --> 08:42:13,840
let me find the slide

10708
08:42:14,960 --> 08:42:17,200
all right so if you do all this stuff

10709
08:42:17,200 --> 08:42:19,040
you end up with an inventory that looks

10710
08:42:19,040 --> 08:42:20,800
like this i'm kind of being flippant

10711
08:42:20,800 --> 08:42:22,080
about all of it but really you should go

10712
08:42:22,080 --> 08:42:23,276
through this methodically for every

10713
08:42:23,276 --> 08:42:25,040
single message with a lot with a log

10714
08:42:25,040 --> 08:42:26,720
file and then you figure that out and if

10715
08:42:26,720 --> 08:42:28,240
you're worried that the can bus message

10716
08:42:28,240 --> 08:42:29,360
might trigger something that you don't

10717
08:42:29,360 --> 08:42:31,520
want to happen then don't fuzz it so on

10718
08:42:31,520 --> 08:42:33,840
and so forth right after you go through

10719
08:42:33,840 --> 08:42:35,436
that methodical process that i'm just

10720
08:42:35,436 --> 08:42:37,360
going to like hand wave away you end up

10721
08:42:37,360 --> 08:42:38,640
with a spec that looks something like

10722
08:42:38,640 --> 08:42:40,400
this so message id 100

10723
08:42:40,400 --> 08:42:42,000
is responsible for the gear and the

10724
08:42:42,000 --> 08:42:43,840
vehicle speed rpm and then a bunch of

10725
08:42:43,840 --> 08:42:45,520
bit flags for the various things that we

10726
08:42:45,520 --> 08:42:47,680
saw happening on the motorcycle two one

10727
08:42:47,680 --> 08:42:49,436
one is auxiliary data that we want to go

10728
08:42:49,436 --> 08:42:51,200
and display back to the rider via the

10729
08:42:51,200 --> 08:42:53,436
dashboard and we have these guys which

10730
08:42:53,436 --> 08:42:54,640
is which uh

10731
08:42:54,640 --> 08:42:55,916
which is awesome so that's the start

10732
08:42:55,916 --> 08:42:59,040
message um and 201 is interesting so

10733
08:42:59,040 --> 08:43:02,000
message id 201 is how the ecu goes and

10734
08:43:02,000 --> 08:43:04,400
communicates error states

10735
08:43:04,400 --> 08:43:06,320
to the dashboard so if you set one of

10736
08:43:06,320 --> 08:43:08,080
these bytes or bits what will happen is

10737
08:43:08,080 --> 08:43:09,756
the check engine light will come up come

10738
08:43:09,756 --> 08:43:11,756
on and it will complain at you with

10739
08:43:11,756 --> 08:43:14,160
whatever error code is there for that

10740
08:43:14,160 --> 08:43:16,000
message now the other cool thing about

10741
08:43:16,000 --> 08:43:18,640
this is if you set this to all fs

10742
08:43:18,640 --> 08:43:20,240
the check engine light comes on it rolls

10743
08:43:20,240 --> 08:43:22,080
through every single error code and it

10744
08:43:22,080 --> 08:43:23,756
also unsets the service light which is

10745
08:43:23,756 --> 08:43:26,000
handy so now we we no longer need the

10746
08:43:26,000 --> 08:43:28,000
ducati factory diagnostic equipment

10747
08:43:28,000 --> 08:43:31,040
because we have a can bus fuzzer

10748
08:43:31,040 --> 08:43:32,000
so

10749
08:43:32,000 --> 08:43:34,560
did it work did all this work yeah

10750
08:43:34,560 --> 08:43:36,720
yeah it worked awesome um this whole

10751
08:43:36,720 --> 08:43:38,720
thing was a little bit misleading uh the

10752
08:43:38,720 --> 08:43:40,560
factory ecu hasn't been in this bike for

10753
08:43:40,560 --> 08:43:42,720
a long time i've put about like three or

10754
08:43:42,720 --> 08:43:44,720
four thousand kilometers uh on this

10755
08:43:44,720 --> 08:43:48,000
setup since and yeah it it works great

10756
08:43:48,000 --> 08:43:50,160
as far as reverse engineering uh the

10757
08:43:50,160 --> 08:43:52,320
factory protocols and making

10758
08:43:52,320 --> 08:43:54,720
uh something new go and communicate with

10759
08:43:54,720 --> 08:43:59,120
the black box via can bus totally viable

10760
08:43:59,120 --> 08:44:02,080
so with that we can move on to factory

10761
08:44:02,080 --> 08:44:04,160
ecu reversing

10762
08:44:04,160 --> 08:44:05,596
now

10763
08:44:05,596 --> 08:44:06,960
what i want to do with this is i want to

10764
08:44:06,960 --> 08:44:08,640
go and pull out the fuel map and the

10765
08:44:08,640 --> 08:44:10,000
ignition table

10766
08:44:10,000 --> 08:44:11,916
now the reason i want to do that is

10767
08:44:11,916 --> 08:44:14,720
these two bits of data are what the ecu

10768
08:44:14,720 --> 08:44:17,040
uses to determine your fuel load and to

10769
08:44:17,040 --> 08:44:18,480
determine how much ignition advance to

10770
08:44:18,480 --> 08:44:20,400
put into your engine these two things

10771
08:44:20,400 --> 08:44:21,596
are like the

10772
08:44:21,596 --> 08:44:23,916
fundamental building blocks of your tune

10773
08:44:23,916 --> 08:44:25,360
if you want to go and change your engine

10774
08:44:25,360 --> 08:44:26,880
behavior these are the things that

10775
08:44:26,880 --> 08:44:29,040
you're going to be changing

10776
08:44:29,040 --> 08:44:31,276
so ben did a great job of explaining all

10777
08:44:31,276 --> 08:44:32,960
the hardware hacking stuff so i'm not

10778
08:44:32,960 --> 08:44:35,200
going to basically you open up the ecu

10779
08:44:35,200 --> 08:44:37,120
you figure out the chip it's an s12x

10780
08:44:37,120 --> 08:44:39,040
chip you spend 16 bucks on aliexpress

10781
08:44:39,040 --> 08:44:41,916
for s12x bdm debug interface you probe

10782
08:44:41,916 --> 08:44:44,080
it with pc byte probes and then you go

10783
08:44:44,080 --> 08:44:45,840
and load it up and usb dm and dump the

10784
08:44:45,840 --> 08:44:49,596
firmware that's it easy

10785
08:44:51,360 --> 08:44:52,400
so

10786
08:44:52,400 --> 08:44:54,080
now we have another problem now we have

10787
08:44:54,080 --> 08:44:55,596
256k

10788
08:44:55,596 --> 08:44:57,840
of ecu firmware and we need to go and

10789
08:44:57,840 --> 08:44:59,436
decode this binary information into

10790
08:44:59,436 --> 08:45:01,040
something that's actually usable for us

10791
08:45:01,040 --> 08:45:03,040
the correct way to do this would be to

10792
08:45:03,040 --> 08:45:04,880
go and load up the firmware engine or

10793
08:45:04,880 --> 08:45:07,040
ida or your reverse engineering suite of

10794
08:45:07,040 --> 08:45:09,916
choice and read the disassembly figure

10795
08:45:09,916 --> 08:45:12,000
out how everything works and like the

10796
08:45:12,000 --> 08:45:14,160
logic behind the ecu and really get an

10797
08:45:14,160 --> 08:45:15,840
understanding for it but

10798
08:45:15,840 --> 08:45:18,640
i just want to fuel an ignition table

10799
08:45:18,640 --> 08:45:20,560
i don't really want to do all of that so

10800
08:45:20,560 --> 08:45:22,640
i'm going to go and share a trick with

10801
08:45:22,640 --> 08:45:23,596
you

10802
08:45:23,596 --> 08:45:26,240
which is using using gnu plot for

10803
08:45:26,240 --> 08:45:28,160
firmware reverse engineering so what you

10804
08:45:28,160 --> 08:45:30,880
do is you take that 256k and you put it

10805
08:45:30,880 --> 08:45:33,756
in a 3d map and it looks like that

10806
08:45:33,756 --> 08:45:36,240
the theory behind this trick is that uh

10807
08:45:36,240 --> 08:45:37,680
code segments within the firmware are

10808
08:45:37,680 --> 08:45:39,436
going to have high entropy meaning that

10809
08:45:39,436 --> 08:45:41,120
they're going to have a wider

10810
08:45:41,120 --> 08:45:44,560
array of bytes between 0 0 and ff and

10811
08:45:44,560 --> 08:45:46,000
they're not going to follow any kind of

10812
08:45:46,000 --> 08:45:47,596
mathematically predefined structure

10813
08:45:47,596 --> 08:45:48,480
right

10814
08:45:48,480 --> 08:45:50,800
but fuel maps and ignition tables and

10815
08:45:50,800 --> 08:45:52,720
structured data are going to follow some

10816
08:45:52,720 --> 08:45:54,320
kind of a pattern and if you look at

10817
08:45:54,320 --> 08:45:56,400
this this whole 256k of the flash

10818
08:45:56,400 --> 08:45:58,160
firmware you can see those two valleys

10819
08:45:58,160 --> 08:46:00,320
those are two sets of field maps

10820
08:46:00,320 --> 08:46:01,840
now the other thing you can do

10821
08:46:01,840 --> 08:46:05,520
is go and set the y range to limit your

10822
08:46:05,520 --> 08:46:07,680
your view and then use the scroll wheel

10823
08:46:07,680 --> 08:46:09,040
to kind of go back and forth so we've

10824
08:46:09,040 --> 08:46:10,640
got program code program code program

10825
08:46:10,640 --> 08:46:12,640
code more program code

10826
08:46:12,640 --> 08:46:14,240
even more program code now it's starting

10827
08:46:14,240 --> 08:46:16,720
to look interesting okay

10828
08:46:16,720 --> 08:46:18,000
and here we go now we have some really

10829
08:46:18,000 --> 08:46:19,680
structured data

10830
08:46:19,680 --> 08:46:21,596
so this is our fuel map but it doesn't

10831
08:46:21,596 --> 08:46:23,276
look like a fuel map and the reason it

10832
08:46:23,276 --> 08:46:24,720
doesn't look like a fuel map yet is

10833
08:46:24,720 --> 08:46:26,320
because we don't know the dimensions of

10834
08:46:26,320 --> 08:46:28,480
that array we know it's structured data

10835
08:46:28,480 --> 08:46:30,400
but we don't know what kind of structure

10836
08:46:30,400 --> 08:46:32,080
it is and this is where the next new

10837
08:46:32,080 --> 08:46:33,680
plot trick comes in

10838
08:46:33,680 --> 08:46:35,120
uh what we want to do is we want to note

10839
08:46:35,120 --> 08:46:37,840
that offset and then open it in 2d view

10840
08:46:37,840 --> 08:46:39,756
and have a look so if you see this line

10841
08:46:39,756 --> 08:46:41,360
what we have is we have a set of values

10842
08:46:41,360 --> 08:46:42,960
that's generally increasing before it

10843
08:46:42,960 --> 08:46:44,640
resets and then it starts generally

10844
08:46:44,640 --> 08:46:46,800
increasing again and then it resets and

10845
08:46:46,800 --> 08:46:48,640
this is a really good thing to see

10846
08:46:48,640 --> 08:46:50,240
because it follows the general pattern

10847
08:46:50,240 --> 08:46:53,120
that we'd expect for both a fuel table

10848
08:46:53,120 --> 08:46:55,360
and an ignition table as engine rpm

10849
08:46:55,360 --> 08:46:58,080
increases we generally need more fuel

10850
08:46:58,080 --> 08:47:02,080
and generally need more spark advance

10851
08:47:02,080 --> 08:47:04,960
now to determine one of the

10852
08:47:04,960 --> 08:47:06,960
dimensions of that array we can just do

10853
08:47:06,960 --> 08:47:08,880
it right here we just count the peaks

10854
08:47:08,880 --> 08:47:10,560
and in this case we have 30 peaks so we

10855
08:47:10,560 --> 08:47:14,160
know that that array is 30 by something

10856
08:47:14,160 --> 08:47:16,640
next we can open this up in a hex editor

10857
08:47:16,640 --> 08:47:18,480
and it looks like this these are 16 bit

10858
08:47:18,480 --> 08:47:20,800
unsigned integers and we want to look at

10859
08:47:20,800 --> 08:47:23,040
that pattern and see when it resets so

10860
08:47:23,040 --> 08:47:24,960
how many integers do we have before it

10861
08:47:24,960 --> 08:47:27,040
goes from a high value to a low value

10862
08:47:27,040 --> 08:47:29,840
and in this case we have 20

10863
08:47:29,840 --> 08:47:32,000
right

10864
08:47:32,000 --> 08:47:34,240
you can see here it goes from 4eb3 to

10865
08:47:34,240 --> 08:47:37,120
1b33 that's our reset point our map

10866
08:47:37,120 --> 08:47:40,000
dimensions are 20 by 30. plug that back

10867
08:47:40,000 --> 08:47:42,160
into new plot we have our fuel map we

10868
08:47:42,160 --> 08:47:45,040
have our ignition table

10869
08:47:45,040 --> 08:47:47,276
just

10870
08:47:47,840 --> 08:47:49,360
we're not done yet there's not enough

10871
08:47:49,360 --> 08:47:51,040
there's not enough information in this

10872
08:47:51,040 --> 08:47:53,756
to load it into an ecu um

10873
08:47:53,756 --> 08:47:56,480
so what we need is we need to figure out

10874
08:47:56,480 --> 08:47:57,276
uh

10875
08:47:57,276 --> 08:47:59,520
what the x and y break points are so

10876
08:47:59,520 --> 08:48:01,200
right now it's labeled 0 to 30 and 0 to

10877
08:48:01,200 --> 08:48:02,080
20

10878
08:48:02,080 --> 08:48:03,360
which doesn't help us because those

10879
08:48:03,360 --> 08:48:05,040
aren't rpm values and those are not

10880
08:48:05,040 --> 08:48:06,480
throttle position values we need to

10881
08:48:06,480 --> 08:48:08,960
figure out what those break points are

10882
08:48:08,960 --> 08:48:10,720
now we know that it's going to be 30 rpm

10883
08:48:10,720 --> 08:48:12,000
values and we know there's going to be

10884
08:48:12,000 --> 08:48:13,360
20 throttle position values and that

10885
08:48:13,360 --> 08:48:16,000
helps us so we jump back into 2d view

10886
08:48:16,000 --> 08:48:17,276
and we find

10887
08:48:17,276 --> 08:48:19,120
uh these two bits of data that follow

10888
08:48:19,120 --> 08:48:20,640
the general structure that we would be

10889
08:48:20,640 --> 08:48:23,756
expecting so for rpm we have 30 integers

10890
08:48:23,756 --> 08:48:26,400
that are generally increasing linearly

10891
08:48:26,400 --> 08:48:28,480
and for throttle position we have a

10892
08:48:28,480 --> 08:48:30,640
logarithmic scale there um

10893
08:48:30,640 --> 08:48:32,240
the the throttle position is logarithmic

10894
08:48:32,240 --> 08:48:33,596
just because of some of the physics of

10895
08:48:33,596 --> 08:48:35,840
how individual throttle bodies work uh

10896
08:48:35,840 --> 08:48:38,560
if you use the linear scale for a engine

10897
08:48:38,560 --> 08:48:40,880
that's running itbs then they like part

10898
08:48:40,880 --> 08:48:42,960
throttle cruise is just a mess

10899
08:48:42,960 --> 08:48:44,960
so you need more tuning granularity down

10900
08:48:44,960 --> 08:48:46,160
low

10901
08:48:46,160 --> 08:48:48,240
now we have enough information to punch

10902
08:48:48,240 --> 08:48:50,320
this all back into the max ecu and i

10903
08:48:50,320 --> 08:48:51,520
really like this view because they

10904
08:48:51,520 --> 08:48:53,436
adjust the scale depending on where you

10905
08:48:53,436 --> 08:48:56,960
set your axis break points

10906
08:48:57,040 --> 08:48:58,640
and we can start the bike with this

10907
08:48:58,640 --> 08:49:00,240
right what i really like about this

10908
08:49:00,240 --> 08:49:01,680
though is you can see where the factory

10909
08:49:01,680 --> 08:49:03,680
tuners wanted

10910
08:49:03,680 --> 08:49:05,680
more granularity like they wanted more

10911
08:49:05,680 --> 08:49:07,360
control from that three and a half

10912
08:49:07,360 --> 08:49:09,200
thousand to five thousand rpm range

10913
08:49:09,200 --> 08:49:12,000
whereas higher up and at higher throttle

10914
08:49:12,000 --> 08:49:13,596
openings especially they didn't need as

10915
08:49:13,596 --> 08:49:15,520
much tuning granularity to go and make

10916
08:49:15,520 --> 08:49:18,560
the engine function correctly uh and

10917
08:49:18,560 --> 08:49:19,840
that's just

10918
08:49:19,840 --> 08:49:21,916
interesting insight into how factory

10919
08:49:21,916 --> 08:49:24,400
tuning works for me

10920
08:49:24,400 --> 08:49:25,756
so did it work

10921
08:49:25,756 --> 08:49:27,680
sort of i mean it kind of worked

10922
08:49:27,680 --> 08:49:30,080
to be fair the ignition table trick

10923
08:49:30,080 --> 08:49:32,640
worked awesome um that was

10924
08:49:32,640 --> 08:49:34,720
like spot on straight out of the gate uh

10925
08:49:34,720 --> 08:49:35,916
the only changes that i made to the

10926
08:49:35,916 --> 08:49:38,080
ignition table are because i wanted the

10927
08:49:38,080 --> 08:49:39,436
ignition behavior to be different in

10928
08:49:39,436 --> 08:49:40,400
some way

10929
08:49:40,400 --> 08:49:41,520
the fuel

10930
08:49:41,520 --> 08:49:43,520
map was within

10931
08:49:43,520 --> 08:49:45,916
five to ten percent of where it needed

10932
08:49:45,916 --> 08:49:49,360
to be uh across most of the

10933
08:49:49,360 --> 08:49:50,800
map which is

10934
08:49:50,800 --> 08:49:52,800
okay i mean not great but it's pretty

10935
08:49:52,800 --> 08:49:54,240
good

10936
08:49:54,240 --> 08:49:56,720
there's no free lunches in motorsports

10937
08:49:56,720 --> 08:50:00,000
right so what i did here is i went and

10938
08:50:00,000 --> 08:50:01,276
gave up

10939
08:50:01,276 --> 08:50:03,276
time

10940
08:50:03,276 --> 08:50:06,000
hardware hacking and pulling out things

10941
08:50:06,000 --> 08:50:07,680
from firmware files and so on and so

10942
08:50:07,680 --> 08:50:09,596
forth so i didn't have to go and spend

10943
08:50:09,596 --> 08:50:11,520
that time building base maps out from

10944
08:50:11,520 --> 08:50:12,560
scratch

10945
08:50:12,560 --> 08:50:14,000
professional tuners have been building

10946
08:50:14,000 --> 08:50:16,080
base maps from scratch

10947
08:50:16,080 --> 08:50:18,880
forever since efi was first invented so

10948
08:50:18,880 --> 08:50:21,276
you don't really need to do

10949
08:50:21,276 --> 08:50:22,560
any of this

10950
08:50:22,560 --> 08:50:24,880
but for me at least with without direct

10951
08:50:24,880 --> 08:50:27,756
access to a dyno it was a useful trick

10952
08:50:27,756 --> 08:50:29,200
to get this up and running and on the

10953
08:50:29,200 --> 08:50:32,160
road faster

10954
08:50:32,560 --> 08:50:34,480
so we have a bunch of time left which is

10955
08:50:34,480 --> 08:50:36,880
nice so we've got some bonus rounds

10956
08:50:36,880 --> 08:50:39,360
let's talk about computer hacking okay

10957
08:50:39,360 --> 08:50:41,276
so i've included this because i know

10958
08:50:41,276 --> 08:50:43,040
that if i didn't put something like this

10959
08:50:43,040 --> 08:50:45,360
in here some like gatekeeping infosec

10960
08:50:45,360 --> 08:50:46,880
chud was going to come up to me after

10961
08:50:46,880 --> 08:50:48,560
this and be like that talk wasn't even

10962
08:50:48,560 --> 08:50:51,200
about real hacking um

10963
08:50:51,200 --> 08:50:52,240
so

10964
08:50:52,240 --> 08:50:54,080
let's talk about some software

10965
08:50:54,080 --> 08:50:55,756
vulnerabilities i guess

10966
08:50:55,756 --> 08:50:57,360
and i want to talk about some software

10967
08:50:57,360 --> 08:50:58,720
vulnerabilities

10968
08:50:58,720 --> 08:51:00,240
in uh

10969
08:51:00,240 --> 08:51:02,400
in the max ecu or at least some some

10970
08:51:02,400 --> 08:51:04,160
bugs in the max ecu itself now the max

10971
08:51:04,160 --> 08:51:06,640
ecu implements this feature called an

10972
08:51:06,640 --> 08:51:08,320
ecu lock

10973
08:51:08,320 --> 08:51:10,000
and what it lets you do is it lets you

10974
08:51:10,000 --> 08:51:11,916
set a password on your ecu and then you

10975
08:51:11,916 --> 08:51:14,320
can protect various tables so that you

10976
08:51:14,320 --> 08:51:16,480
can't go and get them back out

10977
08:51:16,480 --> 08:51:19,840
uh without entering this code now the

10978
08:51:19,840 --> 08:51:21,520
pretense for this is that if you have a

10979
08:51:21,520 --> 08:51:23,436
commodity engine or something that's

10980
08:51:23,436 --> 08:51:26,080
tuned often like say like 100k series or

10981
08:51:26,080 --> 08:51:28,240
2jz or an ls

10982
08:51:28,240 --> 08:51:30,080
something along those lines and you take

10983
08:51:30,080 --> 08:51:33,120
your car or bike or whatever uh to the

10984
08:51:33,120 --> 08:51:35,436
tuner they don't want you sharing their

10985
08:51:35,436 --> 08:51:37,360
sweet ls2 with the truck cam ignition

10986
08:51:37,360 --> 08:51:39,680
map with other people so they'll go and

10987
08:51:39,680 --> 08:51:41,200
lock down your ecu and now if you want

10988
08:51:41,200 --> 08:51:42,480
to go and modify that further you have

10989
08:51:42,480 --> 08:51:43,756
to call your tuner and beg them for a

10990
08:51:43,756 --> 08:51:46,400
password and so on and so forth like

10991
08:51:46,400 --> 08:51:47,756
the whole pretense of this talk was

10992
08:51:47,756 --> 08:51:50,160
about control and having somebody go and

10993
08:51:50,160 --> 08:51:52,560
arbitrarily take that away is not is not

10994
08:51:52,560 --> 08:51:54,480
cool with me so we need to find a way

10995
08:51:54,480 --> 08:51:55,756
around this

10996
08:51:55,756 --> 08:51:57,200
luckily i can think of five ways to get

10997
08:51:57,200 --> 08:51:59,520
around this but we don't have time to

10998
08:51:59,520 --> 08:52:00,800
talk about five ways to get around this

10999
08:52:00,800 --> 08:52:03,120
we have time to talk about one so we're

11000
08:52:03,120 --> 08:52:04,960
going to talk about a known plain text

11001
08:52:04,960 --> 08:52:06,080
attack

11002
08:52:06,080 --> 08:52:07,120
and the way that we're going to go and

11003
08:52:07,120 --> 08:52:08,880
execute that is when you hit that little

11004
08:52:08,880 --> 08:52:10,160
save icon

11005
08:52:10,160 --> 08:52:12,160
if your ecu is password protected it

11006
08:52:12,160 --> 08:52:14,400
gets saved as this max ecu encrypted

11007
08:52:14,400 --> 08:52:16,080
save file

11008
08:52:16,080 --> 08:52:17,436
so let's take a bit of a closer look at

11009
08:52:17,436 --> 08:52:19,040
that and try and figure out how that

11010
08:52:19,040 --> 08:52:21,680
actually works

11011
08:52:23,756 --> 08:52:27,400
okay it works

11012
08:52:29,360 --> 08:52:30,960
all right so here's what i've got i've

11013
08:52:30,960 --> 08:52:33,040
got the encrypted max ecu save i've got

11014
08:52:33,040 --> 08:52:34,800
the plain text max ccu save here so

11015
08:52:34,800 --> 08:52:37,680
let's take a look at the plain text

11016
08:52:37,680 --> 08:52:39,200
this is xml data

11017
08:52:39,200 --> 08:52:40,880
right

11018
08:52:40,880 --> 08:52:43,040
which is for known plain text attack

11019
08:52:43,040 --> 08:52:44,400
that's pretty good because we know that

11020
08:52:44,400 --> 08:52:45,360
at least

11021
08:52:45,360 --> 08:52:46,800
this part of the file is always going to

11022
08:52:46,800 --> 08:52:50,160
main remain relatively static right

11023
08:52:50,160 --> 08:52:51,200
so let's do the same thing with the

11024
08:52:51,200 --> 08:52:53,520
encrypted save and we have base64

11025
08:52:53,520 --> 08:52:55,756
encoded data so maybe

11026
08:52:55,756 --> 08:52:58,240
maybe this is just base64 encoded and we

11027
08:52:58,240 --> 08:53:00,880
can all go home

11028
08:53:01,756 --> 08:53:03,276
whoops

11029
08:53:03,276 --> 08:53:06,080
nope it is binary

11030
08:53:06,080 --> 08:53:08,240
so that's problem so let's move this off

11031
08:53:08,240 --> 08:53:11,840
to ciphertext dot bin so this ciphertext

11032
08:53:11,840 --> 08:53:13,840
is now what we're trying to decrypt so

11033
08:53:13,840 --> 08:53:16,480
we'll take a look at that in xxd again

11034
08:53:16,480 --> 08:53:17,596
just

11035
08:53:17,596 --> 08:53:21,596
kind of scroll through it get some vibes

11036
08:53:22,320 --> 08:53:24,480
going and staring at screens of

11037
08:53:24,480 --> 08:53:27,436
ciphertext shouldn't give you anything

11038
08:53:27,436 --> 08:53:29,040
but sometimes it do

11039
08:53:29,040 --> 08:53:30,320
uh

11040
08:53:30,320 --> 08:53:32,160
so what i'm looking for here

11041
08:53:32,160 --> 08:53:34,800
is like repeating patterns of some kind

11042
08:53:34,800 --> 08:53:38,640
or just anything like see at y at y hmv

11043
08:53:38,640 --> 08:53:40,480
txid

11044
08:53:40,480 --> 08:53:43,840
okay here we go this is weird ox q e

11045
08:53:43,840 --> 08:53:46,560
o x q e that repeats so let's grip that

11046
08:53:46,560 --> 08:53:48,720
up

11047
08:53:48,960 --> 08:53:54,480
so x x d ciphertext grip this guy

11048
08:53:54,480 --> 08:53:56,080
all right it's repeating

11049
08:53:56,080 --> 08:53:57,276
that shouldn't really happen that

11050
08:53:57,276 --> 08:53:59,120
shouldn't happen in a ciphertext

11051
08:53:59,120 --> 08:54:00,880
uh so what i suspect is that they're

11052
08:54:00,880 --> 08:54:02,160
using xor

11053
08:54:02,160 --> 08:54:03,360
um

11054
08:54:03,360 --> 08:54:05,436
now so the thing with xor is xor is

11055
08:54:05,436 --> 08:54:06,400
commu

11056
08:54:06,400 --> 08:54:08,240
commuted

11057
08:54:08,240 --> 08:54:10,880
 if you go and xor the plain text

11058
08:54:10,880 --> 08:54:12,880
with the ciphertext you get the key

11059
08:54:12,880 --> 08:54:14,160
so that's what we're gonna try and we're

11060
08:54:14,160 --> 08:54:16,240
gonna see if that works

11061
08:54:16,240 --> 08:54:18,480
so

11062
08:54:18,880 --> 08:54:21,276
uh let's so i have this xor function

11063
08:54:21,276 --> 08:54:23,040
it's in bash so we're going to source

11064
08:54:23,040 --> 08:54:25,520
this and then i'm going to read

11065
08:54:25,520 --> 08:54:27,436
the plain text first

11066
08:54:27,436 --> 08:54:28,800
i'm going to read

11067
08:54:28,800 --> 08:54:30,880
32 bytes of the plain text and i'm going

11068
08:54:30,880 --> 08:54:33,680
to spit that out hex encoded

11069
08:54:33,680 --> 08:54:35,200
that's what we're doing here okay and

11070
08:54:35,200 --> 08:54:38,400
then i'm going to do the same thing

11071
08:54:38,400 --> 08:54:39,680
for

11072
08:54:39,680 --> 08:54:42,400
the ciphertext

11073
08:54:43,040 --> 08:54:43,840
right

11074
08:54:43,840 --> 08:54:45,840
32 bytes 32 bytes and now i can use my

11075
08:54:45,840 --> 08:54:49,240
xor function

11076
08:54:50,480 --> 08:54:52,080
to xor these two

11077
08:54:52,080 --> 08:54:54,640
and we will decode it back

11078
08:54:54,640 --> 08:54:56,320
from hex

11079
08:54:56,320 --> 08:54:58,320
and that's interesting

11080
08:54:58,320 --> 08:55:00,480
we have a repeating pattern

11081
08:55:00,480 --> 08:55:01,680
right

11082
08:55:01,680 --> 08:55:05,916
with five v u e e x q y five eu e e x q

11083
08:55:05,916 --> 08:55:08,720
y so what we've got here is the 16 byte

11084
08:55:08,720 --> 08:55:10,400
rolling xor

11085
08:55:10,400 --> 08:55:12,800
and we want to go and confirm that so

11086
08:55:12,800 --> 08:55:15,756
uh echo minus n

11087
08:55:15,756 --> 08:55:17,840
into a key file

11088
08:55:17,840 --> 08:55:19,200
we can then

11089
08:55:19,200 --> 08:55:21,120
get the hex value for that and now to

11090
08:55:21,120 --> 08:55:23,040
confirm that that our assumptions here

11091
08:55:23,040 --> 08:55:24,880
are accurate what i want to do is i want

11092
08:55:24,880 --> 08:55:28,160
to read another 16 bytes

11093
08:55:28,160 --> 08:55:30,960
of the ciphertext but i want to do so on

11094
08:55:30,960 --> 08:55:33,360
some other 16 byte boundary so any

11095
08:55:33,360 --> 08:55:35,520
number that's divisible cleanly by 16

11096
08:55:35,520 --> 08:55:37,520
right

11097
08:55:37,520 --> 08:55:41,200
so let's skip 128

11098
08:55:41,200 --> 08:55:42,840
right

11099
08:55:42,840 --> 08:55:47,120
whoops there we go so we want to xor

11100
08:55:47,120 --> 08:55:48,400
our key

11101
08:55:48,400 --> 08:55:51,436
with our arbitrary 16 byte chunk

11102
08:55:51,436 --> 08:55:52,560
pull this out

11103
08:55:52,560 --> 08:55:54,640
decode it back from hex and yeah this is

11104
08:55:54,640 --> 08:55:55,840
plain text

11105
08:55:55,840 --> 08:55:57,596
okay so what we have is a 16 byte

11106
08:55:57,596 --> 08:55:59,756
rolling xor now i'm going to automate

11107
08:55:59,756 --> 08:56:00,320
this

11108
08:56:00,320 --> 08:56:03,680
[Applause]

11109
08:56:03,680 --> 08:56:07,120
i've written this decrypt.c function

11110
08:56:07,120 --> 08:56:10,000
function file right and all we've got is

11111
08:56:10,000 --> 08:56:12,080
a while loop that reads from standard in

11112
08:56:12,080 --> 08:56:14,080
and it goes and xors each byte with the

11113
08:56:14,080 --> 08:56:16,720
key just rolls over so we'll run that

11114
08:56:16,720 --> 08:56:19,120
decrypter pass it the key

11115
08:56:19,120 --> 08:56:22,480
and we push in the ciphertext dustly

11116
08:56:22,480 --> 08:56:27,239
there we go there's our plain tune file

11117
08:56:30,640 --> 08:56:32,400
now we don't really want to be missing

11118
08:56:32,400 --> 08:56:33,596
with file formats and putting things

11119
08:56:33,596 --> 08:56:34,960
into and out of max esu and all that

11120
08:56:34,960 --> 08:56:36,960
sort of stuff so instead we can just

11121
08:56:36,960 --> 08:56:39,200
script for the password

11122
08:56:39,200 --> 08:56:42,560
and in this case it is set to patricia

11123
08:56:42,560 --> 08:56:45,916
so we can now get our totally sweet ls2

11124
08:56:45,916 --> 08:56:47,680
with the truck cam ignition table out

11125
08:56:47,680 --> 08:56:50,240
and share it with all our sweet ls2 with

11126
08:56:50,240 --> 08:56:53,720
the truck cam buddies

11127
08:56:55,040 --> 08:56:57,360
okay

11128
08:56:59,436 --> 08:57:01,756
all right

11129
08:57:07,520 --> 08:57:10,160
okay so basically uh xl with short keys

11130
08:57:10,160 --> 08:57:15,040
is bad um and you shouldn't use it but

11131
08:57:15,040 --> 08:57:16,560
what was the point

11132
08:57:16,560 --> 08:57:18,560
of all of this

11133
08:57:18,560 --> 08:57:22,000
and i don't even know anymore

11134
08:57:22,000 --> 08:57:23,596
i think

11135
08:57:23,596 --> 08:57:25,120
okay i think all i really wanted to get

11136
08:57:25,120 --> 08:57:26,560
out of this talk

11137
08:57:26,560 --> 08:57:30,000
was to hopefully inspire maybe like

11138
08:57:30,000 --> 08:57:31,360
just a few of you to go and start

11139
08:57:31,360 --> 08:57:32,720
looking at your vehicles a little bit

11140
08:57:32,720 --> 08:57:33,680
closer

11141
08:57:33,680 --> 08:57:35,120
you know like start having a bit of a

11142
08:57:35,120 --> 08:57:37,276
play this all this tooling cheat cheap

11143
08:57:37,276 --> 08:57:38,880
cheap um

11144
08:57:38,880 --> 08:57:40,640
everything is in linux kernel and socket

11145
08:57:40,640 --> 08:57:42,560
can usuals and stuff like that

11146
08:57:42,560 --> 08:57:44,800
so start having a little bit of a play

11147
08:57:44,800 --> 08:57:47,120
start seeing what you can find and

11148
08:57:47,120 --> 08:57:49,436
you know maybe maybe you can figure out

11149
08:57:49,436 --> 08:57:50,880
your own stuff and you don't need to

11150
08:57:50,880 --> 08:57:51,840
worry

11151
08:57:51,840 --> 08:57:54,320
too much about not being very good at it

11152
08:57:54,320 --> 08:57:55,360
because like

11153
08:57:55,360 --> 08:57:57,200
being bad at something is sort of the

11154
08:57:57,200 --> 08:57:59,436
first step to being kind of okay at it

11155
08:57:59,436 --> 08:58:00,880
and that's totally fine this learning

11156
08:58:00,880 --> 08:58:02,400
curve is steep

11157
08:58:02,400 --> 08:58:04,240
and it's especially steep depending on

11158
08:58:04,240 --> 08:58:06,160
your background like if you're coming at

11159
08:58:06,160 --> 08:58:08,000
this from the perspective of

11160
08:58:08,000 --> 08:58:10,320
screwdrivers and hammers and carburetors

11161
08:58:10,320 --> 08:58:12,480
and points then this stuff is

11162
08:58:12,480 --> 08:58:15,040
complicated as but if you're coming

11163
08:58:15,040 --> 08:58:17,276
at it from the perspective of all the

11164
08:58:17,276 --> 08:58:19,200
other that we have to deal with in

11165
08:58:19,200 --> 08:58:22,400
it and the levels of complexity it's

11166
08:58:22,400 --> 08:58:24,960
reasonably straightforward so it depends

11167
08:58:24,960 --> 08:58:27,120
on your mindset and how you want to

11168
08:58:27,120 --> 08:58:28,960
apply that now

11169
08:58:28,960 --> 08:58:31,040
uh i didn't do this alone i had a lot of

11170
08:58:31,040 --> 08:58:33,276
help uh and people were very nice to me

11171
08:58:33,276 --> 08:58:35,276
about it and that was that was awesome

11172
08:58:35,276 --> 08:58:37,520
uh i went and picked up that ecu from

11173
08:58:37,520 --> 08:58:40,800
jeff at nz wiring and jeff is amazing i

11174
08:58:40,800 --> 08:58:43,436
sent him like screens of emails with

11175
08:58:43,436 --> 08:58:45,916
questions that no one would reasonably

11176
08:58:45,916 --> 08:58:48,320
expect jeff to answer and he did an

11177
08:58:48,320 --> 08:58:50,800
outstanding job and like we we even

11178
08:58:50,800 --> 08:58:52,640
managed like i got in touch with the max

11179
08:58:52,640 --> 08:58:55,596
ecu developers and they rule

11180
08:58:55,596 --> 08:58:57,360
so what what i figured out was that

11181
08:58:57,360 --> 08:59:00,160
because this is a uneven fire engine

11182
08:59:00,160 --> 08:59:01,756
right you don't need a camshaft sensor

11183
08:59:01,756 --> 08:59:04,480
to do fully sequential ignition and uh

11184
08:59:04,480 --> 08:59:06,560
and fueling anymore because the

11185
08:59:06,560 --> 08:59:08,880
crankshaft kinematics are uneven if you

11186
08:59:08,880 --> 08:59:11,276
do real-time crank analysis you don't

11187
08:59:11,276 --> 08:59:13,520
need a cam sensor anymore so i wrote all

11188
08:59:13,520 --> 08:59:15,200
of this up with a bunch of graphs and i

11189
08:59:15,200 --> 08:59:18,560
sent it off to anders i think at max ecu

11190
08:59:18,560 --> 08:59:20,560
and he went and he handed over like a

11191
08:59:20,560 --> 08:59:22,560
new firmware the next week that had this

11192
08:59:22,560 --> 08:59:24,640
prototype function enabled and it works

11193
08:59:24,640 --> 08:59:27,436
if you want to go and not use a sync

11194
08:59:27,436 --> 08:59:29,436
sensor on anything that's odd fire or

11195
08:59:29,436 --> 08:59:31,520
v20 or single cylinder now like we did

11196
08:59:31,520 --> 08:59:34,160
that and i'm just some guy in new

11197
08:59:34,160 --> 08:59:36,000
zealand that's amazing

11198
08:59:36,000 --> 08:59:38,240
like

11199
08:59:40,800 --> 08:59:42,400
so yeah i mean like

11200
08:59:42,400 --> 08:59:45,756
jeff rawls the max ecu dev's role like

11201
08:59:45,756 --> 08:59:47,276
all of this was great and i was like

11202
08:59:47,276 --> 08:59:49,520
really blown away by how how forthcoming

11203
08:59:49,520 --> 08:59:50,880
people were with information and wanting

11204
08:59:50,880 --> 08:59:52,720
to actually go and get stuff done right

11205
08:59:52,720 --> 08:59:53,680
and

11206
08:59:53,680 --> 08:59:55,360
i think if you get involved with this

11207
08:59:55,360 --> 08:59:56,800
sort of stuff you'll be really surprised

11208
08:59:56,800 --> 08:59:58,800
at how nice and approachable all these

11209
08:59:58,800 --> 09:00:00,480
all these people are and that's the

11210
09:00:00,480 --> 09:00:02,320
great thing because there are questions

11211
09:00:02,320 --> 09:00:05,040
there are important questions right like

11212
09:00:05,040 --> 09:00:07,040
how much power can you really pull out

11213
09:00:07,040 --> 09:00:09,120
of a nissan leaf engine

11214
09:00:09,120 --> 09:00:11,436
and you might be the right person to

11215
09:00:11,436 --> 09:00:14,000
answer those questions

11216
09:00:14,000 --> 09:00:17,240
thank you

11217
09:00:27,276 --> 09:00:28,720

09:02:26,240 --> 09:02:28,560
bunch of people email in and just want

11271
09:02:28,560 --> 09:02:30,800
to donate tickets to students and

11272
09:02:30,800 --> 09:02:32,960
unwaged people so thanks to the good

11273

i think especially like we had someone

11275
09:02:42,080 --> 09:02:44,240
donate enough money to send about 30

11276
09:02:44,240 --> 09:02:46,400
students from unitec from around the

11277

country

11278
09:02:47,756 --> 09:02:49,200
and as well as a bunch of people who

11279
09:02:49,200 --> 09:02:51,200
perhaps had to pull out last minute and

11280
09:02:51,200 --> 09:02:52,720
donated their tickets to some students

11281
09:02:52,720 --> 09:02:55,330
or on wage so really really awesome

09:03:03,200 --> 09:03:06,080
submitted their talks we accepted them

11285
09:03:06,080 --> 09:03:07,680
reviewed them all and then they had to

11286
09:03:07,680 --> 09:03:11,200
wait a year for to give the talk so yeah

11287

weird fairy animals in the sponsor

11293
09:03:36,560 --> 09:03:39,040
categories and it's unclear who gave the

11294
09:03:39,040 --> 09:03:41,916
most money but the it is an order of who

11295
09:03:41,916 --> 09:03:43,360
gave the most money so the emperor

11296
09:03:43,360 --> 09:03:45,120
tamarins

11297
09:03:45,120 --> 09:03:48,080

so

11323
09:05:01,040 --> 09:05:02,720
last year when

11324
09:05:02,720 --> 09:05:06,080
obviously pandemic things were going on

11325
09:05:06,080 --> 09:05:09,276
uh we we decided um we spent actually

11326
09:05:09,276 --> 09:05:11,040
our crew chat turned into really just a

11327
09:05:11,040 --> 09:05:13,520
sharing of food photos chat i think it's

11328
09:05:13,520 --> 09:05:16,080
called actually loud chat um

11329
09:05:16,080 --> 09:05:18,720
share your food pics um perhaps

11330
09:05:18,720 --> 09:05:19,916
something is a little bit more vulgar

11331
09:05:19,916 --> 09:05:22,240
than that but um

11332
09:05:22,240 --> 09:05:24,800
we decided uh why not pull together a

11333
09:05:24,800 --> 09:05:27,680
community cookbook why not um that

11334
09:05:27,680 --> 09:05:31,040
sounds like a great idea um so we did

11335
09:05:31,040 --> 09:05:32,560
and we want to say a special thanks to

11336
09:05:32,560 --> 09:05:34,800
internet and zed who um helped sponsor

11337
09:05:34,800 --> 09:05:36,480
it and also subsidize i think a good

11338
09:05:36,480 --> 09:05:38,320
chunk of the cookbook actually yeah it's

11339
09:05:38,320 --> 09:05:40,240
not cheap to make your own book that

11340
09:05:40,240 --> 09:05:43,720
turns out the cost per book was around

11341
09:05:43,720 --> 09:05:47,520
110 dollars to produce and so internet

11342
09:05:47,520 --> 09:05:49,916
um made it affordable for cause i didn't

11343
09:05:49,916 --> 09:05:52,240
think would anyone want to pay 120 bucks

11344
09:05:52,240 --> 09:05:54,880
for a photo of metal storm um

11345
09:05:54,880 --> 09:05:58,480
face stuck on top of julia child um but

11346
09:05:58,480 --> 09:05:59,276
yeah

11347
09:05:59,276 --> 09:06:01,276
the cheers it's the quality of your

11348
09:06:01,276 --> 09:06:03,756
photoshop

11349
09:06:07,120 --> 09:06:09,839

11412
09:08:24,160 --> 09:08:26,480
and uh just quickly we have had a pretty

11413
09:08:26,480 --> 09:08:28,640
epic road trip down here um so this is

11414
09:08:28,640 --> 09:08:30,720
us getting ready this is all of our gear

11415
09:08:30,720 --> 09:08:32,480
in the back of a trailer um i just spent

11416
09:08:32,480 --> 09:08:33,680
a couple of days at my mom's house to

11417
09:08:33,680 --> 09:08:36,000
like look after the dogs on a farm um

11418
09:08:36,000 --> 09:08:38,080
and so those are the servers like in the

11419
09:08:38,080 --> 09:08:40,080
back of the car hooked up like on the

11420
09:08:40,080 --> 09:08:42,080
cigarette lighter um with an ethernet

11421
09:08:42,080 --> 09:08:43,839
cable out and it's like on rural

11422
09:08:43,839 --> 09:08:45,040
internet which i think is slightly

11423
09:08:45,040 --> 09:08:47,436
faster than sydney internet and uh that

11424
09:08:47,436 --> 09:08:49,199
that's uh so sophie can uh actually

11425
09:08:49,199 --> 09:08:52,160
connect in and uh lastly down the bottom

11426

11433
09:09:10,559 --> 09:09:12,960
um this time we had multiple network

11434
09:09:12,960 --> 09:09:14,720
zones uh active directory environment

11435
09:09:14,720 --> 09:09:16,559

this is just a rough graph we are pretty

11449
09:09:42,559 --> 09:09:45,595
bad at doing photoshops and designing

11450
09:09:45,595 --> 09:09:47,199
you have to deal with uh like do with

11451
09:09:47,199 --> 09:09:48,400
