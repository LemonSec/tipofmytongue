1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:10,679
hey how y'all doing give you all selves

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:16,948
a round of applause it is past 5:00 p.m.

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:19,439
you are still sat all right and my name

4
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,480
is Laura I have the toughest slot of the

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,029
day in my own opinion and that's because

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,039
it is late and I am between you and beer

7
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,480
or family or hugs or pop plants or

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,240
whatever it is you do in your spare time

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,360
I'm gonna be respectful of that and try

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,460
and use a little less than my slot and

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,269
let's face it Mac did an amazing amazing

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,780
job so I want to leave you on a slightly

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,730
different note now I appreciate that

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,219
today started with Runa

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,980
because Runa made me feel okay that I

16
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,289
was a bit weird and different cuz I

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,410
don't hack things I don't pop shell I

18
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,149
haven't for many many many years I used

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,160
to say I hack people and that feels a

20
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,430
bit dirty and wrong I don't do that

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,438
either this is my credentials it got

22
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,570
some attention yesterday at purple calm

23
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:10,080
people had feelings and opinions and

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,580
that's lovely I like that now credential

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,679
slides about showing why you're

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,119
qualified to give a talk and by the end

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,090
of the talk you'll understand why at

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,590
least 50 percent of this slide is

29
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,170
actually covered in things that are

30
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,470
nothing to do with technology because it

31
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,960
turns out this is a story about a lot of

32
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,509
mistakes that I made and a lot of

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,030
assumptions and how I learnt in the

34
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,740
space of about six months that all of

35
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,500
the wonderful things I thought I knew

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,880
were garbage and none of them worked so

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,979
let's start at the beginning and what

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,899
we're gonna cover we're gonna talk a

39
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,710
little bit about the problem of growing

40
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:53,100
old I last spoke on this stage or one

41
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,720
very much liked it in 2014 and what you

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,759
won't have known at the time is before I

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,039
came on I was sobbing in the wings I was

44
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,540
that nervous and now it's years later

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,369
and I have many more gray hairs and I

46
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,030
don't cry as much I have other

47
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:09,330
strategies like chocolate I'm getting

48
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,450
older you're getting older we're going

49
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,990
to talk about why age matters and why it

50
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,869
doesn't and what I learnt

51
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:19,960
about helping people that were older

52
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,250
than me and I'm going to give a tool out

53
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,840
to the world today

54
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,730
I gave one out yesterday this is a

55
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,150
different one because it's that kind of

56
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,350
week and we are going to embrace the

57
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,270
fact that we're different we're going to

58
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,070
learn how to measure that in a

59
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,330
repeatable way and how to apply that to

60
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,269
your world now whether you're offensive

61
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:40,240
or defensive this kind of thinking will

62
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:42,510
help you customize what you do because

63
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,400
it turns out security is as varied as

64
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:49,660
people are varied and that means

65
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,670
infinitely so so how on earth did I get

66
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,700
here well about three years ago I turned

67
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,280
away from security I was busy doing

68
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,100
other things this time last year I was

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,890
literally having a baby I had other

70
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,170
things going on and those things took me

71
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,820
out of cities I was out of Auckland a

72
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,820
lot more than before I was at the coast

73
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:15,910
I was meeting other people and it was

74
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:19,780
like a glorious weird to adventure but

75
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:22,810
it wasn't just me right it was me and

76
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,780
small people and people who were

77
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,690
different genders and different

78
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,430
positions professions viewpoints it was

79
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,470
more small people because you know they

80
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,560
came into the world and it was older

81
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,570
people and what I realized is my natural

82
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,090
instinct to look at everyone around them

83
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,230
and go oh your security sucks which is

84
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,680
you know a natural trait in our

85
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,869
community followed me out into the world

86
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,640
suddenly I looked at people who were out

87
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,410
doing their day to day shopping online

88
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,200
who do nothing in the security space not

89
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,460
even tech folk and you know that little

90
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,839
judgy part of my brain was like you

91
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:59,440
could be better have you thought about

92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,510
two-factor and I thought I was being

93
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,210
helpful

94
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:06,519
until I met Rose now I'm not the first

95
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,110
security person to have an old person

96
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,510
that's inspired them if you follow Jesse

97
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,190
Owen on Twitter and she has a gang of

98
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,690
old ladies and it's glorious if you

99
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,358
follow her adventures with her gang of

100
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,790
old ladies it's wonderful but Rose

101
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,709
taught me a lot her name has been

102
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,620
changed for protection purposes and

103
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,989
because she would hurt me she is tough

104
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,530
as nails now Rose likes to do things

105
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:33,680
the Internet she is 78 she is wickedly

106
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:36,138
smart but you know she's 78 computers

107
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,970
we're not just a new thing to her world

108
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:40,580
but the entire world has changed around

109
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,870
her several times and she's fiercely

110
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,080
independent she's an alpha woman and

111
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:47,360
I've got a respect her literally got two

112
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,889
so I got to her life and we're talking

113
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,030
about shopping and we're talking about

114
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:53,090
what happens when she's wrung from

115
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:55,340
somebody asking to you know fix us her

116
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,138
spark account or I've spotted a virus on

117
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,270
your computer and we got talking about

118
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:01,159
all of these things and I started

119
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:04,219
trotting out my standard advice have you

120
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:08,060
used a password manager what should we

121
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,530
do some multi-factor it'll be fun what

122
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,030
about those privacy settings on Facebook

123
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:17,599
have you considered sharing less and

124
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:21,469
yeah that went well because it turned

125
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:24,169
out her level of Independence her her

126
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:26,509
age her view of the world meant that

127
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:29,990
that advice was either difficult or in

128
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:32,659
some cases physically impossible for her

129
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,490
to follow and it wasn't because she was

130
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:37,580
stupid it wasn't because she was

131
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:40,729
malicious or careless it was because she

132
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,400
was very different to me and so I

133
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:45,289
started getting thinking how on earth do

134
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,000
I protect roams because I was quite

135
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:48,530
invested in her safety at this point I

136
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,190
turned up at her house and she was

137
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:54,409
buying in bulk from Facebook ads and I

138
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,789
was terrified not only did I know what

139
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:57,830
don't not know what I was going to find

140
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,300
every time I turned up but I knew that

141
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,770
there could be better ways I knew there

142
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,719
was risk there and I didn't know how to

143
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,370
protect her and if any of you have been

144
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,870
in a position where you know there's a

145
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,669
problem in the world whether it's with a

146
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,340
computer system or with someone's

147
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:12,198
behavior and you can't fix it and you

148
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,840
get that really sad uncomfortable

149
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,819
feeling of helplessness that's what I

150
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,008
felt if you don't feel that that's

151
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:22,430
interesting empathy is important you

152
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:25,610
might want to work on it right so I

153
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,080
started thinking how do I help rose and

154
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,240
I started thinking about myself I was

155
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,940
like what makes me different from her

156
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,490
other than a few years and several you

157
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,580
know knowledge sparkles as I like to

158
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:40,520
call them well we're all on a bit of an

159
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,258
adventure right we're born we get older

160
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,490
we have some adventures on the way and

161
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:47,990
eventually we go live on a farm and

162
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,729
we're all at a different part in that

163
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,259
journey and our journeys look different

164
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:52,969
some are longer and some are shorter and

165
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:55,400
some are easier as I'm a harder and some

166
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,750
of them are varied in ways we can never

167
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,090
predict in advance

168
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:02,810
she is further along she's had many

169
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:05,179
different adventures to me now if all of

170
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,520
the advice that I give is colored by the

171
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:11,090
analogies and the knowledge I have from

172
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,440
my existence then this sort of an ego

173
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,929
there right there's an assumption that

174
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,819
what I have done in my life matches what

175
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,740
she has done in hers and therefore I'm

176
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:20,539
trying to fit all of my things unto her

177
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,000
now if you're in machine learning or any

178
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:25,849
kind of data science we'd call this

179
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,659
over-classification it doesn't work my

180
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:32,419
t-shirt isn't going to fit her and I

181
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:34,969
don't know why I thought it would but we

182
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:36,859
do you know it works in my system it

183
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,849
works on my machine we do this a time

184
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,259
and time again and the funny thing is I

185
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:44,360
was like why can't I figure this out

186
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:45,590
like I understand what I'll want to do

187
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,900
when I'm old so I started looking into

188
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,429
brains cuz I love brains like really

189
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,840
fascinating things you should donate

190
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,550
your brain if you get to that point in

191
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,520
your life it's valuable they do good

192
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:58,340
research and I found that we are almost

193
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,680
physically incapable of associating

194
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,500
ourselves with our future self the

195
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,599
further into the future we're looking so

196
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,909
five years out 10 years out the further

197
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,430
that time goes the more like a

198
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:13,099
completely different person we see it

199
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,630
which is why when I say to myself Laura

200
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:16,340
you should eat less chocolate today

201
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,900
because next year you're gonna go on a

202
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,119
wonderful holiday and you want to be fit

203
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,888
and active and healthy I'll go

204
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,219
well yeah but future Laura's got it

205
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:24,219
coming

206
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:29,060
so I can't sit there and honestly go

207
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,160
while I know how to protect future

208
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,630
Lauren so I can't protect Rhodes I don't

209
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,940
know what she's gonna be like and I'm

210
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:38,719
challenged by I can't even think like

211
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,279
that so how do we protect our elders I

212
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,529
studied down this rabbit hole after

213
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,600
pretty promising myself I would never do

214
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:46,339
any security research again I would go

215
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,260
out into the world and not do technology

216
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:49,640
I found myself knee-deep in research

217
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,980
there have nothing to do with technology

218
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,890
everything to do with people and was

219
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:59,930
definitely security so like I said

220
00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:02,089
multiple failures how do we protect them

221
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,279
and how do we challenge the assumptions

222
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:08,120
that we have that are really unhelpful

223
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:10,040
about those groups now the first thing

224
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,620
that we need to reflect on is that aging

225
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:17,089
doesn't affect us all in the same way so

226
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:18,650
Rose is 78 some late 70s but a number

227
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,480
when you get surpassed a certain point

228
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,730
stops mattering raise your hand if your

229
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,290
age radar is completely broken

230
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,560
you couldn't confidently say the age of

231
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,449
most of this room it's because we can't

232
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,099
judge people on that number anymore it's

233
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,959
only really relevant when you're at the

234
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,060
start of your life and then it's more to

235
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,880
do with school systems and you know age

236
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,439
of consent and that kind of thing you

237
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,660
can have somebody who's in their late

238
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,670
60s and somebody's in their early 90s

239
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,709
and you wouldn't be able to guess

240
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:49,819
without really digging into it which one

241
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:52,550
was the more independent able cognitive

242
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,990
analytical one of the two it's not

243
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,729
something you can just read off a label

244
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,770
and they certainly know oh I'm ninety

245
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,350
now and therefore this is my stereotype

246
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:02,029
this makes security really hard because

247
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,529
we're like we like going well this book

248
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:05,270
it looks like this and this book it

249
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:09,470
looks like back and that I will treat

250
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:12,199
them as such whether it's circumstances

251
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,270
genetics illness your behaviors your

252
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,700
diet your culture whether you interact

253
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:20,630
with others all of these things change

254
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:23,720
how you age and how your mind ages not

255
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:26,300
just your body and so that means your

256
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,330
abilities and the tooling and the advice

257
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,790
we give the success rate is variable

258
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,470
based on all of these things now if any

259
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,050
of you like entropy and big problem

260
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,550
spaces you know masters time permutation

261
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,800
x' we have dozens

262
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,569
is hell if you need like I need one

263
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,949
approach to fix it all this is not your

264
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:48,019
space and in fact our age and our

265
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,790
ability and our confidence so if we see

266
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,290
the up side on my really badly

267
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,149
hand-drawn graph there's your

268
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,910
independence level and time across the

269
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:57,800
bottom we actually gain confidence and

270
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,740
skill for a period and it goes down over

271
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,260
time it may even fact over time cycle

272
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,730
where we have bursts where we learn new

273
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,769
things and we grow and then we stop

274
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,480
again then maybe you move jobs or move

275
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:11,420
areas and we'll roles and this goes

276
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,950
again and so we're not even saying I

277
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,260
need to protect you at this age because

278
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:18,290
it's static I need to readjust my

279
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,329
protections for you as you change its

280
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,769
dynamic security controls in an

281
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:24,739
ever-changing environment

282
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:27,200
now given I struggle to you know manage

283
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,660
a small company's worth of security

284
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,600
that's fairly static how on earth do you

285
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:36,260
cope with an evolving set of problems

286
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,329
that are different each and every day in

287
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,220
fact the older we get the less you saw

288
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:42,319
this age thing became the more older

289
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,640
people they spoke to the more I start

290
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,180
throwing age out entirely

291
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:49,520
I think fine older people whatever you

292
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,560
want to call it they are as varied as we

293
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,660
are now so I can't use this anymore and

294
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,660
I got frustrated and I hate getting

295
00:11:53,660 --> 00:12:00,010
frustrated so firstly I have to really

296
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:03,709
spiteful question I like fine screw it

297
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:07,120
should we even allow older people who

298
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:09,260
can't be safe online to be online yep

299
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:14,029
not a fine moment for me

300
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:16,640
like I said mistakes are made I kind of

301
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:19,220
believe now I reflect on it that being

302
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,130
digitally active is a human right it's

303
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,380
part of interacting in society the

304
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,449
people we cut off from access to the

305
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:30,020
Internet and the key systems that are on

306
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:32,000
it are isolated and disadvantaged in

307
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,939
ways we can't really even comprehend

308
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,290
unless you've been in that position and

309
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,329
in fact if you look at the way that

310
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,699
device ownership has changed even in the

311
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:44,569
two years in this this diagram so that's

312
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:46,880
2015 2016 we see magnificent amounts of

313
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:50,420
increase in the use of smartphones Smart

314
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,060
TVs digital citizenship

315
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,010
this digital engagement is not just part

316
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,619
of day-to-day it is a substantially

317
00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:00,260
increasing part of the day-to-day across

318
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,420
all demographics we're not talking just

319
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,790
the you know the geek will inherit we're

320
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,670
talking about everyone is in this space

321
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:12,319
and adopting it so we have to protect

322
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,790
everyone there and that's hard now I

323
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,680
started talking to Age Concern of like

324
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,510
rights I can't be the only one in this

325
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,750
space and it does that they have a

326
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:23,480
recipe for life they say that to have a

327
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,670
happy and healthy life especially in

328
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,240
your senior years you need these things

329
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:31,360
you need role models and curiosity

330
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,220
generosity equilibrium friendship family

331
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,230
adaptability now I'd love you to look at

332
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,230
that list and try and identify which

333
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,600
ones of those you currently get from the

334
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:44,270
digital sphere and not just from the

335
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,570
physical space I did them at to myself

336
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:49,819
it's at least 70% of those I seek out in

337
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,160
the digital space before I do it in the

338
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,410
real world you know a friendship and

339
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,699
family I do a lot face-to-face but when

340
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,620
I'm looking at up two things and I'm

341
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,690
curious or even when I'm being generous

342
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,090
whether there was time or money I tend

343
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:04,550
to do that digitally now my culture

344
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:06,140
because I am from somewhere but I live

345
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,689
somewhere I have family in different

346
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:12,500
places my culture is partially digital

347
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:14,840
now so if we're going to help people at

348
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,180
this stage in their life to meet all of

349
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:21,290
these recipes for success it has to be

350
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:23,000
in the digital space so okay so this

351
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,880
can't be the first time we've ever had

352
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,340
to figure out how to help people and it

353
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,560
turns out it isn't we measure people's

354
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:33,140
independence already if you have ever

355
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,239
dealt with or are helping somebody older

356
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,350
than yourself with difficult needs then

357
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,380
you may have come across some of these

358
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:42,590
we call them diagnostic frameworks now

359
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:44,630
there are a real core reason we have

360
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,110
these firstly to assess independence so

361
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,310
can we give it a level a score to

362
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,260
understand support requirements and then

363
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,969
to request that allocate resources so in

364
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,950
the physical space that's providing

365
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,870
things like carers or ramps or whatever

366
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,090
physical equipment you need to get life

367
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,770
done and we do this regularly it's not a

368
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,170
one-off event it's done on an annual

369
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,779
basis or on a two-year basis so that

370
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,240
your knee

371
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:09,810
change and the support requirements can

372
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,480
change with it we have a concept that

373
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:14,459
people go from being fully independent

374
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,259
like much of you are now many of you

375
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:18,660
would count as fully independent in most

376
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:20,970
of your life through to being less

377
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,579
dependent and less independent less

378
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:27,240
independent still and eventually being

379
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:31,199
reliant reliant on systems or support or

380
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,910
carers or tools and that's important

381
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,219
that progression because it means we

382
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:38,129
have to progress with our security too

383
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,629
I'll come back to that when we're

384
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:41,040
looking at daily living we have two

385
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:44,069
frameworks that are commonly used this

386
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,259
the Katz framework and then the Lawton

387
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:49,349
Brodie and they measure what they call

388
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,550
the core instruments of daily living so

389
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,199
if you look at this this is the stuff we

390
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,479
take for granted the ability to dress

391
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:57,479
ourselves to feed ourselves to take our

392
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,790
medication that's that okay I understand

393
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,410
this so if we can assess these things

394
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,329
and there are a diagnostic paper based

395
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,129
frameworks you can score somebody

396
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,989
against these criteria and you can say

397
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:11,069
where are you on this scale what support

398
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:12,629
do you need okay I can get this so I

399
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:14,759
started going if this is the activities

400
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:16,889
of daily living you know feeding washing

401
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,199
clothing medicating then what are our

402
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:19,949
activities of digital living and how do

403
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,399
we measure that

404
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:26,069
and I started building an instrumental

405
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,540
framework for the activities of digital

406
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,069
livering now you'll notice I put bell

407
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,540
and crossed it out that's because I

408
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:31,649
talked to academics and they say yeah

409
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,930
you have to put your name at the front

410
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:36,209
and it makes me feel really awkward so

411
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,649
you can just ignore that bit but I did

412
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:40,829
it because I was feeling brave that day

413
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:42,029
I have after having lots of

414
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:44,670
conversations doing lots of research

415
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:46,949
with these groups I've got it down to a

416
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,809
set of eight activities additional

417
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:50,849
living now I might be wrong I'm happy in

418
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:53,160
fact I welcome the debate after this as

419
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,439
to is there something I've missed but

420
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,569
things like shopping financial

421
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:59,309
management finding information choosing

422
00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:03,748
adopting new technologies physically

423
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:05,459
using devices entertainment all things

424
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:07,980
that we do digitally all the time

425
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,860
without even thinking about it and so I

426
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,880
want to measure an individual's

427
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:15,839
independence level with carrying out

428
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,120
these daily digital activities

429
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,428
now for each one of these activities I

430
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,138
want to talk about with an individual

431
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:23,759
how frequently they do it

432
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:25,979
so do they do it every day multiple

433
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,889
times a day or just every now and again

434
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,749
or never and when they do it do they do

435
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:33,449
it all on their own do they require

436
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:35,399
assistance or do they need someone to do

437
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,779
it physically for them they don't do it

438
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:40,498
at all but somebody does it on their

439
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:41,879
behalf I also started looking at some

440
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:44,309
additional things confidence level

441
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:46,110
safety behaviors in the event of the

442
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:48,928
unexpected so what do we do when bad

443
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:51,508
things happen and I've pulled all of

444
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:53,820
this together into a framework where we

445
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:55,230
could score an individual now you can go

446
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,970
download this framework there's a link

447
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,289
coming up and you can even go and do the

448
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,049
assessment yourself there is a little

449
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:02,820
online quiz that you can go and take but

450
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:04,918
I'll come back to that and why I love

451
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,879
you dearly but I don't care what your

452
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:11,700
score is so we've got this 4/8 framework

453
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:13,619
for assessment and what do we mean by

454
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,659
digitally independent what does this

455
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:18,509
score tell us well it tells us two

456
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:20,309
things how capable an individual is in

457
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:22,409
making good decisions and operating in

458
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:24,178
the digital space and how prepared they

459
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:25,769
are to protect themselves and respond

460
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:28,919
accordingly if something unexpected

461
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:30,809
happens and we want to figure out how

462
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,509
much help they need on the way for each

463
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,918
of these areas so there's the links I

464
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:36,179
promise you you can download the

465
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,369
diagnostic framework I'm going to go

466
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,600
into it a little bit more now but I

467
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:40,860
thought I'd give this here because I'm

468
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,830
gonna give some later links to something

469
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,748
else the online assessment I'm going to

470
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,158
come back to - I'm going to in the next

471
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,809
couple of days start making some real

472
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:52,470
noise about that because I've got a

473
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:55,019
mission I'm gonna share with you now now

474
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,190
a weird thing that this ties into now

475
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:58,289
for those of you are wondering about

476
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,389
that fully reliant on someone else space

477
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:03,389
and any lawyers in the room this gets

478
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:05,399
murky really quick because it turns out

479
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:07,199
that giving somebody the permission to

480
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:09,629
act as you in the digital space is not

481
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,279
covered nicely in law and somebody

482
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:13,439
logging into accounts and managing your

483
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,749
bank account or interacting as you on

484
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,580
facebook is really legally fraught so

485
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:19,499
please be careful here when you start

486
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,789
digging into it and watch dissipate if

487
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:21,960
you are a lawyer and saying the room we

488
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:23,789
want to have a great conversation about

489
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,789
this this is an area needs digging into

490
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:29,220
more so what are the users for this

491
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:29,879
framework so before we get into how it

492
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,910
looks

493
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,860
well if you are in the UX or interaction

494
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,200
design space you can look at this in

495
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:40,199
association with your personas and with

496
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,480
your demographics and say okay how

497
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,520
technically a digitally independent are

498
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,799
my users and what's would support look

499
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,660
like we can customize onboarding in

500
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,270
education based on this information we

501
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,740
can customize our communication channels

502
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,470
to suit the audience that we're actually

503
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,570
talking to not as expecting an older

504
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,460
person to go find the obscure piece of

505
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,409
our website that has the latest scam

506
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,350
warnings on if they're not even familiar

507
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:06,780
you had a website to begin with we can

508
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:09,360
integrate digital assistance in with

509
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,250
life assistance so if we expect that

510
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,168
digital integration and using the

511
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,690
Internet is part of being a happy

512
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:17,700
healthy enriched person later in your

513
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,190
life then we can integrate providing

514
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:25,760
support into our and life services such

515
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:28,260
as caring out in the community the

516
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,850
answers we get lead into the

517
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,470
recommendations we can give for an

518
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,469
individual and they are domain-specific

519
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,840
items or holistic approaches so

520
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,520
domain-specific such as for shopping

521
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,010
these are recommendations just for this

522
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,240
area but holistic ones are across the

523
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,879
board they will affect multiple let's

524
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,039
have a look at an example a holistic

525
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,809
example so password management a fully

526
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:53,158
independent person just like yourself we

527
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:54,389
can say to you hey you should use the

528
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:56,880
passive manager it's a pretty good idea

529
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,890
we can say you can you should use

530
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,659
multi-factor authentication and in fact

531
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,280
one-time passwords are great you should

532
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:05,400
probably go for that one or here's a

533
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,100
physical token like a you Becky but that

534
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,510
guidance doesn't work and the less

535
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,760
independent you get the less likely that

536
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,460
is to succeed so at the lower levels in

537
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,900
terms of guidance we have things like

538
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,880
using physical password management

539
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,140
solutions such as notepads and those of

540
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,820
you who's got instinct was to go

541
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,330
notepads are awful and you're a bad

542
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:26,010
person just quiet it's it's not you need

543
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,899
to think about it because if you're a

544
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,700
person who sits by their computer and

545
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,130
logs in only in one place and that

546
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,659
happens in town Whanui and nobody else

547
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,309
knows you're there and you've got a

548
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,590
little notepad with your passwords in

549
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:39,570
the biggest threat to your life is a

550
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:41,100
family member and believe me your family

551
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,260
or member already knows that your

552
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,830
password is your cat's name so don't

553
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,320
worry about

554
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,699
that's what notebook if you're fully

555
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,500
dependent this brings a whole set of

556
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,750
requirements we haven't covered as an

557
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,429
industry how do we make it safe for

558
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,010
somebody to act on someone else's behalf

559
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:58,309
in a banking app how do we make it

560
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,809
audible how do we have a shared account

561
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:02,610
without it being a truly shared account

562
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:05,129
and therefore both users both the

563
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,110
original owner and the carer looking

564
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,760
like the same person now if you're in

565
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,439
the banking space this is an area I'd

566
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,049
love for you to start thinking about

567
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,820
because I've seen this in action

568
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:17,100
we need to feel accountable and

569
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:20,639
auditable as carers because it protects

570
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:22,500
us from accusation if it's gone wrong

571
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,090
it's not about insider threat it's about

572
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,570
protecting each other from false

573
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:30,029
accusation domain specific examples so

574
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,678
recovering from the unexpected a fully

575
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:33,120
independent person will check the news

576
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,740
and they'll check the Twitter's and

577
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,239
they'll look on the website and they'll

578
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,889
engage in all the right channels and

579
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,010
make a critical analysis of the

580
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:42,959
situation and recover wonderful and if

581
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,850
you're down the bottom you may not even

582
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,580
know that a problem has existed unless

583
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,059
somebody tells you let alone be able to

584
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,389
recover

585
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,340
you probably favor phone systems or

586
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:56,129
person-to-person contact to feel

587
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,779
reassured and the questions you're going

588
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,940
to ask going to be different to the

589
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:01,980
people who are fully independent and so

590
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,039
we can customise our responses based on

591
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,570
this so what do I want to do with this

592
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,120
next we have a framework you can go

593
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,580
download it you can go use it today well

594
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,989
I want to mass collect data not in the

595
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:18,689
creepy way I want us as a country to

596
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:21,720
measure the digital independence of

597
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:24,409
ourselves I'm not sure on like lofty

598
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,960
aims so why not try for our country I

599
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:29,070
want us to score a population and I want

600
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,200
to see it because I want to see the

601
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,450
breakdown of how independent we really

602
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,889
are how many people need help what are

603
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,820
the scores what the breakdown and I'm

604
00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:37,320
going to be pushing this out through

605
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,908
channels if you are the type of person

606
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,950
who knows how to get that kind of thing

607
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:43,710
into these kind of places so that people

608
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:45,990
in care homes people who have families

609
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:48,690
people who are not in this kind of room

610
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,320
can see it and engage please come and

611
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:52,649
talk to me

612
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,178
I want to refine the assessment and make

613
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:56,699
sure that it fits in with assistance

614
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:58,410
plans working with things like health

615
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,000
Puka see groups and digital community

616
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:03,150
groups to try and make sure that we're

617
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,130
giving good advice to them i want to

618
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,590
socialize and integrate this into key

619
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,880
systems into design processes so if

620
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,669
you're out there designing an

621
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,590
authentication system or a system for an

622
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,570
application that's not just used by tech

623
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:17,040
folk though your application is used

624
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,840
because you're a library or you're a

625
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,580
community center or because you're a

626
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,080
supermarket or a bank and you're the

627
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,149
type of place that lots of people come

628
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,370
from all sorts of walks of life then I

629
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:29,070
want to start seeing this in there I

630
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:30,659
want to see that variation of the advice

631
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:34,169
so it's not just use a password manager

632
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:36,180
or feel bad and this links with

633
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,710
something else as well as pushing this

634
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,050
forward you'll start seeing that there

635
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,370
so it's called sage is linked on

636
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,840
something called open security now I

637
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,070
mentioned this yesterday at purple con

638
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,709
you can catch the talk if you want to

639
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:48,960
understand more but this is part of a

640
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:51,900
movement that I'm trying very gently to

641
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,480
encourage and that's I want us to share

642
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,210
and collaborate on our open-source

643
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,160
security tools documents framework

644
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:01,250
scripts anything that's reusable not

645
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:04,620
commercially it's all non-commercial I

646
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,960
want us to make it easy to find use and

647
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:09,870
contribute to diagnostic tools and

648
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,660
things that we can use every day just

649
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:15,719
like sage and so what I'm asking you to

650
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:18,990
do is if you have a open source library

651
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:22,230
framework tools script template document

652
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,940
god knows what and you think it would be

653
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,310
useful to one other person in this room

654
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,620
I would like you to consider submitting

655
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:31,740
it I won't own it it's still your ugly

656
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,389
baby but what I want to do is list it

657
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,580
and I want to make it easy for other

658
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:37,170
people to find so as long as it has a

659
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,389
code of conduct and if it doesn't I can

660
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,830
help you get one really easily as a

661
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,300
contribution guide and that can be just

662
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,310
a couple of lines in a readme file is

663
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,470
under an open-source license is

664
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:48,090
maintained as in you remember where it

665
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,680
is and you've logged into that count

666
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,720
once some time in the last few years and

667
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,120
it was created in New Zealand and

668
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,290
because I've had feedback on this

669
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,800
Australians you can come talk to me too

670
00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:00,389
I've been told you're good people too so

671
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,850
if you have a project like that like

672
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:05,100
sage that you think could change the way

673
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:07,500
we do security to be more collaborative

674
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,059
to work together to change something

675
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,009
little even if it's not

676
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:13,620
Bing shells then I'd like you to go to

677
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:15,570
open security to NZ I'd like you to use

678
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,399
the type form that is there and submit

679
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,928
your details and let me list it for you

680
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:21,959
and let's see if we can get working

681
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:24,509
together on this stuff I am hoping that

682
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,220
we all realize that as we get older we

683
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:28,889
won't be the people in this room anymore

684
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,220
we'll eventually be the people that have

685
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:33,809
to be supported technology will change

686
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,039
one day we will look around us and we

687
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:37,999
are the person who's trying to figure

688
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,230
out who we ask so we can stay safe and

689
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:42,419
so I want us to think about that now so

690
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,249
we can prepare and start thinking about

691
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:46,710
how we help in this situation so by the

692
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:50,759
time we get there it's just how we do it

693
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:52,649
we protect everybody right there are

694
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:53,940
four minutes and 26 seconds remaining

695
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:56,610
which I would love to give you back into

696
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,460
your day thank you so much for listening

697
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:01,550
and I hope to see you using either sage

698
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:06,710
or open security thank you for your time

699
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:06,710
[Applause]
