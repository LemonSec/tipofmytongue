12
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:57,929
I am here today to tell you a security

13
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,300
tale I've worked in information security

14
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,070
predominate in the financial space for

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,158
the past ten years and external or

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,689
internal roles and I was the Equifax

17
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,670
information security officer for New

18
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:15,089
Zealand pre breach and post breach

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:17,100
so this talk covers the experience I had

20
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,150
as working in that role which is the

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,059
equivalent of being a security

22
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,500
consultant here in New Zealand the time

23
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,530
period covered in this particular talk

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,930
is from August 2017 and to 2019 when I

25
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,180
left the business I was not powder the

26
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,079
technical IR I am in no way shape or

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,299
form able to talk about that but when I

28
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,250
can talk about my experiences that I had

29
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,450
and responding to the breach from here

30
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,729
in New Zealand working with the global

31
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,619
team and if you're a customer of Equifax

32
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,810

33
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,720
your needs and then supplying what you

34
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,420

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,009
my former employer and this talk is

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:58,439
purely educational so needs to begin so

37
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:02,060
in 2016

38
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:05,548
I joined Equifax Equifax purchase feeder

39
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:08,670
reader became it perfects I was there

40
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,920
for a year and then 25th of August 2017

41
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,869
I traveled to Atlanta Georgia to meet

42
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,750
the global team there was a week-long

43
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,270
conference

44
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,730
amazing group of people it's one of the

45
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,470
best security teams I've worked in this

46
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,690
was this was a global information

47
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,330
security officers so consulting the

48
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:29,350
business non-operational they just their

49
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:32,860
compliance all of that type of thing

50
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:35,140
I was there had a fantastic week jumped

51
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,820
on the plane came back was ready to get

52
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,670
involved in a whole bunch of different

53
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,790
conversations and initiatives when on

54
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:45,359
the 8th of September the breach

55
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,650
announcement came now as you can see

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,870
when I came back from Atlanta on the 5th

57
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,400
September no one than that team had been

58
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:57,070
notified that was a bit of a shock

59
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:02,110
because when the announcement came on

60
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:04,299
the Thursday night US time no one knew

61
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,190
I've heard stories from teams that were

62
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,660
there at the pub and it popped up on the

63
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,640
news that affects had a breach and

64
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,650
they've had that they found out by the

65
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,600
by the pub Lord coming over and saying

66
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,640
hey you guys are from Equifax right I

67
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,310
see your bags well you know about this

68
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,309
breach so that cells some other teams

69
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,510
found out for me what happened was I

70
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,300
came into the office on the Friday

71
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,799
walked and passed the team of New

72
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,660
Zealand's addictive assistant and she

73
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,120
said ah so Shan what do you know about

74
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,980
the data breach and I just go you know

75
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,400
okay what what data breach haven't seen

76
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:40,060
anything sit down at my desk and in the

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,190
in the email start in my boss who lives

78
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,739
in Sydney contacted me and said buckle

79
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,230
and something's going on and off we went

80
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,880
so that's not the ideal way to find out

81
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,600
about a security breach in any way shape

82
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,180
or form my first reaction on that was

83
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,400
just total utter shock and despair

84
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,650
because what do you do there's been the

85
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,910
breach once at your parent company

86
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:05,590
you've gotta know you've got no idea

87
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,230
what's going on they're not telling you

88
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,400
anything you would just fear in the

89
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,250
middle trying to answer people's

90
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,450
questions add to the fact that the New

91
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,370
Zealand company knew that law was in

92
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,370
Atlanta and everyone started coming to

93
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:22,450
me for answers and I had to purely go I

94
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:24,160
I don't know so I get pulled into the

95
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,159
GM's office and the first thing you do

96
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,280
and that situation is that you go well

97
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,820
how secure a we you know we've got our

98
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,739
yearly assurance exercises where you get

99
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,200
a reputable firm and to test everything

100
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,330
there happened three months ago but you

101
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,979
start doubting everything and I'm

102
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,510
forever thankful for the fact that the

103
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,550
company that we use I got on the phone

104
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,849
called up and said here shown here from

105
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,070
Equifax and they're able to pretty much

106
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,380
give me a slot that Monday to help and

107
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:57,670
just redo an entire entire web facing

108
00:04:53,380 --> 00:05:00,159
environment and for about two weeks

109
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,020
after that I'm just I'm just depressed I

110
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,610
don't know what's going on I'm not

111
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,969
getting any information I've got a

112
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,940
one-liner from from HQ saying hi you're

113
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,260
don't worry you're not you know you're

114
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,810
not involved in the breach Australia in

115
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,750
New Zealand are separate and for New

116
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,610
Zealand that was kind of enough because

117
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,100
people would call me and just say are we

118
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,330
you know how are we involved in this no

119
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,750
we're not okay can give me something

120
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:28,270
official no not yet okay please give me

121
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:31,150
one as soon as you can but this is where

122
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:34,450
I guess my my journey started to change

123
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:37,260
from my peers as the other countries

124
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,030
they had a lot more assurance activities

125
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:43,770
my manager for the next three months

126
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:47,140
after this I think he had 282

127
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:49,599
client meetings and three months during

128
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,860
during the work side of things so I kind

129
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,930
of lost check with him because he was

130
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,400
looking after Australia and New Zealand

131
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,240
there's only two of us to cover the

132
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,239
region at this time whereas for me what

133
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,560
happened was transformation activities

134
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,480
begin where to the three weeks it to the

135
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,850
three weeks after the breach

136
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,290
announcement there was a global company

137
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,240
white communication saying right we've

138
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:16,840
got this big body of work I need you to

139
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,610
help scope this okay but for that to

140
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,640
occur because they're a global company

141
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,740
you had the main side the things in

142
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,849
Atlanta which was pretty much just being

143
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,610
told what to do by the US government

144
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:30,220
various regulations and compliance

145
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,050
bodies over there saying right here

146
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:35,260
here's these number of streams which I

147
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,760
think got up to 28 and then they would

148
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,340
communicate it to Australia in New

149
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,719
Zealand and you're expected to kind of

150
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,030
tow the line and prioritize

151
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,910
what's going on now I was in an office

152
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,950
of 60 people of those 60 people I had

153
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,260
two development teams at the time those

154
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,690
two development teams were on required

155
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,870
compliance activities for New Zealand we

156
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:59,670
couldn't stop to do that so the security

157
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:02,320
remediation team became me I was it I

158
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:05,020
was promised contractors that would

159
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,420
start up soon but because we are still

160
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,740
going through merging activities we had

161
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,750
all these people lined up to start in

162
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,580
December and steered what happened is

163
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,160
that our you can't use I can't use those

164
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,380
agencies anymore here's a new one which

165
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,470
meant that I didn't get my resource

166
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:23,800
until April which means for me for six

167
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:26,800
months I was pretty much on this project

168
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,270
along with the head of QA and the head

169
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,370
of solutions architecture for New

170
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,020
Zealand so these three people trying to

171
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,530
work out how to attack all these complex

172
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,060
problems so I stopped being a consultant

173
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,719
and more back into operational

174
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:45,660
activities you know I over this period I

175
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:48,010
was be a Solutions Architect p.m.

176
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,660
helpdesk just anything anything that

177
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,700
needed done that would come to me and

178
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,860
that kind of put me in a weird position

179
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,479
because I was now the I was now the

180
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,150
focal point for all of these activities

181
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,669
going on around New Zealand reporting to

182
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,770
Australia that went back to the states

183
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:06,849
right this big long giant reporting

184
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:08,080
chain and so what would happen is that

185
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,310
my name would be just dropped into

186
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,750
everything so I beginning emails and

187
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,160
phone calls and things all throughout

188
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,620
the day because I was the main contact

189
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,740
point which meant my day at this time

190
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,600
started like this and this is how it was

191
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,330
for a good nine nine to twelve months

192
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,340
from memory I kind of wake up at six I'd

193
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,310
see what they'd come through from the US

194
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,479
because if something had changed

195
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,490
overnight you need to go for the project

196
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,809
across in estream I knew today I was

197
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,820
going to have to fix something or work

198
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:38,829
with the team to do that I'd get into

199
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,289
the New Zealand office from there I'd

200
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,789
have about two hours to myself to figure

201
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,040
out a plan of attack for the day and

202
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,230
what was going on and then from there

203
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,020
Australia would come a line come online

204
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,370
around 11:00 and they'd suddenly have a

205
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,839
whole bunch of more information so any

206
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,060
plans are made during that first five

207
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,710
hours we now changed

208
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,479
prodigies are changed no please don't do

209
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:00,540
that you're doing this now I've got this

210
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,850
doesn't matter go on to this then from

211
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,500
there I'll work on that till about five

212
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,110
o'clock in the afternoon then I'd go

213
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,760
home I'd done my bit but then you'd get

214
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,650
the end of a messages from people saying

215
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,330
or hang on I don't have this information

216
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,189
I need this now we need to report this

217
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,530
this is going in a report bla bla bla

218
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,270
bla bla needed next day at Congress like

219
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:22,140
all this type of reporting information

220
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:25,490
which I didn't have to bug my that the

221
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:28,610
New Zealand team to find information on

222
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:30,420
now one of the core pieces was that the

223
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,630
infrastructure so other things was

224
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,430
mended out of Australia and I can tell

225
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,290
you now if anyone here is supported from

226
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,719
a team in Australia and a breach happens

227
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:42,089
they are looking after their own do not

228
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,250
for a second think that because you got

229
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,260
in the SLA that they look after your

230
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,670
company in the time of a breach because

231
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,090
all resources are just being chucked

232
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,709
over there it's it was a really trying

233
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,300
period and essentially I deserve to lean

234
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,820
on or the political capital any

235
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,229
friendships or anything to get done out

236
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,050
of the Australian team because they were

237
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,300
wrapped up in Australia everything else

238
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,280
I had to kind of do by myself in New

239
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,020
Zealand with an outsourcer and there was

240
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:12,930
only so much I was able to do during

241
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:15,900
that time so that brings me onto these

242
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,420
slides which is just some when you are

243
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:21,209
call that in a in a post for each world

244
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,890
security is very different because it's

245
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,180
no longer he's our strategy here's our

246
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,069
long-term goal we want to do this in

247
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,930
three and four years that's now high

248
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,050
we've got eight months to implement an

249
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:33,569
array of controls that are very complex

250
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:35,760
let's go do this and you're no longer a

251
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,920
technology function for me and felt more

252
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,720
like a product and the product you're

253
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,760
trying to get out is security and your

254
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,520
customer is regulators and compliance

255
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,540
authorities and the the cost of doing

256
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:50,550
that is not it's not loss of sales or

257
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,410
anything like that there's huge fines

258
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,300
and potentially going out of business

259
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,990
that's a Glee different environment to

260
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:01,020
work in and if you're in a multinational

261
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,880
company and you're doing all these type

262
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,040
of activities make sure all your

263
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,110
territories are on the same using the

264
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,029
same project methodology

265
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,040
also happen at this time is that we

266
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:15,300
transitioned from with our waterfall

267
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,430
projects to agile agile safe I thought

268
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,290
okay this was going on worldwide so

269
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,420
there was a period of six months we also

270
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,149
became an agile coach scrum master

271
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:29,130
because of the fact that I get the Syst

272
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:30,750
of 28 28 different activities and I had

273
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,939
to prioritize that put them in Sprint's

274
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,110
all of that estimates do all of those

275
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,250
things because that's what we were using

276
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,170
down here in Australia there in New

277
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,350
Zealand and when we were reporting back

278
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,459
to the states I kind of just just didn't

279
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,899
feel right be like what you're doing

280
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:45,449
this where's this priority why aren't

281
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:48,329
you doing all of this in parallel but I

282
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,800
later found out like every like a year

283
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:51,719
later that they were still using

284
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,779
waterfall methodology so if you're

285
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,060
reporting on agile to area which is

286
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:58,860
using waterfall we've got a mess of all

287
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,869
the communication massive loss of

288
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,220
communication and that just makes things

289
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:08,459
harder which is why carrying on with

290
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,440
carrying on with with my day you know

291
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,969
I'd go to bed ten eleven o'clock at

292
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,510
night with what the phone at the side of

293
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,920
my bed and then you know at the time I

294
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,360
had a fourth my daughter was four years

295
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,459
old but she should be waking up at night

296
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,470
so I'd wake up the porter back to bed

297
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:25,018
and in that spinning up two or three

298
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,399
hours or she's asleep responding the

299
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,410
changes and things going on I'm trying

300
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,670
to figure out what's going on - whatever

301
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,829
contractors picked up the ball whatever

302
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,569
PM's testing me just trying to find

303
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:35,459
information so I can be prepared when I

304
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,350
wake up make sure wake up and like an

305
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:41,160
hour or two that I know what the next

306
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:43,949
steps were the next day and what works

307
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,170
in your country or territory may not

308
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:48,479
work in another fight for what you know

309
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,279
is right by your people one of the

310
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,529
biggest challenges which I had is that

311
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,300
New Zealand is pretty unique in the fact

312
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:55,800
that there's no local cloud presence in

313
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,750
New Zealand that's all in Australia and

314
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,670
with that comes all types of data

315
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,589
sovereignty issues so when you're

316
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:05,399
looking for moving things to the cloud

317
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:06,870
as a pattern and the global company cool

318
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,040
that works in every other territory

319
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,779
because they either don't have any data

320
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,699
sovereignty or they're hosted in country

321
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:13,680
but with New Zealand that's tricky

322
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:16,439
because if you want to take advantage of

323
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,180
AWS a juror or GCP or moving stuff to

324
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,060
Australia and there are specific

325
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,949
contracts and clauses

326
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,270
and regulations which require certain

327
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,960
amounts of data to stay in New Zealand

328
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:28,370
and it was kind of funny from the fact

329
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,680
that Here I am I'm down in this little

330
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,530
corner of the world two reporting layers

331
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,569
deep to to the states and I'm the one

332
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,430
kicking up the fuss about moving data

333
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,260
anywhere offshore unlike coke that's a

334
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,839
global patent doesn't work for us can

335
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,910
you please support us in other ways and

336
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,130
the biggest fights I had wasn't with

337
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,780
other parts of the business it was with

338
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,790
the security team saying why can't we

339
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,010
use the spec and why can't why can't use

340
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,630
this pattern why can't we deploy why

341
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,610
won't you just do this can we do

342
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:57,950
something like just put it in there and

343
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:00,320
ask for forgiveness later and I just had

344
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,330
none of that not having any type of

345
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,020
thing happen on my watch to New Zealand

346
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:07,520
data just so things can get fixed right

347
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,120
because I was comfortable with the

348
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,980
environment

349
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:14,620
I still am no need to change it so

350
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:17,570
there's that side of things and then

351
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:20,120
post breach business incident response

352
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,830
personal the people with the most

353
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,960
knowledge in your organization that you

354
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,340
rely on the most the one to two people

355
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,350
that know everything about the company

356
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,670
have been there from day dot they are

357
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,080
the ones that suffer the most they are

358
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,270
the one that's pulled in every direction

359
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,290
imagine having 28 different projects

360
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,819
dreams come to you for information

361
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,579
because I need to for that this bridge

362
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,430
sheet there form anything like that in

363
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,080
order to get things moving though that

364
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,640
person becomes squeezed they're going to

365
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,190
become unhappy I'm unhappy because that

366
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,040
person is unhappy and it just ends up in

367
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,690
the giant just a giant pit of despair

368
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,099
because you see them being hammered

369
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,230
they're being hammered along with you by

370
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,380
all these are the 28 different project

371
00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:00,520
teams and whoever's on dick that day and

372
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:03,820
that's in it's tough it's very tough

373
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,960
because I liken the situation I was in

374
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,430
to if you think about the project that's

375
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,260
going live a big project then you've got

376
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,849
those three or four days where it's very

377
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,460
intense everyone's on board everyone's

378
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,970
fighting to get it done fixing any

379
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:19,490
issues imagine doing that for over a

380
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,770
year and the toll that would take on

381
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,390
anyone inside your organization in the

382
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,400
loan a company of 60 people

383
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:28,760
we're only probably 20 I think it was 20

384
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:31,949
the 30 where IT staff right that is a

385
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,959
mess of toll mentally and physically

386
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:36,510
you can't fake who you are under stress

387
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:39,449
now I mentioned this am I my purple

388
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,589
contour where you know who you are

389
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,029
and if you're trying to put up some type

390
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:44,279
of front will be something you're not

391
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:46,740
when you're in one of these situations

392
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,910
you're going to be found out because if

393
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,389
you're doing this for a year

394
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:54,269
something's going to give so this is

395
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:55,860
where I found out that empathy is my

396
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:57,630
biggest strength I may not be the

397
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,980
brothers technically but I know exactly

398
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,779
what's going inside the business how

399
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,940
people are feeling how I can get them to

400
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:04,110
work I just need to protect them from

401
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,060
what's going on so they've got the

402
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,550
confidence and the time to do what

403
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,430
they're paid to do and your mental

404
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:15,269
health food deteriorate this job broke

405
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:17,219
me I've got no shame in saying that this

406
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:19,529
broke me and this broke other members of

407
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,959
my team I know if two people they got

408
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:25,290
Hospital hospitalized for stress and

409
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:27,209
anxiety and exhaustion there are a

410
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:30,269
number of people who missed family

411
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:32,310
events holidays school events anything

412
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:34,260
and everything because something needed

413
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:38,130
to be done I'm pretty sure the team in

414
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:40,110
the states worked 18-hour days six days

415
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,750
a week for this whole period because I'd

416
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,490
come on a come on on Monday morning he's

417
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,120
a whole team working Sunday night sort

418
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,920
of like midnight in Atlanta right and

419
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,430
that's that's the hidden cost that means

420
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,660
we're health of people that they are

421
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,459
working on this project that's hidden

422
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,199
the hidden behind the window success

423
00:16:56,459 --> 00:17:00,959
stories the high we did this and look

424
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:02,430
this is amazing it's hidden behind stock

425
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,290
price it's hidden behind we spent this

426
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:10,049
amount less security because the real

427
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:12,329
cost is as to the people now this became

428
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:15,480
apparent to me because after a year of

429
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:17,010
doing this going back to Atlanta and my

430
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,459
whole team was still there no one had

431
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:23,970
left apart from one team who managed to

432
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:27,270
or get transferred like a certain place

433
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:29,340
a year afterwards in Argentina but I'd

434
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:31,590
been there for a year I was absolutely

435
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,980
empty and our between of the after

436
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,540
Atlanta the go for a go on holiday with

437
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,900
my family for a month and Greece in the

438
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:43,049
UK this picture is me with my daughter

439
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,600
at the Olympic swimming pool in London

440
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:47,490
now I used to love taking her swimming

441
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,049
and this is the first time on dinner in

442
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:52,260
years and kids that you know when

443
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:54,179
something's up because this photo was

444
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:57,030
taken just after she told me daddy I

445
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:58,500
miss you take me swimming and that's

446
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,370
because while I was involved and

447
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,820
although this work

448
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:05,039
I wasn't prison motion emotionally or

449
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,678
mentally I was there but I wasn't my

450
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,270
mind was elsewhere or my energy or my

451
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,740
emotional energy had gone and the people

452
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,020
I'm working with to make sure that they

453
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:16,320
were protected that they had the space

454
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,700
to do these things that I felt oh yeah

455
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,700
it was me it felt there's other if my

456
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:25,289
family down and my daughter down so

457
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,850
thanks to Equifax for an experience no

458
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:30,190
