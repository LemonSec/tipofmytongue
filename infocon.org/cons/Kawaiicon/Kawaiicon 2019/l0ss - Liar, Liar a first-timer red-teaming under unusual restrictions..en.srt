1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,280
hi yes hello it's a quick timeslot and

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,160
I've got a long and kind of goofy story

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,928
to tell you so I'm gonna have to hurry

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,719
I'm Mike lost I work for asterisk

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,670
information security in Perth I do pen

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,279
testing and whatnot you might know me as

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,869
the guy who made gripper and I'm just

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,119
going to tell you a quick goofy war

9
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,710
story about this one time a client

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,170
wanted something that kind of seemed

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,170
impossible and how we pulled it off by

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:36,450
being lucky as hell and not particularly

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,800
prepared I've had to trim some of the

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,809
middle bits out of this story to make it

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,980
fit in the 15 minutes but the original

16
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,949
engagement did include substantial

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,440
contributions from nano and DT here so

18
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:51,239
credit where credit's due and please do

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,010
be dumbassery to me so the brief several

20
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,750
years ago back when I'd only been doing

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,969
this pen testing thing for about six

22
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,170
months we had a client come and ask us

23
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:03,539
to red team then please note the

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,129
enormous scare quotes I love doing the

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,320
bad guy stuff so I got really excited

26
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,110
but when the clients started to explain

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,000
their requirements in detail we realized

28
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,240
that what they wanted met basically no

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,400
accepted definition of red teaming the

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,110
client was a big organization with a

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,820
bunch of facilities out in the suburbs

32
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,890
they wanted us to start by gaining

33
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,649
physical access to one of the satellite

34
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,049
sites and then use that physical access

35
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,630
to get onto their network then they

36
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,060
wanted us to pop a specific confluence

37
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,600
site and to face it to face the front

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,340
page to provoke incident response their

39
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,309
client contact also said that we weren't

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,130
allowed to quote run any exploits on any

41
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,780
other targets in the network we tried to

42
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,908
explain that this would be an extremely

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,649
odd thing for a real-world attacker to

44
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,340
do but the client did a lot of hand

45
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,320
waving and just kept talking he he'd

46
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,210
spoken to their internal legal team and

47
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,199
they told him that the defacement could

48
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:04,770
not be anything offensive or political

49
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,899
no porn Isis flags whatever fair enough

50
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,519
we said but this is getting less and

51
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,348
less realistic the more you tell us no

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,690
one's going to get onto your internal

53
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,679
network hack a single confluence site to

54
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,359
face it with an April it

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,689
message and then stop dude didn't want

56
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:22,950
to hear it after that he said our job

57
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:24,900
would be to keep putting the defacement

58
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,469
image back again and again until evicted

59
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,810
from the network or until he cried uncle

60
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:32,549
then as the meeting is wrapping up and

61
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,569
he's walking out the dude pulled a

62
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:37,829
Columbo on us and he said one more thing

63
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:39,328
the legal team said that when you're

64
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:40,950
trying to get into the building it has

65
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:46,290
to be during business hours for safety

66
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:54,899
reasons also you can't lie to any of our

67
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:57,840
staff we were kind of flabbergasted of

68
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,000
course we tried to explain how absurd a

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,069
task this was and that surely they'd

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,079
been some miscommunication between him

71
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:07,768
and the lawyers but he was adamant no

72
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:09,269
lying so at less than the first if the

73
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:11,040
client asks for something dumb or

74
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,439
impossible try to figure out what they

75
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,060
actually need and certainly if they're

76
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,500
not at the right maturity level and

77
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,449
they're asking for red teaming maybe

78
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,609
question that we discussed it internally

79
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:26,280
and decided that if they were paying it

80
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:28,739
was going to be worth a try weed rules

81
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,079
lawyer our way through the thing and if

82
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,090
we failed we do what testers always do

83
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:34,739
when a client decides to try and

84
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,879
hamstring us on a gig we put a big

85
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:42,180
section at the front of the reports

86
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:45,269
there's limitations so preparation first

87
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,099
we tried to do some recon the site that

88
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:49,079
the client selected for us was basically

89
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,988
the worst it was in like a semi-rural

90
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,629
area till the end of a long driveway it

91
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:56,129
didn't seem to have any Wi-Fi and it had

92
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:59,069
like those mirrored windows so you

93
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,569
couldn't see anything inside and one of

94
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:05,129
us was clearly just gonna have to walk

95
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:07,500
up and wing it I never built a Dropbox

96
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,659
for a gig like this before but neither

97
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,699
had anyone else in the team so I just

98
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,978
kind of made it up we ended up with two

99
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:17,549
devices to plant both are basically just

100
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:21,209
raspberry PI's and powered USB hub then

101
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:23,279
for one we had a Wi-Fi adapter set up to

102
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,289
silently host an IP you know hope we'd

103
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,180
be able to reach it from the car park or

104
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:30,360
the bushland nearby

105
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,280
the other one had a USB LTI adapter that

106
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,610
will connect out to a CTO server with

107
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,349
Open VPN in retrospect I think the only

108
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,130
way we could have made each look more

109
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:45,150
like IEDs is if we'd gaffer tape each of

110
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:47,430
them to a 3310 and a rusty artillery

111
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,580
round I found this picture on Pinterest

112
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:58,200
by the way it's it's a one-sixth scale

113
00:04:50,580 --> 00:05:01,020
toy AED lesson number two don't make

114
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,960
your drop boxes look like bombs buy a

115
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:08,789
goddamn Chiefy box also buy a label

116
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:11,489
maker and write IT do not unplug this

117
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,140
being the first time that I'd done this

118
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,810
kind of thing I wanted to do it right

119
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,340
and so I kidded myself out like I was

120
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,100
breaking into the Pentagon or whatever

121
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,520
lockpicks multi-tool proxmark zip-ties

122
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,260
gaffer tape the whole bit I can't pick

123
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,229
locks to save my life so I don't know

124
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,550
what I thought I was doing of all the

125
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,900
crap I brought the only things I

126
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,840
actually use were the drop boxes

127
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,390
themselves and badge that we faked up

128
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,229
with like a color printer and some clear

129
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:41,460
packing tape so less than the third you

130
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,750
are not James Bond

131
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:48,870
don't bring a bunch of crap you're never

132
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:52,140
going to use right the mission itself so

133
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,520
I Drive into the place I parked the car

134
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,969
I double-check that I haven't wet my

135
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,680
pants and I walk in the front door

136
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,540
there's a desk with a receptionist at it

137
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,100
and she looks me right in the eye as I

138
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,710
walk in so I know I'm clearly not gonna

139
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,160
be able to just glide past so I've gotta

140
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:11,239
talk to her but I'm not allowed to lie

141
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,710
hi I said I'm Mike do I need to sign in

142
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,390
yes in the book just over there who are

143
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:19,560
you here to see she said by the way I

144
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:23,020
did not sign in I've been sent down by

145
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,180
IT to do some Network testing

146
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,539
she says ah do you know where you're

147
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,310
going I reply I just need to find a

148
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,940
spare Network port I can plug a testing

149
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,940
device into

150
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,810
she says well there's an area that

151
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:50,539
everyone's just moved out of will that

152
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:54,500
work yeah that'll work great lessons for

153
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:56,419
half the truth is often a great lie also

154
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,190
the best backstory is the one you know

155
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:59,960
inside out if you used to work helpdesk

156
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:03,110
pretending to be a helpdesk person is

157
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,239
really easy so she shows me around the

158
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,830
corner to this big semi open plan kind

159
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,030
of area and I start crawling around on

160
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,280
the floor under the desks with my laptop

161
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,690
looking for a port to patch into but

162
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,570
they've all been unpatched because

163
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:16,340
everyone's moved out of this area so I'm

164
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,150
pouring sweat because it's the middle of

165
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,260
summer and they've switched the a/c off

166
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,789
eventually after a bunch of horsing

167
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,010
around and swearing I find out a life

168
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:28,190
port I plugged the Wi-Fi based Dropbox

169
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:31,190
into it and stick it to the back of a

170
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:33,080
filing cabinet and then I realized that

171
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:38,000
there's no powerpoints anywhere

172
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,320
nearby so of course I panic and I

173
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,330
basically walk laps around the room for

174
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,560
a couple of minutes until I noticed that

175
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,930
there's actually a coiled up extension

176
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,460
cord on one of the desks and I've just

177
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,979
been too freaked out and agitated to

178
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,739
notice it so less than five is don't

179
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:55,430
panic and build battery backups into

180
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,099
your drop boxes so I plug in I confirm

181
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,800
that the phones on my phone that the APS

182
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:02,539
come up and then I start looking around

183
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,000
for a good place to plant the second box

184
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:07,969
I'm feeling good this is working I'm

185
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,400
doing this so I start walking down the

186
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,080
hall trying to remember all the advice

187
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,780
anyone ever gave me about this kind of

188
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:20,180
thing people walk past and I smile like

189
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:22,010
a lunatic and say ie I find another area

190
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,599
that's been mostly emptied out and I'm

191
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,880
just about to start rooting around under

192
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,810
a desk when I hear a voice from one of

193
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,450
the offices around the edge of the room

194
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:34,429
cyber security where's Berg report an

195
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:38,659
incident or uber bruh

196
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:42,468
I've been rumbled what did I do how

197
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:44,480
did I up I freeze RAM and I listen

198
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:46,610
as hard as I can but my heart's beating

199
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,370
really hard my jaw is clenching up I

200
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,770
can't hear I walk a bit closer to

201
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,480
the door The Voice is coming from so I

202
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,189
can hear better and I can see this some

203
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,899
and he's facing away from me but he

204
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,060
doesn't look like he's on the phone I

205
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:01,220
take a look at his screen and just about

206
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,689
burst out laughing because he's doing

207
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,529
his annual cyber security awareness

208
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:08,750
training and he's got the volume up

209
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:12,110
super loud in his laptop speakers so he

210
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,670
can't hear me behind him sigh relief I

211
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,470
find another life port in a corner

212
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,510
behind a mountain of crap I plug it in I

213
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,639
wait for the lights to go green a text

214
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:25,089
Nano to get him to let me know when the

215
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:27,440
Open VPN connection goes live years pass

216
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:29,870
finally he tells me it's working and I

217
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,579
basically sprint out the door dive into

218
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:37,880
my car speed back to HQ

219
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:39,410
so the hacker named once we actually got

220
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,329
down to it the actual hacking stuff was

221
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,790
kind of fish in a barrel

222
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:45,349
we responded up a set of low proof creds

223
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:48,410
we use those to pull some scheduled

224
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,970
tasks at a group policy use those creds

225
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,760
to push Empire agents out to a few

226
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,680
servers got some da dug in like a tick

227
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,000
I know Empire's not cool anymore but

228
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,660
this was back when Empire was actually

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,970
new nope none of this constitutes

230
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:06,709
running an exploit on any of the servers

231
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:09,190
lesson seven nothing is too dumb or too

232
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:12,469
obvious to be worth trying

233
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,000
next nano deployed a scheduled task to

234
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,680
the confluence server to replace the

235
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,019
template for the main dashboard with

236
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,719
this every 30 minutes

237
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:22,490
you can't go political you can't go

238
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,579
offensive so you might as well go 90s

239
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:28,420
kid nano might have gone a bit overboard

240
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:28,420
I don't know

241
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,760
at this point we told the client contact

242
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,349
that where we were up to and then we

243
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,420
just went quiet checking in on the side

244
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,010
every now and then a little bit later we

245
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,839
noticed that the sites returned to

246
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,130
normal then shortly after that we said

247
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,350
the defacement page come back as

248
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,180
expected then about 10 minutes after

249
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,710
that we noticed the whole servers gone

250
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,810
down which was kind of tricky because

251
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:03,740
that meant there was nothing for us to

252
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:07,130
keep defacing so we found another server

253
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,420
with a default is web server install we

254
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,820
dropped out a Faceman image in the web

255
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,709
route with an index.html and then

256
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:17,260
created a cname record in DNS that

257
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:17,260
pointed the original back to ours

258
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:28,290
that uh which brings us to lesson eight

259
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:30,238
there is always another way it's at this

260
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,189
point the client contact called us to

261
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:33,839
let us know that their staff who'd been

262
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:37,649
reasonably chill about the defacement

263
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,329
originally were basically panicking that

264
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:44,850
we'd somehow magically hack the server

265
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:46,679
that was turned off and they were

266
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,329
getting ready to like shut down Internet

267
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,179
connectivity for the whole company which

268
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:52,979
is pretty big

269
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:55,199
that's the point where he went all this

270
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,939
has gone too far so he told them it was

271
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:59,549
just an exercise and called a stop to

272
00:11:56,939 --> 00:12:01,559
the whole thing we tried to suggest that

273
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:03,720
we keep going so they could have some

274
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,719
like hunting practice or you know

275
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,369
practice their processes whatever but I

276
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,989
think they were so horrified by how

277
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:11,879
badly it had all gone that they just

278
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:16,379
wanted to take the report and lick their

279
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:17,819
wounds in peace then a year later the

280
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:21,029
client came back and asked for another

281
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:22,559
round of the same they were most

282
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:26,129
interested in seeing how their new

283
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:28,139
incident response processes stood up so

284
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:30,179
we suggested that this time we do it

285
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:31,949
rodeo style straight to assume to breach

286
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:34,350
drop agents on half a dozen machines

287
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:36,859
wave a big red flag in front of the blue

288
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,269
team and then hold on as long as we can

289
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,949
which leads us to the weirdest thing

290
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:43,009
I've ever had to put in a report and

291
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:45,209
then read out to a roomful of sea levels

292
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:47,999
allow me to read an excerpt from the

293
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:50,368
engagement time alone own own 50 user

294
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,720
one's machine became active we used

295
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,369
Metasploit to launch a web browser on

296
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,069
the workstation and display a YouTube

297
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:58,410
video of Russian people dancing it to

298
00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:00,610
folk music in the street

299
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:04,839
this did not appear to provoke a

300
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:07,029
reaction triggered a PowerShell window

301
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,649
displaying an animated ASCII version of

302
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:11,430
the video clip for Rick Astley's never

303
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:14,350
going to give you up

304
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:17,939
client contact advises us user one has

305
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:20,290
not yet initiated incident response

306
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:26,498
triggered a system trained notification

10:33 using one's machine reappeared on

310
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:34,930
the network client contact advised that

311
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,120
user one had requested assistance from

312
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,998
desktop support had not initiated

to expedite incident response suggested

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,230
targeting user too by the way user one

317
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:51,759
and two are both people with the word

318
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:53,110
security in their job title and they

319
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,509
start within visual distance of our

320
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,129
client contact so he could tell what

321
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:58,829
that they were seeing this stuff and not

322
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:01,720
reacting

323
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:03,550
11:01 deployed an agent via pass exact

to your user to his workstation and

325
