1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,770
Thanks everyone!
I am here to talk about the mechanics of

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,200
being good to each other- not just what
you intend but how you do it.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,400
I'm Courtney, I'm an SRE and incident
response specialist and I am going to

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,959
talk about, as she said, a disaster- a
disaster in which no one was harmed!

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,280
But it's still pretty exciting. I'll be
talking about this as an operations

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,140
specialist, but a lot of the techniques
that we use to look at failures in

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,949
operations also apply to security
problems, whether you're talking about

8
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:38,489
pen testing, reacting to getting popped,
or handling vulnerability reports.

9
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,379
You can tell from my vowels that I'm not
from around here! This talk was written

10
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,218
about North American English, which is
hardly a monolith, but it does have a lot

11
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,379
of common assumptions. Unfortunately I
don't have the expertise to localize

12
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,214
this talk to the Englishes that you will
hear most often in this part of the world.

13
00:00:57,215 --> 00:01:00,540
And I don't have time to present
that information even if I had it!

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,379
I do have slides from longer versions of this talk, which talk a little bit more about

15
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,430
the linguistic principles that I am
basing all of my content here on, which

16
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,450
would help you to extrapolate this to
the Englishes that you will hear in your

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,320
professional and social lives. I will
tweet links to the longer versions of

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,559
this after I'm done here.

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,940
So let's talk about disasters. Who doesn't like a good disaster where no one died?

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,840
Seattle, where I lived for several years, has the two

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,270
longest floating bridges in the world
and in 1990 one of them sank over

22
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,699
Thanksgiving Day weekend in a storm
while it was being repurposed.

23
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,850
Since many people here may not know, Thanksgiving Day weekend is the biggest holiday in

24
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,470
the United States, it is the biggest
travel season of the year, everybody goes

25
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,460
somewhere to go with family and nobody
is doing their regular stuff- and then

26
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,440
of course we have Black Friday which
probably you all have heard of.

27
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,520
So this happened when there was nobody paying attention.

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,560
The public reporting to this day is extremely simplistic but the official investigation found that there

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,700
were five factors involved and all of
them were required for the bridge to fail.

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,519
So what was going on at the time?
They were doing a process called hydrodemolition-

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,349
they were scraping off the
roadway on the existing bridge span

32
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:21,869
because they were going to turn it from
a two-way bridge into a one-way bridge

33
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,899
and they were building a second span
alongside. So they're basically doubling

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,520
the capacity of this bridge. That means
that they have contaminated water, right?

35
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,870
You are blasting the tarmac off the
surface of this bridge and the original

36
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,560
plan was just to let it run off into the lake.

37
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,700
Sounds good, right? Nobody's gonna get upset about that, that won't be an ecological incident or anything, right?!

38
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,619
So the Environmental Protection Agency came in and said "you cannot do that! You have

39
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,380
to do something with that water, you need
to store it, you need to treat it, you

40
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:59,500
can't just let it, like, go." Since you can't store water in piles, they needed a container to put it in.

41
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,660
Floating bridges are hollow! Right? [audience murmurs] Yeah! So they're

42
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,799
made up of these big pieces of concrete
that are hollow in the middle, a little

43
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,319
bit like a tanker, right? That's how you
get something as big and as dense as

44
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,828
concrete and rebar to float, is you make
it hollow. So they figured all right, what

45
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:23,250
do we know about this bridge? The bridge
is actually in really good shape- all of

46
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,269
the concrete was in excellent condition-
they like, did a really exhaustive survey

47
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,660
and they like mapped all the cracks and
all of it was in better condition than

48
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,660
they expected and also it had been over-engineered so it was floating higher

49
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,460
than originally planned. 50-year old bridge
in really good condition.

50
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,140
They figured out how much water they could store, they gave themselves a margin of error, they

51
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,840
figured out a schedule for like, trucking
the water away- they had this whole plan.

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:53,180
And over the weekend there was the storm,
one pontoon sank, and dragged seven more

53
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,700
down after it.

54
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,380
Shit is more likely to break when you're
fucking with it! [audience laughter]

55
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,980
Important life lessons.

56
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:10,200
Okay so, this video is some of the best public coverage that I could find on this disaster,

57
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,440
and I'm going to play a little bit of it for you. 
If I can see my cursor. Yessssss.

58
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,200
<Video begins with dramatic music and narration>: Built in 1940 in Seattle,

59
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,219
the Lacey V. Murrow Bridge was named after the director of Washington State's

60
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,860
Department of Transportation. The bridge
stood for 50 years, but in November of

61
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:39,140
1990, a rehabilitation and maintenance
operation on the bridge led to disaster.

62
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
[tense musical cue]

63
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,580
Spanning a short but deep section of
Seattle's Lake Washington, the Murrow

64
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:56,429
bridge floated on a row of 25 hollow
concrete pontoons, each 350 feet long.

65
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,080
The pontoons were bolted together for
stability and anchored to the bottom of

66
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,340
the lake.

67
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:11,000
<Expert quote>: The conditions are just right for use of such a structure because the water

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,330
conditions on under- under which they're
installed are perfect- that is, very seldom

69
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:23,090
is there any ice, very seldom
 is there a heavy current, and

70
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,719
the water is very deep- 200 or more feet.

71
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,620
<Video narration>: In the fall of 1990, the Murrow bridge was undergoing a facelift by means of

72
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,180
hydrodemolition, a process in which
highly pressurized water is used to

73
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,970
break up the roadway.
Since environmental regulations

74
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,880
prohibited dumping the contaminated
water into the lake,

75
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,909
it was temporarily stored in the empty
pontoons, via access holes which were cut

76
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,340
into the tops and sides of some sections.
The water level inside the pontoons was

77
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,380
carefully monitored so the structure
would not be compromised.

78
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,540
[tense musical cue]

79
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,440
But on Thanksgiving weekend, with bridge
crews short-handed, a heavy storm hit the

80
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,980
Seattle area. Rain water drained into the
open pontoons. Winds from the storm

81
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,190
whipped up the surface of the lake,
propelling splash water into the

82
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,370
pontoons as well.
On the morning of November 25th, eight

83
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,319
waterlogged pontoons sunk into the lake,
taking those sections of the bridge down

84
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,400
with them and severing 12 anchoring
cables of a bridge that was being

85
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,049
constructed nearby. While luckily no one
was injured, the cost of damage was

86
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,909
estimated at 69 million dollars. An
investigation of the accident came to a

87
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:51,379
sobering, if unsurprising, conclusion.
<Expert quote>: After very extensive study and very

88
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:58,159
sophisticated computer modeling methods, the conclusion was that concrete pontoons

89
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:05,220
simply don't float when they're full of
water [audience laughter]. A very unsophisticated mode of failure.

90
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,680
<Return to narration.: The Lacey V. Murrow bridge was

91
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:13,279
rebuilt two years later. Though it looks
the same from the outside, the pontoons

92
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,580
that support the bridge have been
divided into smaller sections to

93
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,449
minimize damage from leaks, a precaution
that underscores the structural

94
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:25,699
similarities between floating bridges
and floating ships. <Expert quote>: The pontoons were

95
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:32,779
designed with multiple cells, not unlike
the multiple cell super tankers, so that

96
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:39,779
failure in one place would not bring down the entire pontoon. <Different expert quote, cut off>: What has happened here

97
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,059
<Return to speaker>: Okay, so that all sounds pretty obvious, right?

98
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:52,280
Like, the whole story that they drew there about how this bridge sank seems very reasonable and understandable.

99
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,720
And it's not true.

100
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,560
So they checked a lot of stuff. You don't have to read this whole slide, I wouldn't think it's worth it-

101
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,680
So I'm basing this on a paper which was published after the investigation was finished.

102
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,180
They sent divers down at the bottom of the lake to look at the sections of the pontoons

103
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,599
that sank, they that looked at the
pontoons that were still up, this was a

104
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,720
massive investigation. The computer
modeling he mentioned was actually

105
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,020
really a big deal too, in 1990.

106
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,560
The official analysis says all of this- this is the shortest way to describe what happened to this bridge.

107
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,600
I'm gonna read it, for anyone who might not be able to.

108
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,600
"The loads that created significant leakage were the combined effects of all accumulations of water,

109
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,510
including rain after the windstorm,
longitudinal flow on the surface of the

110
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,980
bridge, so that's water on top of the
bridge moving back and forth, and pumping-

111
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,720
pumping water out of the pontoons-
through November 24th 1990.

112
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,260
These loads caused static moments- so that's pressures- that exceeded the threshold for leakage.

113
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:01,220
Existing cracks were opened sufficiently to allow water to leak into the pontoon.

114
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,520
Progressive and accelerated sinking began at this time."

115
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,440
So that's a nested cascading failure for people who are into that kind of thing, like me!

116
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,960
So what actually happened? They had problems keeping up with the pumping schedule,

117
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,880
and they had problems keeping up with the
pumping schedule such that the water

118
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,660
level in the pontoons was not even- there
were some pontoons with more water and some

119
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,819
with less, which caused torque on the bridge. Then we had wind also twisting the spans,

120
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:35,030
and water whipped up by the wind, so all
together the spans started to twist. And

121
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:40,610
the pontoon that sank first had existing
non-leaking cracks- which again remember

122
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,880
this bridge was in very good condition
for its age, so these were expected

123
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,140
cracks and not even as bad as one would
expect in concrete of that age- the

124
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,770
flexion of the pontoon caused the cracks
to open enough to begin taking on water

125
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,300
from the bottom. That pontoon sank and
dragged several more down after it

126
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,120
because they were connected to each
other.

127
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,880
So that's not the story that we heard in that video, even though the story we heard in that video is

128
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,600
extremely understandable and makes a lot
of sense to us.

129
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,440
And even with all of that there was something missing from the paper that I read.

130
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,900
There's a note that the tankers weren't able to keep up with the pumping schedule, which is how I was able

131
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:23,640
to just describe that to you, but no one
either asked why, or wrote down what happened.

132
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,460
So we know that some crew of people
running some crew of tankers was

133
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:34,520
not able to follow the schedule given to them by the engineers, but we don't know what was behind that.

134
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:40,980
Maybe they were short on trucks, maybe they were short on people, maybe everyone got norovirus, who knows?

135
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,220
But now we'll never know, because no one asked, and it's- however many years it is later, a long time, 30 years?

136
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,580
about 30 years later- right, so we're never
going to know, and this is a big miss.

137
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:56,420
This is something that contributed to the failure of the bridge, that even with all of that careful investigation

138
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,860
and all the money they spent, was not recorded.

139
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:09,980
No one does things they think will blow
up the world, mostly, except for those of

140
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,179
you whose job it is to do that. It's
tempting to say the same thing that the

141
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:17,959
experts in that video did- if you fill a
bridge full of water, it sinks, the idea

142
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,040
was bad in the first place, nobody should
have done it, come on people!

143
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,699
But generally, people whose job it is not to
break things do things that seem

144
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,800
sensible to them at the time- some of you
who were at purplecon yesterday will

145
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,160
remember seeing this in the first
keynote. People do things for reasons, and

146
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,880
those reasons make sense in the context
that the person is in.

147
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,959
So you will get better results if you ask about what they knew. Why something made sense to them.

148
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,459
What makes sense about storing the
water in the pontoons? Well, you literally

149
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,729
can't leave it on top of the bridge in a
pile, right, that's not how water works, we

150
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,240
know that, and if you bring in some kind
of container then you have to manage all

151
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,829
the containers, right, so they had reasons
to think that this was going to work, and

152
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:08,239
they had a plan, and they did a lot of
measurement and analysis and thinking

153
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,680
about it in advance.

154
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,120
Even if what you learn when you ask these questions

155
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:16,730
drives you to go sit in the bathroom
stall and engage in fantasy violence as

156
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,230
a coping mechanism- that's okay, I've done
it, no judgment- you're still better off

157
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,799
because you know more about what happened
and you can make different decisions in

158
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,520
the future and talk to people about why
you're making those different decisions.

159
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,420
So how do we do that, like what's the
mechanics of doing that, what is- what are

160
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,266
the actions that we take and the words
that we use?

161
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:43,140
This is a crash course- this is real fast, like this is the fastest that I can give this talk in,

162
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,240
so here we go, hold on.

163
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,880
Facilitation. I am talking about

164
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:52,369
this partly in the context of an incident
retrospective which was like this long

165
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:55,939
prolonged thing that they did for the
bridge, right, it took many months to come

166
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:59,389
up with all of that information and then
to talk about what happened.

167
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:03,200
I do incident retrospectives as part of
my day job for when

168
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,110
our systems go down and we need to talk
about what happened and how to fix them,

169
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,940
so I'm gonna be using that frame. I will be
talking about both what you would do if

170
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,450
you were the facilitator and what you
would do as a person who is trying to

171
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,820
support the facilitator.

172
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:26,660
As a facilitator, your main jobs are to keep the conversation blame free, not make bad jokes, and run a pretty good meeting.

173
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,709
Or an incident- this also actually works for
while you're in the incident, right, and

174
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,050
you're working with other people to try
to fix this- all of these principles

175
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:40,339
still apply in that moment. It's mostly a matter of speed and whether you're doing it all in real time.

176
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,340
So let's talk about how to talk.

177
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,200
But I'm not here to tell you not to swear. Because if I couldn't say fuck on a regular basis

178
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,280
I would not be able to run incidents!

179
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:58,640
I am here to tell you not to cuss out your team. Don't swear at people on your side, don't call them names,

180
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,040
don't call the things they made names
either. Right? Anything that you make is a

181
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,939
part of you, right, you put your
experience and your hopes into that thing.

182
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,260
Someone else calls it a nasty name,
that's kind of the same as calling you a

183
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,920
nasty name, so those are the things I'm
saying not to do.

184
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,859
How many times during an incident has another person told you something that seemed

185
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,860
like a complete hallucination, just like, we are not even
in the same galaxy, what are you on about?

186
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,120
Miller's law is the way to try to
understand what just happened, and I'll read it.

187
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,560
"In order to understand what
another person is saying, you must assume

188
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,520
that it is true, and try to imagine what
it could be true of."

189
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,660
This was coined by George Armitage Miller. I
learned about this from Suzette Haden

190
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,810
Elgin in the Gentle Art of Verbal
Self-Defense- at a very young age

191
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,920
actually, because that's also the kind of
nerd that I am.

192
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,819
This is the key to understanding systems and people who have different perspectives and

193
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,230
experiences than you do. This is how you
can begin to understand why things are

194
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,180
the way they are in any context- but
especially a context that's not yours.

195
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,390
It's also a critical tool when you're
conducting a retrospective because no

196
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,630
two people have the same experience of
the same incident.

197
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:19,719
Next let's talk about blame. English is a
pretty blamey language.

198
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,760
"You knocked over that vase. Why did you knock over that vase?"

199
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,660
A couple things happening here. One is "you". 
"You. Yeah you! I'm talking to you! Don't just walk away from me!"

200
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:39,480
That feels terrible. Starting a sentence with "you"
draws a line between yourself and the

201
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,949
person you're addressing. It creates an
oppositional conversation. There's the

202
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:47,400
person who is saying "you" and the person
who is being "you'd" at.

203
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,860
"Why? Why did you do that? Why'd you do it like that?" That also feels terrible.

204
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,019
Asking a question that starts with "why" is a request for a justification. It immediately puts the

205
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:05,040
person you're addressing on the
defensive. "Why" questions get you answers

206
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,259
in what is called agentive language.
Because a person did a thing, because I

207
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:15,839
knocked the vase over. It has blame in
the very grammar. Agentive language is

208
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,619
also strongly remembered by English
speakers. So you've just ensured that

209
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:25,160
everyone who heard that remembers that
it's my fault because I knocked it over.

210
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:34,140
Other things not to say: 
always, never, every time, should, just, only.

211
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:40,170
There's more but these are the worst. These are the
ones that really create that feeling of

212
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,680
I am putting you on the spot.

213
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,780
An example:
"Why didn't you just fix that the last time it happened?"

214
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,819
This is not compassionate and it's not effective at helping us understand the problem!

215
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,600
There's a lot going on here so I'm gonna take it apart. This assumes:

216
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:06,160
that it's happened before, maybe more than once, that it could have been fixed last time it happened,

217
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,740
easily (that's the just), that "you" was the right
person to fix it, and that there was no

218
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,579
good reason not to fix it. All of that in
this sentence.

219
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,560
So better things to say:

220
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:32,190
how, what, what if, could we,
what do you think about, what would you

221
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,560
have wanted to know. All of these are
designed to get more complex answers

222
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,970
when used in a question. When asking a
question, think about what you can say

223
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,350
that will get the longest answer. This
might be hard because especially in

224
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,560
business, we sometimes get in the habit
of asking questions that will get us the

225
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,790
most concise answer possible, and that's
often the right thing in business, but

226
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,170
here we need to do something different.
And you may need to practice this.

227
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,100
You may need to work on this grammar the
same way that I know that I, and most

228
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,030
other people I know, had to work on, like,
business communication when we started

229
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:11,820
having real jobs. This is a creative
process, both for you and the people

230
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,820
participating- one of the things you're
trying to do is imagine a better world.

231
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,580
When you ask these better questions,
you're what you're looking for is called

232
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,929
a remediation item, an idea for change
that we can make to code, documentation,

233
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:31,170
processes, monitoring, whatever- that will
give a different outcome in the future.

234
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,890
We call this contributing factor
discovery because complex systems have

235
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,300
complex failures, and talking about a
single root cause keeps us focused on

236
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,990
finding the one thing that broke, instead
of finding all of the things that

237
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,520
contributed to a problem and that we
could then try to address.

238
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:54,919
Human error is not a root cause. When someone says "oh that was me I just made a mistake",

239
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,420
well how did that mistake happen? How did the
system, the system being things like

240
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:06,270
documentation, or playbooks, or training,
or monitoring- how were people able to

241
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,120
make that error? What can we do so that
error is less likely to occur in the future?

242
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,800
There's a lot to work on here-
this is the problem of the pumping crews,

243
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,879
right, it's the same thing.

244
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,360
"Try harder" is not the way we fix the problem!

245
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,300
Depending on people to avoid making errors is
unreasonable. People cannot be perfectly

246
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,560
vigilant and they cannot just be better
rested. The human you have today is the

247
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,950
human you have to plan for in the future,
complete with sleep deprivation, small

248
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,140
child, hangover, money worries, or some
combination of the above.

249
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:47,160
So let's talk about how to have a great meeting.
I'm- [audience murmurs] I know! but it's possible, I've done it!

250
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,260
I'm speaking to you as if you're the
facilitator here because these skills

251
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,210
are great for everyone to have, but if
you aren't the facilitator remember that

252
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,900
the person who is needs you to cooperate
with them when they try to do this.

253
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,820
Stay on time and on topic! If you have an
agenda- you should have an agenda- stick

254
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,330
to it. This helps keep you from missing
things by running out of time, it lets

255
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,020
participants know what you'll cover and
when so they can be prepared, it helps

256
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,350
people stay with the group because if
someone gets lost they are less likely

257
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,070
to contribute. Digressions can be
boring for the group and inhibit

258
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,990
participation- I know all of you have
experienced this! So staying on track

259
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,880
helps keep that from happening and keeps
everyone focused.

260
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,420
If you are participating your job is to help the
group stay on track. Before you share,

261
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,660
ask yourself if what you have to say is on
topic and needs the entire group's

262
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,740
attention! If the answer is no, talk about
it later! At some other time! Not in the meeting!

263
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,740
Keep your eye on the agenda, stay
engaged even if you have nothing to

264
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,140
contribute right now,
sometimes the best findings in a

265
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,130
retrospective are about the interactions
between participants. So you might

266
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,300
respond to something that someone else
says and that could be a very useful thing.

267
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,899
You can also help make sure that
note-taking is shared by volunteering or

268
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,440
having a rotation for it because whoever
is taking notes does not have as much

269
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,720
brain available in order to speak.

270
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,580
You might need to practice interrupting- but for a good reason! Not just because you like to talk!

271
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,340
I like to talk, I'm not judging.

272
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,649
As a facilitator you will have
to learn how to interrupt individuals

273
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,860
for the good of the group. It is
necessary when people start to rant or

274
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,820
complain or blame or get off-topic. It
can be super uncomfortable to do this!

275
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,149
Remind yourself that you cannot achieve
the goals of the retro if this goes

276
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:32,430
unchecked. If you need to practice this-
as I do- picture a time when you really

277
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,610
just needed someone to shut up so that
we could keep going and they weren't

278
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,000
talking about anything that we needed to
talk about right now and you were incredibly

279
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,750
frustrated- like, feel that feeling
of frustration in your body! And then

280
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,190
imagine yourself saying "thanks Courtney,
but I think we're off topic and we need

281
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,880
to get back on topic."

282
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,290
As a facilitator one of your jobs is to
make sure that everyone gets a chance to

283
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,860
speak even if they have nothing to say.
Don't assume that just because a person

284
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,550
is silent, it means they have nothing to
contribute. They might be shy, they might

285
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,000
be having a hard time interjecting. Keep
an eye on the participants to see who

286
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,600
might want to speak but be afraid to
interrupt. Watch for, sort of wiggling,

287
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,959
sitting on the edge of the seat, leaning
forward, licking your lips, that kind of

288
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,100
thing, right, the sort of body language of
someone who is trying to get a word in

289
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,629
edgewise. And if you can take time to
stop the discussion, I usually recommend

290
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,200
about twice, and say "if anyone who hasn't
spoken has something to say this is your

291
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,900
time" and then wait.

292
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,100
Wait longer than you think you have to wait. Wait till

293
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:39,959
everyone's super uncomfortable. [audience laughter] 
I mean it. Because sometimes people need more

294
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,590
time to get their minds together and get
themselves focused so they can speak.

295
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:52,050
Let's talk about humor! Or maybe we could
not. It's really easy to mess up when

296
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,820
you're making jokes in a retrospective
or about an incident in general.

297
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,399
You may have heard the saying "comedy is tragedy
plus time". In a retrospective there has

298
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,240
not been enough time. [audience laughter] There has not. Guaranteed. Furthermore someone,

299
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,420
maybe everyone, in that retrospective feels
like they screwed up, and cost the

300
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,450
company money, their teammates' time, and
maybe sleep, and made everyone present

301
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:18,110
have yet another meeting! Probably their
manager is there too.

302
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,410
Getting it wrong means "anything that
makes anyone in the room feel even a

303
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:26,460
little bit uncomfortable, even if they
don't really notice or they aren't

304
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,890
really willing to admit it to you". Some
bad jokes: anything your parents say when

305
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:35,280
they're mad or they think you haven't
come home often enough, anything you say

306
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,730
back to them, anything a manager or other
employee ever said to you that made you

307
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,640
feel bad, anything you said to a
co-worker that made them laugh

308
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,620
uncomfortably or wince, jokes about
getting fired or firing people, politics,

309
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,030
religion, current events. 
Things I shouldn't have to mention but I'm gonna:

310
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:55,740
race, gender, sexuality, fat jokes, jokes
about disabilities, crazy, jokes about

311
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,760
any one person or their decisions or
their wisdom or their face or their plans.

312
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,179
You can probably make jokes about
Murphy's Law, entropy,

313
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,570
computers, which are terrible, the
terribleness of getting paged, you can be

314
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,059
really really serious about very silly
things,

315
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:16,950
"Las Vegas colloquially known as fabulous".
Maybe you can joke with a person about

316
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,340
something they are proud of about themselves. 
I like to talk about myself

317
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,899
as the girl with her hair on fire.
I am very entertained when people make that

318
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:27,988
joke about me, but if somebody else in
the room does not know that I think

319
00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:31,940
that's a positive thing, they will be
uncomfortable so be very careful with

320
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,220
this last one.

321
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,340
If you can't make jokes
how can you lighten the mood? You can be kind,

322
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,908
you can be thoughtful, you can be caring,
you can call out successes, you can thank

323
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:46,500
someone for their honesty, you can be
warm and welcoming.

324
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,580
What about when things go wrong, what do you do when people blame or make bad jokes?

325
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:56,100
What about when you make a mistake?
If you mess up, apologize, correct

326
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,969
yourself, and move on. 
It's important to be sincere and matter-of-fact.

327
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,040
Wallowing is self-blame and it's
uncomfortable, time-consuming,

328
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:10,200
and part of what you are trying to avoid. 
Sometimes people will blame themselves and you

329
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,679
might need to intervene. You just need a
short request of them that they stop and

330
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,970
then the group moves on. If the person is
embarrassed or wants to explain you can

331
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,599
give them a moment, thank them sincerely,
and then again move on. You don't want

332
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,200
anyone in this room wallowing. 
Try something like "this is a blameless

333
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,020
retrospective and that means not blaming
anyone, including yourself".

334
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:36,179
You don't have to be witty. You don't have to come up
with something super cute. You don't need

335
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,940
a clever one-liner, you don't have to win,
you don't have to one-up anybody.

336
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,100
Your goal is to remind people of the ground
rules and why we're here and then move on.

337
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,040
You might be noticing a theme here.
If they ask a blaming question,

338
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,800
gently remind them that we're trying to
avoid blame and help them rephrase the question.

339
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,379
This is all you need to say for bad jokes. 
"Please don't make jokes like that here."

340
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,220
That's it. No explanation.
It doesn't have to be a teachable moment.

341
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,840
In a meeting or a retrospective it should
not be a teachable moment, cuz then

342
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,820
you're wasting everybody else's time,
right. Once you have said this, just move on!

343
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,780
Never bring it up again! Never!

344
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,009
If they come to you afterwards and ask you what
was inappropriate about what they said,

345
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:17,380
and you have something ready that you
are willing to say back to them,

346
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,600
you can do that if you choose.
Or you can just say "please don't make

347
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,919
jokes like that here".

348
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,538
Okay so what's the point?

349
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,639
This might be familiar to many people in this room- Conway's law-

350
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,440
"Organizations which design systems are

351
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,399
constrained to produce designs which are
copies of the communication structures

352
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:40,559
of these organizations." 
He wrote that in 1968 and it is still true and we still

353
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,206
have many things we can learn from this.

354
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:47,580
And a personal note: in operations we

355
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:52,500
spend a lot of time feeling like lone
heroes or warriors, like we're the only

356
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,100
people who can understand or appreciate
what we do, there's no one we can go to

357
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,719
for help, maybe even that there's no
one to trust. And in security, it's the

358
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,100
same but more. It's definitely work to
try to reach out and make connections to

359
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,168
people who have very different job roles,
responsibilities, concerns, than we do.

360
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:12,809
It takes patience and listening, in the
sense of Miller's law that I talked

361
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:17,280
about earlier, and it requires asking the
same work of them whenever we can.

362
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,059
But it's incredibly rewarding. For me, doing
this work is what's made it possible for

363
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:25,769
me to stay in this industry. 
This work is what enables us to have people who know-

364
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,070
who do different things than we do, but
who understand a little bit about what

365
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:33,000
we do, and who are actually truly on our team. 
It works in the professional space,

366
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,669
in the personal space, and the activist space.
In 2019 we don't need more ways to be

367
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:42,269
divided from our natural allies and peers. 
We need more ways to connect and

368
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:46,060
to support each other and to make
meaningful change together.

369
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,860
Let's go make bigger and more interesting 
mistakes together!

370
00:27:52,080 --> 00:28:04,100
[audience applause]

371
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,220
A few acknowledgments here: I worked on
this talk with many people over the years,

372
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,399
including Leigh Honeywell and Lex
Neva, former co-workers of mine.

373
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,229
Other authors and speakers I have listed are
people who have really helped me,

374
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:21,580
and then I learned about how to teach from a
variety of people including some of my

375
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,139
knitting and pottery teachers.

376
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,740
Thank you.

377
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:33,140
