1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,839
uh my name is johnny christmas for those

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,200
of you who have been attending

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,840
um hecfast canada in the past you may

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,519
recognize me

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,240
i think this is my sixth year here

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,880
perhaps my seventh year i usually do

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,640
much longer forms of talks or panels

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,240
sometimes but

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,560
this year i wanted to do something

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,240
different i'm doing a quick lightning

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,599
talk because i don't think that this

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,640
topic

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,039
needs much more than 20 minutes or so to

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,560
get across but it's something that i've

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,320
been really passionate about

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,360
um for a large portion of my life and

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,920
uh most recently i kind of rebooted it

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,559
last year

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,879
and with covid hitting and everything

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,840
being in lockdown

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,200
and the world being practically

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,960
abandoned i thought that was a great

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,239
time to really

24
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,480
really jump up and get back into it

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,480
here's what i looked like

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,600
last year so that may help you identify

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,680
me easier

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,840
i love hackfest canada and i just could

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,600
not miss it this year so i made sure

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,960
that i find something that was going to

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,840
be

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
appropriate to show you all i am a

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,000
security researcher i work for

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,280
grim who you may have heard of the

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,520
security engineering firm i'm a trainer

36
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,360
and researcher there and also i dabble

37
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,799
in some abstract for them when the need

38
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,680
arises

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,400
um i've done everything in security

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,119
under the sun

41
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,880
from penetration testing to secure

42
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,040
defensive security engineering to

43
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,640
um even the boring stuff like grc etc so

44
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,040
i've been around the block but i wanted

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,240
to

46
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,079
maybe even take a break today from all

47
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,840
of the computer-y technical stuff

48
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,840
and talk about going outside something

49
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,680
that we all i think struggle with

50
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,880
even when there's not a pandemic and so

51
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,400
perhaps this will be a great

52
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,759
um inspiration to you all to go outside

53
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,840
and try something new that we can still

54
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,640
consider hacking

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,119
um what we're talking about today is

56
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,200
urban exploration and urban exploration

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,719
is self-explanatory it's the exploration

58
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,439
of

59
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,560
generally urban environments um however

60
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,159
that's not a hard and fast rule and

61
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,360
we're going to talk about some rules

62
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,000
here

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,878
but uh we'll see that they they're

64
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,758
because it's

65
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,560
generally an illegal activity the rules

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,760
are very flexible

67
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,480
um the idea here is that there is so

68
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,400
much out there that has been abandoned

69
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,920
forgotten is being left to rot that is

70
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,959
amazing to go see literal doorways

71
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,720
portals into the past buildings that

72
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,480
have been closed down for

73
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,920
20 30 40 50 years where the insides

74
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,360
haven't been touched since and you can

75
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,120
go inside these places and

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,720
with the exception of this destruction

77
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,319
and graffiti

78
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,560
see what was going on in there 50 years

79
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,760
ago

80
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,200
these buildings do get bought up and

81
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,879
demolished or turned into something else

82
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,760
and so

83
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,599
i'm a really big fan of going in and not

84
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
just for myself but for documenting

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,519
for capturing what was in there creating

86
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,080
these videos and photographs and things

87
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,000
and sharing them with the world and it's

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,519
not just of course

89
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,800
seeing what was going on in there when

90
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,560
the building shut down but also there's

91
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
some really amazing artwork

92
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,200
that goes on in these places as well uh

93
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
and so i'm a really really big fan of

94
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,239
capturing that

95
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,640
um so i'm gonna talk to you a bit today

96
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,360
about

97
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,720
um how to get started how to safely uh

98
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,040
operate in these environments uh and how

99
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,239
to have a lot of fun

100
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,159
whilst um getting caught the least

101
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,879
amount of times

102
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,280
first off uh we do have to talk about a

103
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,560
bunch of legal stuff and i'm not a

104
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,360
lawyer

105
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,360
and the laws like all laws vary based on

106
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,920
whatever location you happen to be in so

107
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,040
definitely

108
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,920
check your local laws as they say but

109
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,120
generally

110
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,840
trespassing is your primary legal issue

111
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,519
that you have here

112
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,959
in the u.s and a lot of the things i'm

113
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,120
going to discuss here are regarding u.s

114
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
law because i'm from the u.s

115
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,200
canadian and u.s law elf often overlaps

116
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,319
most of the time

117
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,680
but do double check again trespassing is

118
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,959
what we're dealing with here

119
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,760
in the us both criminal and civil

120
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,040
liability

121
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,799
can occur here so you can be charged

122
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,799
with criminal trespassing which is where

123
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,640
like a municipal entity like a city or

124
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,760
state government can

125
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,200
bring a case against you for what you

126
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,519
did but also civil liability say if you

127
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,720
damaged something

128
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,560
or you by way of um drawing attention to

129
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
a way to get into an abandoned building

130
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,160
caused many more people to come in

131
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,759
and much and so much destruction

132
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,600
occurred that the building became

133
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,720
unviable and

134
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,240
they couldn't sell it like you might be

135
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
personally liable for that these are

136
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,560
extreme circumstances generally

137
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,400
nobody cares as long as you don't get

138
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,759
injured in there and

139
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,520
try to sue whoever owns it or what

140
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,759
happens or draw attention to

141
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,720
it um you're you're usually going to be

142
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,600
okay

143
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,919
but be aware that you know prison and

144
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,520
fine can be a thing here

145
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,400
uh but again in the us it's it's usually

146
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,240
so much of a pain to enforce

147
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,400
uh especially even to hunt you down and

148
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,160
and bring charges against you like i put

149
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
these videos on youtube

150
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,080
all the time it's it's been fine

151
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,039
you can also be indicted if you're

152
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,639
responsible found to be responsible for

153
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,000
the injury or death of someone you

154
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,120
brought in with you

155
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,520
if say their families would just say

156
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,039
that oh you conjoled this person into

157
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,720
coming with you and you didn't really

158
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
properly inform them of the risks

159
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
involved uh and they wouldn't have died

160
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,080
if it wasn't for you like that's

161
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
that could be a potential real legal

162
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,680
case um

163
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,360
again super rare but

164
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,520
things that can that can be happen and a

165
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,840
risk that you need to accept

166
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,440
and be aware of before you make the

167
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,160
decision to do something like this

168
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,680
aside from all of that on-site

169
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,479
concerns as far as legality goes don't

170
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,240
be suspicious especially when you're on

171
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,680
approach when you're approaching the

172
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,639
building

173
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,000
that um you're going to enter into

174
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,520
keep any gear that you've brought with

175
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,039
you inside your bag

176
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,720
don't be walking around with a big you

177
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,160
know a crowbar and some

178
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,600
lock cutters and doing one of these

179
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,919
um

180
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,400
park far away uh

181
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
from the building and maybe one block

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,919
two blocks if it's an abandoned building

183
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,199
generally there isn't

184
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,600
many cars or vehicles of any sort parked

185
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,880
in front of it so if you're the one

186
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,479
vehicle that's parked right there

187
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,919
police are going to be suspicious

188
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,199
neighbors are going to be suspicious

189
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,319
they may start investigating remove

190
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,199
any of your gear uh before you exit the

191
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,680
building

192
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,520
and don't put it on until you enter the

193
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
building for obvious reasons it looks

194
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,280
very suspicious

195
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,960
try to figure out how you're going to

196
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,560
enter the building

197
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
before you even begin approaching the

198
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,080
building maybe come by

199
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,840
you know a week earlier or something i

200
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,080
like to to fly a drone around

201
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,319
and see if i can identify any means of

202
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,199
entry

203
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
uh before i actually enter or you can

204
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,960
simply come down there

205
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,680
do a few walk-arounds look around and

206
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
even if you identify some points of

207
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,039
entry usually

208
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,240
with the exception of perhaps

209
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,319
trespassing on land if you don't go in

210
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,080
you're not breaking any laws

211
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,599
and so you can at least do your recon

212
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,080
one day and then come back later and get

213
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,599
inside very quickly and that's the idea

214
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,880
that's why you do your recon ahead of

215
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,599
time

216
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,000
so that you can show up get inside and

217
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,199
disappear

218
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,880
before anyone outside the building gets

219
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
suspicious of what you're doing

220
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,000
and that's what i mean by the don't

221
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,080
linger there is don't don't hang out

222
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,440
outside the building too long

223
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,880
especially when you leave don't hang out

224
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,800
outside don't start instagramming all

225
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,639
the pictures right away

226
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,440
wait until you're away from the building

227
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,919
so

228
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,360
the main issues here is beware that

229
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,199
trespassing can have

230
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,680
civil and criminal penalties and don't

231
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,479
be suspicious

232
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,520
sorry while i deal with my odd controls

233
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,759
here here we go

234
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,680
so do your research

235
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,280
know what you're getting into before you

236
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,120
enter a building know what the building

237
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,840
was used for

238
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
look up for his historical information

239
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,960
on that building

240
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,400
this building we're seeing in the video

241
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,080
here was a

242
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,360
radio manufacturing company for zenith

243
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,080
zenith radios back in the 1960s

244
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,319
the building was not used for this for

245
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,720
decades but it was used for many many

246
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,080
other things some of those things can

247
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,800
involve

248
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,280
chemicals some i one building i

249
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,479
discovered was actually used for

250
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,879
asbestos manufacturing

251
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,039
so i didn't even bother going inside

252
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,160
there but i

253
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,520
know what the building was used for know

254
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,680
what to expect uh so that you can you

255
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,319
know

256
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,360
prepare accordingly um talk to

257
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,919
if you can other people who are do

258
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,199
excuse me other people who are doing

259
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,479
this as well

260
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,200
um urban exploration folks tend to be

261
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
extremely secretive

262
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,360
and elusive they often won't respond to

263
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,880
you if you just dm them out of nowhere

264
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,000
because what they're doing is breaking

265
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,080
the law they don't like to share

266
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,040
the locations that they know of because

267
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,399
they don't want the secret to get out

268
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,519
they don't want people to come in and

269
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,040
destroy things

270
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,440
and they don't want the cops to you know

271
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,240
be looking for new people to come in

272
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,959
uh and so you often as far as forums and

273
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,640
dms and things like that will have to

274
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,519
become friends with them uh through the

275
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,480
usual means

276
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,320
before they're ever going to trust you

277
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,920
enough to kind of start helping you or

278
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
maybe even inviting you along

279
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,720
um but go ahead and google go ahead and

280
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,440
look on

281
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,959
youtube youtube and instagram have

282
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,120
become huge for urban exploration so if

283
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,200
you're looking for new sites

284
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,720
youtube and instagram are good great

285
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,800
places to start you may still have to

286
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,320
start doing some reconnaissance based on

287
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,839
the information found in there because a

288
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,440
lot of urban exploration folks still

289
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,120
like to hide the location

290
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,000
of where the video takes place uh and so

291
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,040
you may have to

292
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,959
start looking for you know street signs

293
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,240
and addresses or

294
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
addresses on paperwork inside of the

295
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,839
buildings and things like that in order

296
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,360
to figure out where it's at

297
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,240
um as far as general reconnaissance of

298
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,640
safety of the building and ways in

299
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,200
google satellite maps is excellent and

300
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,320
then do your general

301
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,000
walk around for your reconnaissance

302
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,080
before deciding

303
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,680
whether or not you're going to accept

304
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,320
the risk of entering this building

305
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,480
and seeing what's inside

306
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,120
one final risk to understand and accept

307
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,279
here is to know your limits

308
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,040
these are physical limits your life is

309
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,519
at stake know what you're capable of

310
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,959
doing physically

311
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,160
uh and don't uh don't talk yourself up

312
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,920
don't uh pretend like you're able to do

313
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,839
more than you do you might end up in a

314
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,360
very bad situation

315
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,040
uh because you couldn't accept that you

316
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,279
are you have a physical limitation

317
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,519
and certainly you know if you can strive

318
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,440
to to exceed those strive to build those

319
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,720
physical limitations up

320
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,880
i certainly do i'm a big fan of physical

321
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,320
fitness and one of those reasons is

322
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,079
because i regularly find how often it

323
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,320
pays off in these situations here

324
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,200
um some general rule of thumbs rules of

325
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,880
thumb is what i've listed over here

326
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,560
um can you walk five plus miles

327
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,680
in one session you know over the course

328
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,120
of three or four hours

329
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,040
uh generally that's the average i find

330
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
when i do some urban exploration like

331
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,399
this and that's just inside the you know

332
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,480
a larger building that's not including

333
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,920
walking to and from wherever you may

334
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,519
park to get to the location

335
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,279
that seems like a lot of a lot of miles

336
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,720
for people and

337
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,399
um i often find that it's actually not

338
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,920
because once you have this distraction

339
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,040
of this really cool stuff you're

340
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,079
investigating

341
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,000
um five miles isn't a huge deal but

342
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,920
if you can't do it if you have

343
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,600
respiratory conditions heart conditions

344
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
you're just not in this kind of

345
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,839
cardiovascular shape and three miles in

346
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,120
and you're done for the day and you need

347
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,399
to rest for an hour because you feel

348
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,680
like you're going to die

349
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,440
now you might be inside of a dangerous

350
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,360
building you may need help and you can't

351
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,720
get it

352
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,320
even if you call 9-1-1

353
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,440
if they're not sure how to get in they

354
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,959
may not get to you in time if there's an

355
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,079
extreme situation

356
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,680
if you are having you know a cardiac

357
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,959
arrest or something and you need an

358
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:45,760
ambulance

359
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
you may be out of luck again risk

360
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,880
acceptance

361
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,920
um can you do three consecutive pull-ups

362
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,399
uh can you pull yourself up onto a ledge

363
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,920
that is taller than where your head is

364
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,519
just once you know pull up get your legs

365
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,040
over these are things that happen all

366
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,880
the time in these buildings

367
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,480
a lot of times stairwells and things

368
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,160
like that just don't exist anymore or

369
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
aren't the safest options to get

370
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,399
to where you need to go so being able to

371
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,680
lift your own body weight

372
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,399
it's a very physical activity and not

373
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,519
just from the walking is what i'm

374
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,120
getting at here

375
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,360
can you lift and carry 70 pounds just a

376
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,560
little bit can you pick up something

377
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,399
that's 70 pounds and kind of scooch it

378
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,240
in another direction

379
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,480
that comes in handy um i got this 70

380
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,360
pound and i don't

381
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,399
you'll have to go ahead and do that

382
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,600
kilogram conversion on your own there

383
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,000
but i got this 70 pound marker because

384
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
that's what a lot of warehouse jobs here

385
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,639
in the us

386
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,480
put as like hey this is a minimum

387
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,920
requirement to be able to handle the

388
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,399
daily

389
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,440
tasking of a warehouse worker and i find

390
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,920
that being able to move that kind of

391
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,760
weight even just a short distance even

392
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,200
you know a meter

393
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,720
is super useful because you'll find

394
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,079
things that are that heavy blocking

395
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,760
doorways blocking passages blocking

396
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,040
stairwells and being able to move them

397
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,320
out of the way grants you a lot more

398
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,680
access whereas if you just don't have

399
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,279
that kind of strength you may be limited

400
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,880
in where you're able to go and that's

401
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,839
really annoying

402
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,279
that's a really annoying situation where

403
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,720
you can't get somewhere just because you

404
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,120
just

405
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,279
can't move this thing out of the way

406
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,920
be aware of your own weight how much

407
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,519
your body weighs

408
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,000
versus how much damage the structure has

409
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,680
suffered

410
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,120
again your life is at risk don't

411
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,760
you know pretend like you don't weigh

412
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,880
this much

413
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,920
really you know and you don't have to

414
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,279
tell your friends how much you weighed

415
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,639
you know this is just the thing that you

416
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,760
have to be aware of

417
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,399
these floors are often unstable i always

418
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,000
like to either bring a stick or find

419
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,519
something really fast once i get inside

420
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,440
just to test the floors as i go along

421
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,560
especially as you get higher up um i

422
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,519
don't know

423
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,519
any urban explorer who's been doing it

424
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,279
long enough who doesn't have that story

425
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,199
of oh yeah we lost one of our friends in

426
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,040
such and such city because

427
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
she fell through the floor from the

428
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,120
fifth floor or something like that

429
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,440
and that doesn't necessarily mean that

430
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,560
you're overweight

431
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,320
it just means that know how much you

432
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
weigh and

433
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,880
constantly be judging that against the

434
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,800
structural capabilities of the floor

435
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,760
that you're on

436
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,240
uh and especially as the floor changes

437
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,279
um

438
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,480
that structure is completely

439
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,199
unmaintained and you can fall through it

440
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,880
any minute

441
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,480
make sure that you understand that and

442
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,240
that you're confident in every single

443
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,560
step that you're going to take next

444
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,519
before you take that and finally here's

445
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:23,920
one

446
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,600
everyone forgets um bring snacks

447
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,240
take breaks take a rest i think actually

448
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,600
this is funny right here in the video is

449
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,320
a point where

450
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
we actually decided to take a break and

451
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,240
have some snacks so good timing on my

452
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,040
part

453
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,920
um the this is cool this is a water

454
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,600
tower on top of the building that's how

455
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,240
large this

456
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,000
this radio factory was but anyway

457
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,399
snacks especially like high calorie

458
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,320
snacks high carbohydrate snacks

459
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,720
you want fats you want carbohydrates um

460
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,480
great for kind of giving you that energy

461
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,639
boost and getting you to keep going

462
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,720
it really sucks when you get halfway

463
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,399
into a massive structure like this and

464
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,600
you are just out of energy

465
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,800
and you just can't go and you're like we

466
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,880
gotta go we have to go i'm dead i can't

467
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,399
walk anymore

468
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,639
take a break take a break somewhere safe

469
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,680
take a break somewhere

470
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,639
out of sight here we're dead center on

471
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,760
the roof so

472
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,040
unless you're in one of these buildings

473
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,240
way out here you really can't see us

474
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,320
and aside from my friend here decided to

475
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,880
bring the neon orange jacket

476
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,600
we're generally camouflaged so don't do

477
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,959
that as well

478
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,720
but yeah definitely feel free to take

479
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
breaks bring bring a banana with you and

480
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,399
some granola bars or some trail mix or

481
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,519
something

482
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,600
that goes such a long way and that's

483
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,959
like the number one point i tell

484
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,399
everyone like hey bring snacks make sure

485
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,399
you bring snacks did you bring snacks

486
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,079
bring snacks who doesn't like snacks

487
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,360
talking about snacks talk about what

488
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,519
you're bringing let's talk about

489
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,240
what you're putting in that backpack

490
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,519
lights

491
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,440
you need lots of lights all kinds of

492
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,000
lights any sort of illumination

493
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,560
other lights small lights big lights uh

494
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
maybe one really big light

495
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,160
lots of lights but you don't want to

496
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,000
pack a ton of lights you want the lights

497
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,120
that you pack to be

498
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,720
effective so that you don't need a ton

499
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,639
of them

500
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,399
you want a very bright lightweight

501
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,000
flashlight

502
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,360
so you want to find that really good

503
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,880
weight to light ratio you're going to be

504
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
holding this thing the entire time

505
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,959
this can be hours literally three four

506
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,000
hours where you're just holding this

507
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,519
light so a lot of people say oh i love

508
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,720
my mag light

509
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,959
that takes the four d cell batteries and

510
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,560
it weighs 15 pounds

511
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,920
well you're walking around with 15

512
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,560
pounds in your hands like this

513
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,680
for three hours you're gonna be dead

514
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,279
and you're gonna have one arm that looks

515
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,079
like popeye like a huge forearm and

516
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,360
people will make fun of you for the rest

517
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,600
of your life so you don't want that um

518
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,040
my favorite brands of lights are phoenix

519
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,199
and led lenser i should flip this cam

520
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,199
here

521
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,399
they make excellent weight ratio cost

522
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,759
and cost to lumens ratio lights out

523
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,320
there

524
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,279
i'm a big fan of a headlamp as well for

525
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,520
obvious reasons it keeps your hands free

526
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,919
i do still like to do the headlamp plus

527
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,679
a flashlight

528
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,439
just for just to be able to have that

529
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,280
ample coverage

530
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,199
and one other thing i like to do is

531
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,119
bring a larger lamp that you see here on

532
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,679
the right

533
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,439
and actually kind of strap that to my

534
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,959
backpack strap

535
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,640
so it's just there and you get this huge

536
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,160
flood light that you can turn on and

537
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,000
really blast your room full of light

538
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,760
to help you safely assess what's going

539
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,840
on make sure that all these lights are

540
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,919
easy to turn on and off with gloved

541
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,679
hands

542
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,080
turning lights off can be a critical

543
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,919
safety situation too

544
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,720
especially if you hear someone else you

545
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
hear something going on in the building

546
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,640
and you need to hide really quickly your

547
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,559
lights can absolutely give you away so

548
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,919
being able to quickly turn those lights

549
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,600
off and just stand still

550
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
not only avoids you from being detected

551
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,840
it helps you to detect other people who

552
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,039
are in there because they're going to

553
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,640
have their lights on so once you turn

554
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,760
your lights off

555
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,120
you'll be able to see them and their

556
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,320
lights on and see their movement

557
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,120
patterns

558
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,400
uh more or less hopefully so again

559
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
make sure you can turn these lights on

560
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,440
and off using

561
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,919
gloved hands you don't need dexterous

562
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,120
fingers to

563
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,960
to be able to do this and most you know

564
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,240
high quality work flights are going to

565
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,679
be able to do that no problem because

566
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,799
they're built with that in mind

567
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,240
um documenting is

568
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,720
i feel a mandatory part of urban

569
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,760
exploration

570
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,160
you know it's uh it it's it's part of

571
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,360
hacker culture

572
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,120
sure it's great to learn things and to

573
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,200
see things and to take in something that

574
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,720
nobody else has taken in

575
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,240
but sharing that i believe is critical

576
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,440
this is something that you must do and

577
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,799
you don't need to show your face

578
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,679
certainly

579
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,760
um but you should show what you've seen

580
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,440
uh and because of that

581
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,840
you should be bringing the highest

582
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,559
quality

583
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,440
of recording equipment that you can

584
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,760
afford

585
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,360
uh and that's going and that's because

586
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,520
we want to document it as well as

587
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,200
possible so it doesn't require

588
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,000
multiple entries um some people say like

589
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,280
well why would i do this there's already

590
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,720
been there's already five videos on

591
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,080
youtube of other people who have gone

592
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,520
into this building i don't need to waste

593
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,799
my time

594
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,880
things change even over the course of a

595
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,000
year things

596
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,720
uh we've visited this factory here three

597
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,240
times within a month and

598
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,799
each time we visited there was plenty of

599
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,400
times we said this wasn't here before

600
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,760
this has moved that stairwell didn't

601
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,440
used to be blocked someone was here this

602
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,480
was changed

603
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,320
look at these three new murals that got

604
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,600
painted

605
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,039
things like that so you just always want

606
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,640
to bring cameras because even if you're

607
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,240
going back a week later something cool

608
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,600
may have popped up

609
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,120
or you may discover something you didn't

610
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,960
discover before or that no one had

611
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,600
bothered to discover you may discover a

612
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,120
padlock that's rusted to the point where

613
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,480
you can finally just whack it off with

614
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,120
something

615
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,880
and now you can enter a new room just

616
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,440
always be ready to document

617
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,320
i like to bring a camera that i just

618
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,160
strap onto my chest and

619
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,840
i just have going i don't like head

620
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,760
mounted cameras because it find

621
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,280
i find it makes the viewer sick because

622
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,200
you're constantly doing this

623
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,840
whereas the chest mounted you're rarely

624
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,799
doing this

625
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,360
usually your chest is a lot more stable

626
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,240
and so

627
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,039
that's my recommendation on that

628
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,120
something with a huge sd card

629
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,840
and either enough replacement batteries

630
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,679
or a large usb battery that you can just

631
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,600
run to it so you just turn it on

632
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,520
and you can leave it for four hours and

633
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,640
you don't have to worry about if it's

634
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,840
recording or what it's recording you

635
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,520
just let it go

636
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,080
and then also um you're going to want to

637
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,640
bring

638
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,840
a camera a still image camera to really

639
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,039
line up shots and get some great

640
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,559
pictures i really like that for what i'm

641
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,360
doing here

642
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,080
um taking photographs of some really

643
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,720
good

644
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,320
murals and graffiti that you might come

645
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,919
across along the way

646
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,679
or just getting some really spooky shots

647
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,840
of spooky stuff

648
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,640
our phones these days especially you

649
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:48,960
know

650
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,640
you know we're tech nerds we're probably

651
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,760
going to have some of the best phone

652
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,440
cameras ever made on us at any given

653
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,799
time

654
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,200
our phones are phenomenal cameras now

655
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,640
both for video

656
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,799
and still photography there's

657
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,480
practically nothing out there that beats

658
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:02,799
the

659
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,600
weight ratio to battery ratio to image

660
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,400
quality

661
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,360
than a modern smart smartphone so you

662
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,440
very likely already have most of the

663
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,880
equipment you need

664
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,720
to document what you need to document

665
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,000
just be aware of battery

666
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,559
life and storage capacity as well i'm a

667
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,080
big fan here of

668
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,360
dji's osmo pocket and their action cam

669
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,520
um they're not as unreliable as all of

670
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
the gopro stuff if you can't tell i hate

671
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,559
gopro

672
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,200
um their stuff constantly fails on me it

673
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,960
seems ever since the gopro

674
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
fours have been out their products have

675
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,480
just been garbage and i

676
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,200
never recommend them djis aren't

677
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,480
incredible

678
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,559
but they're more reliable and so that's

679
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,120
why i prefer them and the quality

680
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,960
at least the vid on the video side is

681
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,400
excellent uh

682
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,559
so definitely take a look at those or do

683
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,600
your own research

684
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,840
and take what what what uh you like the

685
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,280
best

686
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,440
uh talking a little bit about safety i

687
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,480
wanted to put a nice

688
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,280
nice gap in there between risk and uh

689
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,799
safety before i just like

690
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,480
beat you all down with like this is

691
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
dangerous and you shouldn't do it

692
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,159
um this is dangerous and you shouldn't

693
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,080
do it that said

694
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,520
you can do things to kind of mitigate

695
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
that danger um

696
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,200
bring mechanics gloves these are these

697
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,559
gloves you can see me wearing here in

698
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,440
this video

699
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,960
um they're gloves that are have a very

700
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,039
high shear strength so they don't slice

701
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,159
open easily

702
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,880
they don't puncture that easily they

703
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,400
don't

704
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,559
they can take a lot of abrasion and not

705
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,840
rub away

706
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,720
and they're nice and padded they have a

707
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,080
great they usually will have a great

708
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,679
grip on them and they're not expensive

709
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,880
you can get a really

710
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,120
uh just a fine pair of mechanics gloves

711
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,919
for under

712
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,720
10 us dollars and they'll last you a

713
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,760
very long time

714
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,840
uh and man they're great um you're going

715
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,760
to be touching and grabbing

716
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,559
all sorts of things here that have stuff

717
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,600
on them that you don't want to get

718
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,640
inside your body

719
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,520
um you know tetanus not with sanding um

720
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,880
some things you're just going to have to

721
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,640
be you know punching out glass like you

722
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,799
see here and removing glass and sharp

723
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,000
metal and rust

724
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
and you're gonna want gloves on that can

725
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,280
protect you from those sorts of things

726
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,960
so not just like your average you know

727
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,280
gardening gloves but some real good

728
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,440
mechanics gloves you can get them at any

729
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,600
auto shop you can get them at any

730
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,640
uh home improvement store that's

731
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,159
probably the most important part of your

732
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,039
kit next next to the lights

733
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,640
you may want to bring a sealed n95 mask

734
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,840
depending on

735
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,480
where what your research has told you or

736
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,520
just have it

737
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,400
anyway just in case if the building was

738
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,279
made before 1965 or so there's a very

739
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,919
good chance it has had asbestos in it

740
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,679
at some point uh and n95

741
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,840
is the limit that you need in order to

742
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,360
be able to filter out any remaining

743
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,039
asbestos that might be floating around

744
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,400
inside of there

745
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,279
especially if you're going to be

746
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,200
shuffling around and stirring up all the

747
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,360
asbestos that may be on the floor

748
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,600
i was in a wonder bread factory in

749
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
buffalo new york that had tons of

750
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,919
asbestos just on one floor of it and i

751
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:06,799
was really

752
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,320
glad that i had brought that mask and i

753
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,559
didn't hang on that floor too often

754
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,960
but yeah n95 masks are much easier to

755
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,240
find these days than they were

756
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,480
even you know six seven months ago for

757
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,320
obvious reasons um make sure it's the

758
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,240
kind that seals around your face

759
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,320
the with the rubber mask with the big

760
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,679
filters on the sides

761
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,480
um you don't want the standard you know

762
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,559
paper mask that everyone wears

763
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,640
um you want the one that's gonna make a

764
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,400
nice seal so that air can't get in from

765
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,520
the sides because you're dealing with

766
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,559
asbestos which

767
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,679
can cause cancer be aware that those

768
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,679
filters expire

769
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,000
if if they're unsealed if they're if

770
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,799
they're just sitting

771
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,840
out in the air they do slowly break down

772
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,919
they'll have an expiration date on them

773
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,520
generally and so you'll want to make

774
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,080
sure that

775
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,679
before you go for a dive that you're not

776
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,360
using some old filters that aren't going

777
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
to filter out that asbestos

778
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,279
and asbestos aside it gets rid of the

779
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,039
mold it gets rid of

780
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,400
anything else you just might not want to

781
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,640
be breathing in in the first place

782
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,480
that aside bring some really good tough

783
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,640
jeans not your designer jeans some

784
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
really good old dad working in the yard

785
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,880
jeans i like to use kevlar motorcycle

786
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,760
jeans

787
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,799
um you bring a hard hat uh

788
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,880
hard hats are really easy to find now um

789
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,279
i like skydiving hard hats skydiving

790
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,720
helmets because they're small they're

791
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,000
form-fitting and they have a lot of

792
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,440
impact protection

793
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,799
um some nice steel-toed boots uh

794
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,640
when you're uh you should dress like

795
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,080
you're going hiking

796
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,919
uh so dress for the weather but also

797
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,840
dress like you're gonna be out in the

798
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,360
woods having a lot of stuff poking and

799
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,559
stabbing you and things like that

800
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,919
because you are so think about it that

801
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,840
way like wear your hiking gear

802
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,919
bring your buddies you should have a

803
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:42,960
buddy on site

804
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,440
and you should have a buddy off site so

805
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,120
that in the buddy off site should know

806
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,480
hey if you haven't checked in in x

807
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,320
amount of hours

808
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,919
you might be hurt call the police tell

809
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,000
them where you're at

810
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,159
being you know getting a trespassing

811
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,120
charge is always

812
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,440
way better than uh you know dying

813
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,880
uh because you broke your leg in the

814
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,480
middle of a place and then broken leg

815
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,279
never normally wouldn't be fatal except

816
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,120
no one came for you and you couldn't get

817
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,400
out

818
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,279
so um i'm sorry i got this just jerked

819
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,320
it over a little bit

820
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,080
um a lot of smart devices now have

821
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
automated fall sensors where if you fall

822
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,919
really hard and stop moving it'll

823
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,440
automatically call 9-1-1

824
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,200
my watch has that on it it's a really

825
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,559
cool feature

826
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,279
and then finally if you can call 9-1-1

827
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,200
don't be afraid to call 9-1-1

828
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,880
call 9-1-1 tell them how to enter the

829
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,880
building try to tell them where you're

830
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,440
at

831
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,039
if you can start yelling when they get

832
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,640
in there do that

833
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,559
again um dying from a non-fatal injury

834
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,159
is way worse than uh being afraid of

835
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:44,880
calling

836
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,720
and getting convicted of a minor

837
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,559
trespassing charge so

838
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,080
yeah always if you need to yeah we're

839
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,600
pretty much at the end here
