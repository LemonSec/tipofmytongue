kids

52
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,360
i remember one day after school i came

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,600
home and said hey dad isn't it amazing

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,000
how people named their wi-fi access

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,680
points after their real name or street

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,280
address

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,599
it was that curiosity that started a

58
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,959
number of discussions that have led us

59
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,480
to this talk

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,920
what is important here is not that it

61
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,520
that it is not possible to understand

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
the challenges that teens experience

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,319
when we view privacy and security she's

64
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,120
the expert

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
i'm just here for the trip we're going

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,680
to cover a number of topics but to break

67
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,280
them down there are only two

68
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,879
major categories schools and peers

69
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,879
then we will cover what can go wrong and

70
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,720
finish with survey results and

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,920
conclusions

72
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,599
uh just a quick note you do not need to

73
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,080
capture any of the links or references

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,840
there will be a list at the end

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,840
and we will share it in the hackfest

76
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
discord

77
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
the main point we're trying to make here

78
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,959
is that privacy is the right to be left

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,680
alone

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,840
as defined by the harvard law review in

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,080
1890 by warren and brandei

82
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,720
sometimes we aren't given the choice

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,040
according to the universal declaration

84
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
of human rights by the general assembly

85
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,920
of human rights

86
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,159
of 1948 privacy is a basic human right

87
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,480
his concept has roots in classical greek

88
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,319
and ancient chinese culture

89
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,879
along with mentions in the quran bible

90
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,840
and jewish law

91
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,560
however times change and privacy is no

92
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,920
longer seen that way

93
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,239
in fact a vpn provider called hide my

94
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,760
ass did a survey

95
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,000
on privacy stigma and came to the

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,840
conclusion that people believe

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,239
all privacy advocates are paranoid male

98
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,599
loners with something to hide

99
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,560
when you consider this image of the

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,480
international association of privacy

101
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,959
professionals 2020 annual conference

102
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,280
in the european union we can clearly see

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,200
that all privacy advocates

104
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,238
are male owners

105
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,040
except the ones that aren't male the

106
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,799
computer science and i.t and infosec

107
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,239
industries have a long way to go to

108
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,599
balance the gender balance

109
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,959
gender diversity the way that the

110
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,000
privacy world has

111
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,120
there are two primary federal privacy

112
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,319
laws in canada

113
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,560
the privacy act covers federal and

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,918
federally regulated

115
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,680
handling information pipita

116
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,400
covers private businesses except in

117
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
alberta bc and quebec

118
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,240
oh and charities not-for-profits

119
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,560
political parties associations and a few

120
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,759
others

121
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,840
this week was a very exciting week in

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,759
the world of privacy law

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,120
for how exciting privacy law truly is

124
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,639
uh for some people bill c41 an act to

125
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,199
enact

126
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,240
two acts was about acting on privacy was

127
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,600
enacted or released

128
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,080
or maybe it was acted on either way it's

129
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,800
124 pages that if passed will change the

130
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,240
way that consumer privacy and

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,479
accountability exist in canada

132
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,120
it's been a long time coming and if you

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,520
want

134
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,280
some really amusing questions you should

135
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,680
watch the original

136
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,560
cpac release on it the question and

137
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,280
answer period

138
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,120
is just wonderful and each province has

139
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,720
their own take on them

140
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,120
jurisdiction is very important to how

141
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
and when these laws are applied

142
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,759
so as you can see there are a ton of

143
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,680
privacy laws it becomes

144
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,919
a substantial difficulty to figure out

145
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,880
how many

146
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,479
and where and which one applies

147
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,160
the laws are complicated enough that

148
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,080
there is an entire online app

149
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,720
to narrow down who you should contact

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,039
when you have a concern

151
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,960
and to put this in perspective this

152
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,360
narrows it down into things like

153
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,120
is this personal health is this an

154
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,880
employee

155
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,039
is this something else does it does it

156
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,160
relate to your bank

157
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,720
is it a school is it provincial it just

158
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,600
goes on

159
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,840
and on it is so complicated to even

160
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,199
figure out who you would contact

161
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,800
the organization for economic

162
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,360
development

163
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,880
the organization for economic

164
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,720
cooperation and development produced the

165
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,960
guidelines for trans border flow of

166
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,440
personal data pipita based its fair

167
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,800
information policy

168
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,280
principles on this and as have many

169
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,120
other privacy laws worldwide

170
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,880
each is a critical part of applying

171
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,120
privacy

172
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,720
consent is the one that gets the most

173
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,280
air time explicit consent as in you were

174
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,479
asked and agreed

175
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,319
likely in writing or at least clicking

176
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,000
the yes i accept your cookie so you can

177
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,720
track me can i read my article now

178
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,960
implied consent is based on your actions

179
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,319
you went to a website

180
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,080
yes you wanted it to send content back

181
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,319
to your ip address

182
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,680
the right to be forgotten is a

183
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,440
revocation of consent

184
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,400
but unlike unlike much unlike or sorry

185
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,479
much like uninviting vampires from your

186
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,199
home

187
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,520
it is a hard problem to solve which is

188
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,360
why i'm cautiously optimistic

189
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,840
about the outcome of bill c-11 and that

190
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,599
one safeguards

191
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,479
and only that one is security security

192
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,319
and privacy are not the same thing

193
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,880
but privacy definitely needs security at

194
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,080
least as part of the whole

195
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,000
terms of service are tough uh there are

196
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,800
click their

197
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
contract click typically known as

198
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,960
clickwrap

199
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
how many of you have actually read the

200
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,880
terms of service for instagram snapchat

201
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,560
facebook twitter i did

202
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,400
bronwyn's sibling texted me a link to

203
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,319
this game asking if it was okay it was

204
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,440
innocuous enough

205
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,800
i mean who doesn't like dudes in little

206
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,520
green hallways

207
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,599
the privacy policy was almost had no

208
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,440
detail whatsoever

209
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
it and it took a substantial amount of

210
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,479
time to find the

211
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,000
the full policy which was owned by the

212
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,960
parent was hidden by the parent company

213
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,520
and located in another country i'm not

214
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,039
going to name the country you can look

215
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,440
it up for yourself that's your choice

216
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,840
legislation is challenging and is

217
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,280
changing how policies

218
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,560
must be written and but

219
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,479
but instead of almost unreadable

220
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,840
pseudo-legal language

221
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,280
we they have moved to forcing you to

222
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,039
read between the lines making it

223
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,960
difficult to understand the intent

224
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,039
and as we can see by the this list of

225
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,199
active of things that were captured with

226
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,280
this particular application

227
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,800
the data that's gathered is a fairly

228
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,319
good start to profiling the user

229
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,639
when you ask the question what is the

230
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,319
imprecise location

231
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,560
of your mobile device according to

232
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,000
google as it relates to the android

233
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,280
operating system

234
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,199
the course location is approximately

235
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,199
equivalent to a city block

236
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,960
today google identifies this as

237
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,320
dangerous data

238
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,279
this wasn't always the case at one point

239
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,958
google didn't think this was dangerous

240
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:37,519
data

241
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,240
and apple devices until recently didn't

242
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,159
identify that there was even

243
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,600
a setting to limit precise location data

244
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,640
when is data disclosed all the right

245
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,440
times

246
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,160
protect us protect you fraud if the

247
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,440
government requires

248
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,839
has a requirement to pull the data from

249
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,680
all of its users so that they can build

250
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,640
a build a

251
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,519
profile of intellectual property assets

252
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,399
to

253
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,000
that they want to invest in

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,080
so what about the children this

255
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,519
application is does not

256
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,040
knowingly engage children under the age

257
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,760
of 13

258
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,880
honest look at the graphics you can ask

259
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,320
it you need to ask yourselves

260
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,839
how can i teach others to think

261
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,440
critically about the terms of service

262
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,480
when bronwyn turned 13 i gave her a

263
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,519
birthday gift

264
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,440
violet blues a smart girl's guide to

265
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,200
privacy and to be honest i hadn't

266
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,560
actually read it

267
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,240
but it was so well recommended by

268
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,080
friends and to be honest

269
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,120
is my teenager going to actually listen

270
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,839
to anything

271
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,120
that i have to say so

272
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,519
why not someone who is smart capable

273
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,440
writes prolifically and has had to deal

274
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,080
with real

275
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,560
and online at real life and online

276
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,440
stalkers

277
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,600
so do you think she actually read it not

278
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,360
so much

279
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,160
how about one chapter just one chapter

280
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
social media did you read that one

281
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,600
not exactly i read the first two pages

282
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,680
so i read it there are bits of it that

283
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,800
are out of date but

284
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,560
the advice is sound and it should be

285
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,399
required reading for any team

286
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,000
for every teen and your sibling read it

287
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,160
when they turn to 13.

288
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,680
all of it on the other hand

289
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,120
outsmarting your kids online is a

290
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,279
completely different matter the only way

291
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,959
forward is to build trust and you have

292
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,760
to have an

293
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,839
open and collaborative relationship

294
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,360
while i am still the parent

295
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,440
my kids need to feel safe enough to

296
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,480
disclose

297
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,880
when something isn't right and discuss a

298
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,160
reasonable path forward

299
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,959
i had suspected that bronwyn had never

300
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,720
actually read any of the violet blue

301
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,079
book

302
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,480
and we had already talked about

303
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,640
understanding the terms of service

304
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,720
uh before you sign up for an account and

305
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,320
when it came time to set up her first

306
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
social media account

307
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,160
we read through them for instagram

308
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,519
together

309
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,160
so what did i do next well whatever

310
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,600
every parent should be doing

311
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,519
i opened up in my own instagram account

312
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,360
and followed her because that doesn't

313
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,000
sound creepy

314
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,720
some things my friends say often is why

315
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,560
would you read the terms of service

316
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,519
no one reads them according to a survey

317
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,640
of my peers

318
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,040
only 48 of them say that they read the

319
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,720
terms of service in some way

320
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,200
and 31 of them also believe that they

321
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,760
own what they post on social media

322
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,360
which makes me think that they actually

323
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,040
haven't read the terms of service or

324
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,480
they didn't understand which is a

325
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,200
different problem

326
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,880
one of the hardest parts about living in

327
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,959
a privacy conscious household is that my

328
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,440
peers and my friends don't understand

329
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,160
at all i try not to bring up privacy

330
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
related conversations with them anymore

331
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,000
because they don't hold the same beliefs

332
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,519
as me regarding it

333
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,880
some things that my friends have said to

334
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,320
me are you they are only watching you

335
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,480
which i think is hilarious to say um or

336
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,079
this is the world we live in and there

337
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,800
is nothing you can do to change it

338
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,000
also very hilarious um most of my

339
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
friends just think i'm paranoid

340
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,680
recently some of them have started to

341
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,760
notice things about targeted advertising

342
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,399
tailored pages on their social media

343
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,079
however when i try to bring it up with

344
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,399
them and discuss they shut me down they

345
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,440
don't want to talk about it

346
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,040
this has been an ongoing problem for

347
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
infosec professionals for years

348
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,000
how do we convince them to care what is

349
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,360
it going to take what would it take to

350
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,399
change their behaviors

351
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,800
social media is a part of daily life as

352
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,920
a teen and

353
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,079
the same for adults as well for some it

354
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,839
is really hard to live without it

355
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,600
there's a lot of pressure to be online

356
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,279
all the time and to always be checking

357
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,079
and seeing what's new

358
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,240
when i came to high school a lot of

359
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,920
people would ask others for their

360
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,959
snapchat

361
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,880
this was an issue because i didn't have

362
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,399
an account

363
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,920
often people would say something like

364
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,399
you should get it everyone has it

365
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,720
just just don't follow the herd don't

366
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,079
follow the herd

367
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,200
um at one point i got fed up and gave

368
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,880
into peer pressure

369
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,200
downloading the app however before i did

370
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,040
that i read through the entirety

371
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,240
of the terms of service so

372
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,399
i read through a fairly well-written and

373
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,000
convincing argument

374
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
trying not to smile outwardly the entire

375
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,320
time it i didn't actually have a problem

376
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,360
with the service

377
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,440
the three things that i asked the time

378
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,480
were

379
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,079
a description in your own words of the

380
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,000
privacy policy

381
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,560
an article giving examples of how the

382
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,120
service

383
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,959
how you would protect yourself or secure

384
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,720
the servicer app

385
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,120
and an article on describing a breach of

386
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,480
the service and what the potential

387
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,720
impacts were

388
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
now after reading the terms of service i

389
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,399
downloaded the app and proceeded to

390
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,800
leave it unopened in a folder of stuff i

391
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
don't touch because i was unsure whether

392
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,560
or not i wanted to allow them access to

393
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,240
my data after i found out what they

394
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,680
would do with it and how much they would

395
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,880
collect

396
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,199
my friends of course thought i was being

397
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,800
completely ridiculous

398
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,120
and that it wasn't a big deal so one day

399
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,399
i ripped off the band-aid

400
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,279
opened it made an account and only use

401
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,440
it once in a while

402
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,160
so what i wanted all along was for you

403
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,519
to understand the risks

404
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,040
of the service and the methods of

405
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,199
dealing with them has this knowledge

406
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,360
changed how you use the app

407
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,279
well i consider who is in the photo

408
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,399
where it was taken

409
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,600
how it can be tied to me i also think

410
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,279
about the content that i like

411
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,839
and how it'll affect my digital profile

412
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,240
so students look to teachers to model

413
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,880
behavior and parents

414
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,639
doxxing is a public release of often

415
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,079
very private information

416
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,440
and it can be a very big issue

417
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,279
especially in aggregate

418
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,320
getting to know students is tough uh and

419
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,000
finding a quick way to build rapport

420
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,600
with them is key

421
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,320
to to successfully start a new hit new

422
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,920
semester or school year

423
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,079
in this particular case an attempt was

424
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,079
made to build rapport

425
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,839
and it was a a great way to share a

426
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,680
tunnel personal information

427
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
so as you can see we have some uh

428
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,360
details about hobbies

429
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,040
a wedding date there's an age

430
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,040
yes i've redacted a fair amount of this

431
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,000
and there were some additional details

432
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,760
about childhood schools

433
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
what cities the person grew up in and

434
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,399
what they've lived in

435
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,839
sorry we'll give them a couple of

436
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,079
seconds for people to see

437
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,759
and some more detail covering their

438
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,839
educational career

439
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,920
and of course details about personal

440
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,440
interests including many standard

441
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,040
knowledge based authentication or

442
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
password reset questions

443
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,720
while it is unfortunate from a security

444
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
perspective in many ways

445
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,880
it shows a general perspective of online

446
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,800
privacy and a failing of awareness

447
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,759
campaigns in the security industry

448
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,279
there's enough information here to put

449
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,880
together a very good profile

450
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,560
to take over a person's identity or

451
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,399
accounts and some of those things that

452
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,440
i've redacted out

453
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,680
are so specific that you would very

454
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,199
easily be able to figure out where that

455
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,560
person has either lived

456
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,639
where they live today or whether where

457
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,839
they work

458
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,800
and well that's unfortunate

459
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,240
oh every fall it's the same thing

460
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,920
everyone goes back to school and a few

461
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,759
days later i bring a bunch of papers

462
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,880
home from school

463
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,199
and hand them to my dad dreading every

464
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,639
minute

465
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,199
and every fall i read them over hoping

466
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,399
that they're going to be better than the

467
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,279
last

468
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,120
and then i marked them up from front to

469
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,560
back

470
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,399
uh one of them in particular noted that

471
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,240
i was responsible for what my child

472
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,040
served for

473
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,519
when at school since i am aware that it

474
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,279
is impossible

475
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,120
to filter all of the traffic all the

476
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,040
time and i don't sit in my kids classes

477
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,240
oh oh never mind

478
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,480
so my dad hands me these forms and now i

479
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,839
have to take them back to school

480
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,839
all scratched out and i'm pretty sure

481
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,760
that my teachers talk about how my dad

482
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,959
does this every year

483
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,640
because they give me a look that says oh

484
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,240
sweetie i am so sorry

485
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,280
as a security professional the main

486
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,119
challenge that i find with these forms

487
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,599
that is that they do not allow for a

488
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,919
level of choice regarding how my child

489
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,799
how much a child needs to engage online

490
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,480
for the purposes of learning

491
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
it's all or nothing much like the

492
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,600
permission settings

493
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
when you install an app on some some

494
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,919
devices

495
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,160
in the new online form you can't even

496
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,480
say that you don't agree you either

497
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,360
agree

498
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,840
or the form is marked as uncomplete

499
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,000
incomplete the day

500
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,679
the way that these are written i cannot

501
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,600
in good conscience recommend

502
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,080
that any parent ever approve media

503
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,640
consent

504
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,480
for any child they are built to

505
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,919
indemnify the boards

506
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,240
not to protect the students it is

507
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,559
important to understand consent here

508
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,880
not providing active global consent does

509
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,960
not mean your child cannot take part in

510
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,240
school activities

511
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,080
it means that every time one of these

512
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,440
tools will be used

513
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,559
active consent directly asking you must

514
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,600
be requested

515
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
passive or implied consent just like

516
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,960
reverse back billing

517
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,120
will not apply in this case

518
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,799
when i went to middle school i logged

519
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,480
into my school google account for the

520
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,280
first time

521
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,640
and found that my password wasn't

522
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,360
working i asked the librarian and she

523
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,400
told me that this

524
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
all the students log in passwords were

525
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,559
switched to the name of my school

526
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,080
every single one and that we weren't

527
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,679
allowed to change them

528
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,440
of course i didn't listen and i changed

529
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
my password anyways

530
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,200
when i went to get my school ipad for

531
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,799
the first time they handed them out and

532
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,080
asked us to set them up

533
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,840
now the setup process was funny to me

534
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,679
because it wasn't really a process at

535
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,400
all

536
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,919
when you first open up the ipad you get

537
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,760
a bunch of pop-ups asking for

538
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,200
locations and notification services

539
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,600
other way around okay what i thought was

540
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,240
hilarious

541
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,600
is that they told us every pop-up every

542
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,880
for every pop-up click

543
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,240
ok allow and accept there are a few

544
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,640
issues with this first of all there is

545
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
no way that my teachers would appreciate

546
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,559
all the ipads in their classroom going

547
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,080
off with the notifications of

548
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,120
every single app installed and second of

549
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,679
all

550
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,679
what is it that i am accepting allowing

551
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,039
or saying okay to

552
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,400
what is the point of having all these

553
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,480
pop-ups in the first place if we're all

554
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,000
going to click

555
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,480
next allow accept okay finish without

556
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
even reading it

557
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,520
we're being trained to skip over the

558
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,760
details and not be aware of what we're

559
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,960
agreeing to

560
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,400
but the problem is they didn't even

561
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,000
realize that's what they were teaching

562
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,640
us

563
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,799
don't read it over just say accept and

564
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,000
it'll start working

565
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,919
what am i accepting again i don't know

566
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,360
class dojo classyojo is one of the many

567
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,880
tools that we've been asked to sign up

568
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,240
for i've been asked to sign up for

569
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,120
over the years many money have

570
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,480
reasonable purposes and

571
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,559
each time i drive my family nuts reading

572
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,000
through the terms of service

573
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,159
the terms of service i'm picking on so

574
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,840
much because it is the

575
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,240
only tool that we have directly to

576
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,840
review the intent of what the

577
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,600
applications and tools that our kids are

578
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,679
using

579
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,320
is is trying to do so this one must be

580
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,720
good

581
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,640
it's used in 95 percent of american

582
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,120
schools

583
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,000
once you dig into the terms of service

584
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
there is a lack of parent oversight

585
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,480
and the fact that it was designed to

586
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,960
normalize classroom behavior

587
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,120
by automating the task of recording

588
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,559
classroom

589
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,000
conduct as noted in the new york times

590
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,960
one might wonder who else is asking

591
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,440
questions

592
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,960
the ottawa citizen had it had reports

593
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,520
that were

594
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,440
that also showing that it was an

595
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,200
organized cyberbullying platform

596
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,280
with intentions of sharing and selling

597
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,640
personal information personally

598
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,720
identifiable information

599
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,919
there were a number of other good

600
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,480
analyses as well so i followed up with

601
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,960
the school

602
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,480
i received a reply about a week later

603
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,080
that there had been a decision not to

604
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,360
proceed with the platform

605
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,760
this is excellent a privacy went for

606
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,919
students reduction of mass surveillance

607
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,080
heck even the new york times wrote it up

608
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,320
all good right

609
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,320
um okay um i had no idea that my dad had

610
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,640
said

611
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,720
anything about class dojo i remember

612
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,640
someone asked our teacher why we stopped

613
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,520
using it

614
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
and my teacher responded by saying there

615
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,760
appears to be some sort of privacy issue

616
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,400
with it

617
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,720
she looked directly at me while saying

618
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,679
so

619
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,280
someone then asked what the problem was

620
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,880
so my teacher answered saying i don't

621
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,799
know apparently there were some problems

622
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,360
with it

623
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,559
looking at me in particular i only found

624
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,600
out when i came home

625
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,520
and my dad told me he had it banned from

626
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,000
the board

627
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,159
oh matchmatics um for valentine's day my

628
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,840
school decided it would be fun to do a

629
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,760
matchmaker quiz with all the staff and

630
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,960
students

631
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,640
i thought this was a horrible idea

632
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,159
but what really got me were the kinds of

633
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,039
questions they were asking us

634
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,960
as you can see the survey is filled out

635
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,120
on something similar to a scantron which

636
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,240
means it must go through

637
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,679
a computer system you can also see that

638
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,520
they're asking questions about what you

639
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,240
will do when you are out past curfew

640
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,640
and how late you stay out on weekends

641
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,679
which are all

642
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,720
security risks and can cause

643
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,120
someone to be put in danger for whatever

644
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,559
reason

645
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,640
now this got me wondering is this a

646
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,840
school organized

647
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,240
quiz or is it from an outside program i

648
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,640
don't know

649
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,320
we did some googling and found that the

650
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,720
survey came from a canadian website

651
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,960
called matchmatics which have several

652
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
different matchmaking questionnaires

653
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,640
naturally we went looking for the

654
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,120
privacy policy the privacy policy

655
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
informed us that they do not share or

656
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,400
sell any information

657
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,640
obtained from the answer form to any

658
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,480
company or government entity

659
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,720
and once scanned into their database the

660
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,360
answer forms are destroyed

661
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,799
now there are a few issues we had with

662
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,200
this claim one is yes they destroy the

663
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
paper copies but they still have all of

664
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,880
our answers somewhere

665
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,640
and what do they do with the data once

666
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,799
it's in the database how is it protected

667
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,480
and what else are they using the data

668
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,000
for

669
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,320
the problem we have the other problem we

670
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,080
had is they claim that they won't give

671
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,960
the data to any government entity

672
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,480
but aren't there legal statutes that

673
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,919
would make that claim improbable

674
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,120
we decided to email them and even a

675
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,600
later

676
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,678
a year later we are still waiting for a

677
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
reply

678
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,440
sometimes with all the good intentions

679
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,279
and the lack of awareness programs

680
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,120
opsec gets missed to the point that it

681
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,600
puts people at risk

682
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,679
in this case the requirement was for

683
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,919
students to harvest email addresses to

684
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,480
help

685
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,440
with the national geographic energy diet

686
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,960
everyone in the household provided a

687
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,760
pseudomeal

688
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,919
pseudomale private address which was

689
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,760
great and don't get me wrong

690
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,159
the the energy diet and the the concepts

691
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,120
that are behind it

692
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
are a great idea we need to make sure

693
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,640
that we are aware of the

694
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,840
impacts of global warming and the

695
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,679
negative impacts on the on environmental

696
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,679
spaces around us so this is a great

697
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,440
initiative

698
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,159
it ends up that all of our first and

699
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,520
last names were registered by the

700
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,240
teacher

701
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,440
and fully displayed on the public page

702
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,880
this would be fine except when you

703
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,960
started to correlate posted works

704
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,200
such as letters to the local newspaper

705
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,360
and a detailed map of every electronic

706
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,400
device in our house

707
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,320
making it the perfect level of detail

708
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,039
for a home invasion

709
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,159
it isn't until after you it isn't a

710
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,520
problem until after you do some

711
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,039
a little bit of google foo or open

712
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,720
source intelligence

713
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
and then you identify the home address

714
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,240
of the points and other points of

715
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,320
interest

716
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,000
but it ends up that you don't even have

717
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
to do that because there is a fully

718
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,960
clickable map

719
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,840
on the public main page of the site

720
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,559
making it

721
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,200
simple to identify the location of the

722
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,039
students in their school

723
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,880
and this is a school i randomly picked

724
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,640
it's not the school that my kids are at

725
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,080
nice try but

726
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,760
as you can see it specifically

727
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,600
identifies every school that's taken

728
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,080
part

729
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,200
in that particular region and it's

730
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,919
nationwide

731
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,080
so this was quickly cleared up but while

732
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,159
notifying me they leaked another child's

733
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,600
name in the response

734
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,360
and it seems that i wasn't the only

735
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,200
concerned parent as a result

736
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,120
so with viewing privacy in minds there

737
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,559
are some concerns

738
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,480
and the intention of the educator was

739
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,400
great

740
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,520
but it comes back to the question of why

741
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,679
what is the purpose of this tool is it

742
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:00,799
engaged in

743
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,720
is it enhancing the learning process or

744
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,919
is it an advertise

745
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,279
is it advertising online for no benefit

746
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,960
in the case of the national geographic

747
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,880
energy diet a deeper look into those

748
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,559
pesky terms of service

749
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,000
showed that the spa that it was

750
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,919
sponsored by the shell corporation

751
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,799
they retain rights of all works posted

752
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,159
and get an active

753
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,559
active advertising campaign as to how

754
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,000
they

755
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,039
how they help communities to

756
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,039
as it's related to environmental issues

757
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,360
distance learning the dreadful new

758
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,880
normal for many students

759
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,840
that is littered with privacy concerns

760
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,679
some schools require webcams to be

761
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,320
turned on

762
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,960
which can cause some issues cameras pick

763
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,520
up the in

764
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,880
the home environment the students are

765
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,279
working in as well as anyone who may be

766
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,640
walking by

767
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,159
some students are working on multiple

768
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,840
devices some have bigger

769
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,919
rooms with more space some have lots of

770
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,600
younger siblings running around

771
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,360
there's a lot there's a lot that can be

772
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,440
exposed to your classroom environment

773
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,360
that you normally wouldn't share

774
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,720
which may make some students and

775
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,480
families feel uncomfortable

776
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,480
this is especially problematic if a

777
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,240
parent if a parent

778
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,640
chooses to photograph their child along

779
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,480
with a partial view of the rest of their

780
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,880
class and share it on twitter

781
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,480
and then it in turn of course is

782
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,000
reshared and retweeted by

783
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,679
the minister of education so

784
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,039
one of my favorite stories so far is

785
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,880
when my teacher decided to share his

786
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,159
screen revealing an

787
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,240
open browser where he was buying a pair

788
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,320
of boots i remember he said oh yeah

789
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,240
those are the boots i want and holy fork

790
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,039
that's my credit card number

791
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,799
there was a few times that my teacher

792
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,399
was kicked out of the

793
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,880
meeting dude which may or may not have

794
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,840
been because of a ddos attack on our

795
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,640
school

796
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,320
students decided to take over the screen

797
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,000
during the teacher's absence

798
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,399
and play first-person shooter games

799
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,240
there have also been several

800
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,000
issues where people have forgotten to

801
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,440
turn off their microphones which

802
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,440
resulted in some rather hilarious

803
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,200
one-sided conversations

804
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,960
for example when someone was talking to

805
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,159
their friend about how they won't be

806
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,840
doing any work all semester

807
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,520
and will only pretend to pay attention

808
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,639
during online class

809
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,440
so in this case this is also from

810
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,720
another tweet

811
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
also from the same particular minister

812
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,399
and if you look carefully

813
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,039
the uh some of the names are slightly

814
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,799
visible the original image

815
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,360
that was posted the original tweet was

816
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,000
fully

817
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,520
uh fully visible and was not downrest in

818
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,000
any

819
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,880
way shape or form so uh thankfully that

820
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,399
was taken down and the and the kids

821
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,600
names were

822
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,279
slightly obfuscated

823
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,559
data is the new oil this has become the

824
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,000
new rallying cry over the

825
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,960
over the last few years there's so much

826
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,440
big money and money being poured into

827
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,760
big data machine learning artificial

828
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,559
intelligence

829
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,520
generative adversarial networks but what

830
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,640
does it mean for privacy

831
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
before you you use or recommend a

832
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,279
service you should always ask yourself

833
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,360
what is the intent of this technology

834
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,520
who benefits from the information

835
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,159
does it enhance our lives or the lives

836
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,760
of our users

837
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,159
is it worth the privacy risk to the to

838
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,360
the user

839
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,720
or is this just self-promotion

840
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,880
much like fossil fuels that have that

841
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,960
we've mishandled in so many ways

842
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
mishandled personally identifiable as

843
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,880
toxic waste and should be treated as

844
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,360
such

845
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,960
it's dangerous and it will get you in

846
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,480
trouble

847
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,720
it must be handled with care then this

848
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,399
has not been a priority over the past

849
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,320
two decades

850
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,000
history has shown that many important

851
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,679
things could not have existed without

852
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,640
privacy

853
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,559
the underground railroad women's right

854
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,240
to vote labor movements

855
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,640
gay and trans rights and many others

856
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,159
these all started as private

857
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,120
conversations

858
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,039
the simple act of being able to decide

859
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,320
who you tell something to

860
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,440
and when is a very powerful thing

861
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,799
if you haven't watched the netflix

862
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,880
documentary get hacked on the subject of

863
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,480
the cambridge analytica scandal you

864
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,039
should

865
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,440
it asks some very pertinent questions

866
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,799
are we free

867
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,720
do we really believe that it is our

868
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,640
freedom to choose

869
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,480
you never want your company logo to be

870
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,240
on a slide like this or worse

871
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
on the front page of the news maybe the

872
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,600
front page of the business section

873
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,799
but not the front page of the news so

874
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,559
how about something a little bit lighter

875
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,880
what if you posted a joke you worked at

876
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,640
a new startup in 2011

877
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,799
everyone is kind of hip and cool and the

878
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,240
next thing you know you all have cool

879
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,360
titles

880
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,120
one of the folks listed here is a friend

881
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,559
of mine who gave me

882
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,399
gave permission for me to point this out

883
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,640
bloomberg helped scrape their website

884
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,840
and managed to find

885
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,559
the chief libation officer a procurement

886
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,320
role only of course

887
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,760
and the chief rantologist

888
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,279
this will follow them throughout their

889
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,080
careers and it's a good thing it's funny

890
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,480
clearvoai is a private company that

891
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,880
scraped more than 3 billion images from

892
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,519
facebook

893
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,840
youtube and millions of other websites

894
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,799
basically they took

895
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,000
any publicly available image and

896
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,080
they sell access to all of our mugshots

897
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,039
to government agencies worldwide

898
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,679
facebook has agreed to pay 550 million

899
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,039
dollars to settle a class

900
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,279
action lawsuit for the violation of the

901
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,720
illinois biometric

902
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,600
information privacy act cameras are

903
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,159
everywhere

904
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,440
every mall library doorbell

905
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,000
and in my school there are 54 cameras i

906
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,679
counted them

907
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,519
it's terrifying to think what happens

908
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,120
once you enable facial recognition

909
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,880
systems across all of them

910
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,120
for example at the mall where cadillac

911
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,200
fairview malls recently

912
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,039
exposed for having cameras in a number

913
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,720
of malls across canada

914
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,640
these gathered facial images of people

915
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,760
without consent

916
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,799
including children

917
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,840
everything has a trade-off location

918
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,679
services and mapping apps for finding

919
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:56,480
your phone

920
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,640
finding your device or kind of makes

921
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,519
sense

922
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,039
social media apps start to get

923
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,640
questionable

924
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,600
this is a point-in-time query by gps

925
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,039
location for twitter

926
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,720
and youtube we not only know

927
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,799
where many of these folks live but also

928
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,399
where they walk their dogs

929
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,519
and what they visit in their

930
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,279
neighborhood the map was produced with

931
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,360
the pushpin module of recon ng

932
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,080
an excellent tool from i believe it was

933
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,000
landmaster 53

934
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,279
and and

935
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,600
simply turning off the location services

936
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,960
on your devices

937
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,200
when not needed and removing the exif

938
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,880
data from your images will stop this

939
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,120
we talked about opsec a little earlier

940
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,039
a couple of days after we had wi-fi on

941
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,880
vacation i decided to check out our

942
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,279
insta

943
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,440
out instagram i have it's four followers

944
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,640
and i follow six people

945
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,000
what exactly were you thinking

946
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,080
when you posted that we were no longer

947
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,919
home on instagram

948
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,679
i just thought look at these cool

949
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,360
pictures uh

950
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,399
but insurance our home is unattended

951
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,679
and you just told 297

952
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,399
of your closest friends to go steal our

953
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,000
stuff

954
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,399
well you know that was resolved

955
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,080
parenting problem solved in one right

956
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,919
oh right that was the day we flew out

957
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,320
oops

958
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,360
okay this is a survey of 89 of my peers

959
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,320
58 appear to be concerned about online

960
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,679
privacy

961
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,440
eighty percent are concerned about the

962
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,360
sale of their info but they make fun of

963
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,360
me when i bring it up

964
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,640
the most that most of them use and

965
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,000
trust instagram when you consider issues

966
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,279
like cyberbullying 29 wish they never

967
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,240
posted

968
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,519
or issues a predatory behavior where 10

969
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,679
of the parents don't know that they have

970
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,279
accounts

971
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,840
these can be very concerning

972
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,839
what we can see is they don't ask their

973
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,440
parents for advice

974
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,839
clearly

975
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,079
there are a lot of rules

976
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,280
and some of them follow them but since

977
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,839
20

978
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,839
skipped the question it's only really

979
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,839
half

980
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,520
they get advice from their peers not

981
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,320
from anyone else

982
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,760
and we can see that the dopamine hit

983
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,719
system is working

984
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:56,560
very well several times a day

985
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:59,839
51.69

986
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,680
we can also see that 45 share

987
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,320
during their vacations so we know who to

988
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,560
rob

989
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,440
and instagram youtube and snapchat are

990
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,280
the most popular services

991
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,359
but they don't seem to realize that

992
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,359
google owns youtube

993
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,640
and the they use instagram and snapchat

994
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
for instant messaging instead of

995
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,880
more secure tools like signal but

996
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,320
interestingly enough

997
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,599
62 percent read the terms of service

998
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,599
read the terms of service for instagram

999
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,960
but only four

1000
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,599
is but since only 48 responded to that

1001
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,640
question

1002
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,839
that would mean only 30 read

1003
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,320
they trust instagram and much a lot more

1004
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,520
than facebook

1005
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,520
that's right they trust instagram the

1006
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,040
most and facebook

1007
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,680
the least it's too bad that they didn't

1008
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,480
know that facebook owns instagram

1009
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,400
the biggest surprise of all and this is

1010
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,839
a huge surprise

1011
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:06,079
23 are actually using 2fa 52

1012
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,200
are using unique passwords 67 turnoff

1013
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,560
location services

1014
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,400
and 79 have private accounts

1015
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,480
that that that last one in particular

1016
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,560
was very shocking to me

1017
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,880
um i am sure that there are a number of

1018
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,079
parents who can learn from this

1019
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,280
assume breach assume breach is the model

1020
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,839
that

1021
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,800
um is is a model that assumes that the

1022
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,960
attackers are already in the network

1023
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,640
they already have your data and you

1024
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,839
don't know where they are and it's the

1025
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:38,960
beginning of the threat

1026

two years later the ontario supreme

1031
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,079
court concluded

1032
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,359
that the breach was responsible that the

1033
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,440
breach response was responsible

that's it in particular they identified

1038
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,680
that compensable injury must be received

1039

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,839
and fears that people living in in

1043
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,480
society routinely accept you should

1044
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,240
routinely expect your personal

1045
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,839

together

1052
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,240
with a little bit of machine learning

1053
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,839
and you can identify anonymous

1054

anonymized data

1055
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,320
when asked about privacy and so many

1056
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,920
people say i'm not a target i have

1057
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,040
nothing to hide

1058
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,640
it's not about what you do what you've

1059
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,079
done anymore it's about what can be

1060
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,760
gleaned from those relationships and how

1061
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,280
can it be monetized

1062
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,359
privacy is a tool to combat this if

1063
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,800
there's no data there's nothing to

1064
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,119
breach

1065
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,720
what can you do stay engaged

1066
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,480
timely follow up and follow through when

1067
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,839
you see something that doesn't make

1068
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:08,960
sense

1069
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,280
think critically never be afraid to ask

1070
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,480
questions

1071
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,599
escalate when necessary and don't follow

1072
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,359
the herd

1073
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,800
some things that we've learned along the

1074
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,680
way not everyone will agree with you

1075
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,720
that's okay trust and communication

1076
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,920
are key trust but verify understand your

1077
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,320
risks what you're sharing and why

1078
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,160
constant vigilance and dad will always

1079
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,960
find out

1080
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,599
eventually

1081
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
so these are all the links there are

1082
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,400
three pages i'll give you a couple of

1083
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,160
seconds to quickly snapshot them if you

1084
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,800
really

1085
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,520
feel that but they're not clickable here

1086
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,680
we're going to post them all on discord

1087
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,160
there are a ton of links

1088
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,160
a serious ton of links we have like two

1089
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,839
minutes for questions if anybody has a

1090
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,240
question i i think

1091
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,000
and we can just follow up and with

1092
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,760
questions in the in the discord

1093
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:14,480
afterwards if that's preference

1094
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,560
um yeah so for for a question in the

1095
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,240
uh this card uh what's your um

1096
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,560
what's your discord id so we can write

1097
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,000
to you directly so so

1098
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,520
if people want to write the right

1099
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,760
question or ask questions directly to

1100
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,440
you so you won't miss it

1101
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,000
uh in the so i'm i'm just in his dawn

1102
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,160
i forget what mine is um

1103
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,160
0x6d 78 underscore gray

1104
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,040
underscore violet

1105
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,040
okay so we'll follow up with any

1106
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,720
questions in the discord afterwards

1107
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,119
and thank you everyone

1108
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,040
uh we really appreciate the opportunity

1109
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,160
to go through this

1110
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,640
i i think this is is great for

1111
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,319
especially parents and kids and

1112
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,880
uh and infosec professionals to start

1113
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,640
thinking about the impacts of awareness

1114
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,560
campaigns and other things

1115
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,960
and which we do we do have a question

1116
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,240
very fast

1117
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,560
um someone asked if there's a

1118
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,960
really uh secure and private app

1119
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,359
somewhere

1120
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,920
really secure and prep app for for what

1121
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,119
purpose

1122
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,839
uh it didn't write but i think it was

1123
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:30,480
more like

1124
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,599
a generic question really is there any

1125
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,440
way to have a really

1126
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,040
secure and private app

1127
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,760
so that's a really difficult thing to

1128
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,560
answer because

1129
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,040
the the simplest answer is there there

1130
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,839
are no such

1131
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,240
things as completely secure and private

1132
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,760
apps

1133
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,760
things that are zero knowledge uh

1134
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
end to end encrypted that would be the

1135
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,359
beginning of anything that would be

1136
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,000
truly

1137
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,920
uh truly true truly private so

1138
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,680
the zero knowledge is key because

1139
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,960
there's no information that can be

1140
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,240
gathered between the the

1141
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,480
the provider and end-to-end encrypted

1142
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,839
meaning of course that there's

1143
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,839
there's no data that's that's captured

1144
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,599
in transit and preferably

1145
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,599
would also be encrypted on the device

1146
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,079
the challenge that you start to get into

1147
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,839
is whether or not the devices

1148
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,960
is then the point of risk so

1149
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,599
there's no perfectly good answer if

1150
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,839
we're talking about texting apps

1151
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,560
i prefer signal over just about

1152
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,520
everything else

1153
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,119
the downfall with signal being that it

1154
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,800
exposes your cell phone number unless

1155
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,920
you've gone and registered

1156
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,200
with a voip number so there are always

1157
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,720
challenges and trade-offs and it's

1158
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,520
always a

1159
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,599
a trick to figure out how to go around

1160
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:44,880
that

1161
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,319
if you're looking for a whole bunch of

1162
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,480
references and recommendations

1163
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,920
the michael basel has a the

1164
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,359
it used to be called the open source

1165
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,359
security and

1166
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,319
open source security podcast uh he's

1167
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,359
changed the name two or three times

1168
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,359
there's uh he recently did a series of

1169
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,040
episodes that were

1170
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,400
a reintroduction of of focusing on

1171
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,319
privacy and privacy focused and security

1172
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,240
uh recommendations and applications and

1173
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,119
things the on the

1174
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,280
extreme privacy end of things it gets

1175
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,640
very complicated

1176
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,680
and the thing to remember is if you do

1177
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,280
one thing that is more private or more

1178
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,000
secure

1179
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,480
today you're better than you were

1180
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,280
yesterday

1181
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,960
and if you do one thing every day or

1182
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,720
once one thing every week

1183
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,880
you'll slowly make your way forward and

1184
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,640
it won't be perfect

1185
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,279
and that's okay
