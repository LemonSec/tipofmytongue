00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,120
hello everyone

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,759
and welcome to trust but verify

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,759
maintaining democracy in spite of

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,800
information countermeasures

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,280
my name is allie mellon i'm a security

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,080
strategist

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,920
in the office of the cso at cyber reason

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,320
i have been in tech for about a decade

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,279
now and

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,119
i've spent five of those years as a

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,359
mobile app developer and engineer

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,439
and the past several working in the

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,800
security space

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,880
and for the last two years i've been

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,719
working closely with the fbi

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,600
secret service dhs and local and state

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,800
law enforcement

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,000
to help protect our elections

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,079
one of the things that we've been doing

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,120
in order to

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,000
really identify the processes in place

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,719
that the

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,280
government has to protect our elections

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,000
is to go

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,920
through um table top election security

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,120
exercises

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,239
in these exercises it's hackers versus

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,559
law enforcement and government officials

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,000
to really figure out whether or not the

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,559
government

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,799
is prepared and has the processes in

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,119
place to handle different things that

33
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,159
attackers

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,280
might try to do this does not require

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,759
any hacking of actual voting machines

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,119
or any actual hands-on keyboard

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,640
hacking it's really all about seeing the

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,320
processes in place

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,280
and really making sure that government

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,880
officials and law enforcement

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,240
are prepared for any scenario

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,560
but before we really dive into that

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,920
portion of the talk

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
i want to start by talking about what's

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,960
truly critical to our daily lives

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,320
because this is really more connected to

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,560
making sure our vote is secure than you

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,159
might think

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,000
the way that i think about this is

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,200
through maslow's hierarchy of needs

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,720
for those of you who don't know what

52
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,799
this is this is a pyramid that

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,719
really talks about all of the things

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,799
that we as human beings need

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,000
before we feel comfortable reaching

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,119
and becoming the best that we can be

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,360
at the base of this pyramid we see the

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,200
physiological needs

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,800
these are things like air water food

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,959
shelter all of the things that we really

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,080
need just to live

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,959
above that we have safety and this layer

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,680
is really about that personal security

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,920
safety with your employment having the

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,200
resources that you need to survive

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
above that layer and this one is really

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,760
critical is all about belonging

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,519
these are things like friendship and

69
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,239
intimacy and that sense of connection

70
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,000
that you need as a human being

71
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
above that is esteem this comes in the

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,280
form of

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,000
not only self-respect and self-respect

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,560
self

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,040
self-esteem but also status and

76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,879
recognition within the community that

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,200
you're a part of

78
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,280
and this is all leading up to the top of

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,159
the pyramid which is self-actualization

80
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,720
this is really that desire to be the

81
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,000
most that one can be

82
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,920
so where does voting fit into this

83
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,000
process that's what we're going to look

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,879
to address today and really understand

85
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,440
and give a framework for how we should

86
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,000
be thinking

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,800
about voting during an election

88
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,959
now i'm going to start by diving into

89
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,640
the defender perspective to give you an

90
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,480
idea of what's happening today

91
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,959
and how this is being approached today

92
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:31,599
then

93
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,440
we'll talk about the daily life of the

94
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
actual voters themselves

95
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,200
before jumping into the attacker

96
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,040
perspective

97
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,519
after that that will really be the basis

98
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,480
to understand

99
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,959
what we as individuals might be able to

100
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,400
do to stop an election

101
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,360
or as nation states and then we can use

102
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,480
that information

103
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,879
to really try to protect our elections

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,080
let's jump into the defender perspective

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,760
the state of play today

106
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,519
so the dhs defines election security and

107
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,959
election infrastructure in particular as

108
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,280
things like voter registration databases

109
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,560
i.t infrastructure

110
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
voting system polling places all of the

111
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,959
things really needed to tabulate

112
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,040
and count the votes but my question is

113
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,080
is this really all and

114
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,720
through my work with these organizations

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,479
i've really found that this is not

116
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,160
all that we need a much more broad

117
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,520
and encompassing definition and the way

118
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,880
that i've been thinking about this is

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,720
through what i call the voter hierarchy

120
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,000
of needs

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,639
this is a pyramid much like maslow's

122
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,160
hierarchy of needs

123
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,320
it shows all of the things that we as

124
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,520
individuals

125
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,960
really need in order to feel comfortable

126
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,160
safe and willing to go vote

127
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,080
much like maslow's hierarchy of needs

128
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,639
this does include physiological needs

129
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,240
if we don't feel like we have the air

130
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,479
or the food or the water that we need to

131
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,280
survive

132
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
we have other priorities that come

133
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,039
before voting

134
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,680
similarly if we don't feel safe either

135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,560
in our country

136
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,600
in our homes at our work we're much less

137
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,280
likely to vote because we need to

138
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,360
prioritize that safety before we can

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,400
prioritize voting

140
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,360
belonging is also an absolutely critical

141
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,639
component

142
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,720
if we don't feel like we belong in the

143
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,000
country that we're in

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,840
if we don't feel an attachment to that

145
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,840
country people are much less likely to

146
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,240
vote

147
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,280
and esteem is also critical if we don't

148
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,880
feel like our vote matters

149
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,600
or like we're respected in the community

150
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,360
we're much less likely to want to give

151
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,639
back to that community

152
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,639
and to make change in that community

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,120
through voting

154
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,199
and then last but not least of course

155
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,800
self-actualization comes into play here

156
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,199
not only about being the best that you

157
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,120
as an individual can be

158
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,600
but about being the best that your

159
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,520
country can be in helping your country

160
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,318
achieve that

161
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
so this is what i call the voter

162
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,400
hierarchy of needs

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,520
and this is one of the reasons why i

164
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,400
question

165
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,800
if election infrastructure should really

166
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,680
be limited

167
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,039
to what's used to tabulate and collect

168
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,759
votes because we have all of these

169
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,880
layers

170
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,440
that we need to protect in order to

171
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,400
ensure

172
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,199
the integrity of the vote and they can

173
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,240
all be

174
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,680
systems that are a target

175
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,160
and this is especially true when we

176
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
think about the fact that 40 percent of

177
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,840
eligible u.s citizens

178
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,720
do not vote at all with the numbers as

179
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,080
high as these

180
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,560
any kind of voter suppression has an

181
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,080
impact on the election

182
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,840
and we need to be cognizant of that

183
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
so when i think about election

184
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,639
infrastructure and election security

185
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,240
i think about the importance of

186
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,560
maintaining faith in democracy

187
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,280
of preventing voter suppression and of

188
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,919
course

189
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,680
of ensuring national security

190
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,919
so with all of that in mind i really

191
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,199
want to dive into

192
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,039
the attacker perspective and i want to

193
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,400
make a quick note

194
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,720
as you're thinking about this that this

195
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,039
is not an evil thing to do

196
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,199
we are not diving into the attacker

197
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,039
perspective so we can hurt anyone

198
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,759
or so we can affect any outcomes of any

199
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,759
elections we're doing it so we can get a

200
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,160
better understanding

201
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,199
of what could go wrong so we can protect

202
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,880
against it

203
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,919
this is why we read team insecurity it's

204
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,039
very important

205
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,120
so that we can be the best that we can

206
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
be and i don't want

207
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,240
to for anyone to get the sense that this

208
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,879
is

209
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,160
something that we're doing vindictively

210
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,960
or

211
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,280
for an evil outcome this is purely to

212
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,000
make us stronger and to make us better

213
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,440
so let's dive in when we think about

214
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,800
attacker motivations

215
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,039
especially at the nation-state level

216
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,639
we're thinking about things like

217
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,759
gaining power spreading a particular

218
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,120
ideology

219
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,599
or maintaining global recognition and

220
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,879
support

221
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,720
all three of these things are really

222
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,400
critical for

223
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,240
um different nation states whether they

224
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,639
are

225
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,639
currently superpowers whether they want

226
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,160
to be superpowers

227
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,200
or whether they're just trying to ensure

228
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,080
their survival

229
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,760
i want to talk about the different

230
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,719
layers

231
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,240
that a cyber attack can target because

232
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,720
more generally outside of elections but

233
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,959
also specifically for elections

234
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,760
i see cyber attacks affecting three core

235
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,399
layers

236
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,279
there's the infrastructure layer that is

237
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:55,920
all about

238
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,480
the physical aspects of a system so it's

239
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,399
about taking a cyber attack

240
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,320
and having it affect the kinetic world

241
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,720
the second is information this is

242
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,760
actually

243
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,080
about spreading information that isn't

244
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,320
true and but making people believe that

245
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,839
it's fact

246
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,720
and then ethos which is of course about

247
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
that belief system

248
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,000
really targeting and affecting that

249
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,760
belief system to influence an

250
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,080
outcome and now i want to really dive

251
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,640
into

252
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,000
a lot of examples of attacks

253
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,120
on elections and on governments

254
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,600
that relate to these three planes we're

255
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
going to show some historical ones

256
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,399
that don't really have a cyber component

257
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,040
but could very easily be translated

258
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,000
to havon and so as we're going through

259
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
these i want you to think about how

260
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,399
cyber

261
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,279
could be used to actually make this even

262
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,480
more potent

263
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,040
than it already was we'll also be

264
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
looking at some modern examples that do

265
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,640
include a cyber component

266
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,240
to give a little variety and show how

267
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,640
this is really happening already today

268
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,320
i want to start with the italian

269
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,519
elections of 1948.

270
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,640
this was election interference in 1948

271
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,880
where the u.s government was actually

272
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,040
intent on psychological warfare

273
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,160
of course it was right after world war

274
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,480
ii

275
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,600
a very tense time and millions of

276
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,959
dollars was going to

277
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,800
christian democratic and right-wing

278
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,160
socialist parties

279
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,079
to sway the outcome of this election it

280
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,120
was really a massive propaganda campaign

281
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
against the communist socialist

282
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,959
coalition and the goal

283
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,760
on both sides was to really change the

284
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,600
perception of the election

285
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,880
it was about democracy versus

286
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,200
totalitarianism

287
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,399
christianity versus atheism really

288
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,160
abundance versus starvation and

289
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,920
ultimately america

290
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,439
versus the soviet union

291
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,079
and the outcome was so effective

292
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,120
that the u.s repeated this process in

293
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
guatemala

294
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,160
in south vietnam in afghanistan

295
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,680
and indonesia and many many more

296
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,239
countries

297
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,959
another example i want to showcase is

298
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,160
the 1996

299
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,200
chinese influence on the u.s election

300
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,399
in 1996 three hundred thousand dollars

301
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,600
was funneled from

302
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
a chinese general interested in

303
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,160
influencing the us presidential election

304
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,279
to the clinton campaign now

305
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,800
at the time of course this is

306
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,600
immediately meant to

307
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,079
add resources to the clinton campaign

308
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,839
because this general wanted them

309
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,399
to succeed in the election which is for

310
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,600
interference

311
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,720
but further of course

312
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,120
americans found out about this happening

313
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,480
and this is the type of thing that can

314
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,160
make you question

315
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,200
whether or not your elections are

316
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,240
really about really by the people and

317
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,279
for the people

318
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,680
or whether there are other influences at

319
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,000
play

320
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
and i also want to talk about some

321
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,519
social media attacks

322
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,519
we're going to talk about ones that

323
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,360
really do target that belief system

324
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,360
on the right you can see an example of

325
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,399
a facebook ad that's meant to make

326
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,680
people

327
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,360
uh really to highlight the contrarian

328
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,399
opinions

329
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,680
and to promote chaos between individuals

330
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,000
in the united states this isn't even

331
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,440
even an advertisement

332
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,920
that's actually sent by someone in the

333
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,760
us by an american

334
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,800
this is sent by another nation in order

335
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,279
to

336
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,959
really highlight the divides that we

337
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,560
have in the country and to

338
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,399
make them deeper on the left hand side

339
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,760
you can see a twitter uh post a promoted

340
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,600
twitter post that's supposed to

341
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
supposedly from the clinton campaign

342
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
it's very convincing

343
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,120
there's a hillary clinton logo in the

344
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,519
corner the colors all match her colors

345
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,079
of course she is in the image as well

346
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:12,560
and

347
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,839
it's meant to get

348
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,040
eligible voters to text hillary to a

349
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,480
certain number

350
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,279
in order to vote needless to say this is

351
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,320
not a way

352
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,880
that you can vote but it would be very

353
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,079
convincing to people

354
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,399
especially during a pandemic who don't

355
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,240
necessarily want to go

356
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,399
wait in line they'd much rather just

357
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,120
text someone and be able to vote

358
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,199
so these are two very important examples

359
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,639
of attacks that

360
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,199
can make people um think that they're

361
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,560
able to do something that they're not

362
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,920
actually able to do

363
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,680
that can change their perception of

364
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,279
their country and

365
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,120
that can of course change their

366
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,800
perception of their government as well

367
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,279
now we've seen over the past few months

368
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,320
especially

369
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,440
a really really great approach

370
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,240
by social media companies to address the

371
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,079
problems that we're seeing

372
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,160
with disinformation online however

373
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,240
i would be remiss not to talk about

374
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,000
quotes like these

375
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,399
from social media companies and their

376
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,519
leaders

377
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,399
that really frame this problem as a free

378
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,519
speech issue

379
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,440
and i bring this up because i think it's

380
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
so important throughout this talk

381
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,160
to be thinking about the fact that this

382
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,320
is not just a social media company

383
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,959
problem

384
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,360
this is not just a government problem

385
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,720
this is a problem for

386
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,560
each of us to grapple with as

387
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,920
individuals

388
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,199
and to try to fix

389
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,920
as individuals as parts of our

390
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,880
organizations

391
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
as parts of the government however we

392
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,760
can we need to address this problem

393
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,639
and quotes like these muddy the waters

394
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,480
and make it seem like this is a free

395
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,600
speech issue

396
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,800
when in reality it is not this is about

397
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,000
making sure

398
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,880
that our democracy is safe and protected

399
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,920
and we need to

400
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,199
expect people who run our social media

401
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,480
companies and who are involved in

402
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,240
our critical infrastructure and who work

403
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,920
in our government we need to expect them

404
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,800
to protect

405
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,599
democracy

406
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,480
now i also want to take a look at the

407
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,320
information plan and i think that this

408
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,680
is really fascinating because we're

409
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,480
going to delve

410
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,440
into some very early examples of

411
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
disinformation

412
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,680
and i want to start with one that's very

413
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,120
near and dear to my heart

414
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,079
which is as an american which is the

415
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,000
foundations of america

416
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,240
which actually comes back to sam adams

417
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
who is a very popular figure in american

418
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,600
history

419
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,199
now america i did not know this

420
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,279
but america was actually founded on the

421
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,360
premise of a conspiracy theory

422
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,279
where the british were trying to enslave

423
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,560
us sam adams argued britain's taxations

424
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,639
were part of an elaborate conspiracy

425
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,079
to eventually enslave american colonists

426
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,720
he actually spread that and other early

427
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,680
disinformation

428
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,519
through pamphlets and speeches that

429
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,720
contained information he knew was untrue

430
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,519
and he actually used the boston massacre

431
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,160
a very

432
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,680
well-known event and inflection point

433
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,279
during um america's revolution

434
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,920
he used that to further his message

435
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,279
so we see at this moment

436
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,560
and over the past four years

437
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,639
americans really grappling with this

438
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,399
concept of disinformation

439
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,600
and it being very much so tied to

440
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,120
um social media and the viral

441
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,279
virality and the viral nature of social

442
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,839
media

443
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,320
however this is not a new problem

444
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,000
we've seen this happening for as long as

445
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
at least the country that i'm in has

446
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,680
been around and

447
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,000
honestly a lot of the countries around

448
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,959
the world

449
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,959
and we need to treat it like a people

450
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,480
problem which it is

451
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,079
instead of a social media problem

452
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,760
the next thing i want to talk about is

453
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,919
the cia and the propaganda asset

454
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,119
inventory

455
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,160
so during the cold war era in

456
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,280
the 50s and 60s of course the cia

457
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,119
had a large inventory of different

458
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,439
propaganda assets across the world

459
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,120
they were very intent on using

460
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,640
propaganda to serve their own um

461
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,000
political and international means

462
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,840
i want to highlight two cases that i

463
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,280
think are really interesting

464
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,080
and could very easily be made a lot

465
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,799
easier

466
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,919
through modern day cyber attacks the

467
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:46,400
first

468
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,200
is um radio free asia which was

469
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,919
controlled

470
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,280
by the cia and the us government

471
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,320
and the goal with radio free asia was

472
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,360
actually to spread the message

473
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,679
of propaganda that the cia wanted to get

474
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,440
out to asian countries

475
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,720
however they realized that that many

476
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,160
people in taiwan

477
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,880
many private citizens at least would not

478
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,080
have access

479
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,600
to radios so they actually strapped

480
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,480
radios

481
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,039
two balloons and released them into the

482
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:19,760
air

483
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,440
hoping that the wind would take them to

484
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,880
taiwan

485
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,640
needless to say the wind went in the

486
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,080
wrong direction and they never

487
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,480
ended up making it to taiwan but it's an

488
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,919
interesting example of how

489
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,559
constraints during that time really

490
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,559
prevented them from spreading propaganda

491
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,000
the way that they wanted to

492
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,520
and how you can imagine that with the

493
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,080
internet

494
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,480
and how we interact now it would be a

495
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,840
lot easier

496
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,320
to really get that message to the people

497
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,960
in taiwan or wherever the cia might be

498
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,200
interested in getting it to

499
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,760
the second example i want to give is a

500
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,400
magazine

501
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,360
called forum world features this

502
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,480
magazine

503
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,280
um had carefully placed propaganda

504
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,679
stories in it from the cia

505
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,080
and it actually became so popular that

506
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,200
it was

507
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,039
the magazine itself was distributed to

508
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,480
the u.s so

509
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,360
the cia had to be very careful not to

510
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,919
place

511
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,960
false stories in the u.s version

512
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,520
so another example of how logistics can

513
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,039
really impact

514
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,360
the process and how people go about

515
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,639
spreading disinformation

516
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,720
another example i want to highlight is

517
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,440
u.s radio in moscow

518
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,720
from 1976 to 1982

519
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,960
rock music like elton john and the

520
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
beatles was really popular but

521
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,120
people in moscow couldn't get it because

522
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,720
it was english

523
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,160
um so the cia actually set up a radio

524
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,080
station that made it to moscow

525
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,880
and they would play rock music but it

526
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,480
was often followed by

527
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,799
quote-unquote editorial content which

528
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,160
soviet authorities considered

529
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,039
disinformation

530
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,440
i also want to talk about the um

531
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,520
2014 elections in ukraine so

532
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,880
during the 2014 elections a few days

533
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,360
before

534
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,400
on the 21st of may in 2014

535
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,440
the um main election network

536
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,880
is called the cec network was

537
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,200
compromised and attackers were actually

538
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,520
able to disable vote counting

539
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,919
for somewhere around 12 hours now

540
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,840
if you're someone who is voting in this

541
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,480
election

542
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,360
obviously this is very concerning

543
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,280
can cause you to immediately lose faith

544
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
in your government's ability

545
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,960
and integrity but

546
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,480
four days later on election day

547
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,039
attacks continued there was a constant

548
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,320
denial service attack

549
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,640
on the cec website this is the same

550
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,240
website that they compromised and

551
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,159
disabled vote counting on

552
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,640
and then 12 minutes before polls closed

553
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,960
attackers posted a picture of the former

554
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,480
leader of the right sector

555
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,000
on that legitimate website claiming he

556
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,440
won the election

557
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,159
and that was immediately widely shared

558
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,640
by russian media

559
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,679
so this is an interesting combination of

560
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,360
a cyber attack used to make something

561
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,600
seem legitimate before the polls have

562
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,559
even closed

563
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,799
which will automatically make people

564
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,240
feel like it's not worth it if they're

565
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
waiting in line and they see that

566
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,960
someone has actually already won the

567
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,600
election

568
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,120
like why would they bother voting but

569
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,039
it was also immediately shared by

570
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,720
russian media

571
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,200
which tries to really widen the spread

572
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,240
of information

573
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,320
and make sure that everyone sees oh

574
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,919
someone has already won the election if

575
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,280
you're thinking about

576
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,480
going to the polls you shouldn't so a

577
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,159
fascinating example

578
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,799
of how it can really mess with people's

579
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,000
ability to

580
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
trust results that are posted even on

581
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,720
legitimate government websites

582
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,240
leading up to an election and during an

583
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,480
election

584
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,799
i also want to give some examples um

585
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,240
from the 2016

586
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,559
u.s presidential election of

587
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,640
communication attacks

588
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,120
so on the right hand side you can see an

589
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,000
example

590
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,799
where an individual is getting a text

591
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,000
message

592
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,919
from supposedly a government-affiliated

593
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,200
organization

594
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,559
it has the actual um address of the

595
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,320
place that this person is supposed to go

596
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,200
vote

597
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,039
and gives them more information about

598
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,640
hours and all of that

599
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,960
however this is not an actual polling

600
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,000
location

601
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,320
this is a message being sent from an

602
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,520
attacker

603
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,280
in order to get this person to go

604
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,120
somewhere that isn't actually their

605
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,720
polling place

606
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,440
can you imagine you go out to go vote

607
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,280
you get this text message you go to this

608
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,840
address and there's nothing there

609
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,600
are you going to feel frustrated maybe

610
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,120
not want to go find

611
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,480
where you're actually supposed to go

612
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,280
vote absolutely

613
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,200
on the left you can also see an example

614
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,919
that's supposedly from president trump

615
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,760
saying that this person has not yet

616
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,679
submitted their ballot

617
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,000
now this message is not from president

618
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
trump it is not from

619
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,919
the trump campaign it is just meant to

620
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,200
shame people

621
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,679
into voting and who knows where that

622
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,640
link actually goes

623
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,720
last but not least are the

624
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,080
infrastructure attacks

625
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,440
and these are particularly um

626
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,720
important to me because really that that

627
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,080
kinetic impact

628
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,200
that physical impact is where we can see

629
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,440
a lot of cyber attacks becoming

630
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,159
very serious and potentially having

631
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,840
fatal outcomes which is something that

632
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,480
i'm very concerned about

633
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,039
and i want to start with the

634
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,640
assassination of lumumba

635
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,960
again this is a historical example it

636
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,799
doesn't have a cyber component

637
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,880
but you can think about how much easier

638
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,720
this could be to perpetrate

639
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,159
by having a cyber component so

640
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,600
in 1960 the democratic republic of the

641
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,919
congo gained independence

642
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,799
that year they elected a prime minister

643
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,480
lumumba

644
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,840
and then he was subsequently

645
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,080
assassinated one year later in 1961.

646
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,200
now having your leader assassinated

647
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,360
as a brand new country would of course

648
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,039
be politically fracturing for

649
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,240
any new and independent nation

650
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,480
but to make things worse this

651
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,799
assassination was actually perpetrated

652
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,400
by the american and belgian governments

653
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,799
all because they wanted to make sure

654
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,320
that

655
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,159
the leader of the drc met their western

656
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,760
interests

657
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,279
so imagine you're in a very small

658
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,039
country um

659
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,159
you're brand new you choose a leader and

660
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,000
then that leader is assassinated a year

661
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,720
later

662
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,480
by some of the world's largest

663
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,159
superpowers

664
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,919
this is the type of thing that will make

665
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,679
you realize

666
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,440
that your vote does not matter in this

667
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,120
country and that

668
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,000
you don't actually control how your

669
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,320
country acts so it not only takes away

670
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,000
your belief that your vote actually

671
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,880
matters

672
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,200
but it also makes you realize that this

673
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,960
isn't really your country

674
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,880
this is a country that's being

675
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,720
controlled like a piece of chess

676
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,880
or like a um like a pawn and a piece of

677
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,919
in a chess game so

678
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,960
a very troubling example and i think a

679
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,039
good example that shows the real impact

680
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,520
that can come from something like this

681
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
the second example that i want to give

682
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,919
is the indonesian elections and

683
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:44,720
subsequent

684
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,720
massacre this was perpetrated in 1965

685
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,520
the communist party finished fourth in

686
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:51,760
an

687
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,360
indonesian election and they were

688
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
offered a proportional representation

689
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,080
in the government there now this was not

690
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,120
in keeping with us

691
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,520
interests and so the us secretly

692
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,120
supported the purge of suspected

693
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,000
communists

694
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,360
through many many messages purporting to

695
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:07,679
be

696
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,000
from people with an indonesia affiliated

697
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,880
with indonesia but they were americans

698
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,799
this caused the death of thousands to

699
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,360
millions of communists over months

700
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,520
and the military actually took over as

701
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,600
the most powerful institution

702
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,919
so this is the type of attack where

703
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:24,960
obviously it

704
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,000
kills immediately but it also terrifies

705
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,960
the public

706
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,039
who is speaking freely who is voting

707
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,880
freely after this happens in their

708
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,679
country

709
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,240
when this huge portion of their

710
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,799
government

711
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,880
is has just been slaughtered for their

712
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,080
beliefs

713
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,480
i can't imagine walking around and

714
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,400
talking about my belief system

715
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,120
or talking about my vote or how i'm

716
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,400
excited to vote

717
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,520
when something like this happens

718
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,600
um so i think this is a really important

719
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
example especially because a lot of this

720
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,559
was

721
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,600
pushed by messages from americans being

722
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,120
sent to indonesians

723
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,760
masquerading as indonesians that's

724
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,120
particularly important

725
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,640
because of course with the internet as

726
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,279
it is

727
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,200
it's much easier to send messages like

728
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,320
that that

729
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,240
really you can't tell if that person is

730
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,840
actually from your country or not

731
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,760
the other example i want to talk about

732
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,919
is the bronze night now this is not from

733
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,279
an election day but it's a good

734
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,279
representation of what could happen and

735
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,360
a really modern example

736
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,440
so the bronze night was a night in

737
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,799
estonia

738
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,600
where estonians decided to move a red

739
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,480
army soldier

740
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,760
from the the center of town

741
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,559
to a soviet cemetery

742
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,960
and this was mainly done because they

743
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,559
didn't want a red army soldier in the

744
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,200
middle

745
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,559
middle of their city which i think is

746
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,960
very understandable um

747
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,000
however fake news

748
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,840
immediately began to spread as they did

749
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,399
this with russian news reports claiming

750
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,480
the statue and soviet war graves were

751
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,320
being destroyed

752
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,480
ultimately even though this was

753
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,919
completely fake

754
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,080
this resulted in two nights of riots and

755
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,880
looting 156 people were injured

756
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,279
one person died and a thousand people

757
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,720
were detained

758
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,120
and at the exact same time that all this

759
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,039
was going on

760
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,720
there was a denial of service attack

761
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
hitting banks media outlets

762
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,760
and the government in estonia

763
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,840
people were unable to get um cash out of

764
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,240
atms

765
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,840
they were unable to use online banking

766
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,760
the government employees were unable to

767
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,919
communicate through email and newspapers

768
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,600
and broadcasters couldn't deliver the

769
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,559
news

770
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,480
so imagine this you have a bunch of fake

771
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,880
um information being spread through

772
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,240
russian news reports

773
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,559
and the newspapers can't even report in

774
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,360
estonia

775
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,640
whether it's true or not you have all of

776
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,039
this

777
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,679
rioting and looting and injury and

778
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:58,880
government employees

779
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,520
like law enforcement can't communicate

780
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,960
through email

781
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,480
and then of course you have a lot of

782
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,399
people who may just be trying to get

783
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,360
home

784
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,440
and they can't even take out money from

785
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,200
atms

786
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,480
so this is an example of a multi-faceted

787
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,360
attack

788
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,320
that can cause a lot more chaos and a

789
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,919
lot more confusion

790
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,880
that can very easily lead to death and

791
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,120
did

792
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,000
to me this quote is really important

793
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,039
because it really

794
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,440
highlights how cyber aggression

795
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,960
can really create a lot of confusion but

796
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,120
you have a very hard time attributing it

797
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,000
to a specific

798
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,279
group and it stays below that level of

799
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:43,520
an

800
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,960
armed attack so the actual response that

801
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,480
you're able to give to this type of

802
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,120
attack

803
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,440
becomes muddy very quickly

804
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,360
next i want to talk about attacks on the

805
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,960
electric grid

806
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,520
and when we're thinking about this i

807
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,960
want to give an example

808
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,679
of from 2003 in the united states and

809
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,240
canada

810
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
where a four-day power outage left at

811
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,960
least a hundred people dead

812
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,120
now this is horrifying for obvious

813
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,240
reasons but

814
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,279
imagine an attack a cyber attack

815
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,360
perpetrated in this way

816
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,679
and the potential to not only leaving

817
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,880
people dead

818
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,520
but to also making people very

819
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,640
suspicious

820
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,840
as to why that happened if

821
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,720
you have a power outage on election day

822
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,919
you're much likely

823
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,640
going to more you're more likely to be

824
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,240
worried about what's in your fridge

825
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,279
going bad

826
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,840
than you are to be going to vote you're

827
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,039
going to be more worried about your

828
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:43,760
parents

829
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,320
and your siblings and anyone in your

830
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,480
life perhaps your children

831
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,000
you're going to be worried about their

832
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,320
safety over

833
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,200
actually going to vote these are

834
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,480
examples of things that really make

835
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,000
people's priorities shift

836
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,960
and i also want to talk about transit

837
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,720
because this one is particularly

838
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,320
important we see this in the united

839
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,360
states a lot

840
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,519
whether it's to cause voter suppression

841
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,840
or not if people don't have a way to get

842
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,960
to the polls

843
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,399
then they're not going to be able to go

844
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,399
vote

845
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,519
so a great example of this is 2016 where

846
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,360
san francisco's transit system was

847
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,440
infected with ransomware

848
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,679
imagine you have your typical day of

849
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,760
going to work

850
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,679
i know that i would take the train in um

851
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,279
it's a couple of stops it's maybe a half

852
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,039
an hour train ride

853
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,760
and then i work all day say that i'm

854
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,799
thinking about voting

855
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,399
after my work day i might take my lunch

856
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,279
break

857
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,039
scroll through twitter maybe see some

858
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,640
disinformation

859
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,320
and then close out my workday go

860
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,039
try to get on the train to go home and

861
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:53,840
go to the

862
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,600
my polling place and find out that the

863
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,679
train has been hit with ransomware

864
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,559
and isn't going anywhere now at this

865
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,440
point

866
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,039
most people are going to be frustrated

867
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,240
and they're just going to want to get

868
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,320
home they've had a long day of work

869
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,720
they're going to be much less concerned

870
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,399
with going to vote and much more

871
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,480
concerned with having to pay for an uber

872
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,919
instead of just being able to take the

873
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,279
train home

874
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,880
these are situations that we need to

875
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,559
think about when we're thinking about

876
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,080
making sure

877
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,480
that people can get to the polls safely

878
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,200
and quickly

879
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
so we can see that all of these attacks

880
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,960
really showcase

881
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,600
across all the different layers both the

882
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,320
information

883
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,039
in infrastructure and ethos layers but

884
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,440
also

885
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,320
each layer of the pyramid itself and you

886
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,600
can think about the fact that these are

887
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:39,919
just

888
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,200
examples that are one facet

889
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,440
but imagine if you combined an attack

890
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,799
across all three

891
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,640
for example infrastructure information

892
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,880
and ethos if you targeted the belief

893
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,440
system

894
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,760
at the same time you're targeting

895
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,559
people's

896
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,279
personal and family health this is when

897
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:57,679
things

898
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,840
start to get more complex and start to

899
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,120
get much more dangerous

900
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,679
so let's use this information to dive

901
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,600
back into the defender perspective

902
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,519
and think about how we can use this to

903
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,200
really protect our elections

904
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,480
so where does this leave us let's take a

905
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:16,799
look

906
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,760
at where we started a very narrow

907
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,840
definition of election security

908
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,000
that's really just about counting the

909
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,720
votes about collecting the votes

910
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,919
about keeping them safe and private

911
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,559
but nothing really else around election

912
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,080
security

913
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,840
and this has left us with quotes like

914
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,679
these

915
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,519
from top top diplomats in various

916
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,880
countries

917
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,799
we'll have to confront distortions and

918
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,600
fake news stories

919
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,159
quotes from presidents talking about how

920
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,200
um

921
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,559
elections are a scam

922
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
even quotes from top congressional

923
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,399
democrats talking about how we are going

924
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,919
to have to

925
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,200
deal with amplified disinformation

926
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,440
which these are not necessarily bad

927
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,559
quotes

928
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,000
it's just important to note that they

929
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,399
don't offer solutions

930
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,719
they don't give us ways to combat this

931
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,320
or to work against it they're just

932
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,560
stating the problem without a solution

933
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,040
and this is where the importance lies

934
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,879
about having a more comprehensive

935
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,599
definition because if we don't define

936
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,440
what we're trying to fight against

937
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,040
we can't give people solutions

938
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,079
so where should we be going

939
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,879
in my view and i hope that you share

940
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,399
this after this presentation

941
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,560
we need a more comprehensive version of

942
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,839
election security that

943
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,639
incorporates other elements besides that

944
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,440
core base

945
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,480
of collecting and counting the votes

946
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,079
this includes the ones that we've talked

947
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,918
about today like communication

948
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,560
and social media and transit but it also

949
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,599
includes others

950
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,599
there are lots of forms of critical

951
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,359
infrastructure that need to be

952
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,320
considered

953
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,079
when we are looking to make sure our

954
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,720
elections are safe and in order to

955
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,000
understand the full

956
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,079
scope of that i want you to really think

957
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,560
about what your election day looks like

958
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,800
do you vote before work do you mail in

959
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,920
your ballot

960
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,560
are you on twitter how do modern events

961
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,000
change the way that you approach

962
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,040
voting and you approach your elections

963
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,720
and then i want you to take that

964
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,359
information and think about how you

965
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,800
would attack

966
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,040
how would you attack your election day

967
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,240
how would you attack

968
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,119
your um friends election day or your

969
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,560
parents election day

970
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,480
what could you do to target each one of

971
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,839
these layers

972
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,560
i want you to take that information and

973
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
use it to understand

974
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,440
and figure out how you can actually

975
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,800
defend

976
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,040
what you can do to protect democracy to

977
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,040
protect each of these layers

978
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,880
what other layers are missing what are

979
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,720
we not thinking about when it comes to

980
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,839
election security

981
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,359
that we really should be and before

982
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,520
we go i want to make sure that we talk

983
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,359
about

984
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,359
and i give you some thoughts on what we

985
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,880
can really do to protect

986
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,760
democracy because i think it's very

987
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,480
important

988
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,560
and so i specifically want to note a

989
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,680
couple of core things

990
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,960
the first being secure your systems

991
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,240
whether as an individual or as a

992
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:18,960
business

993
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,160
or as a person in government

994
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,040
just do your best to make sure that your

995
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,040
systems are secure

996
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,160
this is critical at all levels because

997
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,880
as we see

998
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,880
these attacks are not just targeting the

999
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,079
government

1000
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,440
they're targeting all of us so really

1001
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,000
work

1002
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,640
to do your best to secure your systems

1003
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,800
to protect your private information

1004
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,160
and to make sure that things are more

1005
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,880
safe the second which i highly recommend

1006
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,680
is if you are in a position to work with

1007
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,960
the government

1008
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,680
i am personally not in government i am

1009
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,240
at a

1010
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,920
um private company however

1011
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,040
i am part of a an organization called

1012
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,760
infraguard

1013
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,920
which is a public-private partnership

1014
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,359
with the government

1015
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,960
where we can have um communication back

1016
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,680
and forth

1017
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,119
that aids both of us and

1018
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,280
in the event of a cyber attack you need

1019
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,880
to have that open channel of

1020
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,760
communication

1021
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,440
already or you're gonna have a lot to do

1022
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,839
if you go into election day

1023
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,800
without an open flow of communication

1024
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,560
without the email address that you know

1025
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,359
you need to contact if something happens

1026
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,640
you're going to spend a lot of time

1027
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,240
running around trying to figure out who

1028
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,839
the right person is to talk to and how

1029
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,040
to get to them

1030
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,480
as opposed to just being able to

1031
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,400
communicate the problem immediately and

1032
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,920
effectively

1033
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,440
and that's what we're really looking to

1034
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,599
achieve is to build the processes that

1035
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,560
we need

1036
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,119
to secure our elections and the last

1037
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,079
thing that i will

1038
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,240
really push for everyone is to just

1039
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,920
fight this information

1040
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,560
it's very challenging i know that it's

1041
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,640
very easy to retweet something that you

1042
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,520
believe in

1043
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,640
because it strikes an emotional cord

1044
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,560
but at the end of the day we all need to

1045
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,720
do our part to really focus

1046
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,760
on defense and to think about how we can

1047
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,560
contribute to fighting disinformation

1048
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,040
whether it's online or in person

1049
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,280
if you know someone that spreads a lot

1050
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,480
of disinformation

1051
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,119
try to recognize that this is a marathon

1052
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,320
not a sprint

1053
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,000
you're not going to convince this person

1054
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,760
right away that they should stop sharing

1055
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,440
this type of information

1056
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,640
but if you are there as a reliable and

1057
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,920
trusted resource

1058
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,720
on the truth not there to shame them

1059
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,280
then

1060
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
things will get better they will start

1061
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,440
to come about and understand

1062
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,280
the different perspective on this and

1063
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,960
that's the best thing that you can do

1064
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,520
is just to be there as someone who they

1065
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,400
can trust

1066
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
who they can look up to who they can

1067
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,839
communicate with about the things that

1068
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,799
they're seeing online

1069
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,480
