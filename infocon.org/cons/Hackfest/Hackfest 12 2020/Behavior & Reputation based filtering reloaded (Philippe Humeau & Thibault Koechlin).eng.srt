1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,040
great

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,759
well thank you and uh hello everyone uh

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,760
very very happy to be there with you

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,799
today my name is philip hello my name is

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:13,920
tibo

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,160
and we'd like to introduce our new

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,880
software uh which is called krautsec

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,920
it's also about data privacy somehow and

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,720
uh

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,880
and i think it nicely connects with the

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,880
previous presentation so

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,279
without further ado let's go let's dive

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,320
into it

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,160
so aha yep

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,440
yep so you see we we are security

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,800
professionals with tibo for

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,760
like two one or two decades already and

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,480
um

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,719
we we have tried to analyze what

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,000
happened to those uh

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,760
people that get hacked you know and even

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,120
the biggest company get hacked like

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,680
those

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,000
those logos you know them all and they

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,719
got hacked

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,199
big time uh they lost record they lost

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,559
money they lost you know pretty much

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,079
anything you want

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,399
and they have one thing in common they

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,559
have close to unlimited budget

31
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,959
you know and they have vast teams they

32
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,799
have sick ups devops they have like

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,920
appliances

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,720
licenses they have like compliances

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,280
every year penetration testing

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,280
whatever you want they have it right if

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,360
they don't have it then nobody has

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,840
i mean we cannot expect jpmorgan to be

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,439
missing on budget or something like this

40
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,479
so

41
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,720
nevertheless it got hacked so what's

42
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
wrong i mean even the best team in the

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,400
world could be defeated

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,720
um proof it's not just a problem of mean

45
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,520
actually they're

46
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,960
they're they're facing a problem that

47
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,720
nobody really can solve

48
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,680
so the problem is about time say you

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,280
have an application that's got a

50
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,640
vulnerability

51
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,159
you will have to wait for the patch

52
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,240
right and then when the patch is out you

53
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,759
will have to do to wait for it to be

54
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,200
deployed on your machine

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,399
so between the moment where the

56
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,560
vulnerability is at large and the moment

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
where you are patched against it

58
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,280
it could take like weeks so time is

59
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,960
always on the side of the intruder you

60
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,840
know

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,640
and then there are the unfiltered access

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,159
you know unfiltered access are

63
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,159
everything that is just going through

64
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,240
your firewall without any further check

65
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,280
for example like mail dns

66
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
i don't know applications web

67
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,360
connections and so on

68
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,200
they are just not filtered you cannot

69
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,280
say i just want to accept those ips and

70
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,120
not those ips so basically

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
most of what's at risk is just not

72
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,959
filtered it's great i mean

73
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,360
the firewall is basically a teapot

74
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,720
boiler right

75
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,599
um and then the parameters the parameter

76
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:29,920
is

77
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,160
it's a big question nowadays i mean with

78
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,959
shadow i.t

79
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,239
cloud sas and the crisis that struck us

80
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,480
um people are connecting with vpns from

81
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,599
home for example

82
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,519
and they are bringing all the zoo that

83
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,040
have who their home like

84
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
their home appliances their playstation

85
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
their android devices and all

86
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,000
at work more or less so yeah there are

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,599
things you can do but most of the

88
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,160
companies just don't know how to do it

89
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,400
and so that there is no more perimeter

90
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,280
as such and

91
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,480
they are all interconnected and last but

92
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,280
not least

93
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,360
the the money uh there's a money issue

94
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,280
here because the resources that the

95
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,959
hacker is involving

96
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,360
is something like his time stolen

97
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,480
servers

98
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,519
and a bit of open source tools right so

99
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,680
it doesn't cost you much if anything at

100
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,720
all

101
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,480
whereas you are defending with your

102
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,920
money with uh you know

103
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,720
sec ups teams with a lot of licenses and

104
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,519
things like this

105
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,480
so it's quite critical that you can um

106
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,360
that you can

107
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
um assess the ratio it's like one to a

108
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,440
thousand

109
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,720
you invest in southern and they're

110
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,040
investing one dollar in in attacking you

111
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,319
so moreover this parameter thing

112
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,400
there is no more castle strategy right

113
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,239
back in the 80s you could like

114
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,720
put everything in the same place uh put

115
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,799
a big wall around it and call it a day

116
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,200
right

117
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,959
you could say everything is inside the

118
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,879
castle is protected that's super i'm

119
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,920
super happy

120
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,080
but nowadays every every device is every

121
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,200
i set as to defend himself uh

122
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,120
alone you know so what we want to do is

123
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
teach him aikido somehow

124
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
and what we thought was steve is like

125
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,799
what is the universal language

126
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,200
across all the generation of devices

127
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,000
right

128
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,560
even for the one that are 40 years old

129
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,478
up to the most recent building edge one

130
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,519
like your 5g

131
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,000
phone or watch they all have one point

132
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,959
in common

133
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,680
http this is all and only point across

134
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,160
40 years of it industry right

135
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,400
so we know that if we want to have a

136
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,080
universal solution it has to leverage

137
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
http somehow

138
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,240
so we thought okay let's go with this

139
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
constraint

140
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,440
go to the paperboard and try start

141
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,560
drafting something

142
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,680
that could help people right and we

143
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,400
decided that

144
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,320
ip reputation needed a second go a

145
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,600
second you know look

146
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,280
on it because it was a success partially

147
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,199
if you ask me for example spam house has

148
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,479
been a success right

149
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,600
it's blocking spam and it's it's it's

150
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,639
pretty efficient at it

151
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,400
even though people are complaining that

152
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,160
they have to defend themselves and

153
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,320
the process are long and obvious are

154
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,919
pain in the ass and so on but

155
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,440
mostly it worked but the other one

156
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,280
didn't work much why because it's always

157
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,160
outdated

158
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,240
it's always two or three months old

159
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,400
signature you get inside so

160
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
nothing natural but ips i mean you get

161
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
inside so it's not really relevant

162
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,039
right because the ips are rotating on a

163
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,880
daily basis if not an hourly basis

164
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,520
sometimes

165
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,759
if you if you rent servers from amazon

166
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,280
you're going to get the ip that was used

167
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,240
by someone

168
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,520
hours ago sometimes so

169
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,680
we needed something else we need to do a

170
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,280
crowd reputation system

171
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,960
a cloud-based reputation system that

172
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,479
would be so wide and

173
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,639
so large that it could be real time

174
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,919
nearly you know that

175
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,919
if anything would happen we could update

176
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,440
in real-time signatures

177
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,400
so we were up to a new system and we

178
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,840
decided to give it a go what do you

179
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,160
think

180
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,759
about yes so yes

181
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,880
the idea behind cloud security is not uh

182
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,120
if you take apart the fact of sharing

183
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,960
information is not so innovative one

184
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,000
reusing concepts that have been seen and

185
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
implemented successfully by solutions

186
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,919
such as fail to ban so here's the idea

187
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:06,319
that

188
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,560
you can collect some data it can be for

189
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,800
example workflows but it can be moreover

190
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
any kind of stream of information so it

191
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,840
can be

192
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
for example if you are using aws it can

193
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,759
be cloud shell and so on

194
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,720
this logs there will be normalized and

195
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,639
enriched when we speak about enrichment

196
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,680
it can be things

197
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
as simple as geo-localization

198
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,800
information

199
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,240
because it might help you to take some

200
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,319
decisions but it might be as well

201
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,680
enrichment against your

202
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
own information system or against your

203
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,520
own straight intel information

204
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,680
once those logs have been normalized and

205
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,120
enriched you can match them again

206
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,680
scenario and this is already where the

207
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,479
community aspect will take place because

208
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,360
we have a hub

209
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,800
where people can share and find

210
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,720
scenarios that are relevant

211
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
to their technical stack or to their

212
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,639
business needs

213
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,400
those scenarios are in the form of

214
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,840
simple eml files

215
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,880
and those ml files

216
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,319
they will be able to describe a scenario

217
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,840
to detect an attack

218
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,000
where things start changing is that we

219
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,319
do believe past on our past experiences

220
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:08,880
that

221
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,960
remediation will really depend from one

222
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,800
population to another for example if you

223
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,120
ask

224
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,199
system administrator or people fighting

225
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,160
spam

226
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,319
banning ips might be okay but if you are

227
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,800
speaking to people doing e-commerce

228
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
banning user which is a potential

229
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,800
customer might be something that is

230
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,720
very frightening for them so we do

231
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,639
believe that the remediation should be

232
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,720
free to decide on the user hand and

233
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,080
sometimes you want to ban users

234
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,039
sometimes you want to

235
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,680
enforce uh for example captcha or

236
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,039
javascript challenges

237
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,120
or even sometime instead of trying to

238
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,560
finish results you want to

239
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,160
protect the asset by for example

240
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,400
enforcing multi-factor authentication

241
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,039
and last but not least and this is one

242
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,800
of the main innovative points

243
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,039
of the solution is that the information

244
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,240
is shared we

245
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,360
do know that security and privacy are

246
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,639
too constant so

247
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,319
the only information that he shared is

248
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,840
with the meta information about the

249
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,639
attack whenever you block an ip

250
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,479
you are going to share the ips that you

251
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,240
blocked the scenario for which you

252
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
blocked it and the timestamp at which

253
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,720
you arrived

254
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,879
and once this signal has been shared

255
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,720
the system is going to share back with

256
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,400
everybody a list

257
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,199
of a block list of ips that are highly

258
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,879
susceptible of attacking your own

259
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,319
servers because we have seen them

260
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:26,960
attacking

261
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,240
similar technical stacks

262
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
so somehow this is why we want to mix

263
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,919
the behavior part which is

264
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,760
the local capacity of the open source

265
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,360
software we are speaking about

266
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,120
and the reputation which is done on a

267
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,719
much more central point of view

268
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,200
yeah we could add here that you know

269
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,920
given our past in a hosting environment

270
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,760
and high security hosting environments

271
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,880
we have made this for devops right we

272
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
asked the cops but we made it for devops

273
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,240
so that it's easily

274
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,959
uh usable in any context you have it

275
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:01,920
could be home

276
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,680
simply you know on your machine to

277
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,080
protect yourself in containers

278
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,920
anywhere you want it's not supposed to

279
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,760
be complicated neither to install

280
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,760
nor to uh maintain over time

281
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,800
so we took two ideas behind that that we

282
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,399
wanted to stitch together you probably

283
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,600
know about fail to ban right

284
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,160
this tool has been around for 16 years

285
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,200
and um

286
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,680
it did actually a great job it showed us

287
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,240
a way

288
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,880
in terms of behavior we want to detect

289
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,240
behavior and we want to block the

290
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,000
nefarious behaviors

291
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,160
now we wanted to stitch this with

292
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,399
another concept that is i use the ipdb

293
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,760
or spam house or you know

294
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,720
the reputation system having both uh

295
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,760
reputation

296
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,440
and uh behavior system we probably cover

297
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,720
a lot of glitches and holes that

298
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,880
each of those concepts had on their own

299
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,120
yes and so when we say that we really

300
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,440
look uh up to phaeton we as all

301
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
in spread of what we felt was a

302
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,200
limitation of faith to ban mostly to

303
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,040
reflex the changes that happened since

304
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,920
then

305
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,600
so first of all we want to really

306
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,519
decouple the detection

307
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,000
and the remediation nowadays with modern

308
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,600
architectures it seems

309
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,760
it doesn't seem too realistic to want to

310
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
detect and block at the same place

311
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
your application is partly on premises

312
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,200
some things that are using puberty

313
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,760
clouds

314
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,480
some parts that are even outsourced to

315
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,959
other

316
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,720
services so you really need to be able

317
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,560
to detect here but block there for

318
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
example if you have a web application

319
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,440
you might want to block or detect sorry

320
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,920
on your

321
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,680
log servers but you will want to block

322
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,959
the attacker

323
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,560
the highest you can for example at the

324
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,640
cdn level

325
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,720
then one of the usual friction zone

326
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,040
between operation people and security

327
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,399
people might be the lack of

328
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,120
observability of some security solutions

329
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,680
so you know the famous black box aspect

330
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,760
here we took care very early to

331
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,920
implement strong observability within

332
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,279
the software for example by

333
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,240
instrumenting it

334
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,360
very early with prometheus which is a

335
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,120
kind of technology that speaks more to

336
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,640
the admin people

337
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,200
and as we are strongly committed to the

338
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,399
community aspect

339
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,120
being by the aspect of them or even the

340
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
software licenses that we choose such as

341
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,760
mit which is very permissive we really

342
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,279
hope that being able to

343
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,320
build and bring all together a community

344
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,120
that will help each other and last but

345
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,399
not least

346
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,560
while for example a usual defense

347
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,959
software we focus on the ip

348
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,519
layer we do believe that it's less and

349
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,040
less true and it will become less

350
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,880
relevant as what we think such as

351
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,279
ipv6 so we really want to have a

352
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,440
multi-layer aware software because

353
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,760
sometimes instead of punishing origin

354
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,839
you might want to protect the target so

355
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,519
instead of banning an ips that is doing

356
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,200
a brute force you might want to enforce

357
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,920
mfa

358
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,480
on the user that is being targeted and

359
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,200
all this

360
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,320
are very strongly and highly modular

361
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,880
system

362
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,920
with a modern and simple grammar we do

363
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,600
believe it will allow us to address a

364
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,800
lot of the common issues

365
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,480
so for example when we pick speak about

366
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,000
the behavioral enzyme which is

367
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,160
a part that is a local software itself

368
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,000
of course you can address some of the

369
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
usual

370
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
pain or noise that you will see on the

371
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,800
internet such as

372
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
credential brute forcing and so on

373
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,000
however a strong

374
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,800
grammar will as well allow to address

375
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,120
rather complex scenarios and detect

376
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,360
more complex attacks as well so for

377
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,959
example it can be as well

378
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,279
exploitation of web vulnerabilities

379
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,639
vulnerability scans

380
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,440
and not only the simple repeating

381
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,639
attacks

382
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,440
plus as well if you take some kind of

383
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,120
threats they are very hard to fight on

384
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,720
your very own for example if we take

385
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,000
credential surfing

386
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
credential surfing is a practice that

387
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,680
whenever there's a dump of logins and

388
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,040
passwords that are published on the

389
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,920
internet

390
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,079
some people are going to try those on

391
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,320
every website they can find

392
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
it being it can be an e-commerce website

393
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,240
dating website email website

394
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,040
whatever so these attacks are very

395
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,440
sporadic and they are very short-lived

396
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,839
so even if you have a team and two and

397
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,760
you start to try to detect them by the

398
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,240
time

399
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,079
you detect the attack that is going on

400
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,519
and you decide to block it

401
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,040
the attacker will already have finished

402
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,959
trying his few hundreds of passwords

403
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,600
and we'll move to the next one however

404
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,480
if we put

405
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,760
into place or crowd aspects

406
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,519
he might be able to attack one two or

407
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,959
three users but then they're all going

408
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,040
to automatically report

409
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,480
that they've been seeing credential

410
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,560
staffing from this specific ip

411
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,320
and then the information is going to be

412
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,720
shared amongst all the participants

413
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,959
and then they can preemptively block

414
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,399
this ip

415
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,560
in strongly very strongly increasing the

416
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,160
cost for the attacker to be able to

417
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,519
perform such attack

418
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,519
so this is one example of the kind of

419
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,440
scenarios that we do believe the crowded

420
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,079
aspect

421
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,639
crowdsourced aspect sorry will help to

422
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,440
fight with

423
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,519
along with classical things that a

424
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,440
powerful grammar allows to deal with

425
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,240
yeah and you know regarding this ip

426
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,839
reputation system

427
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,040
um what we want to have is a huge scale

428
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,920
because the scale

429
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,160
plays a major role in the data freshness

430
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,560
as soon as your detection network is big

431
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,360
enough

432
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,600
you don't really need to keep any ip on

433
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,639
the long term

434
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,519
because if any ip is doing crap at no

435
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,199
given moment in time

436
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,600
um and then it gets cleaned by the

437
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,639
administrator

438
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,240
uh you should remove it as soon as you

439
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,320
can right so

440
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,880
what we look at is a huge detection a

441
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,480
huge collection network

442
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,240
which will allow us to have a very

443
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,600
dynamic database

444
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,959
it's not really about the database it

445
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,120
says it's about really the the

446
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,279
flexibility and actually the accuracy of

447
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,720
the network in real time

448
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,480
so it's highly curated we'll explain you

449
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,720
how because it's not enough to just

450
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,440
explain its security things system you

451
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,600
will want to know why

452
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,519
and uh it allows you to have a

453
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,720
tailor-made list

454
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,639
for anyone and everyone so that you

455
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,000
don't have to fight

456
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,279
uh yourself with a complicated uh uh

457
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,560
list system you can have just your stick

458
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,959
your list uh of ip that is dangerous to

459
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:11,920
your

460
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,160
technological footprint and it's appear

461
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,360
first so meaning

462
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,079
you would be able to query the api

463
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,760
wherever you are whenever you are in

464
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,040
whatever you are

465
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,360
so say if you use for example an iot

466
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,560
device

467
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,959
that is pretty dumb and has very few cpu

468
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,000
capabilities

469
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,920
meaning it cannot be smart cannot make

470
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,360
any um

471
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,320
complicated treatment to allow or block

472
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,040
an ip

473
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,759
uh inbound so what you can do there is

474
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,240
just like

475
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,399
one http query you know this is what we

476
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,600
told you before it's

477
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,279
we want to have a universal solution and

478
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,800
the solution should hold

479
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,120
in just one http query super small and

480
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,000
super fast

481
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,160
and that any iot for example device can

482
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,399
do it any device at all can do it

483
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,519
yep sorry that's a glitch maybe we'll

484
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,880
have a little demo

485
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,120
to explain you how it works right yeah

486
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,720
sure

487
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,759
thank you so this is a recorded demo

488
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,079
so here what we are going to see is that

489
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,120
we are going to

490
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,279
showcase the setup of coretech on a very

491
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,800
classical website so

492
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,560
i'm downloading it and we are going to

493
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
use a wizard to go through the

494
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,519
installation

495
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,199
the idea of the wizard is to really

496
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,959
lower the technical barrier for people

497
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,720
to set up

498
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
so this is a very classical linux server

499
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,639
as we'll see with the web server mysql

500
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,079
database and ssh

501
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,399
the wizard here is detecting the value

502
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,519
services that are

503
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,680
deployed and allows a user to choose a

504
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,120
services he wants to

505
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,759
monitor and identify the associated log

506
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,000
files for each of the services

507
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,040
once this has been done the user can

508
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,880
choose

509
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,639
a list of sorry

510
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,240
yeah you want to close it right just

511
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
click ok

512
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,000
i'm going to so sorry so we are

513
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,519
downloading the reason we are going to

514
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,480
go through the

515
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,800
the wizard so with that so he is really

516
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,720
here to assist the user in the setup

517
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,839
to lower us a technical barrier thanks

518
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,439
so here it's exposing the user with the

519
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,079
value services that are present

520
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,959
and finding the associated lock files

521
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,480
and then as we are going to

522
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,400
see it's going to suggest a user with

523
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,599
various collections

524
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,439
what we call a collection is a current

525
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,359
and symbol of configuration that

526
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,439
aims that helps you to protect a given

527
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,640
technical stack

528
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,120
so here for example we can see for ssh

529
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,039
it will be brute force protection for

530
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,679
while for nginx it might be most

531
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,679
more generic http scenarios and for

532
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,520
mysql it's going to be

533
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,120
similar things such as brute force

534
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,440
protection from the user point of view

535
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
this configuration of the detection part

536
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,200
is now over

537
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,679
so while it's insane in the background

538
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,280
you are going to see that it's going to

539
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
register to the central api

540
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,600
so that it can already start to be fed

541
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,760
reputation is from the central system

542
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,520
deploy some whitelist to avoid binding

543
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,240
your

544
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,960
private ip's address and as all it

545
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,120
reminds you as we explained earlier

546
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,559
that crotech is really in charge of the

547
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,799
detection while the banter in charge of

548
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,640
the remediation and we're going to see

549
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
later

550
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,840
how do we get to the proper time stamp

551
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,880
by the way

552
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,840
how there is okay

553
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,080
sorry just a little glitch yes we go on

554
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:57,280
the demonstr issues on how to control it

555
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,880
very sorry about that but basically

556
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,039
where we were yes so the user he picked

557
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,480
the collection so

558
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,080
now we are seeing the wizard again but

559
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,840
somehow once you are done with the

560
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,039
wizards

561
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,960
setup is over from the user point of

562
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,400
view

563
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,880
and so at the end of the setup it's

564
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,679
going to

565
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,919
install whitelist to avoid binding

566
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,840
private ip addresses and it's going to

567
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
remind you that

568
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,760
the crowtech part is in charge of the

569
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,679
detection while the bouncer is in part

570
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,160
of the

571
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,160
remediation so what we're going to do

572
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,080
next is that we are going to

573
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,000
simulate some attacks using some

574
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,720
classical

575
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,240
tools

576
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,760
so here we can see that it's restringed

577
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,440
to the central ipa so it's already

578
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,720
starting to be fed

579
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,039
with some ips that might be malevolent

580
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:45,760
based on

581
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,000
your current technological stack as we

582
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,760
already told krotek what kind of

583
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,120
services

584
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,320
we want to monitor

585
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,880
so here we are keeping a look at this

586
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,160
and what we are going to do is that we

587
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,520
are going to use

588
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,280
nicto which is a rather old fashioned

589
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,720
but very typical

590
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,799
behavior of a web application with the

591
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,000
scanner and

592
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,080
if we look at the logs we can see that

593
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,280
my ip is getting

594
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,559
code for various attacks such as coming

595
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,880
with a known by user agent performing hp

596
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,120
http probing which is trying to access a

597
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,799
lot of files that doesn't exist

598
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,799
trying to call non-static files trying

599
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,480
to access nct files

600
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,320
or doing past traversal probing and so

601
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,840
on

602
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,320
so if we check uh from cloudtech point

603
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
of view this ips which is myp

604
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
should be banned for a few hours because

605
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,679
of the default policy

606
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,840
and i can see history of the various

607
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,000
alerts that were triggered by the ipr

608
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,840
that can be seen on my system

609
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,480
we can as well inspect a specific alert

610
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,080
here we are going to check for example

611
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,559
the

612
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,640
one over the sensitivity files to see

613
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,320
which kind of files did the scanner try

614
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,879
to access

615
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,480
however if we go back from the attacker

616
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,000
point of view we can see that my ip is

617
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,440
not blocked i can still access the

618
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,240
website

619
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,600
so what we are going to do is that we

620
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,440
are going here to showcase the hub

621
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,679
so the hub is just a front end of a

622
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,120
various

623
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,960
repositories and we are going to find a

624
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,400
bouncer that is relevant to our

625
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,679
technical stack

626
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,360
here we are going to use the nginx

627
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,120
bouncer as it will be

628
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,840
more speaking for the demo

629
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,440
so we are going to download it on the

630
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,000
machine

631
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,120
and to be able to install it at the back

632
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,039
the idea is that all the bouncers are

633
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,720
very simple implementation as

634
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,360
writing a bouncer is no more than doing

635
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,840
a simple hp race query to a local

636
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,720
daemon and here we are leveraging the

637
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,480
power of your integration with it

638
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,159
within nginx to provide this kind of

639
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,919
feature and so now if i go back from my

640
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,120
attacker point of view

641
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
as i install the bouncer we can see that

642
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,200
i am blocked so what i'm going to do is

643
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,280
that for the further steps of the demo

644
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,760
i'm going to unbind myself before

645
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
continuing

646
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,520
so i'm going to unban my ip and now what

647
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,960
we're going to showcase

648
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,080
is that for example um

649
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,840
i can of course access again my machine

650
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,880
and on my system i have configured a

651
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,799
linux firewall so that it logs all

652
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,840
established or

653
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,600
attempted to be established connection

654
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,200
we are going to use this example to

655
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,880
showcase again the hub

656
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,400
but this time we are not going to look

657
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,919
at the bouncers but rather the

658
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:30,720
collections

659
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,400
we are going to use the epitable

660
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
collection the epitable collection

661
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,200
consists of

662
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,960
a parser for the logs generated by

663
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280
epitables and a scenario to detect port

664
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,400
scans

665
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,480
so as you will see to install the

666
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,240
connection of the system i simply have

667
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,880
to

668
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,799
pass this command line as crowtech

669
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,880
managed itself it's a configuration

670
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,600
i'm going to reload as well the service

671
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,039
as indicated

672
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,280
we're going to keep an eye on the on the

673
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,159
logs again

674
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,679
but however if now i do use for example

675
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,559
nmap to

676
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,440
perform a part scan on my machine as

677
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,760
i've

678
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,000
installed the collection and passes that

679
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,679
will allow to deal with this

680
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,440
we are going to see here my p being

681
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,799
blocked again but

682
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:23,840
this time for performing poor scan

683
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,559
and again of course i am a block from

684
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,840
accessing my web server again

685
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,440
observability is a very recurrent topic

686
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,159
so here

687
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,240
a quartet comes out of the box with the

688
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,159
ability to deploy dashboard we are using

689
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,240
the open source software metabase to do

690
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,720
so

691
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,640
metabolize is a bit for those of you

692
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,880
that don't know like a graphene or such

693
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,640
except that it can work with a very

694
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,720
later database it's going to work on the

695
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,600
default

696
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,000
sqlite database that is generated and

697
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,440
maintained

698
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:05,840
by crotech

699
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,039
so once the dashboard deploy is deployed

700
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,640
it's going to be able to

701
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,799
give us visibility on all the past

702
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,480
activities that were detected on the

703
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,159
machine and that krotzek took

704
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,720
action again

705
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,600
at the back the dashboard deployment is

706
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,919
simply firing a docker container with a

707
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,600
metabase software that is configured

708
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,760
automatically to

709
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,080
point to the sql database so i'm going

710
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,840
to access right now

711
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,480
to the metabase setup that we just did

712
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,080
i'm going to connect to it

713
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,919
and we'll be able to see what is going

714
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,240
on so of course here there's not much

715
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,159
activity going because we just installed

716
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,240
the software and we only simulated a few

717
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,039
attacks

718
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,840
however i will still be able to see my

719
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,480
machine

720
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,720
the bouncers that i've installed and we

721
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,480
can see various information about the

722
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,880
activity such as the geolocalization the

723
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,720
history of the attacks or the machines

724
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,279
that push

725
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,000
outlets along with the value scenario

726
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,919
that has been triggered and information

727
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,760
about the source

728
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,080
however when we speak about the force

729
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,400
positive and such

730
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,480
there's one more thing it says

731
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,640
observability so here we can see the

732
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,039
cscli allows you to see as well part of

733
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,880
the promoters metrics that are exposed

734
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
by the software so that the

735
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,640
more operation people can see exactly

736
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,000
what is going on and what is the

737
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,440
software performing giving you a live

738
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,120
view of this

739
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,200
when it speaks about false positive one

740
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,720
of the very common thing is

741
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
yes but what would have happened if i

742
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,080
had the software in the past so here

743
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,279
what we are going to do is that we are

744
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,279
going to run crowtech again some old

745
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,480
logs from

746
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,840
like my logs of 2019

747
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,240
and it's going to really pass the log

748
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,919
and analyze them and show us what would

749
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,760
have happened if i had crowdsec

750
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,840
at that time and so here when we process

751
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,679
it's going to push to the local database

752
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,679
again and we are going to see and we are

753
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,440
seeing here it's detecting attacks but

754
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,840
that happened in january 2019

755
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,480
and of course if now we go back for

756
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,360
example

757
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,640
to the metabase and we checked not the

758
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
last months but the last two years

759
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,480
we are going to see the past attacks

760
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,440
that are going to appear

761
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,600
so it's a good way for user either for

762
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
example to generate reporting to help

763
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,120
when you are doing forensics

764
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,159
or simply to test and try your scenarios

765
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,679
on pass logs to see what would have

766
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,000
happened if you had the software enabled

767
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
at that time

768
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,240
so what can not be seen during this demo

769
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,760
is that but all the components of

770
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,400
crosstak

771
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,720
crosstak itself cscli and the bouncers

772
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,080
they all communicate all together

773
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,919
through a rest api which means that

774
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,320
what we did here on a single machine

775
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,360
setup you can

776
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,679
as well do it on multiple machines with

777
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,440
a machine passing log and

778
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,840
some other machines that are doing

779
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,039
bouncers etc

780
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,400
so simply allowing you to create either

781
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,240
simple or rather complicated setup

782
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,520
okay thank you tibo um

783
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
our goal here is really to make it as

784
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,640
simple as possible

785
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,039
uh for devops and developers and

786
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:09,840
sysadmin

787
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,320
whomever they want to install the

788
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,039
software

789
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,039
and leverage it like in minutes like

790
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,200
because literally we install it in

791
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,960
minutes okay we know it by hard but if

792
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,000
it takes you five minutes

793
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,840
it's kind of worrying because really

794
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,200
it's so simple

795
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,120
soon enough we'll have divine packages

796
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,039
as well so you'll be able to install it

797
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,039
directly from your usual tools and

798
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:29,520
that's

799
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,120
that's pretty cool just it's taking a

800
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,640
bit of time you know like dbn

801
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,279
is like a slow paced distro very stable

802
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,200
very rock solid but takes time to get

803
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,080
things

804
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,679
rolling so um we talked about the hub

805
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,360
quickly the hub is really the place

806
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,720
where we live you find

807
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,559
anything that you want to install on

808
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,039
your machine or eventually where also

809
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,399
you will want to share your own

810
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,440
creations

811
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,000
say for example i'm myself i'm the ceo

812
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,840
of the company but i'm using the product

813
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,399
and i'm

814
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,520
willing to develop some few things i

815
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,440
will do tutorials on it but i want to

816
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,399
develop an

817
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,440
arp watch

818
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,320
parser and i want also to have a few

819
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,880
other

820
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,760
bouncer rolling and a port knock d port

821
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,640
knocking system

822
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,279
uh you know done so once it's done i

823
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,320
will upload them

824
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,640
to the hub and the team will review it

825
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,000
so okay uh

826
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,240
this can go to production this is safe

827
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,080
enough or this is crap you should have

828
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,919
written this in this in that way

829
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,600
they will only tell it's crap if it's me

830
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
if it's you it will say okay you have

831
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,399
progression margins or

832
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,799
you know but yeah so this is it

833
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,240
everything you could find

834
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,320
and possibly a leverage has to be in

835
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,000
this one place because it's cool for the

836
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,159
for the community you know to to find

837
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,559
everything in the same place

838
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,480
it's free okay it's free it's forever

839
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,640
free period we don't have any

840
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,919
monetization plan about this open source

841
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,640
software so you will forever benefit

842
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,279
from

843
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,600
the software the behavior software and

844
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,360
as long as you share your signal

845
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,520
the signal you're blocking you're also

846
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,360
benefiting as long as you want

847
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,840
uh and as long as we're around the scene

848
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,480
uh

849
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,200
of this be uh reputation system so both

850
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,080
are for free

851
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,480
right you could disable if you want the

852
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,279
reputation system not share anything

853
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,520
but then you would not benefit from the

854
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,120
repetition system yourself which sounds

855
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,159
pretty normal

856
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,880
the software runs under an mit license

857
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,120
it's as free as it can get you know

858
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,039
we were talking about debian earlier

859
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,480
deviant is exactly the same

860
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,440
license so you know it's really use it

861
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,480
wherever you want

862
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,600
however you want really

863
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,520
um this is the key information here

864
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,000
the bad ip is something that is

865
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,600
extremely contextual

866
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,240
it has two contexts up to us the time

867
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,919
and the technological footprint

868
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,240
the time is like as we as i told you

869
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,039
before

870
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,440
we don't want to to keep ips forever in

871
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,279
the database that doesn't make sense at

872
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:53,600
all

873
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,200
it the ips now are currency like another

874
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,000
it's switching

875
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,320
hands on daily and sometimes hourly

876
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,039
basis

877
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,440
so what i want to do as mac at maximum

878
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,320
is uh

879
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,200
clear out any iep that hasn't been

880
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,960
involved into a hack

881
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,320
or a hack attempt for the last 72 hours

882
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,240
the network is powerful and strong

883
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,159
enough and fast enough to regenerate and

884
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:16,640
detect

885
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,240
any further attempt from that ip

886
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,919
whatever happens so

887
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,600
why keep it forever why keep it for

888
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,440
three months is you know and the second

889
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:23,840
thing

890
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,240
is so because you know back on the time

891
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,039
scene sorry

892
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,200
an ip used to be good and then it was

893
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,240
compromised

894
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,919
and then it's good again it's clean by

895
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,480
its mean so the lifespan of an ip is

896
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,840
very complicated that's why we don't

897
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,559
want to keep

898
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,679
keep it for too long yes indeed and

899
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,679
when it comes about the context the

900
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,440
thing is that as he said

901
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,919
temporarily of her info of the

902
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,760
dangerousness of an ip something because

903
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,600
ip will go from good to balance

904
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,840
and so on however the compatibility

905
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,440
between a threat and your exposition

906
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,880
surface is something that is as

907
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,320
important

908
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,080
for example if i'm hosting your

909
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,240
e-commerce website running php on the

910
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,159
linux server and on the other end i have

911
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,360
my grandmas that has

912
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,679
infected windows such as having a worm

913
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,200
and that is trying to break into

914
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,720
every remote they started can find on

915
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,960
the internet first of all

916
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,799
her ip and her machine is not real

917
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,720
threat to my e-commerce website and

918
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
second of all it might she might even be

919
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,200
a very legitimate customer

920
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,120
so here's the ideas rather than

921
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,279
redistributing a huge list

922
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,480
of her ips where 90 of those are never a

923
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,240
threat to you and will never attack you

924
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,279
or even if they do

925
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,000
they won't hurt you so it is we to be

926
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,760
able to redistribute the list that our

927
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,120
tailor made

928
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,679
as we know which scenarios you are using

929
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:38,880
will be able to

930
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,120
report you specifically ips that we have

931
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,799
been with that we have seen

932
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,640
attacking similar technologies or

933
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,440
triggering several similar scenarios on

934
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,080
other peers

935
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,679
um here we will explain you a very

936
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,200
complicated very

937
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,120
very crucial part of the software

938
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,320
because you know

939
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,440
security uh software they have one major

940
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,080
weakness

941
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,960
is false positives and this is a curse

942
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,399
and a fear for everyone

943
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,480
so what we do here is we curate the

944
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,039
signals highly and a lot so that we're

945
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,720
absolutely sure that you never get a

946
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
false positive and or

947
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
or that we get poisoned you know right

948
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,559
that someone reports your ip whereas

949
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,159
there's no need for that and no reason

950
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,440
for that and then you would be banned

951
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,640
for nothing

952
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,880
so we have a consensus chamber and the

953
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,960
way it works is the following

954
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,720
we are seeing we are seeing at the trust

955
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,799
rank to our users

956
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,320
the users that are the older in the

957
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,919
system have the higher cross rank you

958
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:34,880
cannot reach

959
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,279
trust rank one before being for at least

960
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,320
six months

961
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,399
uh in the system right in the in the

962
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,760
network if you're a

963
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,880
network member with less with

964
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,320
less than this uh six months is

965
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,240
you won't be able to partake directly in

966
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,919
the consensus nevertheless

967
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,600
you'll be listened to you are

968
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,200
transferring two eventually

969
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,960
and we will listen to you but we will

970
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,799
not confirm directly or your

971
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,760
signals and i will add that not only the

972
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,600
ancient tier of the user is taking into

973
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,519
account but as all the consistency of

974
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,519
the information that he's pushing

975
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,919
the thing that we can't say poisoning

976
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,279
won't be an issue we can just make

977
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,880
poisoning as expensive and as

978
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,480
complicated as possible

979
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,159
so what we are doing is that your trust

980
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,159
rank is as well based on

981
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,320
the kind of information you report and

982
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,440
your trust rank will

983
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,840
increase for example if you are able to

984
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,760
give us some sightings that we are not

985
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,360
aware of and that will be confirmed

986
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,039
later by users with higher extra

987
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,159
strengths

988
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,240
that's why for example in our example we

989
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,159
have a trust rank 1 reporting

990
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,559
minase that it found and a trust rank 2

991
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,159
also reporting a minus

992
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,919
what happens here is like since the

993
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,600
trust rank one has validated the signal

994
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,559
by himself

995
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,000
there's no problem the trust rank two

996
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,679
will be given a bit of credit

997
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,760
for finding it and confirming it as well

998
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,399
so we will trust him a bit more right

999
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,240
and then uh say for example the truss

1000
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,840
rank one has not reported it

1001
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,080
but the threshold two did we can check

1002
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,000
the signals against our own honeypot

1003
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,880
network

1004
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,559
uh and eventually the signal will be

1005
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,080
validated as well and

1006
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,240
the threshold two will get some uh

1007
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,360
credit for that

1008
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,879
but the honeypot network serves as

1009
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,199
another purpose as well we can deploy it

1010
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,480
and expand it

1011
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,679
based on current menaces or trends say

1012
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,679
for example something just got loose

1013
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,480
yesterday

1014
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,839
on wordpress for example um

1015
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,199
and we want to be sure that we are

1016
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,199
catching it as soon as possible and as

1017
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,560
effectively as possible

1018
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,480
we can deploy a lot of machines to say i

1019
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,320
don't know how one or two hundreds

1020
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,800
on different uh environments to be sure

1021
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,960
that we also can catch a signals as soon

1022
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,918
as possible

1023
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,918
and validate what the network is

1024
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,320
bringing us as spottings

1025
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,679
um next your trust rank 1 and 2 reported

1026
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,239
something

1027
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,839
and we want to be sure that they are not

1028
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,480
killing canary the canary concept dates

1029
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,760
back from the mine time

1030
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,679
mining time you know in the coal mines

1031
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,599
the miners had canaries

1032
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,639
with them and if they would dig into

1033
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,119
a gas place a place full of gas sorry

1034
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,200
the methane would go into the mine and

1035
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,800
potentially blew it up

1036
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,440
and the canaries were there to die first

1037
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,800
because they couldn't breathe anymore

1038
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,400
and they are very allergic to methane it

1039
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,200
seems

1040
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,280
and the guys could go out before the

1041
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,400
wall thing can

1042
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,599
or risk to blow so here the concept is

1043
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,280
roughly the same what we do is we have a

1044
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,320
crowd source list

1045
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,599
of ips that should never ever get banned

1046
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,079
you know

1047
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,560
like say casper's key update for

1048
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,119
antivirus or microsoft updates or

1049
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,440
google boot or google dns or gmail

1050
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,240
whatever you know

1051
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,800
those things are reliable highly very

1052
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,079
highly reliable

1053
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,839
so if you're blacklisting them first of

1054
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,839
all you have problem and most

1055
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,560
most likely your scenario is twitchy so

1056
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,400
we would not consider you poisoning us

1057
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,280
but we'll say okay

1058
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,800
maybe this scenario using is a bit

1059
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,960
twitchy and we will not consider this

1060
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,920
point

1061
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,240
yes and last but not least i think that

1062
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,320
as a canaries as for the source code the

1063
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,079
idea here is really to make something

1064
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:56,720
that is

1065
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
transparent so this is part of a github

1066
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,480
repository as well so that

1067
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,880
legitimate actors can declare themselves

1068
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,400
and people can add for example

1069
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
very early we are working with people

1070
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,839
from the e-commerce background

1071
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,480
they are very specific kind of ips or

1072
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,560
actors that they will never ever want to

1073
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,040
see

1074
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,680
ban on their system like their psp yeah

1075
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,720
or psp or

1076
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,760
seo mechanisms yeah so

1077
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,079
the next one is you know we are not

1078
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,839
allowed to say artificial intelligence

1079
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:24,640
because

1080
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,880
i i saw some vcs and they were like okay

1081
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,640
guys you're doing cyber security you're

1082
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,839
doing sas

1083
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,079
uh you know and just put ai and

1084
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,920
blockchain and it's a bingo

1085
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,359
so we won't put any money in your

1086
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,200
company if you put ai right so

1087
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,599
we it's not ai right it's machine

1088
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,520
learning it's very very different

1089
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,359
so what we do is we are digging in our

1090
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,280
logs in our honeyput logs

1091
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,400
and it allows us to find say

1092
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,880
low noise signals right because the

1093
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,760
system itself

1094
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,800
tends to be a low frequency pass

1095
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,560
filter if you're familiar with

1096
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,800
electronic so what we want to do though

1097
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,119
is still see the very low noise signal

1098
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,560
because they are interesting to us

1099
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,720
say for example a complicated pattern

1100
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,640
could be ipa

1101
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,359
is just connecting to your port 80 to

1102
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,280
check if you have a web server running

1103
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,520
and ipb is then checking for

1104
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,920
vulnerability and ipc is exploiting it

1105
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,560
right and they come at different times

1106
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,760
from different places

1107
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,200
so how would you know that those three

1108
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,720
are related if they are really related

1109
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,599
well

1110
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,599
with the frequency analysis in the logs

1111
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,440
we could see that ipa

1112
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,520
just come usually 15 minutes right

1113
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,560
before ipb

1114
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,040
and ipb just 15 minutes before ipc for

1115
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,760
example

1116
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,079
and that would be a very low nose signal

1117
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,839
that we could not detect directly

1118
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,280
through our network

1119
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,000
but that this non-ai system would be

1120
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,440
able to catch in the logs

1121
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
and that's a very very basic example of

1122
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,200
what we're trying to achieve with it but

1123
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,560
you know so once you pass all those

1124
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,200
barriers

1125
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,359
somehow you end up in the ip reputation

1126
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,200
database congratulations you made it to

1127
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,480
the core system

1128
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,040
and the iep is blocked we see here that

1129
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,960
it could cost a tremendous lot of time

1130
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,599
and money

1131
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,119
to rig the signal system and a lot of

1132
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,320
patience as well and

1133
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,240
if you're feeding us with proper signals

1134
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,640
for months before turning rogue

1135
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,800
thank you you have the you helped us for

1136
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
months and as soon as you make a false

1137
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,520
report

1138
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,359
your trust rank will fall quite

1139
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,040
immediately so

1140
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,880
we are benefiting even eventually from

1141
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,800
this

1142
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,320
um i don't know if we have time for this

1143
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,640
one let's let's talk about this one sure

1144
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,640
so one of the early concerns that a lot

1145
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,640
of users add with the software is what

1146
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,560
kind of information are you sharing what

1147
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:32,880
about

1148
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,119
privacy and so on so what we are

1149
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,880
strongly committed to is that the only

1150
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,560
information that is shared from your

1151
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,880
system to our system we are never going

1152
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,000
to share logs

1153
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,359
the only thing that is going to be

1154
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,839
shared is that if you are using crowdsec

1155
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,839
and you use a default setup which means

1156
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,920
that you push information to the api and

1157
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,480
you get

1158
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,440
blacklist from the api whenever you are

1159
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,599
deciding to ban an ip automatically you

1160
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,960
are going to push to us

1161
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,599
the ips that you banned the scenario

1162
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,240
that you

1163
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,040
used that uh that the ip triggered and

1164
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,079
the timestamp

1165
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,480
and if your scenario is something custom

1166
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,720
or you modified one of our scenario we

1167
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,320
are not going to report it because we

1168
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,079
wouldn't know anywhere how to exploit

1169
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,359
this information

1170
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,040
and you know we have a commitment toward

1171
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,800
this open source community right

1172
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,520
so we don't want we want people to eat

1173
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,560
properly they are

1174
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,720
all experts and you know they can earn a

1175
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,560
lot of money on the market our guys

1176
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,720
so we want them to be paid properly so

1177
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
we are not uh

1178
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,920
we have to monetize something sorry

1179
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,079
about this for the very uh purists

1180
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,359
within the ranks you know with the

1181
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,520
building and stuff but it's

1182
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,760
it's just the way the world works so we

1183
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,200
will monetize something but

1184
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,599
in the fair fairest way you can think

1185
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,240
about

1186
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,320
we will never ever screw up the

1187
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,240
community everything will stay for free

1188
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,119
for the community

1189
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,359
what we monetize though is access to the

1190
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,480
apa databa

1191
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,520
api database for the companies that

1192
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,119
don't want to share anything first of

1193
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:55,599
all

1194
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,640
and also fleet features that allows us

1195
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,079
uh that allows this company to uh deploy

1196
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,920
and configure and maintain a large

1197
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,839
number of crosstalk instances

1198
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,880
from a central point um that that is for

1199
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,160
convenience

1200
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,119
um that's pretty much it with ip

1201
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,240
repetition at scale

1202
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,560
we can tackle a lot of front trust me

1203
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,560
really a lot of them every pass you see

1204
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,040
here

1205
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,599
is super super easy maybe not but really

1206
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,079
easy to tackle with the system

1207
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,920
yes um maybe tibo you want to talk

1208
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,720
quickly because

1209
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,160
we have four minutes or three minutes

1210
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,000
left yes two examples

1211
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,160
sure so i'm going to focus on the first

1212
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,520
one that i think will be the most

1213
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,400
relevant it's

1214
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,000
one of our early users they were

1215
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,240
operating some ntdos

1216
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,760
protection system and they were

1217
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,000
previously using some home ground

1218
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,240
software with fail to ban on top of it

1219
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,480
so they were you dealing with a usual

1220
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,800
you know http ddos that you can see

1221
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,040
quite often with a botnet of around

1222
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,839
seven thousand

1223
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,920
ips or machines that are hammering one

1224
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,079
website and he was able to

1225
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,680
quickly set up a krautsec and create a

1226
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,920
very custom scenario to deal with it and

1227
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,560
he was able to tackle the

1228
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,640
robotnet within less than a minute i

1229
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,240
think we do even have a blog post

1230
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,119
somewhere about it

1231
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,400
yeah sure on the website so this

1232
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,319
and another example would be more like

1233
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,920
your e-commerce related

1234
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,680
for those of you that are in this field

1235
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,359
it's a user that was uh

1236
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,200
having to deal with credit card staffing

1237
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,560
so it's someone that is

1238
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,160
getting a bunch of credit cards and

1239
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,319
using a targeted e-commerce website to

1240
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,359
validate all

1241
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,599
of those it's very expensive for him as

1242
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,000
he's having to deal with bank fees

1243
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
so here what was interesting for him is

1244
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,640
that he created the crosstalk scenarios

1245
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,920
that he's dealing directly with his

1246
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,599
applicative logs because this is the

1247
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,520
only place where he could detect that

1248
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,800
someone was actually doing some

1249
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,839
credential stuffing

1250
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,640
um and he was acting at the applicative

1251
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,040
level to block them because against some

1252
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,000
population

1253
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,280
for example if you are dealing with a

1254
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,760
massive botnet banning ips is fine

1255
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,440
if you are dealing with a potential

1256
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,359
suspicious activity but within

1257
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,000
a payment tunnel you are a lot more

1258
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,079
reticent to banning an ipad just because

1259
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,760
it might be a potential customer

1260
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,119
yep absolutely ah well we seek help on

1261
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,960
that one for timing reasons

1262
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,319
um yet you know remember it's like ipv6

1263
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:17,599
is compatible you get

1264
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,160
observability right uh down the road is

1265
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,760
stateless and decouple is made for

1266
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,880
modern architecture

1267
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,040
you can replay logs with new scenarios

1268
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,400
to see if there are anything

1269
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,560
anything is going wrong it's multi-state

1270
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,560
detection multi-layer responses

1271
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,359
you can do live api query or local cache

1272
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,760
query to avoid breaking anything

1273
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,319
that's pretty much it um we want to be

1274
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,680
the ways of files

1275
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,040
that's pretty much it if you think about

1276
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,599
it we are building in a set

1277
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,640
that is real time powered by users and

1278
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,599
made for users

1279
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,839
and that's that's what we intend to do

1280
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:50,880
within the next

1281
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,960
years you know so if you have any

1282
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,920
question i guess

1283
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,839
the time is right

1284
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,359
i don't know if we could take questions

1285
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,680
um

1286
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,119
yeah i'm i'm looking at them there's no

1287
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,640
question for a moment

1288
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,160
oh okay right right right um well when

1289
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,000
we we can say is like we have a new

1290
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,920

1293
