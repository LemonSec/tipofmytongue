1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,470
can everyone hear me okay cool so

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,000
welcome to seven Habits of Highly

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,090
Effective adversaries this is the

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,250
precursor to my upcoming talk called

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,990
seven Habits of Highly Effective

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,880
clickbait taught titles

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,170
purely kidding but before we get started

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,520
let's set the stage with some Depeche

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,189
Mode and they're all about people or

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,330
people so let's just remember that

11
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,730
adversaries are people to the this is

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,710
actually a live attempt of me attempting

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,710
OS CP unsuccessfully it happens and of

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,570
course the thoughts and opinions are not

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,219
that of any of my employer's past

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,000
present future or otherwise about me I'm

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,770
a senior security I'm sorry a senior

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,550
ascent specialist with complex 2017 der

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,930
beek on social engineering capture the

20
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,840
flag winner I've placed as part of the

21
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,910
password inspection agency second and

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,800
third place of various assets ETFs

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,469
fourth place this last year solo at

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,438
Derby con when I came up here the

25
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,299
password Inspection Agency was in second

26
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,570
place the trace lab CTF and pending two

27
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,280
other competitors I'm currently in first

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,010
four there as SC CTF so I like to

29
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,810
compete what can I say but it's all in

30
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,750
that one realm with that there's a

31
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,030
picture of the black badge but let's get

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,549
into the actual fun part in objectives

33
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,610
so with this I want I want to provide

34
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,850
you a basis to either find the way to

35
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,110
work into the offensive world or to get

36
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,520
better at being offensive and by

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,590
offensive I'm obviously meaning more of

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,290
the read operations red teaming

39
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,270
pentesting social engineering all of

40
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,240
those not necessarily passing gas in an

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,259
elevator however offensive that may be

42
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:54,210
so with this we're going to talk a bit

43
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,049
about making the transition and look at

44
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,479
the differences in philosophies and

45
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,880
mentalities for red teamers and blue

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,670
teamers and then we'll actually look at

47
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,619
the seven habits and how how we will

48
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,500
actually implement them so why this

49
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,629
presentation I've been in InfoSec for

50
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:14,040
almost ten years now

51
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,629
I started out assembling security

52
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:17,069
documentation

53
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,050
it was incredibly boring and from what I

54
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,580
hear it still is but I mean let's we can

55
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,019
get our laughs out all we want but at

56
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,370
the end of the day they have a seat at

57
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,040
the table too so it is what it is we

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,590
have to have compliance but I mean it is

59
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,870
exactly what it is

60
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,519
but over time my interests were more red

61
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,709
but my job titles didn't really

62
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:44,940
reciprocate that too much to date when I

63
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,410
was a consultant I got to do quite a bit

64
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,810
of red team stuff I got loaned to the

65
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,910
pin testing team to do social

66
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,130
engineering operations and collect some

67
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,920
assent for them from time to time that I

68
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,569
did my time as a security architect

69
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:01,280
which has spoken muted on incident calls

70
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,209
determining if we needed to notify

71
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:06,510
regulators and then now in my current

72
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,150
role I'm collecting Osen as part of a

73
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,250
project that we're trying to do some

74
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,140
stuff with risk which in turn will feed

75
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,489
into compliance but I get to look at

76
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,849
things with the offensive lens again

77
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:20,250
which is fun you know and and then

78
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,910
there's my rolls around the end of 2016

79
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,459
I started attending conferences in 2017

80
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,079
I started speaking

81
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:31,019
I got active on Twitter I'm still

82
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,069
working on OSC P I mean you just gotta

83
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:36,720
try harder rome wasn't built in a day

84
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,639
and then I've collaborated with people

85
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,920
like Adrian Sanabria on the red team

86
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,569
framework which we presented it at the

87
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:46,459
red team village this year in Las Vegas

88
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:51,180
so with that in making the transition we

89
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,889
always have to think of how do we go

90
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:55,859
from blue to red well we need to

91
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:58,040
understand the differences first and

92
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,299
something I've always heard is a broken

93
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,720
clock is Right twice a day while that's

94
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,430
not directly applicable to that it's

95
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,130
close enough because as a blue team er

96
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,169
we're expected to be right every single

97
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:14,519
time when we are not correct someone

98
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,738
gains their access they do their thing

99
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,700
we end up the target of investigative

100
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,789
journalism maybe get a Twitter mockery

101
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:27,870
getting the peanut gallery to way

102
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,730
on what the company did or did not do

103
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,440
right when they could have been doing

104
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,240
everything correct up until this one

105
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,630
point and it was just a massive failure

106
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,870
whereas as a red teamer you only have to

107
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,160
be right that one time to gain that

108
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,940
access granted there are multiple that

109
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,850
one times throughout succession of a

110
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,470
full engagement of the full attack

111
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,350
pattern but you only have to be right

112
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,229
that one time and also with with blue

113
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,810
team it they kind of have more of a team

114
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,150
mentality because you have your shift

115
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,430
work you have multiple layers of the

116
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,250
sock level one two three whatever then

117
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,990
you have your incident responders and

118
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,850
you have all of your architects and

119
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,320
whatever and ultimately that's blue team

120
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,830
that's a huge team effort and red team

121
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,780
not necessarily not saying that red

122
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,570
teamers don't participate in team

123
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,979
environments but they can be just as

124
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,740
successful as a lone wolf if they take

125
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,090
the time collect the Oh scent do the

126
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,490
attacks they don't necessarily need

127
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,100
massive architecture and because they're

128
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,750
doing things behind the scenes that are

129
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,120
not detectable like standing up say

130
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,850
phishing architecture or a server that

131
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,979
you're going to host your malware on

132
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:39,300
that's not really detectable unless

133
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,830
threat intelligence feeds pick it up so

134
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,139
you can go very lone wolf with that in

135
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,650
terms of the training perspective if you

136
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,660
can't afford sans there's really not a

137
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,070
whole lot of blue team training past

138
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,960
security plus unless you want to talk

139
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,610
about like the GRC stuff including like

140
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,240
aisaka and is c-squared stuff whereas if

141
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,210
you're on the red team side you have

142
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,160
sans and offensive security and then

143
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,360
there's a lot more training at

144
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,099
conferences for red teamers and then

145
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,169
let's just go ahead and get the the

146
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,590
whole public perception out of the way

147
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,479
and that's especially with conference

148
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,430
presentations red team talks are like

149
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,610
always considered sexy I mean blue team

150
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,220
just as sexy to me I love regular

151
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,039
expressions I mean you want me to waste

152
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,780
a weekend give me a file and say parse

153
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,750
this I will waste a whole weekend

154
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,760
parsing it and playing with it until I

155
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,800
finally fall asleep

156
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,919
but anyway you know Red Team you also

157
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,120
have your red teamers your social

158
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,430
engineers all of those and really you

159
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,139
know this is kind of to play into that

160
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:50,300
so you know this is basically just you

161
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,280
know what blue team strives to do

162
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,960
they're just trying to burst the red

163
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,110
team's bubble and as we see it's a team

164
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,349
effort this the next slide actually has

165
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:04,310
live footage of Johnny Christmas he

166
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,630
didn't know I collected it well there it

167
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,460
is this was taken at the Walmart across

168
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,110
the street from the speaker's hotel last

169
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:24,800
night exactly so so now that we see this

170
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,800
and we see how adversaries work let's

171
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,349
get into the habits so I would be remiss

172
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,060
if I gave a talk and did not mention Oh

173
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,960
sent so honestly better assent makes

174
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,699
better social engineering but it also

175
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:40,190
makes more informed pentesting red team

176
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,750
type engagements because these

177
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,210
adversaries they're taking the time to

178
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,970
understand what you're using for

179
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,650
password reset questions anyone in here

180
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,370
a fan of darknet diaries anyone listened

181
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,659
to episode 50 okay that's the that's the

182
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,070
newest episode it's the one that's got

183
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,099
the guy from the Marine Corps that was

184
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:02,599
part of the team that attacked Isis and

185
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,599
they talk a lot in that episode about

186
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,479
the amount of ascent they collected and

187
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,020
at one point they had hit a snag and it

188
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,419
was like we need to gain access to this

189
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:15,889
but it's asking what our first pet's

190
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:18,620
name was and one of the Intel analysts

191
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,090
out of nowhere was like oh I know that

192
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:25,130
it's 1515 I mean its elite for Isis

193
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,070
right and it worked so that's an example

194
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,820
of doing the O sent in advance to help

195
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,820
you later I surveyed quite a few

196
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,270
professionals that I respect in terms of

197
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,039
how much time they spend doing ascent as

198
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,990
opposed to actually attacking and the

199
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,890
numbers varied between 40 and 65 percent

200
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,380
so you have a 12-hour engagement six

201
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,720
hours of it do some o sent find out

202
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,250
because you can find out things like

203
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:52,940
operating

204
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,380
system - they use a VM how do they

205
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,510
receive their email do they filter using

206
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,070
proof point or mime cast or something

207
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,850
like that

208
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,420
do they have SPF Deak md mark are they

209
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,700
using the cloud are you going to run

210
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,740
into a situation like mike felch and get

211
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,270
your personal Google accounts locked out

212
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,390
because you're targeting their G suite

213
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,070
so these are all things that you can

214
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,670
find out via Oh sent with very little to

215
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,150
no detection capability for the person

216
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,460
so you know with that we can also find

217
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,360
out about company culture does it seem

218
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,270
like they get trained do they have a

219
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,300
whole lot of what I call number 17

220
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,920
number 17 is from a group I'm in on

221
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,420
Facebook and they came up with like

222
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,760
personality traits of people number 17

223
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,310
is the chronic oversharer

224
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,960
so do you have a lot of number 17s

225
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,040
chronically over sharing everything can

226
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,050
you find via a Google search can you

227
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,000
find at the configuration file for their

228
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,630
router or their backup to array I say

229
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,020
this because I found it both things what

230
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,090
software is in use of course you can

231
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,950
find out web server software but go look

232
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,080
at their career postings what if they're

233
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,180
using Oracle ERP version 12.2.2 and

234
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,920
there's a sequel injection vulnerability

235
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,080
and a server site request forgery

236
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,610
vulnerability couple those two things

237
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,980
together and you could pretty much bone

238
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,800
that company fairly simply know their

239
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,630
supply chain if you're gonna do social

240
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,000
engineering if they're using cloud

241
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,300
assets but they're using Azure you

242
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,550
probably don't want to spoof Amazon when

243
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,210
you call them also if Walmart is your

244
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,160
target you don't want it mention Amazon

245
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,410
whatsoever because part of their

246
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,240
agreement is you work with Walmart

247
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,030
you're not allowed to use Amazon or AWS

248
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,470
so you probably want to spoof like

249
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,790
Google or somebody else perhaps maybe

250
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,750
Azure whenever you call but and the big

251
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,890
thing is oh scent is cheap or free right

252
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,750
now I pay for three things in the Oh

253
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,850
scent world three dollars and fifty

254
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,170
cents a month for I have I been poned

255
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,900
API key I've paid for showed in for life

256
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,630
on Black Friday so later on this month

257
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,830
you're going to have the opportunity

258
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,740
do it - I'm not a paid rep I'm just

259
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,600
being honest and same thing with

260
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,980
pastebin that's the only three things

261
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,030
I've paid for I don't use multigo or any

262
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,490
of the paid sources there's just really

263
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,110
no reason because most of the stuff you

264
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,520
can find if you're willing to do the

265
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,500
searches but anyway off of that soapbox

266
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,080
let's get into enumeration enumerate

267
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,680
cubed and what do I mean by cubed well

268
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,900
take your time doing the enumeration

269
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,030
this plays into that forty to sixty five

270
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,400
percent of the time but find out the

271
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,230
versions and do your checks with this

272
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,090
enumerate before you conduct your

273
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,110
initial attack to gain your access find

274
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,600
out your software versions there's a lot

275
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,770
of things that we can find out about

276
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,970
that we'll talk about on the next slide

277
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,220
that is they're associated with that but

278
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,620
especially like in a CTF environment or

279
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,670
in a Windows environment SMB SNMP SMTP

280
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,120
there unless they are properly

281
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,050
configured they're gold mines and more

282
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,430
often than not they're not properly

283
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,240
configured I mean has anyone seen a

284
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,180
properly configured SMB that has port

285
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,350
445 open to the public Internet probably

286
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,210
not because then they wouldn't have had

287
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,180
it had it open to the public Internet

288
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,880
but it's just a thing consider your web

289
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,110
enumeration there's a lot of stuff

290
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,640
within the web headers that doesn't need

291
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,930
to be there that people just put in

292
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,670
there because they've always done it

293
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,640
that way and you know those who study

294
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,620
people within this industry Grace Hopper

295
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,050
said that's probably the scariest phrase

296
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,550
to ever hear of we've always done it

297
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,490
that way so it's something to consider

298
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,280
and then anyone in here a fan of nmap

299
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,330
scripting engine what if you're not

300
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,870
oh of course Johnny is and team Johnny

301
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,440
over there it's all good

302
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,400
oh we've got another one okay so here's

303
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,620
your homework go home and play within

304
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,470
map scripting engine in Cali it's in

305
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,790
user share and map scripts that's the

306
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,640
path go take a look if you know what

307
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,070
protocol you're attacking whether it be

308
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,430
HTTP SMB whatever there are scripts for

309
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,750
that they will do a lot of the ANU

310
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,260
raishin for you granted yes it's noisy

311
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:30,430
but there there something you can use so

312
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:35,390
just play with it trust me I'm gonna

313
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,850
save that phrase because I think I use

314
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,410
it later in this presentation but anyway

315
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,630
look for things like shares ports

316
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,870
services something companies need to

317
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,480
understand shodhan is not your asset

318
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,210
inventory system just as Brian Krebs and

319
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,470
other journalists are not your IDs

320
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,200
but anyway enumerate users if you can

321
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,370
find a user that I don't know they come

322
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,730
across as a significant number 17 or you

323
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,200
see things on their public Facebook that

324
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,450
says sorry I didn't send any friend

325
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,690
requests I was hacked again that's gonna

326
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,230
be a good target because they're

327
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,370
probably going to click on they

328
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,190
will do it or die find out their host

329
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,800
names operating systems you should know

330
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,270
that from the OSINT but you can further

331
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,300
refine that of course web denied web

332
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,890
directories of languages and files and

333
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,410
languages not just like JavaScript PHP

334
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,320
or you know whatever the rage is within

335
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,180
the mean stack or whatever other stack

336
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,240
all the DevOps people are using but also

337
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,910
look at the language setting is it en-gb

338
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,500
or is it en-us because if you're doing a

339
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,260
social engineering engagement in the

340
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,680
u.s. the word realized has a Z in it

341
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,230
with British spelling it does not so

342
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,270
that's something to consider if you're

343
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,980
gonna claim to be someone you need to be

344
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,150
able to spell like them so third have it

345
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,930
live off the land remember the basics if

346
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,200
you have to install something assuming

347
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,760
they are monitoring it's a big

348
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,850
assumption I know but assuming they are

349
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,770
monitoring that is an opportunity for

350
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,070
detection if you have permission to

351
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,810
install software chances are you've

352
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,240
already met any pin test objectives

353
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,280
you're now in the world of red teaming

354
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,720
of you're trying to simulate something a

355
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,610
specific adversary would do

356
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,569
such as install say tour and email

357
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:42,350
something to yourself but if you can use

358
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,649
PowerShell or Python they're both on

359
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:48,920
operating systems by default granted yes

360
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,749
there are ways to lock both of them down

361
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:54,199
yes there are ways to detect things but

362
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:55,970
you're going to be a lot quieter if

363
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,559
you're living off the land than if

364
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,420
you're having to install or import all

365
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,339
of these scripts um you do have to

366
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,639
consider how to get the scripts in

367
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,350
because a lot of Sox they're gonna look

368
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,439
for things like get W get curl those

369
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,470
types of things

370
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,499
also for non HTTP traffic on ports 80

371
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:24,819
and 443 I mean specifically 44 44 I mean

372
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:28,040
that's Metasploit stew fault so if

373
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,420
someone's working in a socket not

374
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,360
explicitly trying to monitor for that

375
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,309
there can be some problems but with that

376
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:37,040
you you want to find out what you need

377
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,509
to have a concept of normalcy you want

378
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:43,339
to be able to blend in with the behavior

379
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:46,069
of the host and the host could be the

380
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:49,489
host system or it could be the host user

381
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:52,399
if you know for example the Samantha in

382
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,040
HR that you're targeting goes to lunch

383
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,860
at chick-fil-a on every Thursday at

384
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,699
11:30 a.m. and comes back at 1:15 p.m.

385
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:03,909
that is probably not the time to attack

386
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:06,799
because if they are using user behavior

387
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,750
analytics and assuming it's properly

388
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,659
configured and assuming and it's working

389
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:14,299
that's a means of detection a lot of

390
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,619
sims could pick that up for abnormal

391
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,730
activity as well if you know the CEO is

392
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,069
in Bangalore for a conference

393
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:25,579
I would not attempt to log in from

394
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,850
Chicago there are plenty of VPNs that

395
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,080
terminate in Bangalore go with those

396
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,110
things like that um don't try your

397
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,240
previous core nosy scripts unless you're

398
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,649
prepared for detection and that may be

399
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:44,179
what that may be the right answer that

400
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:45,620
may be within the scope of the

401
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,820
engagement you're being asked to do

402
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,910
okay again there's the Hank the thing

403
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,070
about show Dan have I been poned same

404
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:58,680
thing so I go to the Dollywood theme

405
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,360
park probably once a year maybe twice

406
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,610
it's really close to where I live in

407
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,950
Tennessee and every time I always get

408
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,540
the discount for being a veteran I mean

409
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,370
I'd rather pay $30 for a ticket than

410
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,190
$100 I mean I don't really wave that

411
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,020
flag too hard but with that one yeah

412
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,470
I'll do it

413
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,070
and the the people who sell the tickets

414
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,220
they are so quick to immediately say

415
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,100
what's your zip code at this point I've

416
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,440
already signed my receipt and I'm like

417
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,030
is this required for the transaction

418
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:32,030
well no okay well I don't have one okay

419
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,190
what's your email address is this

420
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,810
required for the transaction no well I

421
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,350
don't have one

422
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,240
what's your address I think you know

423
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,920
what my next question is going to be and

424
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,460
my next answer and they're like the

425
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,840
first time this happened the lady's like

426
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,330
we're giving you a big discount on a

427
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,100
ticket you should give us information I

428
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,840
was like I'll give you information all

429
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,190
day every day but I'm not gonna give you

430
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,340
anything it's accurate because I value

431
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,320
my personal security and my operations

432
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,480
security and I'm not gonna give data

433
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,310
that's not necessary to someone who's

434
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,050
just going to a use it for their data

435
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,300
mining so they can try to market to me

436
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,460
better and B they're gonna store it and

437
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,470
I don't have any concept of how secure

438
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,800
how they value the data for it to get

439
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,040
dumped and end up on the Internet so

440
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,540
then finally we agreed that my zip code

441
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,420
was nine oh two one oh the next year

442
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,370
same thing I told him my email address

443
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,270
was notify at twitter.com he didn't

444
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,900
believe me so he put in his zip code I

445
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,890
was like hey man if you want to put in

446
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,910
your own zip code that's cool because

447
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,850
it's you screwing up your employers data

448
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,680
analytics that's on you man

449
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,860
but anyway D hash that's proof that

450
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,740
people use garbage passwords and I've

451
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,420
said it earlier journalists should not

452
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,540
be companies IDs so you know

453
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,820
don't attempt or don't forget to attempt

454
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,080
to compromise credentials

455
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,820
don't forget password stuffing or

456
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,550
spraying you don't have to brute-force

457
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,750
everything you know exploitation is not

458
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,910
always the answer sometimes mas o 8 o 6

459
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,700
7 or 17 0 10 those are the answer

460
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,160
sometimes I mean as long as admin admin

461
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,680
works if you don't believe it works ask

462
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:30,100
Equifax as long as they work what does

463
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,870
it matter I mean you don't have to come

464
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,420
in being a brute-force nation-state like

465
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,070
Ginny Radcliffe when it comes to social

466
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,050
engineering subverting all the physical

467
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,270
security controls getting deviant aalam

468
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,270
to come in and throw his film over the

469
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,340
door to be able to pop the doors open if

470
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,660
you've not seen that take a look at it

471
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,310
you don't have to do that if you could

472
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,110
just simply come and knock on the door

473
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,570
and they say password please and you say

474
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,900
New England clam chowder and then they

475
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,810
say white or pink does anyone know the

476
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,970
answer to this

477
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,420
no Ace Ventura fans answers pink but

478
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,200
it's it's from Ace Ventura pet detective

479
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,910
but as long as if you can co and knock

480
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,210
on the door and get through that way

481
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:16,030
what's this even for because unless

482
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,860
they've got cameras and changes are if

483
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,910
someone's gonna let you in the door that

484
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,100
easily even if they have cameras hey

485
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,750
they may not be a recording B they may

486
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,130
not be plugged in and even if they are

487
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,300
who's going to watch them um but

488
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,440
diversify your tool sets don't just use

489
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,840
Hydra consider Medusa consider in crack

490
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,910
there are other tool sets to use some of

491
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,250
which you can alter your user agent

492
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,750
strings and look like you're something

493
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,450
else you know when when our parents said

494
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,620
you can be anything you want to be when

495
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,630
you grow up they kind of we're talking

496
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:51,700
about user agent strings I mean there's

497
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,190
there's all sorts of things don't don't

498
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,100
put all your eggs in the same basket you

499
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,760
don't have to be a nation-state unless

500
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,980
they cook the client asks for it and if

501
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,360
you want to be a nation state based on

502
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,280
what a lot of the apt reports are saying

503
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,590
what are they doing this

504
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,450
so you don't have to go in with some

505
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,330
like ultra whiz-bang solution to

506
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,779
successfully do one of these engagements

507
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:24,100
if that's what they're asking for if

508
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,659
they're a very mature company and they

509
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:27,909
want you to run with some sort of newly

510
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:31,720
drop Xero Dave okay go for it but at the

511
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,799
same time there's a good chance that

512
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,090
they would go down via social

513
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,700
engineering or default creds or

514
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,460
something to that effect and and this

515
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,499
this is something that comes to mind as

516
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:44,979
well the Zen of Python anyone familiar

517
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:47,409
with this if you want to read it just

518
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:48,970
open a Python interpreter and type

519
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,429
import this and it pops up it's an

520
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:54,249
easter egg but basically there are four

521
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:56,919
lines in this that are but actually five

522
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,619
lines that are very important to this

523
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:02,580
right explicit is better than implicit

524
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,349
simple is better than complex complex is

525
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:07,779
better than complicated right its

526
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:12,070
simplicity in getting in at the same

527
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,749
time readability does count

528
00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:18,159
hence my regular expressions now is

529
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,320
better than ever but never is often

530
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,840
better than right now that's more on the

531
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,009
blue team side sorry to get

532
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:25,330
philosophical with you I really

533
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,690
apologize for that but anyway in not

534
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,679
being a nation-state go back to habit

535
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:34,059
three with the PowerShell or Python

536
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:36,580
consider this though I mean if you can

537
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,859
get on a host you can send an email to

538
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:40,809
yourself you can send an email with an

539
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:44,320
attachment to yourself you could use

540
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,399
something like tor you might be able to

541
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:51,599
use like social media or an API

542
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,720
something to that effect or upload to

543
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,049
the cloud is there really any need to go

544
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:03,369
owning the galaxy not really because you

545
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:04,419
can walk right out the door with their

546
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:07,149
crown jewels granted they may have DLP

547
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:10,389
software that may catch you but even if

548
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:13,859
they do catch you it may be too late so

549
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:16,720
and that goes to my final point on this

550
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,729
slide about you know you don't need zero

551
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:20,259
days when companies are failing to do

552
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:25,930
basic security measures again

553
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,760
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention social

554
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,920
engineering if you want to watch some

555
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,809
calls after this talk I think there's

556
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:33,430
going to be a few more calls downstairs

557
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,559
but basically technology typically

558
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,960
doesn't fail routers route switches

559
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,830
switch I'm really unsure what a lot of

560
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,380
vendor appliances do I think the vendors

561
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:50,350
are unsure to just being honest but you

562
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,650
know at the same time people we have

563
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,750
that weakness we want to be helpful

564
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,880
Chris had Nikki says the mode for the

565
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,170
most important phrase in social

566
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,809
engineering is can you help me

567
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:02,800
every time somebody answered the phone

568
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,240
while I was competing downstairs I used

569
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,760
it and with the exception of one very

570
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,550
very very aggressively secure woman in

571
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,270
Vancouver who hung up on me quick people

572
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:18,520
wanted to help so with it I mean people

573
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,929
want to be helpful you know you see

574
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:22,720
someone with coffee and doughnuts in

575
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,840
their hand struggling to get to the door

576
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,679
especially if you think you're gonna get

577
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:28,030
a doughnut out of it you're gonna hold

578
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:32,110
that door I mean truth is truth you have

579
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,600
a clipboard a toolbox a ladder or

580
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,610
doughnuts you're probably getting in

581
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:41,500
just being honest um with fishing

582
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,340
according to the semantics is TR the

583
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,380
global success rate on fishing emails is

584
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,059
13% let that sink in it sounds like a

585
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:54,760
really low number but then also factor

586
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,010
in how many emails are sent per second

587
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,870
80% of those thirteen percent so that

588
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,860
comes to about ten point four percent

589
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:13,420
contain malware so one in ten emails

590
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:18,120
that you're receiving contains malware

591
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,360
so you do the O sent from habit number

592
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,400
one your efficiency has just went

593
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,760
through the roof merge it with other

594
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,120
disciplines with social engineering it

595
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,490
merges very easily with physical merges

596
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,429
very easily with O sent it's it's coming

597
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:38,740
in really nicely with pen testing and

598
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,260
red teaming but

599
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,940
I'm going back to the presentation I

600
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,470
gave last week at the Wild West hack and

601
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,800
fest has anyone thought about

602
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,710
weaponizing memory forensics and in the

603
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,809
presentation I did last week basically

604
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:54,450
the pretext is I'm a forensic consultant

605
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,750
I've been hired by your company because

606
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,050
you've had adverse events another

607
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,880
computer on the network has been fully

608
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,930
compromised

609
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,940
we don't believe your computer has been

610
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,440
compromised we don't think anything's

611
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,270
wrong but that other computer did

612
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,650
communicate with yours and I've been

613
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,780
sent to get a memory image just to make

614
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:20,040
sure you'll walk out the door with the

615
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,309
memory image keep in mind the person has

616
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,990
to have at least local admin for you to

617
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,460
get the memory image so that is a

618
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,440
constraint but I have a back-up plan

619
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:34,200
you can run me me cats across the memory

620
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,140
image using volatility you can dump the

621
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,290
entire you can do hash dump and find out

622
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,450
the ntlm hashes you can see what was on

623
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,950
the clipboard you can look at net stat

624
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,150
you can see what was put into the

625
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,040
command line you can look at Chrome

626
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,750
Firefox and Internet Explorer browser

627
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,390
history that can give you all sorts of

628
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,980
situational information about the

629
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,530
company to go forward and then that goes

630
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,950
back into enumeration cubed because I

631
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,900
did mention the steps of enumeration but

632
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,120
then what makes it cubed is you after

633
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,530
you get your initial exploitation

634
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,420
enumerate some more to find out how you

635
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,120
can escalate and then once you get your

636
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,280
full escalation enumerate some more and

637
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,760
see where you can pivot to using the

638
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,440
memory image you could do that very

639
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,300
easily if they don't have administrative

640
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,630
rights you can very easily put proc dump

641
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,390
on a thumb drive and dump I don't know

642
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,850
say Firefox and if they've got the

643
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,230
password stored in the browser guess

644
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,290
what you've got now all you've got to do

645
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,970
is strings and then pipe it to a grip

646
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,679
for whatever you're looking for and it's

647
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,740
right there and plain text for you and

648
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,670
that's something that forensics

649
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,400
professionals have been doing for years

650
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,290
but we don't really hear people on the

651
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,970
offensive side talking about using that

652
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,600
as an attack vector and yes some of the

653
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,980
feedback I got it wild was hacking fest

654
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,530
was able to be very hard for me to stop

655
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,840
at getting the memory image

656
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,380
without trying to do something else

657
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,789
absolutely because when you're getting

658
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:00,260
in you're gonna try to pone pone pone

659
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,429
right but if you can do this and be very

660
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:07,370
silent about it and walk out the door no

661
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,559
one's going to detect you messing with a

662
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,779
memory image in your evil lair with your

663
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:13,940
black hoodie your mom making your Hot

664
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,370
Pockets cheeto dust on your keyboard

665
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:20,889
listening to dual-core or trance music

666
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,179
hey I call it like I see it

667
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:27,559
my favorite Cheetos are the spicy

668
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:33,230
Cheetos I like pizza hot pockets but you

669
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,850
know that gets down to the point you

670
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,559
know you don't have to be super elite if

671
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,789
you can't explain it so go off and read

672
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:43,220
the red team or the blue team reports

673
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,130
read what I like don't don't concern

674
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,480
yourself so much with the IOC s because

675
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,049
that stuff can change on seconds notice

676
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:52,730
concern yourself with the TT piece the

677
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,070
tactics techniques and procedures that

678
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,950
the adversaries are taking it doesn't

679
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,710
matter if you use the same hash of a

680
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,260
Python script that they use and save

681
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,830
file less ransomware you can coordinate

682
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,110
with your target company and be like hey

683
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,100
here's the hash that's for what I'm

684
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,480
gonna do let's see if anybody to text

685
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,370
this you can do that without having to

686
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:17,090
try to replicate their stuff absolutely

687
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,480
but if you can't explain it

688
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,309
why do it I mean that's I came up with a

689
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:27,200
term earlier this year it's called a

690
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,600
technical Tarzan it's one of those

691
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,919
people that want to beat their chests

692
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:32,870
and talk about how stupid the users are

693
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,580
and how great they are hacking things

694
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,549
but when you say okay you pulled this to

695
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:40,090
tackle what does it mean to the business

696
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,529
explain to a manager why they should

697
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:44,270
invest money into fixing whatever you

698
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,539
just broke technical Tarzan's can't do

699
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:50,419
that that's what makes them technical

700
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:54,679
Tarzan's um but anyway emulate

701
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,220
adversaries not other pentesters Haroon

702
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,690
mirrors said that a couple years ago a

703
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,370
44 con but learn take the approach the

704
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,200
salespeople take

705
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,269
common phrase the salespeople use tell

706
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:10,279
me about the concerns and problems

707
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,570
you're trying to solve within your

708
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,570
organization that's wide open social

709
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,570
engineering but anyway take the time to

710
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,190
understand what's keeping their

711
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,279
management up at night find out what

712
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:25,100
their crown jewels are not necessarily

713
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,140
the contents of them but for example

714
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,330
you're going against a software company

715
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,890
more than likely it's going to be their

716
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,110
source code find out what the crown

717
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,480
jewels are and then help them develop

718
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,750
the objective based on that a realistic

719
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,179
scenario because sometimes you don't

720
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:46,159
have to get da domain admin yeah I mean

721
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,630
it's a way to beat your chest but not

722
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,480
every adversary does it and you can

723
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,909
cause just as much havoc mayhem dystopia

724
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:55,779
whatever you want to call it without it

725
00:31:55,779 --> 00:32:01,340
so with that study the the threat Intel

726
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,320
feeds I understand a lot of threat Intel

727
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,960
feeds are garbage I'll be I will readily

728
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,809
admit that to you especially the ones

729
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:10,279
that are very heavy on Io sees because

730
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:12,350
you want to know about how the

731
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,389
organization's surveilled the target you

732
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:15,769
want to find out how they gained their

733
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,750
initial foothold like what kind of

734
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,880
phishing attacks they used or what kind

735
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,889
of low-level account that they took over

736
00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:23,360
and then how they did the privilege

737
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,880
escalation that's what's important you

738
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,889
might learn something that uh might

739
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:30,830
actually help you long term as well and

740
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,690
keep in mind that there there is a lot

741
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:35,600
of vendor Fudd with that it just is but

742
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,279
a lot of people put stuff up on Twitter

743
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,980
even LinkedIn InfraGard puts up some

744
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,139
stuff in the United States understanding

745
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:44,659
that you have to be a US citizen to join

746
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:45,370
InfraGard

747
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,529
that's kind of a moot point here but you

748
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:50,179
know at the same time it could be the

749
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:52,309
difference between da and na which is

750
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:53,570
completely contradictory to what I said

751
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,760
about you don't have to have da but it

752
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,880
is also nice habit 7 remain adventurous

753
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,880
and curious don't stop

754
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,700
try harder all these things we hear go

755
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,470
to conferences so you're already one

756
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,960
step ahead you're already in you already

757
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,899
and habit 7 read blogs there are blogs

758
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:18,230
everywhere alienvault now ATT

759
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,790
cybersecurity they have some really good

760
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:24,280
tripwire has some good stuff I TSP and

761
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,020
then the vendors trusted SEC Black Hills

762
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,610
information security

763
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,120
Leslie Carhartt with Tiffany has a lot

764
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,260
of good stuff as well

765
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,030
understanding who she worked for it's

766
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,790
just our website but study things I

767
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,530
think Johnny might even have some stuff

768
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:46,490
maybe study write blogs if you have

769
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,320
something that interest you if you don't

770
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,850
want to set up your own domain and do

771
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,410
all that stuff that's cool go get a

772
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,850
WordPress go get a medium account

773
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:55,010
whatever and just write it post it there

774
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,740
I mean it'll help you out because in the

775
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,570
long term when you talk to employers and

776
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,400
they say hey can you show me some of you

777
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,620
like tell me about your lab it's like

778
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,570
well I really don't have a lab but I do

779
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,800
have some blogs about the stuff I've

780
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,170
researched and I've got github that goes

781
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,040
along with some of the scripts

782
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,050
associated with it that'll be just as

783
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,989
impressive so having that it shows that

784
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,550
you can communicate clearly about

785
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,170
technical topics and it also shows that

786
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:21,409
you are committed to learning if you're

787
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:23,420
comfortable with it give talks it

788
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,010
doesn't have to be necessarily on this

789
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,230
stage at Def Con blackhat stage it could

790
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,090
be with your local def con groups city

791
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:33,139
SEC is SAIC squared all the above Derby

792
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:36,350
con groups they're coming as well so

793
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,630
you've got that network with people so

794
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,489
thank you for coming to my talk the talk

795
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:41,510
is not over I'm just saying thank you

796
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,699
for coming but Lobby con is a great way

797
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,590
to learn things too because a lot of

798
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,989
times the talks are actually recorded

799
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,190
you can watch them later

800
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,810
you can't lobby con later have a home

801
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:58,730
lab read da 667 s guide his name's Tony

802
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,370
Robinson but read his guide about doing

803
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,830
a home lab feel free to mentor someone

804
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,750
you can learn just as much from

805
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,940
mentoring someone as the mentee can

806
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,880
learn from you mentoring them because

807
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,740
sometimes they'll ask questions that you

808
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,910
never really thought about and then take

809
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,430
courses if you can

810
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:22,970
so of course remain curious it's very

811
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,680
important if you're not adventurer

812
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,839
you can become adventurous I just don't

813
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,910
suggest doing it in this manner where

814
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,410
you have to walk around for three hours

815
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:36,549
at a time barefoot for several movies

816
00:35:36,549 --> 00:35:38,619
only for about a third of the way

817
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:40,690
through the last one throw a ring in a

818
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:43,000
volcano walk back just to drink a little

819
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,089
bit and roll the credits so you know

820
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:50,380
just consider it I mean something that

821
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,390
if it makes you if you're slightly

822
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,460
uncomfortable with it that's giving you

823
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,559
an opportunity to grow because you're

824
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:01,930
gonna gain your comfort with it so on

825
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,270
the topic of mentoring Brian Austin and

826
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,039
I co-founded through the hacking glass

827
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,690
we're trying to get it off the ground

828
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,260
right now we have a significant

829
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,049
disparity between mentees and mentors

830
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:15,970
it's like a thirty one to one ratio

831
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,829
mentees to mentor so we're gonna have to

832
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:20,440
do cohorts basically we understand

833
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,329
certifications give you this piece of

834
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:23,920
information academia gives you this

835
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,390
piece of information we're trying to

836
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,910
help you in the middle so if you want

837
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:32,220
that 14 years of aetherium experience

838
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,240
okay y'all don't get that one

839
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,230
the theorem has not been around that

840
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,210
long a vendor actually asked for that

841
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,640
much experience it made it to Twitter I

842
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,539
mean 20 years of blockchain experience

843
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:45,670
we can't help you with that but if you

844
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,020
need some experience with like Cisco

845
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,880
routing or something that's something

846
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,039
that we can help you with as the program

847
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:53,380
matures we're currently establishing a

848
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,490
board of directors and we're actually

849
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,930
trying to get everything a little bit

850
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,279
more operational and then we'll

851
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:59,650
establish the cohorts unless we get a

852
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,890
boatload of mentors and you can't be a

853
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:06,160
mentor and a mentee as well but most

854
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,609
importantly don't be afraid to beat the

855
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:15,309
drum to your own cadence some

856
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:17,380
commonalities this is going to be

857
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,529
controversial here's a hot take for you

858
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:22,349
the red team is really the blue team

859
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:25,390
what I mean by that is the red team they

860
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,339
go off they do their thing they produce

861
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:30,069
a cohesive report that in theory someone

862
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:32,710
is going to read and act upon key

863
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,920
operator there in theory and they seek

864
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,249
improve the overall security of an

865
00:37:40,249 --> 00:37:42,499
organization by definition that makes

866
00:37:42,499 --> 00:37:49,549
them what blue team um both can be

867
00:37:49,549 --> 00:37:53,210
technical both don't have to be if

868
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,789
you're trying to learn set up a home lab

869
00:37:55,789 --> 00:37:58,190
something like the detection lab I

870
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,359
forget I think it's Chris Long's

871
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,999
detection lab set that up and attack it

872
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:03,200
it's gonna have the monitoring

873
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,700
capability so not only do you get to

874
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,559
play with attacking things but then you

875
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,150
also have all the sim artifacts to go

876
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,970
back and learn from so you can learn the

877
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,289
red and the blue at the same time and

878
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,749
both sides really benefit from learning

879
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:18,529
from each other but you know if you're

880
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,200
if you're currently in a role and you

881
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,970
want to make a transition one way to the

882
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:27,980
other so say for example you you're a

883
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,099
programmer you work in app sec well you

884
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:33,470
can very easily go to pen testing and

885
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,819
exploit dev you just have to look at the

886
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:36,920
way that you're that you're programming

887
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,319
things look at how what the end game is

888
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:41,150
what the inputs are how it works

889
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:45,200
together if you're writing things from

890
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,150
the ground up you have a leg up on

891
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,069
people who don't have that background in

892
00:38:49,069 --> 00:38:51,319
learning exploit development or reverse

893
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:53,900
engineering malware threat intelligence

894
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,549
there's a lot of us and associated with

895
00:38:55,549 --> 00:38:59,089
that that works both directions reverse

896
00:38:59,089 --> 00:38:59,869
engineering

897
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:02,779
you already reverse engineer malware why

898
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:05,539
not why not reverse engineer executables

899
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:06,859
to find buffer overflows and other

900
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:08,420
vulnerabilities that you could use to

901
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,619
gain access it's there so I do offer

902
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:17,329
assent training online it's live online

903
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:19,599
here are my next two training sessions

904
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,839
November 5th and November 18th

905
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,059
the one on the fifth is a for our basic

906
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:27,950
o cent training the one on the 18th is a

907
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,690
three hour regular expressions training

908
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:32,930
I've got coupon codes up if you want to

909
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,569
come there some discounts associated

910
00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:38,150
with that I'm going to open it up for

911
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,009
any questions concerns complaints

912
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:41,450
grievances thoughts opinions or

913
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:44,779
otherwise know that phrase does not

914
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:49,269
rehearsed maybe it is

915
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,510
okay and as a final note if you

916
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:57,150
implement these habits this may become

917
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:02,100
you and if there are nothing else that's

918
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,460
all folks
