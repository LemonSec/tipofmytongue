00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,090
seddie

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,339
good morning do I have to do the shot of

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,599
rum or am i my good cuz it's 9:00 a.m. I

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,139
was all day to do a shot of rum but I'm

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,010
okay to skip that cuz it's very early so

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,270
thank you for being here bright and

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,520
early on a Friday morning to talk about

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,630
mobile ad where as you heard my name is

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,510
Christina and I am based in Toronto

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,369
although I'm very happy to be back and

11
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:30,720
it's beautiful province cuz I lived here

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,290
for about five years I'm a security

13
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,180
intelligence engineer at lookout which

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,860
is a mobile security cyber security

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,930
company with the main office in San

16
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,280
Francisco but were kind of all over the

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,969
place before that I was an app sec

18
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,090
engineer for Shopify and I was primarily

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,850
responsible for monitoring the Android

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,170
applications that were developed and

21
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,699
making sure that vulnerability is

22
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,190
weren't introduced in those guys I'm

23
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,140
also a master's student and I just

24
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,149
released a course on LinkedIn learning

25
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,219
about analyzing mobile specifically

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,379
Android malware so if you find this

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,760
interesting and you want to get started

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,500
it's free so that's handy so there's a

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,390
fair bit to cover and I've got 50

30
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,490
minutes so I'm gonna be kind of brief

31
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,140
just going over what we're going to talk

32
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,700
about today the first thing we're gonna

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,080
look at and I'm sure most of you know

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,820
the term adware but we're gonna kind of

35
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,369
dive a bit more into what it is and why

36
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,409
we should even care about it then we're

37
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:26,939
gonna look at a particularly interesting

38
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,310
case study that I worked on earlier in

39
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,470
the summer and we're going to talk about

40
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,650
the aftermath of that case study and the

41
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,479
future of adware and and how that might

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,100
impact us in the future especially for

43
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,140
researchers so what is adware why should

44
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,570
we even care about it for anyone who

45
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,700
hasn't heard the term before adware is

46
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,130
essentially an application that either

47
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,930
collects sensitive information from you

48
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,630
or your device or it invades your device

49
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,700
with really disruptive ads typically

50
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,250
they're out of app ads so it's you know

51
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,840
if you're using a free app you kind of

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,210
expect to see ads within the application

53
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,820
it's when you shut that app and all of a

54
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,530
sudden you have ads on your lock screen

55
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,430
that's considered adware most of what

56
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,680
we've seen up until this point is

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,500
really poorly written and not obfuscated

58
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,209
at all they don't even try to hide what

59
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,239
they're doing a lot of it 99% of it is

60
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,890
financially motivated so you can usually

61
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,870
trace the money and figure out who is

62
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,810
behind this particular campaign and a

63
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,109
2013 report from lookout showed that 6%

64
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,060
of free apps contained adware so not

65
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,090
just ads but actually ads that that

66
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,650
violated Store policies there are three

67
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,349
common approaches to adware and most of

68
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:44,790
you have probably had some experience

69
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,799
with these or at least heard of them the

70
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,409
first is a synthetic audience and that's

71
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:51,540
essentially a way of saying fake clicks

72
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,430
so they have some sort of thought or

73
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,620
some sort of automated clicking system

74
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,900
within the application that makes it

75
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,400
look like for some reason you are

76
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,049
clicking a hundred times on an ad that

77
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,930
you're really talking that interested in

78
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,400
another interesting approach is to have

79
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,500
unclick Abul ads and we'll look at an

80
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,930
example of this but it's it's kind of

81
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,099
similar to what you would see in the

82
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,689
browser it's essentially an ad that's

83
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:15,090
loaded in an area where the user can't

84
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,859
actually see it can never actually click

85
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:19,139
on it but the advertiser thinks that

86
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,459
you're watching it and that you have the

87
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,919
ability to interact with the ad and then

88
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,870
as we talked about out of a bad vert

89
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,989
iseman --tz-- so you know basically

90
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,010
bombarding you with advertisements when

91
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,849
you're not actually using an application

92
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:35,010
this was a pretty staggering statistic

93
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,379
for me according to Business Insider in

94
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,650
2018 mobile in-app advertising fraud so

95
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,689
not just ads but fraud has surged as

96
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,489
much as eight hundred percent over the

97
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,829
previous year I am very interested to

98
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,870
see what they say for 2019 because I

99
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,489
would suspect it's going to be more than

100
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,079
eight hundred percent which is a little

101
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,009
crazy and so now let's talk about why we

102
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:57,720
should even care about adware I mean I

103
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,829
feel like for most researchers

104
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:01,349
especially malware researchers a lot of

105
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:04,049
the time adware is kind of kind of

106
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:06,120
boring like I said it's usually really

107
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,150
poorly built it's not very well off you

108
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,439
skated it's kind of considered the

109
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,849
low-hanging fruit of the research

110
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,099
community and some people see it as a

111
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:14,909
victimless crime

112
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:16,918
I mean if you're faking clicks who's

113
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,599
really getting hurt here people aren't

114
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:19,918
having money stolen from some sort of

115
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,750
banking Trojan it's not like you're

116
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,340
dealing with some sophisticated

117
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,469
surveillance where spyware that's you

118
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:27,180
know targeting political dissidents

119
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,419
it's essentially falsifying clicks for

120
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,880
advertising revenue so is it really

121
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,530
hurting anybody other than maybe the

122
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,650
advertising agencies so we're gonna look

123
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,259
at that very briefly but I think it's

124
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,729
important to remember that adware

125
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,650
targets everyone so you don't have to be

126
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,250
a political dissident they kind of try

127
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,229
to basically net as many people as they

128
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:51,240
can as many downloads as they can and so

129
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,850
you see a much larger sort of target

130
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,949
audience some of the apps we'll look at

131
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:57,479
and specifically the app that I'm

132
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,220
talking about in the case study had

133
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,320
about a half a billion downloads so that

134
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,729
can actually generate quite a lot of

135
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:05,639
revenue and you know as we talked about

136
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,350
if ad companies are paying money for

137
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,970
clicks or views that don't actually

138
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,370
exist that can impact the advertising

139
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,380
industry now again maybe we don't care

140
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,289
about that quite as much but if we're

141
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:17,940
looking at it from a personal standpoint

142
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,880
ad where is the type of malware you're

143
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,340
most likely to be affected by in a

144
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,259
really interesting Check Point report

145
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,729
called state of the mouse state of

146
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:29,940
malware from 2019 they listed adware as

147
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,220
still the most common malware affecting

148
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,810
consumers and businesses year-over-year

149
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,970
so I mean that's not really surprising

150
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,099
as we said they're trying to throw it a

151
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:39,599
large net and get as many people as I

152
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:39,870
can

153
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,849
so you're typically going to see that

154
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:45,150
with this particular type of malware but

155
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,130
the impacts can be more than just

156
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,659
falsifying clicks they can actually be

157
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,130
pretty substantial so we're going to

158
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,169
look at some interesting cases this this

159
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:58,710
was from January 2019 from upstream

160
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,659
systems they they released a report

161
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:04,530
about an Alcatel weather app that did a

162
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,229
whole bunch of things but mostly what it

163
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:09,240
was responsible for was generating false

164
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,430
clicks subscribing users to premium

165
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,220
services but it was also collecting some

166
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,599
sensitive information including your

167
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:17,909
email specifics on your device and your

168
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:20,159
location and those were being sent to a

169
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,659
third-party server in China that

170
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:23,490
apparently did not have anything to do

171
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,830
with the actual weather application and

172
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,150
then we have certain types of adware

173
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,090
that actually display malicious

174
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,740
advertisements so you're not just

175
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,330
dealing with falsifying clicks you're

176
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,650
actually dealing with the kind of

177
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,849
advertisements that you're interacting

178
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:40,830
with or that someone who

179
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,090
using an application that should be

180
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,030
trusted might be interacting with one

181
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,010
example is called simbad this was from

182
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,770
checkpoint research and they showed that

183
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,870
in this particular family of adware they

184
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,820
were actually seeing advertisements for

185
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,510
fishing sites so that's real fun through

186
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,100
a situ server the attacker could

187
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,780
essentially decide what kind of fishing

188
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,040
site they wanted to push out to

189
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,780
applications and they could modify it as

190
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,610
they wanted to and so you weren't just

191
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,710
seeing ads you know you were seeing some

192
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,720
kind of browser activity that was saying

193
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,920
that you had been logged out of Gmail

194
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,150
and you better log back in or you're

195
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,230
gonna miss important emails this one was

196
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,210
particularly concerning this is another

197
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,980
case of malicious advertisements within

198
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,890
adware and this one was appropriately

199
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,320
named adult swine once again by

200
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,510
checkpoint it had between three and

201
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,670
seven million downloads and it

202
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,210
essentially displayed born to kids

203
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,640
because most of the apps were actually

204
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,730
gaming apps for children so that's

205
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,220
incredibly unfortunate and then on top

206
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,840
of that it would actually trigger pop up

207
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,850
saying hey your device has been infected

208
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,810
by a malicious virus the irony you

209
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,790
better go to Google Play and download

210
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,610
this super grade AV app but of course it

211
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,810
wouldn't take you to Google Play would

212
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,800
take you to some like sketchy

213
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,210
third-party site that was made to look

214
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,840
like Google Play and then finally

215
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,580
there's the case of device performance

216
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,260
and usability and how that can be

217
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,600
impacted by certain adware families and

218
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,830
that's where we're going to look at our

219
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,040
main case study this was this was a

220
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,110
research project that I worked on for

221
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,720
the better part of kind of the

222
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,910
springtime and like all great stories it

223
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,760
started with a Zendesk ticket so a user

224
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,800
contacted us saying that they were

225
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,960
seeing very strange out of app

226
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,120
advertisements on their device primarily

227
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,590
when their phone was locked they were

228
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,270
seeing advertisements on the lockscreen

229
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,490
and they weren't entirely sure where it

230
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,320
came from they just knew that when they

231
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,750
opened up the Android multitasking view

232
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,659
they saw some kind of app called beta

233
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,570
plugin and they told us the apps that

234
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,790
they had recently downloaded and so then

235
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,150
I started digging and there was exactly

236
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,130
one mention of beta plug-in on the

237
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,320
Internet which is very strange but it

238
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,690
was actually a very helpful forum post

239
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,600
and this forum dated back to about 2017

240
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,580
and it was essentially a bunch of people

241
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,740
complaining about the same what they

242
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,810
thought was an app or a plugin maybe

243
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,330
called beta plugin and they were

244
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,410
listening all the different apps they

245
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,000
had downloaded the fact that they were

246
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,680
seeing really kind of bombarded by by

247
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,140
different pop-ups on their device they

248
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,490
were seeing lockscreen ads

249
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,200
somebody actually said they missed a

250
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,610
phone call because they went to go

251
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,110
answer their phone and instead of being

252
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,300
able to actually answer the call they

253
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,920
got a 30-second video ad so that sucks

254
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,260
there were also people who were so

255
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,910
bombarded by these advertisements that

256
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,470
their device had to be factory reset

257
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,270
because I guess they had multiple

258
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,160
downloads of sort of like the carrier

259
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,730
application and so when I started

260
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,810
investigating these different

261
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,640
applications that were listed you kind

262
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,880
of saw a trend in the reviews despite

263
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,470
the fact that they actually had pretty

264
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,450
decent overall ratings they were like

265
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,600
four stars four and a half stars most of

266
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,880
those four or five star reviews looked

267
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,470
really fake and the ones that didn't

268
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,120
look very fake for usually one or two

269
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,790
stars so we can see added unwanted ads

270
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,950
that locked my screen put ads all over

271
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,240
my phone without asking for permission

272
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,420
horrible so that was basically the trend

273
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,220
all of these apps had those same kind of

274
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,170
reviews and you can see a flagrant

275
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,610
disregard for Google's Play Store

276
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,760
policies and so while I think most of us

277
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,960
know that you're allowed to have ads

278
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,090
within applications Google is pretty

279
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,160
strict about what kind of ads you can

280
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,750
actually show they don't allow

281
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,330
disruptive ads or deceptive ads as well

282
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,020
so anything that's like a phishing ad or

283
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,680
something trying to get you to download

284
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,870
another application and falsifying that

285
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,630
information not allowed any apps or any

286
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,520
apps that display ads outside of the

287
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,560
application once again not allowed so

288
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,970
clearly there were some rules being

289
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,790
broken here and when I installed one of

290
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,650
the applications on my test device this

291
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,990
is a picture of my screen I think you

292
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,120
can see what the like lovely reflection

293
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,320
in the back is before I realized I could

294
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,220
just take a screenshot of it we see the

295
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,550
same kind of thing so this was a lock

296
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,850
screen ad for tax cycle

297
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,110
I guess because April was coming up and

298
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,460
basically I figured out that

299
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,260
within all of these applications there

300
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,500
was this particular plugin called beta

301
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,589
plugin just like we saw with the

302
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:18,210
multitasking activity view on the

303
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,760
Android device what this ended up being

304
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,180
was a very well advocated advertising

305
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,670
plugin i and all of the carrier apps

306
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,520
were pretty popular on google play and

307
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,990
we'll look at that in a second but

308
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,300
overall there were 238 unique

309
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,279
applications that contain this plugin it

310
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,430
was loaded as a dex file via a loading

311
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,680
class called qihoo 360 I might be saying

312
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,500
that wrong the kind of funny thing about

313
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,240
qihoo 360 is that they're actually a

314
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,100
cyber security company and they're

315
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,600
considered China's largest cyber

316
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,940
security company and they make an AV

317
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,690
program so that's funny the loaded

318
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,130
plug-in has never actually installed to

319
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,480
the device so if you were to actually

320
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,610
look through the installed applications

321
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,990
you would never see anything called beta

322
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,240
it's just loaded with the carrier

323
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,250
application and you have to essentially

324
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,290
remove that application to remove the

325
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,600
plug-in but the impacts were pretty

326
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,459
significant there was a significant

327
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,110
battery depletion lockscreen

328
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,320
advertisements as I said advertisements

329
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,270
preventing the regular use of the phone

330
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,580
and then advertisements with

331
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,290
accompanying audio while sleeping and

332
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,630
that's what I saw on my test device so I

333
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,070
just heard kind of like ghost music from

334
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,540
somewhere my test device had been

335
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,850
sleeping on my desk realized the audio

336
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,700
was coming from my phone and then when I

337
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,589
kind of turned on the screen there was a

338
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:38,520
full screen video ad with music playing

339
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,130
from my once sleeping device so good

340
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,770
times

341
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,540
238 applications and they had exactly

342
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,400
two things in common the first was that

343
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,740
they contained the beta plugin plugin

344
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,860
and the second thing was that they were

345
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,750
all developed by this company called

346
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,970
Khoo Teck this is where the story gets

347
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,640
pretty interesting because Khoo Teck is

348
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,440
actually a publicly traded company on

349
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,360
the New York Stock Exchange they were

350
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,089
founded in 2008 in Shanghai and they've

351
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:07,610
actually won a fair number of awards

352
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,470
they were rated as one of the top 10

353
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,570
most innovative companies in China by

354
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,270
Fast Company they won an award from

355
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,720
Google for best of Play apps 2015 they

356
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,450
IPO in 2018 and according to Pew tag

357
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,360
in 2019 their global products reached an

358
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,660
average of 250 5.5 million monthly

359
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,750
active users around the world so they're

360
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,120
pretty popular and some of you might

361
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,740
recognize this app because this is their

362
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,440
flagship app it's called touch pal it's

363
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,420
essentially a third party keyboard so if

364
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,399
you really want to have a keyboard that

365
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,820
looks like a starfish you can do that

366
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,190
it's incredibly popular it has you know

367
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,750
millions and millions millions of

368
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,269
downloads but on top of this particular

369
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:53,949
application they also developed some

370
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:57,339
others like high fit or man fit for step

371
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,949
tracker and a bunch of others that were

372
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:01,209
actually published under different

373
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:02,920
developer names but you can actually

374
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,019
trace back to qtek using some good old

375
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:08,110
open source intelligence and the

376
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,060
cumulative installs for all of the apps

377
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,529
that qtek developed that were available

378
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:13,839
on Google Play and contained the plugin

379
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,959
was over 500 million so they had a

380
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,010
substantial user base so what makes this

381
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,709
particular family interesting is that we

382
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:26,649
had 238 apps most of which were

383
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:29,560
incredibly popular and they were you

384
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,470
know very obviously violating Google

385
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,000
Play Store policies so how were they

386
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,279
able to actually sneak past any of the

387
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,820
tests that Google bouncer has in play

388
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,810
this is where we look at some of the fun

389
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,880
code so they evaded Google bouncer in a

390
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,610
number of ways one of the first ways was

391
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,260
that they didn't actually trigger any

392
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,880
malicious activity until a certain time

393
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,490
had passed sometimes this was randomized

394
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,649
even so for my test device the reason

395
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:58,269
why I had this ghost music playing was

396
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:00,070
because it took two weeks to actually

397
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,920
see any activity on the device they also

398
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,779
had conditional checks in place to make

399
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,420
sure that the device wasn't an emulator

400
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,100
it wouldn't trigger any malicious

401
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,290
activity if it suspected or it

402
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,149
recognized that you had USB debugging

403
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:16,209
enabled or that ADB was enabled so they

404
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:17,500
would kind of suspect that you could be

405
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,760
a researcher and trying to figure out

406
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,829
what they were up to they checked

407
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:22,660
whether auto time and auto timezone

408
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,279
settings were in place and then wouldn't

409
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,079
trigger any of the malicious activity if

410
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,300
they were and then they had some really

411
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,370
fun anti debug measures that made

412
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,170
stepping through the application ended

413
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,000
but in a debugger pretty much impossible

414
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,460
it would just crash all the time

415
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,250
so the only real success I had like I

416
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,710
said was installing it on my device and

417
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,149
just letting it go to town and

418
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:47,050
thankfully it did what was interesting

419
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,180
as well about these particular apps is

420
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,460
that the plug-in itself was refactored

421
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,899
over time so just like you see with

422
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:55,690
regular software projects this too had

423
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,770
different iterations and different

424
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,430
versions in earlier versions the the

425
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,290
actual Dex file that was responsible for

426
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,050
the plug-in was unencrypted and it was

427
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,330
called beta dot re C and it lived within

428
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,300
the assets directory and in later

429
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,399
versions this was actually renamed to

430
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,560
iko iko moon - Gemini dot re NC and I'm

431
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,600
not entirely sure if this is why but I

432
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,940
suspect they named it that because there

433
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,029
is like a vector pack for developers

434
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:28,200
called ICO moon and there is a

435
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,130
compatible download for that like vector

436
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,860
pack called Gemini so I'm assuming that

437
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,270
they named it this so they could make it

438
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,560
look like these were just like icon

439
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,089
packs that you were using with your app

440
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:42,160
I'm not entirely sure if that's right

441
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,120
but it just seems like an interesting

442
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,690
coincidence and when they renamed the

443
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,380
the beta dot rec Dex file to ICO moon

444
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,490
they encrypted it with AES and like I

445
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,930
said in both cases these were actually

446
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,060
just dalvik executable files which are

447
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,300
loaded by a plugin the the Q 360 plugin

448
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,470
loader so the AES encryption key is it

449
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,869
actually exists within the code base of

450
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:10,869
the main application it's obvious gated

451
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:11,709
through like a whole bunch of different

452
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:12,760
methods you have to kind of follow

453
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,189
through this maze of of connected things

454
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,050
it was a pain in the butt to go through

455
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,990
but essentially it's called in a package

456
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,030
called Hades SDK which doesn't sound

457
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,059
ominous at all so you can see right

458
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:26,589
there the function is called get

459
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:30,400
encrypted key and there's also within

460
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,320
Hades another function that's

461
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,090
responsible for retrieving the asset

462
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,620
path where the plugins located so I

463
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,970
guess if they wanted to change up where

464
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,559
they were storing the plug-in or the the

465
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,270
name of the plug-in they could change

466
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,850
that here I'm very handy for future

467
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,760
versions and what's interesting for this

468
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,400
Hades SDK package all of the classes

469
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,410
within this package were responsible for

470
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,850
much all of the interaction between the

471
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,010
plug-in and the add libraries once it

472
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,150
was loaded there were also checks for

473
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,590
whether the plugin had been decrypted

474
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,500
loaded Hades specified the output of the

475
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,810
jar file that was generated it set

476
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,310
alarms to trigger the add related

477
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:10,030
intense and it also specified spaces for

478
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,010
the ads to appear and this is one

479
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,690
example where they really weren't trying

480
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,980
to obfuscate where they were going to

481
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,450
display the ads because it's literally

482
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,880
called lock screen that made my life

483
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,670
easier but what's interesting about

484
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,170
Hades is that you don't actually see it

485
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,510
initialized if you just look through if

486
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,860
you step through like the regular flow

487
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,540
of the Android application when you're

488
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,320
reversing it

489
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,140
so the Hades SDK is actually initialized

490
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,420
by a subclass that's defined in the

491
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,090
manifest and that subclass is calm

492
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,740
scanner dot qrc application if we go to

493
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,260
qrc application hopefully this will play

494
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,890
there's no audio this video we can it's

495
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,030
sort of hard to see but you can

496
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,710
essentially see that it and curacy

497
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,600
application if you kind of step backward

498
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,910
through all of the Superdog create

499
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,760
methods there they're being called we

500
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,490
end up in the Hades SDK I mean this

501
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:07,840
one's just called Khoo Teck dot Vives so

502
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,280
here we can see this is within the the

503
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,290
Hades SDK and it's calling the qihoo 360

504
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,450
replug in apps so that is where it's

505
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,230
loading the the Dex file all that to

506
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,820
basically say that you had to kind of

507
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,110
step through different versions

508
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,300
different classes to actually get your

509
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,210
way to Hades from that initial

510
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:32,770
initializer subclass no okay that just

511
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,610
played it automatically there we go okay

512
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,330
so other than the actual plug-in going

513
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,440
through different iterations of

514
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,720
obfuscation not being encrypted being

515
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,120
encrypted the same thing was true of any

516
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,490
of the classes that were responsible for

517
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,320
dealing with Hades SDK the plug-in

518
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,140
itself all that good stuff so earlier

519
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,170
versions dating back to about 2018 all

520
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,090
of the strings were hard-coded and not

521
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,760
obfuscated but later especially in all

522
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,410
the versions where we saw the Dex file

523
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,359
called the ICO moon

524
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:06,369
all of the strings related to any plug

525
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:08,469
in activity were XOR encrypted and

526
00:20:08,469 --> 00:20:10,899
base64 encoded like you can see over

527
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:13,059
here and I just have a little comment

528
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:15,279
showing what it actually what I actually

529
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,309
says if it wasn't encrypted in encoded

530
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:20,769
but for every single class they actually

531
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:23,769
had their own string as the encryption

532
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:26,919
string so for the Hades SDK package all

533
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:28,509
of those classes were encrypted with

534
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:33,609
this robbing hi string what was fun

535
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:35,339
about this was that these were all

536
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:38,460
encrypted using a public encryption

537
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,509
library I guess you want to call it

538
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:43,059
called string fog which is appropriately

539
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:45,249
named and you too can find it on github

540
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:47,859
because it's open source and free so

541
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:49,859
that made figuring that out a lot easier

542
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:52,479
and each of these classes facilitate

543
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:54,129
something to do with loading the plug-in

544
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,450
or interacting with the plug-in or

545
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,219
loading the add libraries or figuring

546
00:20:57,219 --> 00:21:01,349
out where the plug-in was located so

547
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:04,889
what does this mean for the future of

548
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,789
adware and what does this mean for

549
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:09,869
researchers because we're seeing a

550
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,339
pretty significant increase in the

551
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,869
number of applications that are using

552
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:16,029
more sophisticated approaches to

553
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:18,369
creating these kind of adware

554
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:20,679
applications and trying to basically

555
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,499
monopolize on the popularity of their

556
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:29,349
applications so this is this was a kind

557
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:33,039
of stressful situation but it worked out

558
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,339
kind of interestingly so we reported all

559
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:38,559
of these apps to Google and then in June

560
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,830
2019 I published my research and that

561
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,589
deku tech stock dropped 20% so that was

562
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:47,469
a really fun getting a DM from their PR

563
00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:50,649
lady she was not pleased they removed

564
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:52,899
the plugin from a few of their apps and

565
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:55,299
uploaded versions and of course you know

566
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:58,389
released some statements but after a

567
00:21:58,389 --> 00:21:59,950
couple weeks we actually saw that the

568
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,779
plugin wasn't really removed from many

569
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,429
of the applications that had updated

570
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:05,200
versions so it looked like they had

571
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,399
uploaded in a new version but it was

572
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:10,479
really the same and in fact in in some

573
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:13,059
of the applications they had removed the

574
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:15,249
specific plugin but they had taken the

575
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:17,710
plug-in code and they said they reef

576
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,750
after dit they did they refactored it to

577
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,630
like do the same thing with in other

578
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,880
areas of the kind of carrier application

579
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,200
so there was no longer a plugin that was

580
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,190
being loaded they just kind of like

581
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,100
moved all the code over so we notify

582
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,380
Google of this again and at that point

583
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,779
Google temporarily removed all of the

584
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:36,730
apps from the Play Store and then it

585
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,779
actually banned them from the

586
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:40,840
advertising platform and and their stock

587
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,350
dropped 30% and and then at the end of

588
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,320
august by that point their stock had

589
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,870
dropped 40% of the original value so

590
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,549
this was an interesting case study of

591
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:53,260
seeing what happens when these kind of

592
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,929
big-name players are caught essentially

593
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:57,250
trying to bend the rules and thinking

594
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,720
they won't get caught because it had

595
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,010
some pretty devastating consequences I

596
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,000
really love this quote because I think

597
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,429
it accurately reflects what's happening

598
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:08,710
to the industry right now that if you

599
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,590
want to call it like the adware industry

600
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,760
but it's from a checkpoint researcher

601
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,409
and and he says you're starting to see

602
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:16,419
actors realizing that just regular

603
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:19,059
adware won't do these days if you want

604
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:20,590
the big money you need to invest in

605
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,000
infrastructure and research and

606
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,770
development and so that's what we were

607
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,690
seeing with companies like Khoo Teck

608
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,700
that are you know multi-million dollar

609
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,490
companies they have the dollars for

610
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,529
research and development and there we

611
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:33,789
can see them iterating on the

612
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:35,500
development of their software not just

613
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,669
in terms of the actual software

614
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:40,029
application but also you know the kind

615
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:41,289
of malicious activity that goes on

616
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:45,309
behind the scenes so we're seeing this

617
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:47,230
shift in the industry essentially

618
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,809
this is by no means an isolated case for

619
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:51,520
2019 there were a number of other

620
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,070
companies that did something similar do

621
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,289
global was banned from Google Play in

622
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:58,419
April 20 19 and at this point this was

623
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:01,000
considered the largest banning I guess

624
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,130
of developers from Google Play

625
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,080
they had about a hundred apps in the

626
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,600
Play Store and something like a half a

627
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,990
million no half a billion number of

628
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,460
downloads so that was a pretty

629
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,330
substantial banning and you know we're

630
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,000
seeing a really considerable increase in

631
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,110
the number of these more sophisticated

632
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,960
and obfuscated adware apps so we're no

633
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,250
longer just seeing these kind of like

634
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,350
poorly built apps that you could kind of

635
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,460
look through a couple of classes and

636
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,750
know exactly what they're doing people

637
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,580
are getting really creative so one

638
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,140
is an app that was was they released but

639
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,670
is a family of apps that were discovered

640
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,330
in 2019 called pre ammo and it actually

641
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,530
connected to three different ad

642
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,450
frameworks using three different methods

643
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,290
in order to try and and sort of dissuade

644
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,580
researchers from necessarily convicting

645
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,110
them based on just like one of those

646
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,000
methods so essentially you'd have to

647
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,260
figure out all the three different ways

648
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,370
that they were connecting to all the

649
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,540
three different ad networks and

650
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,850
potentially create some kind of

651
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,590
heuristic to notify your antivirus

652
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,040
software based on those four shared is a

653
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,320
file storage app that was quite popular

654
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,430
and that wasn't in the news a lot

655
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,160
I believe this summer and they did

656
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,900
something really creative as we talked

657
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,870
about the the unclick opal ads they

658
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,840
actually just used invisible overlays so

659
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,730
they would have these invisible overlays

660
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,890
over their actual application and then

661
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,450
any time the user was interacting with

662
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,490
the application it would register as a

663
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,130
click or a view for different ads so

664
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,820
that's kind of creative and then finally

665
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,480
agent Smith which is a nice reference to

666
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,150
the matrix here this adware started as

667
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,660
kind of just like a really clunky crappy

668
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,670
piece of adware that didn't really do

669
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,380
much other than display out of app ads

670
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,720
and then they actually iterated over it

671
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,130
to eventually create this this adware

672
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,630
that would essentially go through all of

673
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,220
the installed applications that a user

674
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,530
had on their device see if they had any

675
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,420
matching applications that they had kind

676
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,570
of like Trojan Iverson's of and then

677
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,030
install their own versions of those

678
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,010
applications in order to continue to

679
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,870
propagate ads so I mean the reference to

680
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,370
Agent Smith is just like duplicating

681
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,220
itself to try and just get more ads to

682
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,870
display on your device and therefore

683
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,830
have more revenue dollars for the

684
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,260
delivers developing this stuff and then

685
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,910
we're also seeing more actors actually

686
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,290
relying on using legitimate

687
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,690
infrastructure and this makes all of

688
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,800
their network traffic just appear a

689
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,970
little bit more legitimate so that's

690
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,410
sort of an easy way that they've they've

691
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,060
sort of tried to fool researchers or

692
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,670
antivirus software to to not have them

693
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:39,110
convicted so what does this mean for the

694
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,690
future of adware as I said we're seeing

695
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,220
an increase in the amount of off you

696
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,290
station and that means that there is

697
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,060
less low-hanging fruit for researchers

698
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,460
like me to - basically convict things

699
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,720
right away you have to do a little bit

700
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,760
more digging and it's more challenging

701
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,580
for not only researchers but certain

702
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,900
antivirus solutions or you know um kind

703
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,370
of deterrents like Google bouncer to

704
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,680
actually convict these these adware

705
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,380
families out right we're seeing a

706
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,210
continued introduction of add plugins or

707
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,130
functionality that sort of crosses the

708
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,480
border between appropriate and

709
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,190
inappropriate ways of serving ads and

710
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,200
and policy violations for these

711
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,460
different app stores and not just with

712
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,460
Google Play but with others as well and

713
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,450
then of course what we've talked about

714
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,670
in the the prime example from our case

715
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,560
study being KU Tech with these larger

716
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,390
and considered reputable companies

717
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,340
actually investing research and

718
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,200
development dollars to produce these

719
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,360
more sophisticated and novel ways of

720
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,390
circumventing Av checks to kind of get

721
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,680
their ads delivered to more people

722
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,310
without being caught so this kind of

723
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,620
marks a really interesting change in the

724
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,300
future of what was once considered kind

725
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,780
of like the not so exciting malware to

726
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,670
sort of investigate and it'll be

727
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,050
interesting to see what 20/20 brings

728
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,400
because I think people are going to have

729
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,000
to get more creative so thank you so

730
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,040
much for listening I think for questions

731
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,740
I will just be behind the registration

732
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,630
desk if you have anything you want to

733
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,470
talk about thanks so much
