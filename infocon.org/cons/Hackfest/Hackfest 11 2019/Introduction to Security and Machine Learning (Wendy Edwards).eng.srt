1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,030
thank you so much for coming this is my

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,010
first time speaking at hackfest and very

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,410
happy to be there be here I really like

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,270
Quebec so just I'll just start by

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,410
introducing myself

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,560
I'm from Urbana Illinois where the

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,019
University of Illinois is about actually

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,970
200 kilometers south of the Chicago

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,480
Blackhawks so I'm a software developer

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,880
and I'm in a NASA program called the

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,710
data noughts where we got to learn we

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,239
got the opportunity to learn about data

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,390
science and so I'm interested in

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,160
basically both data science and security

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,410
and I got very interested in finding an

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,270
area where those intersected and so I've

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,050
been basically studying basically data

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,370
science and machine learning and

19
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,870
cybersecurity and I would just like to

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,120
share some of the things I learned I was

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,610
also part of this 2017 sans woman's

22
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,620
Academy where I was able to earn 3 GI

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,400
ACC certifications I'm we word 7/10 on

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,600
Twitter a shabarimala francais Jew by

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,860
the booth - LeMond parle Anglais yes ok

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,340
so I don't speak French very well so

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,900
actually let's so I'm curious how many

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,360
people have have had a vendor talk about

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,250
how their mission their product uses AI

30
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,280
or machine learning or deep learning

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,360
anybody heard that from a vendor at all

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,540
oh yeah ok the vendors never ever

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,390
mentioned that right so then we could

34
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,829
actually start out by just talking about

35
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,930
what what do these terms even mean and

36
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,810
so one way of thinking about AI machine

37
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,670
learning and deep learning is you could

38
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,560
look at it as this egg diagram or you

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
could look at it as it's been described

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,640
as a set of Russian dolls

41
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,229
we're basically AI is on the outside

42
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,329
layer it encompasses everything machine

43
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,670
learning is a slightly smaller subset

44
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,299
and then deep learning is basically a

45
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:09,810
slightly smaller subset of that so so if

46
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,060
if you're hearing the terms used

47
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,890
somewhere interchangeably it's like

48
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,390
basically there you're talking about

49
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,240
sort of a subset relation so basically

50
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,830
so what comes to mind when people think

51
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:30,390
of artificial intelligence nobody I mean

52
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,030
I was thinking of I mean I was thinking

53
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,660
of the movie 2000 because Hal came to

54
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,780
life in Urbana Illinois after all look

55
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,220
Dave I can see you're really upset about

56
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,820
this

57
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,850
I honestly think you ought to sit down

58
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,740
calmly take a stress pill and think

59
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,200
things over

60
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,190
it doesn't ring a bell with very many

61
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:56,070
people okay so basically it's been

62
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,510
described as the branch of computer

63
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,190
science dealing of the reproduction of

64
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,620
mimicking of human level intelligence

65
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,730
self-awareness knowledge consciousness

66
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,770
thought in computer programs in other

67
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,980
words it's artificial intelligence is

68
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,800
where a computer tries to emulate some

69
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,450
things we think of as being part of

70
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,220
human intelligence so it doesn't really

71
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:26,160
work quite the same way so basically uh

72
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,989
machine learning I could put a

73
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,340
definition up here it is it basically

74
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,500
involves a lot of math statistics and

75
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,560
algorithms and there are two terminology

76
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,330
two major term you were to come across

77
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,680
when you talk about machine learning

78
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,140
there it's called supervised and

79
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,450
unsupervised learning

80
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,630
so it has anybody heard of those before

81
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,820
okay so supervised learning is

82
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,739
essentially a supervised learning

83
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,440
essentially you at some level start out

84
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,239
with some some hopefully right answers

85
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,910
right you're you basically start out

86
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,560
with a set of correctly labeled data

87
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,220
that you use as training data in

88
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,660
unsupervised learning is we're

89
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,070
interesting unsupervised learning you

90
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,470
don't get to start out with correctly

91
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,260
labeled data you actually take this this

92
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,190
data such that you don't have any

93
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,310
transfers for and basically extract

94
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,720
knowledge and patterns from those

95
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:28,599
so my buddy so that's a I think you've

96
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:30,099
probably heard the term neural network

97
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:35,620
right so essentially a neural network

98
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,300
it's modeled on the human brain it's

99
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,979
modeled on the idea of neurons where

100
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,469
they get gets a certain amount of

101
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:43,210
certain inputs and basically if it gets

102
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,770
a certain level of input then it's

103
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,150
activated and it fighters and so

104
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,990
basically the what so basically nodes in

105
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,580
neural networks are kind of like neurons

106
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,159
they get assigned weight kind of weights

107
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,930
and thresholds so this is kind of hard

108
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,669
to just this is kind of a little a

109
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:02,110
little bit hard to visualize if you're

110
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,180
not familiar with it so I just got a

111
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,310
I've got a diagram it's like it starts

112
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,979
with the so the red stuff and the red

113
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,289
stuff on the far left is are basically

114
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:17,169
inputs you're it may be multiple kinds

115
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:19,389
of inputs and then this thing called

116
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,370
hidden those are the basically those are

117
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,839
the hidden layers in this case it just

118
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:25,659
has one hidden layer but those those are

119
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,370
kind of the neurons you think about and

120
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,800
then those actually feed you then out

121
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,469
the input so it's not necessarily a

122
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:34,419
completely one-way process because it

123
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,219
tends to continually can continuously

124
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:41,080
get feedback and we're I it it kind of

125
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,180
content continuously gets feedback and

126
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,860
kind of adjust its computation and

127
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,990
weights and stuff until it gets closer

128
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,020
and closer to the right answer in that

129
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,759
let's see so I got so I got hopefully a

130
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:57,180
video this is really kind of neat it's

131
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,830
it's called player it's at a site called

132
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,319
playground tensorflow org and anybody

133
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,139
can use it for free and I put the link

134
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,500
in my slides but kind of easy to see it

135
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,969
this is actually an animation of a

136
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,969
network a neural network in progress you

137
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:14,169
can kind of seen your browser you can

138
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:17,500
have draw you can basically add the

139
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,969
features that are your input features

140
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:22,330
you can you can adjust your number of

141
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:28,500
neurons and your layers and and

142
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,759
visualize the output so I don't know it

143
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,589
can you can you guys see that very well

144
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:34,469
from your Amir where you're sitting or

145
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:38,289
um but at any rate I'm going to tweet

146
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:40,030
out my slides after I get done

147
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,800
and the Lincoln's - the link to the site

148
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,120
if you want to play with it is going to

149
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:51,430
be in the slides but if you continue to

150
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,590
watch this you can kind of see the you

151
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,660
can kind of see the inputs and the

152
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,000
weights and stuff getting refined kind

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,040
of in response to the feedback as far as

154
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,740
and basically the input keeps getting

155
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,220
better and better

156
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,340
anyhow that that is that is the best I

157
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,690
could that is the best I could come up

158
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,670
with for just visualizing a neural

159
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:18,790
network in action and like I could feel

160
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,350
really bad about doing a presentation

161
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,790
without any MEMS yeah but it's always

162
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,760
this is very realistic because like when

163
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,990
people talk about machine learning they

164
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,370
think of it as some kind of like magic

165
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,020
black box or something and that's not

166
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,720
really what it is I mean a lot of times

167
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,710
that people when they're working knew

168
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,060
that they need to know what kind of data

169
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,710
they're working with and they're kind of

170
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,960
continuously tweaking the parameters and

171
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,610
the model and stuff to make it better I

172
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,490
mean I I mean if you if you go to the

173
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,360
site and stuff

174
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,180
you can even experience that as you see

175
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,490
as you tweak your inputs and parameters

176
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,990
and stuff you could get better and

177
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:59,920
better results so actually deep learning

178
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,290
very specifically refers to these neural

179
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,000
networks so basically that basically ID

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,470
when they talk about deep learning and

181
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,180
thinking probably a lot of vendors have

182
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,640
used that too so that it's very

183
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,500
specifically referring to the two of

184
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,790
these neural network as I showed you in

185
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,190
action

186
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,140
in the end they could be and they can

187
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,760
actually be both say both supervised and

188
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,820
unsupervised so one thing that's very

189
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,270
useful about this is a lot of times when

190
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,620
we're detecting threats and bad

191
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,240
behaviors where you lie on signatures

192
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,610
which are kind of like signs or

193
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,299
descriptions with a associated with the

194
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,270
malware exploits known behavior and so

195
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,830
basically if you eat so you had known

196
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,480
throughout the signatures are very good

197
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,990
and the problem is zero day the zero day

198
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,580
exploits and stuff you don't you usually

199
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,980
don't have signatures to plug into your

200
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,970
into like your IDs or your antivirus

201
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,750
software so basically this this is where

202
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,200
a deep learning comes in and the deep

203
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,920
learning is good for detecting a lot of

204
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,920
anomaly detection it could detect

205
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,680
basically a user and behavior user

206
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,190
behavior issues I'm sorry user and

207
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,530
behavior anomalies like for example like

208
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,990
they've been used to detect insider

209
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,670
fraud insider threats and fraud and

210
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,900
stuff like that as well

211
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:53,760
I see so this is just assistant this is

212
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,470
just an example paper that I read if I'm

213
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,820
very interesting um so naturally so one

214
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,470
applications it's very common with deep

215
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,640
learning it's not usually associated

216
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,130
with security but you see it in a lot

217
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,480
with deep learning is is like natural

218
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,209
language processing like if you like for

219
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,550
example if you go to a deep Elcom that

220
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,640
that is that could be even that a piece

221
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,779
of a lot of people consider that even

222
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,649
better than Google Translate but you

223
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:21,149
know but you don't often but you don't

224
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:24,029
see a lot of NLP in security but

225
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:26,399
Microsoft is found a very interesting a

226
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,410
very interesting application of this so

227
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,029
this is so they essentially used this

228
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:39,120
algorithm called word avec we just sort

229
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,600
of it which is kind of a neural net that

230
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,610
is able to take to take these words and

231
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,350
kind of embed them and in vectors that

232
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,149
show kind of it show something about the

233
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:50,610
context and how how far apart they are

234
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,130
from each other and they call it

235
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,520
contextual embedding and they they got

236
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,930
some very good results from that they

237
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,480
they so a lot of times your power um a

238
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,100
lot of times like your PowerShell

239
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,770
commands they have aliases right and

240
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,940
also if you've got a malicious script

241
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,800
people will very often try to obfuscate

242
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,040
it they'll try to consider I mean

243
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,329
they'll try to intentionally make it

244
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:19,730
hard to break down and this this

245
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,140
actually was it actually turned out to

246
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,870
be very effective against that this was

247
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,579
just just a somewhat interesting use

248
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,279
case I found so actually skipping over

249
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:35,699
to preparing the data so you got a few

250
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:37,980
things you got a you've got a school say

251
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,360
you talked about data selection and

252
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,399
sampling sometimes you can use all the

253
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,649
data but sometimes if you've got a whole

254
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,930
lot of data like for example your

255
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,529
network flow and stuff that's that it's

256
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:51,149
not quite you have too much data it's

257
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:51,720
now cracked

258
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,970
it's not practical to Elliott value with

259
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,230
everything you have to come up with some

260
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,060
way of sampling and selecting

261
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:01,529
another thing that they talk about is

262
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:04,349
feature extraction so with feature

263
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,179
extraction so you've got this this whole

264
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:08,489
front you've got this stream data or

265
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:10,799
something coming in at you right like

266
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,899
let's say you're trying to you're you're

267
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,099
trying to look at your network traffic

268
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,659
or something you maybe you've got a pcap

269
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:22,259
file it's like you're well if you're not

270
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:24,659
going to say dump the peacock pcap file

271
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:26,099
directly and to say something like

272
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:27,709
tensorflow

273
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,879
you're you need to you need to baby

274
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,399
decide so what what part of the network

275
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,099
traffic are you interested in what feat

276
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:39,179
what features do you care about like for

277
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,639
example are you looking maybe for a

278
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,509
certain payloads are you looking for

279
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:49,559
maybe sir maybe going going to certain

280
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,929
addresses with poor going to certain

281
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:55,319
servers with poor reputations that show

282
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:57,989
up in a threat intelligence feed and so

283
00:12:57,989 --> 00:13:00,569
so essentially a feature extraction it's

284
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:02,399
like you need to understand something of

285
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,929
the domain and decide which features

286
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:06,269
that you you want to think about and

287
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:07,409
we're to talk a little bit more about

288
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:10,979
that later then with it featuring coding

289
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:14,579
and vectorization essentially that just

290
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,199
means that you need to represent things

291
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:19,159
in a mathematical way that these

292
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,919
packages can understand and then there's

293
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,939
finally there's something called

294
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:27,989
normalization nobody but has anybody

295
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:29,299
heard of that before

296
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:32,309
yeah so essentially with normalization

297
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:36,809
it's like you have maybe you've got to

298
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:38,729
two variables you care about one has a

299
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:42,029
much wider variation than the other well

300
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,679
if you don't normalize those the one

301
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,179
with a wider variation is gonna have

302
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:46,619
maybe a disproportion about I've been

303
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:50,039
influenced on the results so actually

304
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,169
here's an example of a normal just

305
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:55,349
normalize data like for example you can

306
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:58,709
see that there's a lot more that just

307
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:02,069
the CPU utilization present and the

308
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:03,899
request per se the scale is completely

309
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,179
different and so normalization you

310
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,099
probably want to find a way to us yeah

311
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:10,649
it's a pretty simple it's a pretty

312
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,060
simple equation you just want

313
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,920
to basically represent the data all the

314
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,770
data on a scale from zero to one and so

315
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,420
here's an example how we normalize some

316
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:24,750
data okay so a big part of machine

317
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,520
learning with security is pattern

318
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:37,980
recognition like for example there's

319
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,380
something called data mining knowledge

320
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,690
discovery in knowledge kdd which I

321
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,730
remember that calling knowledge

322
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,100
discovery and something but that tries

323
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,720
to just that it tends to discover like

324
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,760
just unknown patterns that are located

325
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,590
in the data and sometimes you want to

326
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,560
discover to basically find very explicit

327
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,400
characteristics about the data and so

328
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,020
essentially when you talk about pattern

329
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,630
recognition you can say you've got these

330
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,460
things it recognizes that it can extract

331
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,030
certain patterns that are related to the

332
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,250
known data you're passing in and it can

333
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,660
take those patterns that has discovered

334
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,300
and apply it to unknown data so like for

335
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,100
example you have like some known hostile

336
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,920
traffic or you've got some no malware

337
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,250
and stuff like it like you can feed it

338
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,190
you can feed it to a machine learning

339
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,160
system and it can in it get an extract

340
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,360
characteristics about it and then it

341
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,320
goes straight and then you can start

342
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,390
feeding may be unknown software or

343
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,670
unknown traffic to it to say well does

344
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,110
it look like this it pretty much it's

345
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,460
like so does it look like this bad stuff

346
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,880
you saw earlier and so there's there's a

347
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,020
lot of them I think so the most obvious

348
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,300
or just your spam and your botnets and

349
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:54,960
your malware so basically the with with

350
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,460
clustering the whole idea with

351
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,920
clustering really is that bad things

352
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:07,260
happen together so um let's see I don't

353
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,100
know if you what I think about this or

354
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,230
not like so if we the audience agree

355
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,730
that the remaining audience and you

356
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,560
needed to arrange yourself into clusters

357
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,350
how would you do it um I mean it's like

358
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,420
so maybe you would try to find people

359
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,980
maybe you try to find people who are

360
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,840
sitting close to you and arrange

361
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,570
yourselves in groups

362
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,560
instead of going across the room you

363
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,980
maybe you would do it that way and so um

364
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,900
what I heard stirs clusters it's like

365
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,000
you're trying to find points that are

366
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,920
close together and there's typically

367
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,830
mathematical ways of measuring closest

368
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,210
together you can do it the Manhattan

369
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,100
distance or you can do the Euclidean

370
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,330
distance but that's usually pretty

371
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,000
straightforward and so the whole idea is

372
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,740
that basically study the items within a

373
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,560
cluster are going to be hopefully more

374
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,330
similar to each other than items that

375
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,870
are not in a given cluster and so

376
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,580
there's there's actually there's really

377
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,380
a lot of ways you can do this there's

378
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,280
something called there is and we'll just

379
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,750
talk about a couple of the most common

380
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,910
ones very common ones called kami

381
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:16,380
k-means and DB scan let's see so the

382
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,209
whole fundamental idea with k-means that

383
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:19,459
you kind of you kind of try to group

384
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:22,470
data points together and discover

385
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,050
underlying patterns so I mean

386
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,290
essentially you start by uh so you

387
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,080
really you start by just picking picking

388
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,020
in like art just just putting centroids

389
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,040
in arbitrary locations trying and

390
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,930
iterating is true until you can discover

391
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,720
the optimal to the the optimal location

392
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,260
for the centroids so it's a fairly

393
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,420
simple algorithm so this is just a

394
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,940
picture of how it works so initially

395
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,580
it's kind of random

396
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,420
initially it's kind of random that's not

397
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,910
very good round one gets a little better

398
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,430
around two it's still better and then

399
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,370
finally you get a not a basically an

400
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,830
optimal like it you get what's a pretty

401
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:12,510
good cluster and then then under the

402
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,980
okay another approach you could take

403
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,870
it's this is this is really common it

404
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,150
shows up very often in like research

405
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,310
papers about machine learning and

406
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,830
security it's called DBC on and honestly

407
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,570
I keep thinking of it as being about

408
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,710
databases but it is not it's about

409
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,300
densities base facial clustering of

410
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,910
applications with noise and then the

411
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,560
noise of the noise is significant too

412
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,300
because they because they you actually

413
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,840
want to find the noise so

414
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,770
so basically that takes two parameters

415
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,779
basically it's EPS also known as epsilon

416
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,700
that specializes that specifies how

417
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,890
close the point should be together to be

418
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,140
considered part of a cluster and then

419
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,450
min points is basically what's your

420
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,400
minimum number of points that could be

421
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,159
considered a cluster so you just put you

422
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,330
past those two parameters so it's it's

423
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,549
some basically it's an iterative process

424
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,320
just like k-means you start with an

425
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,309
arbitrary point if in basically if you

426
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:18,510
can start form a cluster you can start

427
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,360
to form a cluster you do if you cannot

428
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,010
form a cluster at the point label it is

429
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,820
noise and basically you you kind of

430
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,710
continue this until you built your

431
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,179
cluster and then you restart with

432
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,559
another point that has not been visited

433
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,750
and do the same thing until you

434
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,330
basically have a number of clusters one

435
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,919
thing that's a bit different about DB

436
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,380
scan is that what the k-means you have

437
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,419
to tell it how many how many clusters

438
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,320
you want you want and that that actually

439
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,970
reinforce a lot of that does involve

440
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,929
some trying error DB scan DB scan will

441
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:53,370
come up with a number of clusters for

442
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,399
you so you do that you are possibly

443
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:58,320
gonna want to tweak your your a meters

444
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,940
as far as like your epsilon and your

445
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,820
minimum number of points okay so this is

446
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,730
just showing your DB scan cluster in

447
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:13,799
action so there's so I don't know how I

448
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,390
know I don't know how well you guys can

449
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,820
see that you've got but you've got

450
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,230
yellow green and red and then you've got

451
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,210
these points on the outside that are

452
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,000
kind of black and those are those so

453
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,049
those will be considered your noise

454
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:30,470
points

455
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:45,010
okay so actually this so it just as for

456
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,990
some case studies I found some some

457
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,240
rather interesting ones from Trend Micro

458
00:20:49,240 --> 00:21:02,080
Micro and and Symantec so so um this is

459
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,710
the Symantec Laurie the Symantec visa is

460
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,940
that Symantec actually started with

461
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,660
looking at the HTTP flows and and trying

462
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,860
to look for things that were consistent

463
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,950
with known malware attacks and so there

464
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,990
so we talked earlier about features like

465
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,920
what do you what do you care about but

466
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,790
features a lot of times it's like what

467
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,050
kind of information are you trying to

468
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,460
extract from this that you might care

469
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,280
about so there were actually a couple of

470
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,060
very significant features the when they

471
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,960
were trying to fight when they were

472
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,970
trying to find attacks if they could

473
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,580
cluster as ransomware that very often

474
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,050
showed up in the URL that the basically

475
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,730
they were able to be URL information

476
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,430
gave them allowed them to cluster

477
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,560
ransomware attacks collect together

478
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,630
which is pretty interesting the other

479
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,870
ones were generic malware and what that

480
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,130
that was actually more related to the

481
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,540
payload because that was specifically

482
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,090
the file type like so that was related

483
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,880
to like your file type the malware was

484
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,800
coming across and stuff like PDFs and

485
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,140
shockwave and stuff and basically files

486
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,730
like that which is a pretty normal way

487
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:18,130
to deliver malware and then it's inside

488
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,630
Symantec they did something and they did

489
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,060
something kind of interesting they

490
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,660
basically so they it's the so some

491
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,490
semantics is run either SOC and they

492
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,970
want to uh basically cluster their the

493
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,680
incidents that happened in their in

494
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,170
their SOC s together and so they want to

495
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,870
basically see like how similar if events

496
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,760
are like so can they can they respond to

497
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,760
them in a similar way is there it can

498
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,750
they learn anything from how they're

499
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:50,050
handled in the past and and they

500
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,029
actually they actually were able to

501
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:53,679
she had quite a bit of success like they

502
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,409
were a figure out like for example if

503
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:57,789
they got like a know where a malware

504
00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:00,009
attack they were to a cluster a lot of

505
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:02,229
things that came into their SOC with

506
00:23:02,229 --> 00:23:05,379
that male with that malware attack they

507
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:07,539
could also look for like certain they

508
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:08,859
also were a little for certain behaviors

509
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:12,429
that were not good like for example like

510
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:15,249
if you're monitoring a network like it's

511
00:23:15,249 --> 00:23:16,599
like if somebody's attacking you what

512
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,919
kinds of things might they do they might

513
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,469
start scanning you right like they might

514
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:21,700
start looking for certain they might

515
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,289
start looking for vulnerable services

516
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:25,509
they might they might start me for like

517
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:28,749
do you have an open SMTP server you and

518
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:32,769
ft do have services like FTP or LDAP or

519
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:33,729
something that could that might be

520
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:35,499
vulnerable that might that could be

521
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:38,649
abused or provide some information for

522
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:41,379
them and so they were they were able to

523
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:46,029
look look at that as well to see just no

524
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:49,299
no they were they were able to look at

525
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:52,359
that as well and closer those kinds of

526
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:56,979
attacks together as well so just as far

527
00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:00,969
as clustering um takeaways they could be

528
00:24:00,969 --> 00:24:03,129
a um they can be applied to a lot of

529
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:05,009
different ends of data like for example

530
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:08,739
categorical and continuous when they

531
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,239
talk about the relevant features be

532
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,979
extracted and normalized and that does

533
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:13,539
mean that you probably need to know

534
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:14,769
something with the domain and the data

535
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,059
you're dealing with so you know what

536
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:17,409
kinds of features you want to it you

537
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:22,479
might want to extract there a lot of

538
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,619
times with machine learning there are

539
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:26,289
validation error validation techniques a

540
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:28,389
lot of times if you're trying to build a

541
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:29,950
two cluster you maybe look at the

542
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,919
cluster and you see you basically look

543
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:35,919
maybe how how close the claw how close

544
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,489
the clusters are how does that how many

545
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:41,559
how many elements are in clusters how

546
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:43,059
does that perform to other other

547
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:45,519
clustering algorithms so there are there

548
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,899
actually are some ways you can validate

549
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:52,210
that and so it's so basically what it it

550
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,609
the way it works is really kind of what

551
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:56,019
it did with the SOC in the network it's

552
00:24:56,019 --> 00:24:58,210
they they started with like a big SOC is

553
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,739
gonna have lots and a lot of data lots

554
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:01,089
and lots of data and it allowed them to

555
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:02,769
basically take this vast amount of data

556
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:05,999
and sift through it

557
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,049
okay so classification it sounds kind of

558
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:12,730
like clustering but it's at but it's but

559
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:18,960
it's a bit different so um basically

560
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,809
classification is like watch what is the

561
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:24,580
likelihood that something is in a given

562
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,440
class so like if you're gonna classify

563
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,799
people here many ideas how you would how

564
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,700
you would do it okay like tabs versus

565
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:47,559
leaves no sorry but it's but it's but

566
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:48,309
essentially the client that

567
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:49,480
classification is a little bit different

568
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,639
it's like youyou know what classes or

569
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:52,960
categories you want to use and that's so

570
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,919
that's actually a little bit that's

571
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,120
works a little bit differently than

572
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,820
clustering and so that is because then

573
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,710
it's basically considered a supervised

574
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,820
learning because it's kind of like

575
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,340
you're starting with the answers the the

576
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,750
samples have already been collect

577
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,529
correctly labeled and identified and

578
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:10,750
then it's and it's also possible just to

579
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,429
bear in mind with classification that a

580
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:13,990
sample can belong to kind of multiple

581
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:20,500
categories at once so just some

582
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,570
classification just some examples of uh

583
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,320
here's an example of what somebody did

584
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,549
mistake lassic example they wanted to

585
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:30,399
they wanted to detect a botnet command

586
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:34,330
and control center um so what they did

587
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,409
was they was they issued HTTP request to

588
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:41,500
benign in CNC controls is so well

589
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,970
actually let me clarify that what they

590
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,960
did was they took a list of files and

591
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,909
file headers URLs that were known or

592
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:50,769
associated with kind of known sketchy

593
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:53,889
C&C sites and so they specifically

594
00:26:53,889 --> 00:27:00,190
requested those in basic and and and

595
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,110
they saved the responses and the well of

596
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,519
course the response codes because like

597
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:06,610
for example if you get a if you get say

598
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,370
a 404 or something that's that meaning

599
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,360
like that would mean that the file

600
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,590
wasn't there and that's different if you

601
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,059
then if you get a 200 and you get the

602
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:17,590
file right with an HTTP request so they

603
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,720
were actually able to create a

604
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,009
decision tree model in the basically

605
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,470
saying essentially if they get what I

606
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,960
think it's what they make if they got

607
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,509
enough hits on the sketchy looking file

608
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:32,980
patterns they were to conclude that it

609
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,809
was fairly likely that this was a cnc

610
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:38,730
sia server

611
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:49,779
vicen so essentially it's a supervised

612
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:51,490
learning while it can work well when

613
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,139
there is a sufficient quality quantity

614
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:55,690
of accurately labeled data and one

615
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,669
challenge and security is it's kind of

616
00:27:57,669 --> 00:27:59,740
it says if there is a sufficient quality

617
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,659
of accurately labeled data so in

618
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:04,320
security that's not always the case

619
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,370
though essentially so you've got the

620
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:09,629
fourth age of biology you've got the

621
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:11,590
training and then you then the

622
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,909
validation where you do something to

623
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:15,159
actually to actually test to make sure

624
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:17,740
whether you're whether your model makes

625
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,289
sense a very common way of validating a

626
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:23,259
machine learning is that you you take

627
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:25,629
your training data but you you withhold

628
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:27,220
some of it you keep some of it out of

629
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,529
the training model and then you run your

630
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:31,149
model and you generate your model and

631
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:32,769
then you take the data that you've held

632
00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:34,389
out against it and you see how well that

633
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:37,210
performs and that that is a fairly cut

634
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,740
like saying so does your model still

635
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,600
hold up when you test it with this new

636
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,250
with this new data that you haven't used

637
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,080
in training and that's that's just a

638
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,769
very common way you do your validation

639
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:53,470
um another thing with classification is

640
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,789
you're not you're not getting absolutely

641
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:57,159
you're not getting absolutes it's not

642
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:59,409
going to say this is absolutely a CNC

643
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:03,159
server or this is absolutely botnet it's

644
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,720
basically to tell you how likely it is

645
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,399
and so um a lot of things a lot of a big

646
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:11,110
problem a big known problem with like

647
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,220
machine learning is you get false

648
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,559
positives and false negatives and so

649
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,179
like false positives or like when you

650
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:18,190
get an alert it tells you that there's a

651
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,679
problem there's not and false negative

652
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:22,240
is when it tells you that something is

653
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,230
okay and it's not and so a problem with

654
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,779
false false positives and security is

655
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:30,279
that it can chew up a whole lot of your

656
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:32,409
time like if it's if it's constantly

657
00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:34,019
going off

658
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:35,980
throwing up alerts you have to deal with

659
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,019
it can waste all that I can't your time

660
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:40,059
and it can teach people to ignore and

661
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:41,350
connect each field even ignore the

662
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,720
system and false-negatives are kind of

663
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,879
obviously a problem me because well it

664
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:47,919
means the system's not not doing what

665
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,809
you wanted to do you you want it to tell

666
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:51,970
you there's a problem and it's not so

667
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,080
those are both so these are actually

668
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,239
both big problems and they're both risks

669
00:29:55,239 --> 00:30:00,279
with machine learning so this is said

670
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,049
this is actually a little bit different

671
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:03,249
we talked earlier about pattern

672
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:06,549
recognition absolutely so the idea like

673
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:10,359
what is normal but a state of mind so

674
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:11,919
the whole idea is that we want to we

675
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,019
want to establish some rough idea of

676
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:17,619
what normal looks like and we talked

677
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:20,019
when we talked about this this deviation

678
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,519
of from normal we could we Club we can

679
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,029
call them anomalies or outliers ends and

680
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:27,309
security of nominees anomalies and

681
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:30,929
something that's unusual is often bad

682
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,720
and so for example like anomalies often

683
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,549
mean that we have like an intruder or a

684
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:42,070
breach or an exploit going on so just

685
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,659
your overall goals with an intrusion

686
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:46,359
system just for the reasons we talked

687
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,919
about earlier you want low false

688
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,659
positives and low false negatives so

689
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:51,159
that it does your job it said it does

690
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:52,629
its job without wasting a lot of

691
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:54,549
people's time I mean the whole reason

692
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:55,809
you might want it you're gonna want to

693
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:58,629
plug machine learning in is basically to

694
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:02,919
save people's time to automate to maybe

695
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:04,359
ideally automate some of the tedious

696
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:06,399
tasks that you're soces or not gonna

697
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,690
want us but we're not want to spend

698
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,340
their time doing you want to be

699
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:13,629
basically easy to easy to work with and

700
00:31:13,629 --> 00:31:15,850
it's just with exploits and threats and

701
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,429
stuff the I mean landscape changes

702
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:20,889
constantly in security isn't it I mean I

703
00:31:20,889 --> 00:31:23,710
mean it's like you're your latest worms

704
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,309
or the latest alerts like when like when

705
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:28,869
is the last time is a security alert

706
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:30,899
probably today

707
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:34,419
and ideally uh ideally like

708
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:36,359
resource-efficient because it's with

709
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:38,559
what security here you can be talking

710
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,549
about very large amounts of data in fact

711
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:46,210
I bet it's in fact some of the some of

712
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,559
the security the

713
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:50,230
the software and stuff has specifically

714
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,450
you uses tools like Anoop and stuff to

715
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,440
deal with big data and there's also some

716
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,149
people explainable alerts does that make

717
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:58,480
sense

718
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,340
I mean essentially you want to know if

719
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,840
it's if it's - if it's telling you

720
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,370
something's wrong you want it you want

721
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,049
to be able to trace back Wyatt made that

722
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:07,059
decision like for example if it tells

723
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,700
you to delete somebody's account that

724
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,049
person is maybe gonna want to know why

725
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:13,269
their account got deleted so you're know

726
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:15,850
probably to be a you're gonna want to be

727
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,049
able to understand the system well

728
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:22,119
enough to know why I did what it did so

729
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:24,159
let's just talk so we talked earlier

730
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,509
about just features and stuff and what

731
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:29,769
we might want to look for in here are

732
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:31,450
see and these are some things you might

733
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,759
want it you might want to look for in

734
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:36,399
host intrusion I mean so gonna be

735
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,639
looking at you'd be looking at processes

736
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:42,519
are you seeing anything unusual walk in

737
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:46,740
in sometimes processes on an attack are

738
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,059
camouflaged looked pretty close to

739
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:50,039
something that's normal

740
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,840
like just a little bit off I don't be

741
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,799
seen that you can see after new user

742
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,019
accounts like it basically it created

743
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,110
this account why did it do it is it

744
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,999
loading and a kernel modules it doesn't

745
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:07,029
usually look and then actually your your

746
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:08,649
DNS can tell you quite a bit is it

747
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:11,649
looking is it like for example is it

748
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:13,929
looking up sites that are is it looking

749
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:17,499
up locations or addresses that are happy

750
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:18,999
to be also showing up on your a thread

751
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:23,440
and tell feed so DNS lookups can

752
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,629
actually tell you wait a

753
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,399
network connections are kind of

754
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:29,379
important because well it's like if

755
00:33:29,379 --> 00:33:30,909
you're trying to connect like a a

756
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:33,340
command-and-control network or some I

757
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,350
mean just a lot of times if you've got a

758
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,090
compromised system it is trying to be

759
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,960
trying to communicate out right and then

760
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,740
another thing that you'll you'll see is

761
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,509
for is like for example with a Windows

762
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:49,269
attack it's going to uh try to moderate

763
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:50,950
you're gonna see your a registry

764
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:54,159
database messed with often right or

765
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,470
that's that's not uncommon when you get

766
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,240
like a Windows malware attack is it

767
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,619
yeah this is this is just a this is a

768
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:07,419
fairly useful tool if you want to

769
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:08,949
actually look at your host you see what

770
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,569
my I may be compromised

771
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:14,230
um I think probably a lot of you've

772
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:20,949
heard of it always query yes okay so

773
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,270
it's it's very it's really handy and

774
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,819
basically it can have even run query you

775
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:27,010
can even schedule queries it'll it'll

776
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,219
pop you like tables you know you can

777
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:33,279
freighter it's it's I believe it's free

778
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:38,429
it runs in it supports Windows and Linux

779
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:41,168
yeah that's and that is just a very good

780
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:43,929
way of getting information that you

781
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:46,059
might want to feed into a machine

782
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:48,569
learning algorithm

783
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,250
so then approach a network network

784
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,020
intrusion detection I just as we said

785
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,239
earlier that I see you've got a

786
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,980
compromised host it's going to in some

787
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,960
way try to initiate communication with

788
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,349
the outside world like whether it's

789
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,640
exfiltrating data or if it's talking to

790
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,400
a command and control server I mean and

791
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,700
your adware is trying to download ads to

792
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,160
show up on your machine your spywares

793
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,869
sending the results of your monitoring

794
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:17,079
somewhere and you and you can there are

795
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:18,039
a lot of tools you guys have probably

796
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:20,380
heard of them TCP dump I bet everybody's

797
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:25,359
sort of yes okay and then a snore is

798
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,970
that sports snorts fairly simple it's

799
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,010
sorts pretty popular it's fairly simple

800
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,599
and rule-based and then there's also a

801
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,410
tool if you guys you guys sort of broke

802
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:39,220
okay bro is now known as eek oh and that

803
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,980
that's that's kind of neat that's that's

804
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,069
like a row is almost bro is actually

805
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:49,170
kind of like a programming like language

806
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,140
specifically dedicated to monitoring and

807
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,730
analyzing network traffic it's really

808
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,299
it's pretty impressive

809
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,940
okay so another thing another year that

810
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,190
very often a very common target it's

811
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:07,000
called your web application so these are

812
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,589
so these are some things you might want

813
00:36:08,589 --> 00:36:10,089
to look for to feed into a machine

814
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:11,680
learning algorithm for your web for a

815
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,859
potential web intuition

816
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:15,190
I'll see you

817
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,480
I want to you might want to look at your

818
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,060
IP addresses again if it's connected to

819
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,160
if you're if you're hearing from if

820
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,720
you're looking at seeing sketchy IP

821
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,170
addresses one thing you could pop when

822
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,579
do you possibly do that sometimes

823
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:30,640
helpful is also geo locate I P addresses

824
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,819
I mean if you're if you're getting a lot

825
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:37,180
of a lot of logins to your small company

826
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,460
Network from like China or Romania maybe

827
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,700
that's a maybe that's not good you

828
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,589
should see kind of some and then

829
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:46,480
sometimes they you'll see some kind of

830
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,660
strange URL string as you'll see on

831
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,810
Knoll terminations your decoded URLs or

832
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,550
whatever and they're essentially trying

833
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,380
to evade signature so it's they're doing

834
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,700
funny things with strings to try to

835
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,440
evade I say signature based detection

836
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,410
and then kind of okay so like your

837
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,359
unusual referrer patterns I mean has

838
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:09,010
anybody here use curl a few of you right

839
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,430
okay so curls kind of a girl sort of a

840
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,680
nice tool you can even conceive I'd like

841
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,050
you can connect like it's a very nice

842
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,119
way to connect to a web server via the

843
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,130
command line and you can pass in a lot

844
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,540
of parameters and so it's like if you're

845
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,500
using curl you can tell it that your

846
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,079
that your user agent or referrers

847
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,510
whatever you want it to be and so like

848
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,710
for example if your wrist so if you're

849
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,030
seeing somebody who's using mozilla from

850
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,750
1998 it's it's possible that you it's

851
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,760
possible that that some date information

852
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,230
is getting manipulated i mean if you're

853
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,359
seeing something that's if you're seeing

854
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:47,680
something that's really old or really

855
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,349
strange it's possible that somebody's

856
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:54,880
manipulating something so the when they

857
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,859
talk about sequence of ex access to

858
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:57,819
endpoints doesn't have any creative

859
00:37:57,819 --> 00:38:01,960
fuzzing yes I like fuzzing is when

860
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,760
you're basically exposing is basically

861
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,200
you throw away a whole bunch of inputs

862
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,329
it's something to try to see if you can

863
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:09,310
make it somehow it's just try to see if

864
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,960
you can make it fail or expose some kind

865
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,180
of security hole and so when you start

866
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,760
seeing these really strange sequences of

867
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,050
access to endpoints that are not

868
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,670
consistent with what a normal user would

869
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,470
do it's possible somebody is prize

870
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,410
throwing a buzzer at you and so what are

871
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,119
these things is these these are all the

872
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,710
kinds of things you might look at to

873
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,930
feed into a machine where

874
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:33,760
learning tool and just for what it is

875
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,190
worth again I will tweet out I'll post

876
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,589
my slides online and tweet out the links

877
00:38:38,589 --> 00:38:42,190
the links so you got this other we've

878
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,020
got another tool called off forecasting

879
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,089
so we probably all heard of forecasting

880
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:50,230
like in terms of weather right and

881
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,890
slowly so um so you got it you've got

882
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,579
things called trends and then seasons

883
00:38:57,579 --> 00:39:00,670
and then cycles and that kind of means

884
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,260
that it kind of means that you were to

885
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,890
see some up and down and stuff in cycles

886
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,260
you're not gonna that a try you're not

887
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,760
going to necessarily see straight lines

888
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:20,800
up and down I mean it and so see so

889
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,619
basically this is this is just a this is

890
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:26,339
just basically a model that handles a

891
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:29,349
basically a forecast um these are also

892
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:30,940
described as time series because it's

893
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,559
like a lot of times they're something

894
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,640
that happens over it's over ice time and

895
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,609
then so you've got something called

896
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:42,030
arena it's the auto auto regressive

897
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,180
integrated moving moving average and so

898
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,680
that basically means that these models

899
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,940
are kind of dependent on kind of their

900
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:55,299
own past input no I mean this is so the

901
00:39:55,299 --> 00:39:58,119
so it's basically what I get it simply

902
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:59,950
gets its input from what's happened in

903
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,319
the past but it's somewhat more

904
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:03,130
sophisticated than a linear algorithm

905
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,099
because a lot of times like if you see a

906
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,750
time series trend it's it's not going to

907
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,970
be linear like for example if you look

908
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,280
at usage or something on your work

909
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,660
network you're hopefully not going to

910
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,190
see as much going on maybe in the middle

911
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,420
of the 90s you would during the middle

912
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,160
of the work day so you're not going to

913
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,299
so you're easier it's not gonna be a

914
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:20,859
straight line it's gonna kind of up and

915
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:26,530
down right and then though so this is

916
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,510
just a generic generic data straight

917
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,960
data series you can kind of see that's a

918
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,049
it's it's basically a daily series that

919
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:36,730
goes up and down but it's kind of but

920
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,230
it's kind of trending up but you can

921
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,849
kind of see that it's through that we're

922
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:42,040
Gretchen why that's it's so it's got its

923
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,609
cycles

924
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:44,789
but it's kind of trending upward right

925
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:47,680
and in this this is just this is just an

926
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,529
example of basically a time series that

927
00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:52,150
you can apply forecasting to this is a

928
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:56,710
generic thing cool what do you would it

929
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,430
put our unit to talk about CPU

930
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,380
utilization over a period time so let's

931
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,489
say this is this is a great a graph of

932
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:10,119
some known CPU data and so actually you

933
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,829
can apply it you'd apply something to go

934
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:14,799
ARIMA or in fact another forecasting

935
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:16,839
model to try to get an idea of what's

936
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:19,299
what's normal what can you expect on a

937
00:41:19,299 --> 00:41:20,829
particular time based on what's happened

938
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:24,339
in the past and so I don't know if you

939
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:27,039
can can you see the I just think can you

940
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:28,779
see the blue and black heard from there

941
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:34,390
and not very well okay so basically the

942
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,609
blue the blue is the actual data and the

943
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:39,220
blacks the model so you see they manage

944
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:43,569
they managed to fit that pretty well so

945
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:45,069
what we're gonna do I think we talked

946
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,299
earlier about like a lot of times you

947
00:41:46,299 --> 00:41:47,799
you want to like sometimes you would

948
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:50,349
have validate or you want to or you want

949
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:51,519
to check your model you're gonna go

950
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:53,619
ahead and take some you're gonna take

951
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:55,690
some data that's that's not in a sample

952
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,160
or we're gonna apply this model we came

953
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,470
up we came up with the last slide so

954
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:00,700
this is what the model looks like you

955
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,019
can see it's kind of blurry at the end

956
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,579
and that means they're not quite as

957
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:05,349
confident about it that means that

958
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:06,640
they're a little bit easier but what

959
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,470
happens and then this in the gray shows

960
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,920
the area this integration area and you

961
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,940
can see that the area so you can see

962
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,069
that the area does not line up very well

963
00:42:21,069 --> 00:42:23,470
with what was forecast so the air that

964
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,089
Brady airy and stuff doesn't line up

965
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:26,769
very well with with what was forecast

966
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:28,539
because if you look at if you look at

967
00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:30,730
the model in the past it was kind of it

968
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,499
was trending upwards it was it was

969
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:35,200
gradually trending upwards in that and

970
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,119
then in the area in the gray it's just

971
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,259
it's starting to drop

972
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:41,499
and then it's the upward trend wasn't

973
00:42:41,499 --> 00:42:43,059
continuing so it's a basically through

974
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:45,130
this model we can see that that was

975
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:48,039
viewed as kind of an anomaly does that

976
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:51,089
does that make any sense okay

977
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:58,240
so I'm sure um has anybody here not

978
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,210
heard of like a male where a family a

979
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:06,960
family are male we're like like no yes

980
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,810
okay so like a lot of times like you get

981
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:12,700
some male work this male worker comes in

982
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,620
and then you start getting these other

983
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,300
male where this other samples of malware

984
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,120
that or maybe a whole lot like it but

985
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,460
not exactly like it and it's like maybe

986
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,680
they're they're building it on different

987
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,270
compilers they're trying to evade

988
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,650
signatures or something like that but

989
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,120
it's really kind of the same thing doing

990
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,100
the same stuff and that's what they mean

991
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,640
by a malware yeah that's what they mean

992
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,350
by a malware family

993
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,970
in fact like this probably came coming

994
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:40,480
from the same people so traditionally

995
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,920
the malware like you know like your

996
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,540
typical Android virus thing you've got

997
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,430
the signature matching it matches kind

998
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,460
of known characteristics of this Miller

999
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:50,050
um and that's great except for what

1000
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:55,480
about when you get the zero days so you

1001
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,920
see news things I'm you guys heard of

1002
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,690
have you guys heard of static and you

1003
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:59,740
know interesting what static and dynamic

1004
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,090
analysis means with Miller

1005
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,160
it's like static analysis you're

1006
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,030
basically taking the binary and just the

1007
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,140
executable stuff analyzed it wasn't the

1008
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,140
executable and dynamic analysis it's

1009
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,730
like you're taking it in like a sandbox

1010
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:14,770
often like a VM or something and

1011
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:19,780
executing it so let's see so with me

1012
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,580
Android malware you might look for

1013
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,000
interesting strees specifically like

1014
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,070
hard-coded URLs and addresses that it

1015
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:31,060
might be using to talk to talk to a C&C

1016
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,370
to talk to a CNC server or some other

1017
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,880
11th server you might look at what what

1018
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,930
kinds of API calls does it make the

1019
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,000
network I mean just when you're doing

1020
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,200
when you're looking at it dynamically

1021
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,580
it's like I know what kind of network

1022
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,650
behavior does it does is it starting to

1023
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,290
try to initiate these these connections

1024
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:53,320
and if so why you want to look at what's

1025
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,050
changing your system like have you seen

1026
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,550
strange changes to your registry they

1027
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,140
don't make any sense with that kind of

1028
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,710
software with with what with what the

1029
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,710
software is supposed to be uh for

1030
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:08,339
example um and if you're looking at it

1031
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:10,619
something like Android or something you

1032
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:14,999
can also look at like Android you can

1033
00:45:14,999 --> 00:45:16,380
just put you can actually just look at

1034
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,789
the manifest and see if is requesting um

1035
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:22,769
permissions that are to greatly exceed

1036
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:24,329
what it would need to do that kind of

1037
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:26,729
thing because like a lot of times for

1038
00:45:26,729 --> 00:45:28,349
example people with mobile stuff they'll

1039
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:29,999
agree to just about anything

1040
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:32,789
I mean seriously have you like have you

1041
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:34,170
seen the permissions and stuff we were

1042
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,569
trying to uh install something there's

1043
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:38,819
phone it's like yeah I'd like to access

1044
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,819
your email address your contacts and

1045
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:43,200
then I like to have your firstborn child

1046
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,109
and your users are just like okay okay

1047
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:50,069
okay and so basically strange

1048
00:45:50,069 --> 00:45:52,289
permissions in mobile applications are

1049
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:54,599
kind of a common mail where delivery

1050
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:00,359
route so let's talk about something okay

1051
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:01,799
so we talked about what machine learning

1052
00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:03,569
is so we talked about what some of the

1053
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:06,509
limitations of it are one we talked a

1054
00:46:06,509 --> 00:46:08,219
little bit about it we talked a bit

1055
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:09,869
about explain ability earlier and it's

1056
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:12,989
it's like so is your machine learning

1057
00:46:12,989 --> 00:46:16,200
system this black box or is it like is

1058
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,769
it open the analyst actually explained

1059
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:22,319
understand why a the system made a

1060
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,229
particular decision a recommendation

1061
00:46:24,229 --> 00:46:26,519
it's also not a silver bullet I mean

1062
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:28,710
like your vendors are talking to you and

1063
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,719
they're saying we've got this machine

1064
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:31,979
learning and stuff like it's gonna be

1065
00:46:31,979 --> 00:46:34,170
magic and it's like it's really not it's

1066
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,969
it's there's nothing magic at all about

1067
00:46:35,969 --> 00:46:37,920
it it's basically a set of like

1068
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,940
mathematical techniques and algorithms

1069
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:44,549
in you you have to know what you're

1070
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:46,410
feeding into it if you if you want to

1071
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:50,309
use it and uh another thing that is that

1072
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:52,589
the body of human knowledge is pretty is

1073
00:46:52,589 --> 00:46:56,549
just pretty large like for example I

1074
00:46:56,549 --> 00:46:58,380
think you're trying to decide whether an

1075
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,979
email is spam or ham like a human could

1076
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:05,460
look at and understand words in context

1077
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,469
like maybe if somebody sends you

1078
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:11,219
um like you're doing business with a

1079
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:13,579
vendor and they send you an email about

1080
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:15,869
about the laser toner you've you've

1081
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:18,660
ordered that's legitimate but like a lot

1082
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,450
of times litchi pleaser toner on an

1083
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:22,309
email it's not

1084
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:24,680
good right and there they're like oh

1085
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,880
there are a whole lot of other words

1086
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,619
they often show in this spanning family

1087
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:28,759
Mo's but they can sometimes show the

1088
00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:30,709
legitimate emails and I human can pretty

1089
00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:31,910
readily look at them because it's like

1090
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:32,900
there's a whole lot of background

1091
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,180
knowledge and context and stuff and it

1092
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,650
could be hard to represent that to a

1093
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:37,779
machine learning algorithm

1094
00:47:37,779 --> 00:47:39,559
there's also have you guys heard of

1095
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:44,559
overfitting and underfitting so like um

1096
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,609
so there's so overfitting and

1097
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:47,660
underfitting it's like when you have a

1098
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,910
ma or you have some training data

1099
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:52,219
sometimes it may be when you over put it

1100
00:47:52,219 --> 00:47:54,410
it means it fits the training data very

1101
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,029
well but it doesn't chip but it doesn't

1102
00:47:56,029 --> 00:47:59,029
generalize to other data very well under

1103
00:47:59,029 --> 00:48:01,249
fitting means that it doesn't really fit

1104
00:48:01,249 --> 00:48:02,779
the train it doesn't really fit any of

1105
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:05,150
the data very well and the whole and

1106
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,249
generally with just like with anything

1107
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:10,249
in a computer machine learning it's

1108
00:48:10,249 --> 00:48:15,079
garbage in garbage out I mean it's not

1109
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:18,289
specifically related to security but ok

1110
00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:21,109
hey have you ever heard heard of like

1111
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:23,900
machine like algorithms that deal with

1112
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,279
different races of people differently

1113
00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:28,999
like like like a smart sync or something

1114
00:48:28,999 --> 00:48:30,739
they've only tested it with people with

1115
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:32,119
light skin and somebody with dark skin

1116
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:35,079
tries to use it and it doesn't work in

1117
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,369
very recently there is an article about

1118
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:39,289
like an algorithm that recommended like

1119
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:41,269
lower quality of care for African

1120
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:44,630
Americans so so essentially the thing

1121
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,920
that the thing that is it's not a silver

1122
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,900
bullet and basically garbage in garbage

1123
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:52,099
out there's nothing magical about it so

1124
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:53,569
I just so right now I just have what I

1125
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:55,459
just have some links and stuff if you

1126
00:48:55,459 --> 00:48:57,319
want to dig into it cheer so they get it

1127
00:48:57,319 --> 00:48:59,989
to it yourself you're welcome to and I'd

1128
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:02,449
like to heavily credit the these are

1129
00:49:02,449 --> 00:49:04,819
these are some excellent resources this

1130
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:06,170
is machine learning with security

1131
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:08,269
protecting data systems with today

1132
00:49:08,269 --> 00:49:09,349
they're on algorithms this is an

1133
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:11,059
O'Reilly book it's excellent

1134
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:13,579
I got it enough I got it in a $15.00

1135
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:15,650
Humble Bundle purchase at least the

1136
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:18,109
electronic version the science book is

1137
00:49:18,109 --> 00:49:20,900
pretty good and that's actually free so

1138
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,339
it's so you can you can get these for

1139
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:23,599
inexpensive or free and they're very

1140
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,420
good I uh I would say I used to these

1141
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,429
heavily when I'm in the talk and then

1142
00:49:28,429 --> 00:49:30,079
there's towards data science which is

1143
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,959
websites that's pretty good too and then

1144
00:49:32,959 --> 00:49:34,849
these are just some other good resources

1145
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:36,020
you might want to use when you

1146
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,190
and it any rate they thank you for your

1147
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:50,270
patience are there any questions really

1148
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:54,710
pretty much a time I think we're tying

1149
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:55,820
but if you any questions you're able to

1150
00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:05,690
come up to me know how many time you can

1151
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:09,400
spend on data classification before just

1152
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,330
sending that to your machine learning

1153
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:17,300
process because it seems to be critical

1154
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,140
if if it if the data is not good like

1155
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,090
your entire process at the end which

1156
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,520
will fail or like don't do what you want

1157
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,200
to do or or how do you acquire like good

1158
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,200
sample of data or um you know we should

1159
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,570
be very honest like so I've I was having

1160
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:38,150
to start doing like some machine machine

1161
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:40,850
learning and I knew nothing about the

1162
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,800
domain and the data what I would really

1163
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,040
do is I basically kit Google and see if

1164
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,050
anybody else is seeing what kind of what

1165
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,790
kind of analysis maybe not even machine

1166
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:50,930
learning had been done on that day day

1167
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:54,140
before what what do people look for and

1168
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,190
tried to learn something about the

1169
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,290
domain and what's been done in it that

1170
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,460
would give me that would just give me a

1171
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,380
starting point

1172
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,300
uh-huh because they because like if you

1173
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,650
just try to throw something that you

1174
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,050
don't understand atom in a machine

1175
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,640
learning algorithm that's gonna maybe

1176
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,890
not work out very well and one thing you

1177
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:13,070
can do we I try to show some graphs just

1178
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,920
because I I mean my presentation it was

1179
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,140
pretty mom deficient really and I

1180
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,850
figured we could at least have so we at

1181
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:21,470
least have some graphs and it's like if

1182
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,330
you're if you're dealing with two and

1183
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,640
three dimensions it's it's actually very

1184
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,260
it's actually very very useful to this

1185
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,510
visualize it like just graph what you

1186
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,730
have and say does it make sense and you

1187
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,230
can kind of do that in three dimensions

1188
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,970
too once you get past that you get into

1189
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:37,070
hyper planes and that's kind of hard for

1190
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:41,570
humans to process hello

1191
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:45,980
sorry and one common problem that what

1192
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,820
I've read and seen while you know

1193
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,270
implementing machine

1194
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:52,280
not necessarily just for security but

1195
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,970
for any domain is there's bias in in the

1196
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,010
data oh yeah especially when they're

1197
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,750
during the stage of gathering the data

1198
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,970
is that also a prevalent problem when

1199
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:05,810
when a career domain um you know I would

1200
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:09,190
imagine I would imagine it could be I

1201
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:11,840
mean I think that when we talk about

1202
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,500
bias and bias and stuff like in some

1203
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,540
ways racism is kind of a most obvious

1204
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,010
and glaring one that we've seen like in

1205
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,750
other domains of data science that are

1206
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:24,440
not related to security but I would say

1207
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,270
if you think about bias and feels like

1208
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:28,490
preconceived notions and just idea just

1209
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:29,930
preconceived notion about what you're

1210
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,610
looking what you should look for and

1211
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,410
what's important I would think somebody

1212
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:34,970
could introduce bias into that very

1213
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,430
easily just in fact even just what

1214
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:38,930
somebody knows and what's familiar to

1215
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,840
them does that make any sense yeah so in

1216
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,640
your experience what would you actually

1217
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,430
recommend in actually cleaning up that

1218
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:48,170
bias or making sure it's not introduced

1219
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:54,740
I've had there down the pipeline that's

1220
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,740
actually that's actually very

1221
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:00,140
interesting excellent question and the

1222
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,160
best is the best thing I could maybe

1223
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,290
think of as coming up with is coming up

1224
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:06,440
with is is trying to see if somebody

1225
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,850
else has approached the problem a

1226
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,290
different way and comparing your

1227
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,180
approach to their approach and seeing if

1228
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,860
they saw something or thought about

1229
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,530
something in a way that you didn't

1230
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:17,750
because it's it's just like as far as

1231
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,460
trying to get Pat past what's in my own

1232
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,320
head the I feel like the best thing I

1233
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,580
can do is get try to find some kind of

1234
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:33,430
external input thank you
