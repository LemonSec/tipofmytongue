1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,259
all right hi everybody hello okay so the

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,350
title of the talk is right self-evident

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,320
so I'm here to speak to you about an

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,889
area of law of technology law that is to

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,839
say the least very gray and extremely

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,640
fuzzy and it remains that way to this

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,340
day so it mostly in the sense that it

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,680
touches on multiple areas of law and

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,660
legal principles that were put into

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,119
place before the internet was even a

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,300
thing okay so therefore I have to issue

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,488
some kind of disclaimer everybody's

13
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,399
issuing disclaimers today and so I'm a

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,760
lawyer I'm a lawyer in Nova Scotia and

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,680
nothing on these slides is legal advice

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,780
because I'm gonna say the annoying thing

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,280
that every single lawyer you've ever met

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,950
has said and the answer is it depends

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,559
okay I'm gonna say that every single

20
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,180
every single time so have you ever even

21
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,190
go up to a lawyer at a party you ask

22
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,960
them a question they'll say well it

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,180
depends that will be their answer for

24
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,289
everything and it means that they don't

25
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,660
want to answer the questions okay now

26
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,129
it's a good thing that I don't actually

27
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,739
have to give the disclaimer about but

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,450
these are my opinions and not that of my

29
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,130
employer because I own the damn company

30
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,810
and to be honest with you if I did give

31
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,040
that disclaimer you'd be a little bit

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,930
concerned about my mental health and

33
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,500
split personalities so the title of this

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,799
talk is I mean it's kind of an homage to

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,680
the the type of people that are in the

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,689
information security industry but it's

37
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,570
also an excuse for me to put as many

38
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,470
cats as possible into one presentation

39
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,990
okay to break my own record because I do

40
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,600
I do often do this and I was actually

41
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,850
successful spoiler alert

42
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,610
so so why did I want to do this talk

43
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,170
I've actually given this talk before I

44
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,270
gave this talk at all at set con earlier

45
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,540
this year because there was an incident

46
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,110
in Nova Scotia where a young man hacked

47
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,740
into the freedom of information website

48
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,430
has anyone heard of this incident okay

49
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,829
so maybe a raise of hands just so I know

50
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,860
who we're doing with it okay so we we

51
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,570
kind of people in the community started

52
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,758
calling him the W get kids so if I refer

53
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,849
to him as that so he was this 19 year

54
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,290
old gentleman just to give everybody a

55
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,040
background

56
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,730
who was arrested in what was reported to

57
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,310
be a very spectacular raid there were

58
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,950
reports of floorboards being ripped up

59
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,690
at computers seized all this stuff I

60
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,010
don't know if that actually happened but

61
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,510
there were reports and I'm going to take

62
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,740
this gospel and he face prison time for

63
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,930
unauthorized use unauthorized access to

64
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,300
a computer when he downloaded

65
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,480
approximately 7,000 documents from the

66
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,070
provinces freedom of information and

67
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,010
protection of Privacy Act website using

68
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,630
their request portal so this is a place

69
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,220
where they put documents for people to

70
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,850
view so what actually happened was that

71
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,150
he he just changed the URL and ended up

72
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,620
having access to private information

73
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,990
that he shouldn't have been able to

74
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,290
access and he then apparently downloaded

75
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,790
the information you know because why not

76
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,440
you discovered it so why not download it

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,350
so after college as a stock photo was

78
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,960
absolutely stupid and ridiculous but the

79
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,500
reaction to this story to this kid kind

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,050
of ranged from like oh poor kid to oh

81
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,730
he's an underdog hero and we kind of

82
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,260
started calling him this w get kid which

83
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,900
sounds vaguely superhero-ish I called

84
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,340
him this in spite of the fact that he's

85
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,690
not a kid he was an adult and he was

86
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,750
going to be tried as an adult and he

87
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,640
also wasn't a hero he was just just a

88
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,400
curious kid who discovered an issue and

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,560
kind of died a little bit and then dug a

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,959
little bit more and then got himself in

91
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,120
some pretty serious [ __ ] to be perfectly

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,870
frank with you

93
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,190
so the Halifax police eventually dropped

94
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,720
the charges against this kid it took a

95
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,220
very long time and one of my colleagues

96
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,700
was actually directly involved in the

97
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,850
case and in having them drop the charges

98
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,160
and I think everybody who is aware of

99
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,350
the case and who's in the security

100
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,600
community breathed a collective sigh of

101
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,750
relief for their teenage selves who

102
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,620
would have done exactly the same thing

103
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,150
okay and you know you know exactly who

104
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,910
you are so but this incident and the

105
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,680
reason the how this incident inspired

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,260
this talk and might my research into

107
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,860
this issue is that it taught me it tell

108
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,430
us about the reaction

109
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,800
of organizations to learning that your

110
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,470
organization has been breached and it

111
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,759
taught us that that reaction is

112
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,289
emotional and often very very extreme

113
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:39,490
okay

114
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,470
but if you think about it this emotional

115
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,360
reaction makes sense because the nature

116
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,850
of the information is intensely private

117
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,710
especially in this case we were talking

118
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,150
about healthcare data we're talking

119
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,940
about reports you know requests by a

120
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,710
sexual assault survivor so these are

121
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,020
this is intensely personal information

122
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,050
that if found in the hands of the wrong

123
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,449
people could be incredibly damaging to

124
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:07,960
these individuals so and this is why the

125
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,580
the Nova Scotia government wasn't then

126
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,840
it wasn't Nova Scotia government who

127
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,330
freaked out this is why the Nova Scotia

128
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,580
government wasn't the first data holder

129
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,610
to absolutely totally freak out when

130
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,710
somebody they found that somebody had

131
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,389
exposed a security vulnerability okay

132
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:26,860
the other thing that I that we found out

133
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,509
and do it well I found out doing this

134
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:31,630
research is why these these

135
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,030
organizations are so quick to conflate

136
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,669
innocent discovery with nefarious

137
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,590
purpose so there's that direct

138
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,949
connection between the two of them so

139
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,780
there was a lot of speculation about the

140
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,699
W get kids motivations and I've kind of

141
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:47,560
alluded to this however to outside

142
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,620
observers it seemed that he was it was

143
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,479
just a how far does the rabbit-hole go

144
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,240
type scenario and you can imagine

145
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,430
yourself finding a similar vulnerability

146
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,930
and saying okay well how bad is this

147
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,060
thing and being curious about it so you

148
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,130
can also draw this analogy you can also

149
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,349
draw this kind of thread pulling sweater

150
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,500
analogy if anyone gets that reference

151
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,570
now I wasn't surprised by the story in

152
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,039
the least okay people were pretty upset

153
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,440
about it when it did happen but I wasn't

154
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,909
surprised because I have the pleasure of

155
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,280
knowing many people in this community my

156
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,990
husband is involved in this community I

157
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,090
know that you're very curious people I

158
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,250
know that I know that that's the

159
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,800
understatement of the friggin century I

160
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,210
know that you have a cat-and-mouse

161
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,699
mentality when it comes to your work and

162
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:33,400
I know that that's necessary when it

163
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,810
comes to your work that that's part of

164
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,190
it not so they want you to just take a

165
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,570
moment to think of the language that you

166
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,910
use okay honey pot phishing

167
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,460
attack breach brute force this is the

168
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,940
language of games and war right so you

169
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,770
have this you have this cat-and-mouse

170
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,070
mentality you have this curiosity and

171
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,570
that's great and I'm sure it makes you

172
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,860
more effective at your drives but it

173
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,130
also gets you into trouble with the law

174
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,410
often more often than you probably would

175
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,250
like to admit so speaking of the law

176
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,870
this is the section of the criminal code

177
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,670
that deals with hacking okay it's 3:42

178
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,920
point one of the criminal code it has

179
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,090
changed very much over the past how long

180
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,260
has it been for seven years okay and

181
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,610
what it's called it's called it deals

182
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,360
with the unauthorized use of a computer

183
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,740
so the basic elements of the offense

184
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,990
which is what what how lawyers say how

185
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,640
do we actually find somebody guilty of

186
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,380
this thing and what we say is they have

187
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,240
to make out all of the elements of that

188
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,610
defense or of that offense rather okay

189
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,670
so you have to fraudulently and or

190
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,950
without color or right okay I'll explain

191
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,380
to you what those mean obtain a computer

192
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,200
service intercept any function of a

193
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,450
computer system use a computer system

194
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,650
with attempt to obtain or intercept

195
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,390
cause mischief relating to a computer

196
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,040
we'll talk about that more in a second

197
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,680
what that means or use possess or

198
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,900
traffic or from it someone else to do so

199
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,100
in passwords okay so that's that's the

200
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,930
basic elements of that offense it's

201
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,120
actually it's it's pretty simple but the

202
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,890
problem is is that it's all simple when

203
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,080
it's on paper but then when it meets the

204
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,030
nitty gritty dirty Ness of real life it

205
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,040
becomes very difficult for us to figure

206
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,020
out where it should apply and how we

207
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,250
should apply it so section 430 of the

208
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,230
Criminal Code deals with that mischief

209
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,940
element that was in the previous section

210
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,630
so section 430 says it's the specific

211
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,729
one covering mischief in relation to a

212
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:41,059
computer the specific code number is 431

213
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,760
point 1 and the penalties are pretty

214
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,490
hefty okay you've it's it's mischief

215
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,800
over $5,000 carries a maximum penalty of

216
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,670
ten years in prison okay and mischief

217
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,900
that causes danger to life

218
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,510
just danger not actual harm just danger

219
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,290
to life is life imprisonment a maximum

220
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,330
of life imprisonment so it's pretty damn

221
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,890
serious for hacking a lot of people are

222
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,710
very surprised by that so it's pretty

223
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,630
serious so I came up with a Quebec

224
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,190
example because the last time I did this

225
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,839
talk I was in Nova Scotian I thought you

226
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,250
guys might be curious to see how these

227
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,690
provisions have been dealt with in this

228
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,290
province

229
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,870
so federally the Criminal Code it is

230
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,610
dealt with the same because you have a

231
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,110
different legal system here in Quebec in

232
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,970
relation to non criminal matters but in

233
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,140
relation to criminal matters they're

234
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,820
dealt with very much the same as the

235
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,760
rest of the country so in this example

236
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,940
and this rrv San Martin case in 2012

237
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,350
obviously this is the kind of the early

238
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,180
days of this legislation so this is like

239
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,010
the initial interpretations of when this

240
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,560
legislation came in a police officer

241
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,430
used a police computer to obtain private

242
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,000
information relating to the spouses and

243
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,540
former spouses of women that he was

244
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,589
either dating or wanted to date

245
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:58,710
I know it's boo it's bad it was very bad

246
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,540
so he didn't he didn't actually hack the

247
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,070
computer per se he didn't actually you

248
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,330
know take any effective measures to

249
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,740
break into any system but he did

250
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,570
he wasn't found guilty of unauthorized

251
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,730
access of a computer because he used

252
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,010
that information for non police purposes

253
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,910
so and that was one of the first

254
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,709
interpretations of this without color of

255
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:22,200
right thing and we're gonna go into it a

256
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,640
little bit more if we don't get to board

257
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,720
but he basically was found guilty

258
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,980
unauthorized use and access of a

259
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,900
computer because he didn't have the

260
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,730
right to use that information to access

261
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,830
it first for non police purposes and

262
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,110
then to use it for not police purposes

263
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,790
okay now's a funny side note and I found

264
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,400
this incredibly hilarious the

265
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,380
interpretation of the term fraudulently

266
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,690
and without color of right in Quebec is

267
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,050
actually based in a case where a man was

268
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,290
found guilty of having stolen a rocking

269
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,470
chair and he stole it on a drunken night

270
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,560
of debauchery and his defense was that

271
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,720
it was totally a prank and they were

272
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,980
going to return it in the morning

273
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,200
that defense failed

274
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,470
so another area where where the law has

275
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,880
developed on this point I'm trying not

276
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,200
to get too much into the weeds on this

277
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,130
I'm just kind of giving you some

278
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,660
interesting tidbits about what the law

279
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,480
has done because it's I'm told that

280
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,060
these talks can be potentially

281
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,040
interesting because lawyers are really

282
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,450
just another form of hacker I'm not sure

283
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,920
if you agree with that or not but I mean

284
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,350
basically we look at the law and we

285
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,210
figure out loopholes and all these

286
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,270
things I don't know if that's true but

287
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,980
whatever I'll take it as a compliment so

288
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,110
at the time of the police officer case

289
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,850
the one we just talked about it was

290
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,220
illegal to access a computer without

291
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,650
authorization but the law hadn't yet

292
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,900
advanced to cover theft of data okay and

293
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,060
in this case in our V Morris oh the

294
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,490
Queen vimar in 2015 were told his

295
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,310
girlfriend he would fix her laptop he

296
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,340
then took nude images of her from that

297
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,190
laptop so from her hard drives which she

298
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,380
thought had been deleted and when they

299
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,810
broke up he put the images on the

300
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,930
internet and spread the URL around her

301
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,790
workplace so this is your classic

302
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,740
classic example of revenge porn okay so

303
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,470
one of the questions in this case was

304
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,830
whether or not her data had been stolen

305
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,920
one of the problems with how the law

306
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,380
grapples with these questions is that it

307
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,050
depends very heavily on how lawyers

308
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,920
people who are notoriously slow to adopt

309
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,070
or understand technology it's how they

310
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,880
interpret the technology in relation to

311
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,220
the actual offenses in the criminal code

312
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,360
so in this case the Crown attorney who

313
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,610
is probably somebody who still wrote

314
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,550
things on paper on a regular basis to

315
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,540
submit them to the court

316
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,820
I had framed it in terms of the theft of

317
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,460
the data instead of breaching the

318
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,290
provisions of the half of the Criminal

319
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,360
Code really in relation to hacking so

320
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,340
and of course then you have you have the

321
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,900
crown prosecutor and I don't want to be

322
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,200
ageist probably a much older person then

323
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,120
you have the judge who is probably a

324
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,910
much much much older person trying to

325
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,040
interpret well okay this this data was

326
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,970
stolen how do we deal

327
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,069
these provisions of the Criminal Code is

328
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,689
it theft well we have an understanding

329
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:28,060
of theft and the understanding of theft

330
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,579
is that you take something from somebody

331
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:34,860
thereby depriving them of that thing and

332
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,180
that was exactly how it was put to the

333
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,620
judge and that's how the judge

334
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,569
understood it and that's not what

335
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,079
happened

336
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,879
she wasn't deprived of that data it

337
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,139
wasn't taken from her computer was

338
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:46,120
copied was copied and put somewhere else

339
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,449
so this guy actually got off not because

340
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:51,819
the law wasn't there but because the

341
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:53,410
understanding of the technology and the

342
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,910
interpretation of the legislation in

343
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,250
that context wasn't there because the

344
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,779
lawyers weren't able to understand so he

345
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:04,120
he was found not guilty of theft of data

346
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,399
and not charged under the criminal code

347
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,649
provisions all right so basically a

348
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:10,420
technicality but still it was a very

349
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,040
meaningful development because what it

350
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,899
meant is that you couldn't be found

351
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:17,319
guilty for theft of data okay it's it's

352
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:19,180
since developed but it was a very

353
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,740
discouraging case the worst part about

354
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,410
this is that this very year in 2015 this

355
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,959
is when the Criminal Code provisions

356
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,059
regarding revenge porn came in but

357
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:29,170
because the offense it happened

358
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,910
significantly before 2015

359
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,970
they couldn't even catch him with that

360
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,259
so he could he couldn't have been found

361
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:36,910
guilty of distributing at an intimate

362
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,309
image without consent because the

363
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:41,379
offense had happened before the law was

364
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,139
there so he got off completely scot-free

365
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:46,750
for being a total jerk

366
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:52,600
all right so but things have since

367
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,059
changed so our interpretation of the

368
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,579
theft of data has caught up with a

369
00:14:57,579 --> 00:14:59,829
normal person's understanding of what

370
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:01,600
Teta is that it can be copied and still

371
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,610
be stolen even if you're not depriving

372
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,189
somebody of that data so but this is the

373
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:08,079
current state of the lying Canada to sum

374
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,800
it up in terms that non-boring lawyer

375
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,139
type people can understand is if you

376
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:16,689
hack into someone's computer or access

377
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:19,449
it without their permission even if that

378
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:22,209
system is horribly insecure even if they

379
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:25,509
deserve it and should know better even

380
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,100
if you're doing it to prevent bad people

381
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,500
from exploiting the vulnerability you

382
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,189
are still breaking the law which is kind

383
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,930
of intense

384
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,920
this is my favorite headline in the

385
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,450
world and the internet the internet

386
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,190
never disappoints I think I think to get

387
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,430
this headline I put I put into Google

388
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,959
like dangers of hacking or something

389
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,310
just to see what would come up for fun

390
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,899
and this came up first and it's like

391
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:52,959
that'll do so the point is hacking is

392
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,029
being taken more seriously by the

393
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:56,470
general public that's why I wanted to

394
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,029
show this to you and you you're all more

395
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:01,000
aware now than than ever that hacking is

396
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,190
in the news that that large data

397
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,070
breaches are published by reporters and

398
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,810
and scrutinized by reporters which that

399
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,420
the coverage is often hilarious and this

400
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,880
may seem a little bit extreme but I want

401
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,440
you to consider for just a second

402
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,529
the fact that I am 23 weeks pregnant

403
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:20,829
right now okay with my second child this

404
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:24,579
this is my first child right here okay

405
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,350
and when I gave birth to my first child

406
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,680
I opted for the epidural okay and that's

407
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,660
a drug infusion pump we've all talked

408
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,040
about drug infusion pumps and how

409
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,160
they're very scary because the drug

410
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,570
infusion pump not many people know this

411
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,089
but it's generally a fentanyl drip okay

412
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:42,250
that's the drug inside of it it's a

413
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,750
mixture of other things but the good

414
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,990
stuff is the federal okay so the

415
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,399
interesting thing is I made some

416
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,500
observations as they were bringing this

417
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,740
in and rolling it out is that the drugs

418
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,570
were locked up so the drugs are locked

419
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,339
up away until the anesthetist shows up

420
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:59,230
but the device is completely unlocked

421
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,540
and it has a handy little USB port on

422
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,829
the outside so and device is similar to

423
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,299
this one and we're trying to obviously

424
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:09,130
be very vulnerable to remote code

425
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,599
execution and man in the middle types of

426
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,849
attacks and my spouse who knows about

427
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,169
these things thought that this was an

428
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:15,609
ideal time to point this out to my

429
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,780
anesthetist and speak to him about

430
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,669
device security so under under the

431
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:22,900
current provisions and this is how the

432
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,220
law has changed under the current

433
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,740
provisions of the Criminal Code simply

434
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,840
someone simply accessing this device or

435
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,290
attempting to access the device would be

436
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,660
a crime okay so they don't actually have

437
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,460
to successfully access it they can

438
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,260
attempt to access it even if they're

439
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,150
just curious even if they just wanted to

440
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,740
play with it without permission and

441
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,390
prior to the changes in the criminal

442
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,280
code since mar and since the other cases

443
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,920
where we looked at

444
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,140
they would have to actually cause harm

445
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,850
to that person so somebody would have to

446
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,040
either die or or experience some kind of

447
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,930
some kind of pain or you know the

448
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,070
fentanyl would stop working and then

449
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,360
you'd experience natural childbirth and

450
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,670
that would also be awful but the point

451
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,500
is is that the law has caught up with

452
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,140
the fact that merely accessing is a

453
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,700
crime and now that all sounds very

454
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,310
extreme but there's obviously a reason

455
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,550
for this because causing direct harm was

456
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,980
just simply wasn't cutting it okay so

457
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,570
the law needed to catch up with the fact

458
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,690
that simply accessing and disseminating

459
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,670
the information was a violation and it

460
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,890
eventually did and this is around the

461
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,480
time when the Ashley Madison hack

462
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,340
happened you're all aware of that it was

463
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,980
it was one of the biggies this is one

464
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,600
where 33 million the intimate

465
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,660
information of 33 million people was

466
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,240
dumped okay and I actually did a talk

467
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
quite some time ago around the time that

468
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,170
this happened about how actually

469
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,420
possessing that data could be a crime so

470
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,790
anybody who who still has the data

471
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,930
dumped on their computers should

472
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:53,150
probably okay that's another time so in

473
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,040
there was a direct connection and people

474
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,690
committed suicide and really in relation

475
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,860
to this okay they're worse there are a

476
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,990
few people who did to people

477
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,460
specifically took their lives in

478
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,990
relation to this hack because the

479
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,180
information was leaked so there was a

480
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,950
connection in the public's mind and

481
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,990
therefore the law makers mind there was

482
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,000
a real connection between data breach

483
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,360
direct harm to people okay before it was

484
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
just it was more this abstract thing

485
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,570
that was kind of difficult for them to

486
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,020
conceptualize for some reason and so

487
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,180
direct was that connection that the

488
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,770
chief of the Toronto Police said and I

489
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,900
quote I want to make it very clear to

490
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,180
you that your actions are illegal and

491
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,190
will not be tolerated no help will not

492
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,320
be tolerated this is your wake-up call

493
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,000
of course nobody was arrested because

494
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,500
it's very difficult to find out who does

495
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,060
these things but the point is is that

496
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,560
it's still it's very serious in the mind

497
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,240
of law enforcement and more so some of

498
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,700
that that liability was shifted away

499
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,200
from the criminal liability because it's

500
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,880
very difficult to enforce that over to

501
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,250
the civil liability and class-action

502
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,290
lawsuits were brought against Ashley

503
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,780
Madison across the country and that the

504
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,010
first one was actually filed here in

505
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,780
Quebec interesting

506
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:06,990
a bit so other jurisdictions are also

507
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,030
taking packing very seriously an

508
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,910
Australian teenager compromised apples

509
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,590
mainframe various times between 2015 and

510
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,800
2017 and he downloaded 90 gigabytes of

511
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,540
data I think people who are in the

512
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,090
security community are hoarders but I

513
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,100
think a lot of your information hoarders

514
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,140
I think you know who you are you might

515
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,230
be you're smiling too much but and then

516
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,200
he stored all of this information on his

517
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,510
computer in a file that was called and I

518
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,460
kid you not

519
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:40,050
hackie hack hack methods exclude so he

520
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,050
was caught he pled guilty to an in

521
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,520
Australia they call it they call them

522
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,590
unauthorized and reckless modification

523
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,270
of data and unauthorized access to data

524
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,390
and the judge called his defense very

525
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,690
serious and referred to it as a

526
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,790
sustained sophisticated and successful

527
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,700
attack on the security of a major

528
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,490
multinational corporation I think he

529
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,990
should have been shaming Apple but I

530
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,150
mean it was the kid who was in trouble

531
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,080
so this brings me to the obvious

532
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,510
conclusion the hacking is really illegal

533
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,640
it's a really illegal thing it's really

534
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,780
legal thing in this country it's a

535
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,860
really illegal thing pretty much

536
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,990
everywhere else but there are two

537
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,860
elements to every crime there's the

538
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,080
intention that's the mens rea and

539
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,210
there's the action that's the actus

540
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,100
reyes okay so it's Latin now you learn

541
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,130
some Latin today you're all triangle now

542
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,270
so it's the difference between just

543
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:33,000
thinking about about doing something

544
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,280
illegal and actually doing something

545
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,510
illegal and that's kind of an

546
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,820
oversimplification but you're not boring

547
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,440
lawyer type people so we're gonna go

548
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:40,740
with that

549
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,210
and it's also the difference between

550
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,730
accidentally doing something and illegal

551
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,650
and intending to do something illegal so

552
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,330
the classic example is breaking into a

553
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,230
car so I have to intend to break into

554
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,700
somebody's car knowing that it's not my

555
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,280
car okay and that's the criminal offense

556
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,160
okay if I merely think about breaking

557
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,140
into the car that's not a criminal

558
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,180
offense that's thoughtcrime we don't do

559
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,870
that in Canada yet um but then there's

560
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,990
also I can break into my own car because

561
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,090
I'm allowed to do that I'm allowed to

562
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,620
break into my own car I might look very

563
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,429
suspicious

564
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:16,350
while doing it I might get arrested

565
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,330
while doing it and then release later on

566
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,149
but I'm allowed to break into my own car

567
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:21,869
it's not a crime

568
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:24,299
so these and this is an important

569
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:25,860
distinction between the action and the

570
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,629
thinking especially when we talk about

571
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:29,700
the W get kid okay

572
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,980
so he accessed information that did not

573
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,889
belong to him that he shouldn't have

574
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:38,519
accessed but did his actions rise to

575
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:42,869
that of criminal activity so the intent

576
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:45,240
elements of the anti hacking provision

577
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,529
this is where you're all kind of coming

578
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:48,200
to law school with me okay so it just

579
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,499
just bear with me the intention element

580
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:54,450
is fraudulently and without color of

581
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,730
right that's that's the intention piece

582
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,940
that has to be there as well as all of

583
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,919
the action elements that we'll talk

584
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,909
about those in a section in a second so

585
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:07,669
fraud is obvious fraud is a deliberate

586
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:11,039
deceit or falsehood that you either tell

587
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,860
to somebody or do and color right is an

588
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,289
honest belief that you have a right to

589
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:17,850
access or use the computer in this

590
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,769
context even if there's no basis for

591
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:21,389
that belief in law which is interesting

592
00:23:21,389 --> 00:23:23,879
and difficult so this doesn't include

593
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:26,039
the mere moral beliefs that you had a

594
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,080
right to do it so you can't say well

595
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,299
their security was horrible they

596
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,669
deserved it that doesn't count

597
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:35,009
so and the action elements of this

598
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:37,350
offense are all the verbing verbs

599
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,659
okay so obtain a computer service

600
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,940
intercept the function of a computer use

601
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,679
a computer for mischief or traffic and

602
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,700
passwords so in the context of the W get

603
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,940
kid did he obtain a computer service

604
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,700
well yeah he did the system was a data

605
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,499
store and client portal and when he

606
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:58,740
accessed it he obtained the service did

607
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,269
he intercept at a function of a computer

608
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:02,070
well yes the function was to stored it

609
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,110
to stored at it and provided to

610
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,299
customers and he intercepted the

611
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:07,440
function by accessing the information

612
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,029
and downloading it the interesting thing

613
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:12,450
is is that intercepting does not mean

614
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,279
blocking you need to understand that

615
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,899
it's not it that's interference

616
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:17,730
intercepting is merely it's like

617
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,499
observing the data as it's going to

618
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,830
where it's supposed to go all right

619
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,409
so did he use a computer system with the

620
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:28,390
intent to obtain or intercept

621
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,940
so once he realized he could access the

622
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,910
information he kind of just kept doing

623
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,160
it just kept getting just more and more

624
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,280
information and and downloading it so he

625
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,070
obviously had the intent to obtain the

626
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,690
information which is unfortunate if he

627
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,570
if he had just changed the URL once this

628
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,220
would not be the case he would not have

629
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,660
it would not have been sufficient for

630
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,190
him to have that the intent to obtain

631
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,720
all the information was like whoops

632
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,790
Jesus and then it would have been the

633
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,310
end of it it was really the ninety

634
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,250
gigabytes that was the problem so then

635
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,470
there's the then there's use did he use

636
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,260
or possess and or traffic and passwords

637
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,060
and I mean no that's that wasn't part of

638
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,120
this issue but then the question is was

639
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,730
this fraudulently or was this without

640
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:19,230
color of right so no if I remember fraud

641
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,090
is a deliberate deceit or falsehood

642
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,810
he changed the end of a URL there was no

643
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,390
deliberate deception his actions cannot

644
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,100
be compared with a spear phishing attack

645
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,770
attack like it's it's it's just a

646
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,270
different type of action it wasn't

647
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:37,480
deliberate now color of right is is the

648
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,280
interesting part of this and the less

649
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,230
obvious one because you have to have an

650
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,640
honest belief that you have a right to

651
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,920
access or use the computer system in

652
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,750
order to not in order to have that color

653
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,880
of right and if you have that color of

654
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,400
right then you don't have the intent to

655
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,660
make up the offense the W get W get kid

656
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,630
knew he didn't own the data but he did

657
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,040
have access to the system the system

658
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,620
itself is credentialed so once you were

659
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,200
into the system you could move around

660
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,300
freely by changing the URL not from the

661
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,300
outside so it's entirely reasonable for

662
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,240
him to think okay well I have access to

663
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,100
the system I have these credentials I

664
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,900
have entered them in so therefore

665
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,420
anything that I access is it's okay that

666
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,370
I access it so that's where he's OK on

667
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,280
the color of right so he didn't do it

668
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,560
without color of right at least that's

669
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,330
that's what I would have argued had this

670
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,460
gotten of course the Halifax police he

671
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,800
dropped the charges because they were

672
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,570
basically told by several people in Nova

673
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,040
Scotia myself being one of them that

674
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,050
this was absolute [ __ ] to be honest

675
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,380
okay

676
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,330
it took them a few weeks to finish their

677
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,100
investigation but a few weeks of hell

678
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,220
for that poor young man but he didn't

679
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,559
actually his actions fell short of the

680
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:54,080
elements of the criminal offense so this

681
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,659
is a graphical representation of what

682
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:59,179
actually happened and honestly the whole

683
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:01,370
story made me very sad because it was

684
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,909
just I mean it was just some bright kid

685
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:07,039
with enough knowledge to get himself

686
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,769
into some really serious trouble and

687
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:11,720
what happens just pissed off the wrong

688
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,220
people the government you know what piss

689
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,870
off the government they're scary they

690
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:18,559
have all the guns okay so that's more

691
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,470
the criminal side of things now I want

692
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,019
to talk about the civil liability part

693
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,029
of this because I mean it's it's very

694
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:27,740
unlikely that any of you will undertake

695
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,929
actions that will rise to the level of

696
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:33,409
criminal activity moving forward I'm not

697
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:34,789
gonna speak to your past I don't know

698
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:38,269
what you guys got a feeling but the

699
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:40,549
civil liability is more what what's more

700
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:43,580
likely to touch your lives so where this

701
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,019
is also where I feel a little bit out of

702
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:46,639
place because I'm from Nova Scotia v

703
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:49,039
Ontario Ontario via newfoundland via BC

704
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,889
okay so I've lived in a lot of provinces

705
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:54,710
except this one and and I grew up in

706
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,230
rural Ontario so and my French teacher

707
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,110
was actually the basketball coach and I

708
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,669
ended up not even knowing the French

709
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:04,789
word for basketball I googled it and now

710
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:08,630
I feel very silly but and as a lawyer

711
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,639
I'm pretty sure I know more Latin then

712
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:14,510
than French so so and I was also not

713
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,720
trained legally in in the civil system

714
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,889
so and the only tie think I saw the

715
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:20,539
inside of a French law school once I did

716
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:22,610
you I went to you to em and I competed

717
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,860
there at a a lawyers have these

718
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,269
competitions they're called they're

719
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:28,039
called moots they're mock trial

720
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,679
competitions they're very weird but

721
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:32,000
they're very fun and they're kind of

722
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,830
like debate competitions and that's

723
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,240
that's the that's the only time I saw

724
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,649
the inside of a French law school so

725
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:39,289
that's also a disclaimer but Quebec

726
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:41,690
Quebec law in this room knows but I'm

727
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,580
gonna break it down for you is unique in

728
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,110
Canada because Quebec is the only

729
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,450
province in Canada to have a judicial

730
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,470
system that is based in civil that's in

731
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,960
French heritage civil law okay so it is

732
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,940
it is different public law

733
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,500
and criminal law is the same okay we

734
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,659
already talked about that but the civil

735
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:02,240
civil law in in Quebec is is codified

736
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,519
that's the difference whereas in in all

737
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:06,200
the other provinces it's developed by

738
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,649
stages by star a decisis star II decisis

739
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:11,480
is basically one judge makes a decision

740
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,070
then the other judge makes another

741
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,350
decision and then the next judge looks

742
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,940
at the decision of both of those judges

743
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,730
to determine how they should decide

744
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,870
that's kind of how it works it means I

745
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,700
should do a lot of reading to be honest

746
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,750
with you your system is way more

747
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,840
efficient so that's that's where we are

748
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,090
but I have discovered through careful

749
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,799
research that the principles that I'm

750
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,039
talking about are the same so we're good

751
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:37,129
to go and one of those principles is the

752
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:39,169
general accountability principle and

753
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:41,330
that is that the man you manufacture is

754
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,549
held liable for the quality of their

755
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:46,309
product meaning the vulnerability in

756
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:47,750
their system is presumed to be their

757
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,600
responsibility however it's a bit more

758
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,340
complicated than that

759
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,049
because it's difficult if not impossible

760
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:57,259
to to know all of the conditions that

761
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:58,909
software software is kind of a unique

762
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:02,059
thing the circumstances and the kind of

763
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:03,980
the unique context of the use of the

764
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,269
software are more difficult to determine

765
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:07,309
than something let's say a car we know

766
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:09,230
where cars go cars go on the road

767
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,480
generally when I'm not driving them they

768
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,799
go on the road okay

769
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,750
so we know and we know what fails on

770
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,750
cars because they're mechanical well not

771
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,659
so much anymore I suppose but but you

772
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:21,769
get the idea okay

773
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:24,740
so the law has decided that software is

774
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,740
this special thing so really it all

775
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,330
comes down to industry standard

776
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,070
practices when it comes to security and

777
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,379
you find people know all about that

778
00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:34,940
stuff whether you know that or not

779
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,250
because you're the people who helped set

780
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,629
those industry standards through your

781
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:39,799
research and your efforts and your

782
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:43,100
complaints okay so good for you it's a

783
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,470
lot of responsibility so you all know

784
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,080
this situation you all come across it

785
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,379
you find something okay whether or not

786
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:53,929
you went looking for it you found it the

787
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:56,059
security vulnerability of some kind now

788
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:58,009
how do you deal with it what's what's

789
00:30:58,009 --> 00:30:59,600
the actual practical steps that you can

790
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,029
take to deal with it so you you have two

791
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:02,769
options

792
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:07,549
essentially privately so in two to the

793
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:09,110
company directly I'm talking about third

794
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,770
party so the

795
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,090
is a company that you don't work for

796
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:16,820
okay or publicly so forums blogs concept

797
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,680
videos things like that and private

798
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,210
reporting can lead to public reporting

799
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,710
there it's not mutually exclusive as

800
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,780
you're all aware and to be honest with

801
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,460
you I have I mean I've noticed that

802
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,170
public reporting is actually more more

803
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,610
popular than almost anything else

804
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,410
because you can put it up on a forum

805
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,170
have other people validate it and then

806
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,540
you the company can either discover that

807
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,050
independently or someone will will ship

808
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,300
it off to them some good citizen will

809
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,060
ship it off to them but so choosing

810
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,590
between the options is actually quite

811
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,300
difficult and I don't know how many

812
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,380
people have actually been in this

813
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,700
situation how many people have been in

814
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,770
this situation where you've you've been

815
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,210
kind of poking around and you found a

816
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,650
security vulnerability and some of it

817
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,270
wasn't your employer you can admit it to

818
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,340
me even if you haven't retained me it

819
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,590
will be kept confidential okay so not

820
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,500
not like not many of you but quite a few

821
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,250
of you so choosing between those those

822
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,200
two reporting options which like I said

823
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,400
aren't mutually excuse it can be

824
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,470
difficult because there's no there's no

825
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,970
so-called you know you don't have a

826
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,710
codified system of ethics I mean certain

827
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,500
of you have taken courses that that

828
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,120
require you to subscribe to a system of

829
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,400
ethics but we'll talk about those in a

830
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,940
second so the vacuum that's created when

831
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,950
you don't have a codified system of

832
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,770
ethics for your profession it's filled

833
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,850
in with the law the regular law because

834
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,120
people need some kind of method to to

835
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,090
resolve disputes to determine where

836
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,850
something bad has happened

837
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:46,040
so people reach for legal remedies when

838
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,240
they feel as though they can't solve

839
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,710
problems themselves that's what the rule

840
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,130
of law is okay and if when people lose

841
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,250
faith in that and our key results so in

842
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,480
an area where there's little to no

843
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,610
guidance on on those who feel threatened

844
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,280
overreact and I'm not talking about you

845
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,660
guys I'm talking about the people who

846
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,060
are receiving these reports and they

847
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,740
reach for legal remedies to protect

848
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,860
themselves one of these example was

849
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,940
first state superannuation so in 2011 so

850
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,680
this is a long time ago this is one of

851
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:23,630
the early examples they could see other

852
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,690
accounts by merely changing the URL so

853
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,510
sounds familiar and here's an expert

854
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,010
excerpt from their angry letter don't

855
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,600
read it it's a lot of text I've

856
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,800
summarized it for you okay so the person

857
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,190
who reported the vulnerability received

858
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,500
this letter okay despite the fact that

859
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,020
he or she made this disclosure in good

860
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,760
faith hoping that they would fix their

861
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,770
security issues because it was so

862
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,760
blatant then so the good thing is is

863
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,910
that it's now pretty much standard

864
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,940
industry practice to reward people for

865
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,770
reporting these types of vulnerabilities

866
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:04,250
to even pay them okay and companies

867
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,990
actually have competitions and things

868
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,080
like that you're all aware of that stuff

869
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,340
but but it all depends on how the

870
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,889
company reacts okay so and it's not

871
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:15,350
they're not required to act in a happy

872
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,719
way they can react however they want and

873
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:21,469
often they react like this okay this is

874
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:23,449
and and and and you have to remember

875
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:24,440
that you're dealing with people who

876
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,690
first of all don't understand what the

877
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,340
vulnerability is unless is explained to

878
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,429
them property properly and they there

879
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:33,830
are also people who exist in the world

880
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,139
of that five ways hackers could kill you

881
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,179
headline right so you have to remember

882
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,889
that that this reaction this is the

883
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,330
emotional reaction we're talking about

884
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,409
so how do you protect yourself so

885
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:47,630
ethical hacking as it's performed with

886
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,639
the permission of the owner of the

887
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,690
system and then you discover a

888
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,219
vulnerability discover a vulnerability

889
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:56,030
doing that is part of an information

890
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,490
risk program that's fine that's all fine

891
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,870
you can do that because you have

892
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,270
permission to do that but and there's

893
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,130
there's courses in these methods many of

894
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,970
you have taken them like cissp as one

895
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,590
example I don't know how people feel it

896
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,820
but I just recently learned that some

897
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,170
people do not like this certification

898
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,430
and they think it's bupkis is that true

899
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,760
yes

900
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:25,870
bupkis gotcha

901
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:38,380
gotcha okay that's actually very helpful

902
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:47,829
that makes a lot of sense okay so that

903
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:50,020
makes sense so bupkis potentially

904
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:57,579
however okay good alright so so but I'm

905
00:35:57,579 --> 00:35:58,890
still gonna use this as an example

906
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,400
because and because I think that they're

907
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,619
all the same in terms of and it's

908
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:06,670
interesting that you use the word

909
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,970
marketing okay because this is a

910
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,670
registered trademark and that's

911
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,900
important for several reasons okay

912
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,339
and actually the Canadian trademark was

913
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:21,390
filed in 2003 by the International

914
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,380
information systems security

915
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,410
certification consortium Inc that kind

916
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,910
of makes it sound like their CEO looks

917
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:33,160
like this guy like I really feel like I

918
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,540
missed an opportunity for a Halloween

919
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,270
costume this year like I really did

920
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,819
so the trademark was registered in

921
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:42,099
relation to services ok trademarks are

922
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:42,760
they

923
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,920
they protect brands so the information

924
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,099
of sorts of services or products

925
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:48,910
specifically it was registered in

926
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,619
relation to the provision of information

927
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:52,569
security by professionals certified by

928
00:36:52,569 --> 00:36:54,700
ISC and the development and

929
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,290
implementation implementation of

930
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,849
strategies policies and procedures

931
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,319
relating to information security

932
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:00,880
it was also registered as a

933
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,130
certification mark which makes it a very

934
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,470
special kind of trademark because a

935
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,690
certification mark is a mark where the

936
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,140
use of that mark is whether the owner of

937
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,569
AK mark rather has the exclusive right

938
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:17,290
to license that mark out to those who

939
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:20,470
meet certain criteria and the certain

940
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,630
criteria have to relate to the the

941
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,160
character or quality of the goods or

942
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,130
services the conditions under which the

943
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,960
goods have been produced or the services

944
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,810
performed at classes of persons who can

945
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:35,470
who can provide the services and within

946
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,569
an area where the and don't worry about

947
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:38,619
the last part it doesn't apply to this

948
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:41,200
so the owner of the certification mark

949
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,000
is responsible for setting the standards

950
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,220
and also enforcing

951
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,250
the use of that mark so you can only use

952
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,069
the CISSP mark if you've taken their

953
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:52,599
course otherwise they'll sue you because

954
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,920
you don't have a license that's

955
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,390
basically what it is since in searching

956
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,859
for this gift I found a Wikipedia page

957
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:02,020
on the nights of knee and it did not

958
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,849
disappoint to is absolutely fantastic

959
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:08,050
so so with the certification mark the

960
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,540
owner becomes the gatekeeper of that

961
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,640
industry okay or of the goods and

962
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,650
services associated with that mark and

963
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,770
they can prevent its use by persons who

964
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,690
they deem unfit so people who haven't

965
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:22,119
passed the exam so you can say your C is

966
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:24,069
SB or or any other program because

967
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:25,780
they're all under the same thing okay

968
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,730
these aren't creatures of legislation

969
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,099
we'll talk about that in a second if but

970
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,450
you can only use that mark if you

971
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,430
satisfy the owner of that mark that you

972
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,630
meet their standards and you do this by

973
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,829
passing a test in the case of CISSP so

974
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:41,829
what the little R means is that CISSP is

975
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:43,569
a brand that's what you need to

976
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:45,609
understand it is a brand it is not a

977
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:48,910
shield and this means there's actually

978
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,670
very little power in the CISSP

979
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,420
certification and other similar

980
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,829
certifications in terms of protecting

981
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:56,950
security professionals from claims the

982
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,960
reason why lawyer is in a certification

983
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,579
mark is that lawyers are creatures of

984
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:03,550
legislation okay what that means is that

985
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:08,109
we have a legislated monopoly okay which

986
00:39:08,109 --> 00:39:10,300
there's very few legislative monopoly so

987
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,890
we're talking about lawyers dentists

988
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,480
doctors were the only ones who are

989
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,849
allowed to practice law and with that

990
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:17,170
comes a set of rules they're very

991
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,700
stringent rules for lawyers regarding

992
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,319
ethics and how we have to act in certain

993
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:23,050
situations those rules expand all of the

994
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,400
time and all of a sudden I can't talk to

995
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,150
anybody anywhere so but it protects that

996
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,400
that those serving the ethical

997
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,020
requirements and our codes protect

998
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,200
lawyers but they also make us

999
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,599
accountable for our mistakes all right

1000
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,819
and we have mechanisms for that that are

1001
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:41,980
all in our legislation so when your

1002
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,240
profession is not a creature of

1003
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,730
legislation you're left basically

1004
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,640
unprotected except by the regular law by

1005
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,780
all the other laws that apply to

1006
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,420
everybody else so although I say that

1007
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,940
that trademark is not a shield that your

1008
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,440
certification is not a shield it's a

1009
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,839
brand the certification mark does create

1010
00:39:58,839 --> 00:39:59,230
interest

1011
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,180
standards and those industry standards

1012
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,859
eventually do become something that can

1013
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,060
protect you as long as you adhere to

1014
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,160
them right so that's important to

1015
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,380
understand what does this all mean I'm

1016
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,550
gonna try and round it up with some

1017
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,599
questions and we're gonna do a little

1018
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:13,240
bit of a case study okay so I'm an

1019
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,560
employee I discovered and disclosed a

1020
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,480
vulnerability to a third party someone

1021
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,790
who wasn't my not my employer can I get

1022
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,300
fired

1023
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,630
so an employer is vicariously liable for

1024
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,300
your actions even if they're done off

1025
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,099
the clock depending on several

1026
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:28,960
situations I did it I said it depends

1027
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,369
I'd gone this long without saying it um

1028
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:34,930
but things that you undertake as part of

1029
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,180
your off-duty activities you your

1030
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,710
employer can potentially be held liable

1031
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,510
for those and if you if your employer

1032
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,550
can be found liable for them then you

1033
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:46,960
can be fired for them okay but it's

1034
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,280
actually very difficult to fire somebody

1035
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,720
for their off-duty conduct in

1036
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,460
impracticality there's wrongful

1037
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,780
dismissal suits and it's generally just

1038
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,329
creates a big mess so but because

1039
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:57,369
generally the employees actions have to

1040
00:40:57,369 --> 00:40:59,829
harm the employers reputation or stop

1041
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:01,570
other people from wanting to work for

1042
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,339
them that's basically where you come

1043
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:04,569
into that situation where you'd be fired

1044
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:07,450
so if I'm an individual and I discover

1045
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,400
and disclose the vulnerability breach to

1046
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,380
a third party without permission can I

1047
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,170
be sued and this is where I did not find

1048
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,930
any commonalities between the common law

1049
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,640
jurisdictions the rest of Canada and

1050
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,000
Quebec so what I have for this is really

1051
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,290
just just applying to those

1052
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,480
jurisdictions and it's basically there

1053
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,060
is a tort which is a fancy word for a

1054
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,390
civil action of invasion of privacy and

1055
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:35,980
if you if you seek out if you find a

1056
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,810
vulnerability and then you poke it a

1057
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,579
little bit and kind of pull that thread

1058
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:41,319
what's gonna happen is you're eventually

1059
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:42,609
going to find information that doesn't

1060
00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:45,730
belong to you okay and you're

1061
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,140
technically invading and you can't

1062
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,490
invade a company's privacy that's

1063
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:49,630
something else you have to understand

1064
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:55,540
okay so if you do that you can be found

1065
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,460
liable of the tort of evasion of privacy

1066
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,650
and basically you have to have your

1067
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,290
actions have to be intentional which

1068
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,420
includes recklessness okay so it's not

1069
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,310
just oh I did this thing I'm person

1070
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,720
problem purpose I discovered all this

1071
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,130
information on purpose and I found all

1072
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,839
of it nice job and I stashed all of it

1073
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:12,730
it's well you know I figured

1074
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,530
there was quite a bit of information but

1075
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,790
I didn't really count it I don't know

1076
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,530
how much there is you're just reckless

1077
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,030
how much information you found at that

1078
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,390
point it's the same thing okay you have

1079
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,070
to have invaded without lawful

1080
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,560
justification the privacy of that of

1081
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,829
that individual and a reasonable person

1082
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:33,070
would regard the invasion of privacy as

1083
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:36,460
offensive or causing stress okay so but

1084
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,020
there is there is actually limits to

1085
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,150
this because in in Ontario and Nova

1086
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,040
Scotia it's really only been applied in

1087
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,540
situations where was health card or

1088
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:47,440
financial data that was taken and the

1089
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,170
damages actually max out at 20 grand

1090
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,730
which in the grand scheme of most

1091
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:54,300
lawsuits really isn't that much money so

1092
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,260
if you're self-employed and you have a

1093
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,150
company can my company be sued in the

1094
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:04,359
similar situation yes that's it so let's

1095
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:07,300
do a case study so this was an actual

1096
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,510
case this was an actual client of mine

1097
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:12,430
someone I have this person's permission

1098
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:14,020
to talk to you about this but I've

1099
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,300
changed names anyway they were okay with

1100
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,650
me using their name but I didn't want to

1101
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,990
do it so I've changed all the names to

1102
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:24,819
funny names so what happened was was my

1103
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:27,700
client was having a house built he

1104
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,470
logged into the Builders online portal

1105
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:31,750
and noticed that he could view other

1106
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,210
customers information simply by changing

1107
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,750
the URL this is all sounding so familiar

1108
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:41,140
so familiar okay they sent this nasty

1109
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,369
letter you can read it or not but I'm

1110
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,750
about to change the slide very quickly

1111
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,300
so they requested summer I'm just going

1112
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,170
to give you a summary of it they

1113
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:48,430
requested the return of all the

1114
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,589
downloaded material and for the person

1115
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:53,440
to provide confirmation satisfactory to

1116
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,420
big construction company that the person

1117
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,970
deleted all downloaded material from any

1118
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,950
devices owned or accessed by the person

1119
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:04,450
by a deadline okay they then barred the

1120
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,040
person from accessing the customer

1121
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,790
portal in the future now I'm I'm a

1122
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,829
professional okay I know that I've been

1123
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:13,540
telling jokes up here but I'm I like to

1124
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,560
consider myself to be a very

1125
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,609
professional person with the highest

1126
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:17,619
integrity but when I get a letter like

1127
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:19,599
this that just is so blatantly

1128
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,430
unreasonable I just I just like this is

1129
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,570
my initial reaction and I just

1130
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,890
I mean we couldn't just respond by

1131
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,720
ascending this photo you can't just

1132
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,930
email photos of cats flipping the bird

1133
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:36,050
to people so so we sent a letter ok this

1134
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,490
always lawyers respond with letters we

1135
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,500
love letters we email we we we turned

1136
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,570
them into we write letters in Word we

1137
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:43,610
turn them into PDF and then we email

1138
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,280
them don't ask me why don't ask me why

1139
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,350
we just do it it's all it's just madness

1140
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:50,810
so and in this letter we said your

1141
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,180
website was inherently insecure there

1142
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,890
were no security protocols preventing

1143
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:57,590
access between user accounts and there

1144
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:00,020
were they any additional accounts were

1145
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,850
accessed merely to confirm the

1146
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:03,380
vulnerability the extent in the nature

1147
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,210
of the vulnerability and the client was

1148
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,520
an authorized user and there was no user

1149
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,370
term preventing them from changing a URL

1150
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:11,840
and I'm talking about the actual terms

1151
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,220
of use on the website they'd allege that

1152
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,190
this individual had breached them and

1153
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:17,750
the client felt an ethical obligation as

1154
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,480
a person who worked in this space to to

1155
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,760
report to discover and report this

1156
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,520
vulnerability we also pointed out that

1157
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,840
there was a certain irony in this

1158
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,430
situation because had this person not

1159
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,200
informed big construction company of the

1160
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,630
issue a person with more nefarious

1161
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,210
purpose may have gained access to the

1162
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,740
system causing big bank to incur

1163
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,350
significant costs while risking damage

1164
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:44,030
to their reputation we discovered so we

1165
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,770
suggested that revenue attempt to scold

1166
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,840
and intimidate this individual big

1167
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,920
construction company ought to be

1168
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,120
thankful the vulnerability was

1169
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,640
discovered and the extent of it

1170
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,380
confirmed before a serious state of

1171
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,390
breach actually occurred and their

1172
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,720
response

1173
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:02,120
crickets mostly because taking these

1174
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,650
things any further than a little bit of

1175
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,120
posturing and a few nasty letters back

1176
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,830
and forth is really impractical they

1177
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,990
didn't really suffer any losses on on

1178
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:10,430
their side I mean aside from

1179
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,230
implementing the security they should

1180
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,740
have had you in the first place so and

1181
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,420
so there there would be very little

1182
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,340
damages for them so they wouldn't chase

1183
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,440
anymore and the tort of invasion of

1184
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,430
privacy could apply if there was

1185
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:27,890
financial information it just wasn't

1186
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,750
worth it for them to pursue and that

1187
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,700
that is often the case ok now this is

1188
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,410
obviously criminal liability aside

1189
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:35,660
obviously that was threatened but

1190
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,130
certainly no criminal charges were

1191
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,380
brought thank goodness and as a side

1192
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,339
note we

1193
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,509
no indication that big construction

1194
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:44,869
company reported this breach so they're

1195
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:48,979
bad they're bad kids all right so this

1196
00:46:48,979 --> 00:46:51,979
this is my favorite thing mostly because

1197
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:55,430
it's accurate so when I'm sure many of

1198
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,440
you've seen this before when you so when

1199
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,200
you disclose a security vulnerability

1200
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,309
when you've just that you've discovered

1201
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:02,930
when you're off the clock okay so in

1202
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,930
your spare time having fun you're taking

1203
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:09,049
a significant risk a significant risk

1204
00:47:09,049 --> 00:47:11,329
maybe your insurance will cover you so

1205
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,469
many of you have professional liability

1206
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:13,940
insurance especially if you have your

1207
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,559
own companies or consulting services you

1208
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:16,880
probably have some kind of insurance if

1209
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,960
you don't oh my god you should but I

1210
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,670
mean are you sure that you've complied

1211
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,440
with all the industry standards are you

1212
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,089
absolutely sure that your insurance will

1213
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:29,839
cover you in that type of scenario do

1214
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,130
you really want to explain this to the

1215
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:34,489
police or your boss sure if you're an

1216
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:38,719
employee these the risks are there and

1217
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:40,789
the reality is is that when you discover

1218
00:47:40,789 --> 00:47:43,339
and report a vulnerability when it's not

1219
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:44,809
your job and you don't have permission

1220
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:47,299
to do it and even if you're inside your

1221
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:49,700
company and you report it when you

1222
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,349
weren't really authorized to be poking

1223
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:55,039
around you're you're putting yourself at

1224
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,349
risk of reactions like this significant

1225
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:59,269
risk of reactions like this so without

1226
00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:01,880
solid protection you're at the mercy and

1227
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,499
at the merciful mercy of multiple areas

1228
00:48:03,499 --> 00:48:06,380
of law that existed even before these

1229
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,219
the internet did it's it's actually very

1230
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:12,259
unclear what would happen in certain

1231
00:48:12,259 --> 00:48:14,420
scenarios so the risk is significant

1232
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,489
which leads me to this wonderful and

1233
00:48:16,489 --> 00:48:20,029
succinct takeaway they for good at

1234
00:48:20,029 --> 00:48:24,140
something never do it for free all right

1235
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,910
thank you for listening everybody thank

1236
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:28,029
you

1237
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:35,660
I think I have time questions you we

1238
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,280
have a mic coming around there are

1239
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,160
questions I reserve the right to not

1240
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,450
answer any questions if they're too

1241
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:44,090
difficult you mentioned permission and

1242
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:47,120
authorization a number of times both

1243
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,560
professionally and personally I also

1244
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,970
have this question in general but

1245
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:52,850
because it ties directly to this what is

1246
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:57,020
the burden of of ensuring that the

1247
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,060
amount that that the highest or most

1248
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:02,090
appropriate level of recognition is is

1249
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:05,390
made to appropriately assign permission

1250
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:08,510
and authorization to do any form of both

1251
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,850
as an internal employee for internal

1252
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:15,020
systems but also to an external company

1253
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,750
say you're a pen tester that might be

1254
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:19,340
doing a physical pen test on them okay

1255
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,830
courthouse in a state somewhere that is

1256
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:26,510
a very no that's an excellent question

1257
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:28,550
so basically so this is the the classic

1258
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,590
and you could have said this in just a

1259
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:31,550
very few words and it's the

1260
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:32,990
cover-your-ass question is what it is

1261
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,540
how do I stop this from happening so

1262
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,870
contracts contracts contracts so in

1263
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:41,660
terms of you being an independent pen

1264
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,340
tester which many of you probably are

1265
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,590
you need to have contracts that outline

1266
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:47,480
not only the nature of the work that

1267
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,730
you're going to be doing potential

1268
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,250
outcomes limiting your liability if

1269
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,650
there's any issues especially because

1270
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,780
depending on the scope of that pen

1271
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,460
testing I've done I've done quite it

1272
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,230
I've drafted a few of these contracts

1273
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,510
and they're extremely difficult to draft

1274
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:04,130
because the problems that you're joining

1275
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,740
in parties that aren't actually parties

1276
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,720
to the contract because you have the cue

1277
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,160
have privacy concerns of other people

1278
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,230
involved in pen testing depending on the

1279
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:14,990
scope so you limit your scope first and

1280
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:18,340
then make sure that the scope is very

1281
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:22,010
very clearly put out and that scope and

1282
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,720
to includes timelines because if you

1283
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,460
don't include a timeline then they could

1284
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,960
say well we we only authorized you for

1285
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,910
monday to wednesday and you got in on

1286
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,100
friday like you did these things happen

1287
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,360
right so you have to make sure that you

1288
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,340
do that but in in terms of your

1289
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,610
employment emails get it in write and

1290
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,930
get everything in writing everything in

1291
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,250
writing and you'll protect yourself

1292
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,609
because and

1293
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:43,470
and view it as a contract view every

1294
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,269
email and I know this sounds horrible

1295
00:50:45,269 --> 00:50:46,319
and you probably don't want to ruin the

1296
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:47,730
relationship with your employer this way

1297
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:50,009
but you've got to put it in an email

1298
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:53,700
that you are doing this that you that

1299
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,009
they confirm with an email back that you

1300
00:50:56,009 --> 00:50:58,109
have their authorisation view that as a

1301
00:50:58,109 --> 00:50:59,640
contract make sure you sufficiently

1302
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,529
define the scope and timeline for it and

1303
00:51:01,529 --> 00:51:03,269
you should be more protected that way

1304
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:06,359
because really it's it's more the the

1305
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:09,839
criminal charges are are a kind of an

1306
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,720
off risk but I mean in terms of getting

1307
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,910
fired for doing that type of work when

1308
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,019
you maybe you shouldn't be or in a

1309
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:17,150
different area where you shouldn't be

1310
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:19,680
define the scope and stick to the scope

1311
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,239
sticking to the scope is important

1312
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:22,670
especially if you define the scope so

1313
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,809
because if you lose your wiggle room

1314
00:51:24,809 --> 00:51:26,460
that way you're more protected but you

1315
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,289
also lose your wiggle room yeah so the

1316
00:51:28,289 --> 00:51:29,940
extended question is that goes along

1317
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,799
with that is at what level do you need

1318
00:51:31,799 --> 00:51:35,249
permission to operate so follow up the

1319
00:51:35,249 --> 00:51:37,259
management does uestion to go before

1320
00:51:37,259 --> 00:51:40,859
it's considered acceptable so if you're

1321
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:42,690
an independent contractor it needs to be

1322
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:44,579
somebody who is sufficiently high up to

1323
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:46,470
bind the company okay and that's the

1324
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,849
same with any contract you decide but

1325
00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:49,289
the minute like I mean even if you just

1326
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:51,779
sign a contract with them it's like okay

1327
00:51:51,779 --> 00:51:52,859
this is how much I'm getting paid for

1328
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,480
this much work it has to be someone

1329
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,710
who's who can sufficiently bind the

1330
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,539
company but within a company it becomes

1331
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:00,059
a little bit more like do I talk to my

1332
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:01,739
direct manager okay well if you get

1333
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:03,210
permission from your direct manager and

1334
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,259
your direct manager doesn't have

1335
00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:06,980
permission can you still get fired I

1336
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,390
don't know it would have to go to

1337
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:11,759
arbitration it would go to a wrongful

1338
00:52:11,759 --> 00:52:14,279
dismissal arbitration which you wouldn't

1339
00:52:14,279 --> 00:52:16,470
want but I mean if you have the

1340
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,940
protection of your do your the

1341
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,470
permission rather of your direct manager

1342
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,390
then you're less likely to get fired

1343
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,739
than if you don't have the permission of

1344
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:24,569
anybody so it's certainly a situation

1345
00:52:24,569 --> 00:52:25,829
where it's where something is better

1346
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:27,960
than nothing especially if you're just

1347
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,789
you know that that curiosity ticks off

1348
00:52:29,789 --> 00:52:31,499
and you're like I'm gonna look at this

1349
00:52:31,499 --> 00:52:33,390
and then I look at this then well look

1350
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:34,619
at this and you're distracted and all of

1351
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:35,549
a sudden you've been doing this for a

1352
00:52:35,549 --> 00:52:38,099
week and a half and you have all these

1353
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:39,660
results and then you can't report them

1354
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,799
to anybody because you risk getting

1355
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:43,309
fired that would be bad very

1356
00:52:43,309 --> 00:52:49,490
unsatisfying that's right

1357
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:52,280
hey it's all about passing on the

1358
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,760
problem right okay any other questions

1359
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,530
I'm here anybody whoever you get to

1360
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:03,770
first they have to convince you in the

1361
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:07,880
same optic um how do laws apply to bug

1362
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,490
bounty programs and how do you make sure

1363
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:13,190
that you can actually participate in a

1364
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,109
bug bounty program without exposing

1365
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,200
yourself so bug bounty programs in my

1366
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,670
experiencing please correct me if I'm

1367
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:22,369
wrong but the few that I have seen have

1368
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:24,410
user agreements basically are terms of

1369
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,390
engagements where if you go on the

1370
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:27,800
website you find it there there's

1371
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,500
usually user terms those user terms

1372
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:54,140
that's your contract so it's kind of a

1373
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,359
spectrum right so at one end of the

1374
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:58,820
spectrum you have clear permission I

1375
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,380
have been contracted by the company my

1376
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:03,200
contract is solid I have and it's very

1377
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,220
obvious that you do and then there's

1378
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,570
thinner I have nothing and I just found

1379
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:07,310
stuff and I reported it to them at the

1380
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,540
inn you're talking about somewhere in

1381
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,339
the middle right where it's like like

1382
00:54:10,339 --> 00:54:11,660
they don't really have they have a

1383
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,810
policy but not a program it's a it's a

1384
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:16,760
policy it's not a like a like a

1385
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,250
competition where you actually like have

1386
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,920
login and you'd go in and say hey I'm

1387
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,220
reporting this to you so I mean it's all

1388
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,200
about your levels it depends it depends

1389
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,839
it's all about your level of comfort all

1390
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:30,200
right

1391
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,790
and I hope I've made everyone

1392
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:33,109
uncomfortable this is like I feel like

1393
00:54:33,109 --> 00:54:35,060
this is my job like I show up I make

1394
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,339
people really uncomfortable all right

1395
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:39,859
three yeah like more about it takes

1396
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,080
because here in Quebec now we have a new

1397
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,040
law to protect the whistleblowers so

1398
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:49,339
there's a fine line about saying that

1399
00:54:49,339 --> 00:54:50,950
there's a Ranieri or something there

1400
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:54,740
versus whistleblowing that's right so so

1401
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:56,839
whistleblowing and I haven't reviewed

1402
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:58,580
the Quebec legislation I have to say

1403
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,140
whistleblowing protects people from

1404
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,690
within organizations so if you are

1405
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:03,320
within or

1406
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,060
in you report a security flaw of

1407
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,920
security vulnerability you would be

1408
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,660
protected by whistleblower legislation

1409
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,310
which is excellent and it needs to be

1410
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:13,730
robust but if you are a private citizen

1411
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:16,040
and you discover it voluntarily on this

1412
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,860
off-the-clock scenario then the

1413
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,000
whistleblower legislation doesn't apply

1414
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,990
to you doesn't protect you maybe it

1415
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:29,420
should talk to your MP that question yes

1416
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,620
Hey

1417
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,450
so through the course of some side

1418
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:33,800
research that I do that involves a lot

1419
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,300
of discovery and mapping across the

1420
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,410
Internet

1421
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:38,810
I accidentally stumble across a lot of

1422
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,580
things that shouldn't be exposed to the

1423
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,620
internet that are actively open with no

1424
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,580
security and soliciting connections I

1425
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,710
send out a couple of middle finger cat

1426
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:50,930
responses a month because I get harassed

1427
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,490
a lot but there's no way that they could

1428
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:54,410
actually identify Who I am so I kind of

1429
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:57,890
brazenly limitation all of this first

1430
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:59,150
they have to find out who you are oh

1431
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:02,270
yeah yeah it's great I mean don't shield

1432
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:05,420
your ID done right and so I go hey just

1433
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,160
trying to help and it you know I send

1434
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,680
back a nice block of text like hey this

1435
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,790
is you're going about this the wrong way

1436
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:12,230
just trying to help here's your problems

1437
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:16,100
middle finger cat what protections do I

1438
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,450
actually have in those scenarios and

1439
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:21,740
that I was not I had no intention to in

1440
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:25,610
to even access them for any purpose they

1441
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,200
were just out there floating at sea and

1442
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,990
accidentally hit their boat well it

1443
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,130
would first of all have to be determined

1444
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,480
they actually were just floating at sea

1445
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,550
mmm and sure and this kind of goes back

1446
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:36,080
to what we're talking about earlier

1447
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,670
about how you have a bunch of people who

1448
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:39,250
are unsophisticated in these things

1449
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:42,140
making the determinations of how the law

1450
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,840
should apply in these scenarios so I

1451
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,160
mean I know it's kind of a non-answer

1452
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,030
but the problem is is that you have to

1453
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:53,200
show that it's actually floating a true

1454
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,970
roofer buddy yeah it was it was like

1455
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:57,740
that like all I did was just access the

1456
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,680
standard port for a web server on an IP

1457
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,990
address and I got access to say a

1458
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:06,170
hydroelectric dam which is not an

1459
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:11,330
exaggeration right yeah your computer

1460
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:14,450
and leave the house no so I the first

1461
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:16,130
time yeah the first time I did and I

1462
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,090
freaked out and I

1463
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:19,010
well it wasn't even on my computer but

1464
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,020
yeah and then you know I let a month go

1465
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,690
by and then and then once I started to

1466
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,600
realize this isn't extremely common my

1467
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,040
of course was less freaked out about it

1468
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,050
and took it upon myself to start

1469
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:32,050
alerting these people you're very brave

1470
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:38,390
they are stupid well I mean the jury's

1471
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:42,560
still out so I mean like in terms of

1472
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,510
your of your protections there there

1473
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:46,970
really are none and that that's your

1474
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:48,860
only protection is is that you you may

1475
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,450
not make out the elements of the

1476
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:51,650
criminal offense and we're just we're

1477
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,180
talking about criminal liability right

1478
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,430
now yeah but if you don't make out the

1479
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,900
elements of the defense of the offense

1480
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,370
rather really need to stop confusing

1481
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:01,010
those words of the offense then I mean

1482
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:04,220
you're you can't be I'm pretty much you

1483
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:05,390
can be charged but you can't be the only

1484
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:07,490
hope is convincing the court I'm not a

1485
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:09,560
bad guy is what you're saying the thing

1486
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,960
is that well the same time is public

1487
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,850
sentiment is like hackers freaked out

1488
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:16,220
it's also like holy holy crap this

1489
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,140
person was a good person and reported

1490
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,240
this data breach and now you're doing

1491
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,590
what to him like people generally

1492
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:23,150
respond like it's kind of it's be honest

1493
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:24,500
with you and when this happened in Nova

1494
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,390
Scotia with this young man it seemed

1495
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,970
like it was a 50/50 split right between

1496
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:30,230
people I'm a didn't obviously didn't

1497
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:32,000
take any polls or anything but it did

1498
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,350
feel that way that it was a 50/50 split

1499
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:35,180
people were very divided about it right

1500
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,350
I think the split there was that he

1501
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:39,170
actually did access the data knowingly

1502
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:42,920
and prepare perpetually he did whereas

1503
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,900
this is me just going oh damn and then

1504
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,190
moving I'm not saying what he did was

1505
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,830
right sure I am saying it didn't in my

1506
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:51,020
case I'm not pushing the buttons okay

1507
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,340
we're not pushing the buttons and it's

1508
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,260
easier for you to make out or a defense

1509
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:58,640
to the offense that makes sense okay yep

1510
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,180
Thanks welcome anybody else oh my god

1511
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:08,840
free legal advice no I'm kidding there's

1512
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,340
a gentleman at the back in a red shirt

1513
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:13,570
there is he's waving at you

1514
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:16,430
Thanks I was wondering if you could just

1515
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:19,880
speak to so for instance there's in the

1516
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,520
OSN missing-persons CTF that's going on

1517
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,010
right now I've personally done some work

1518
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:27,860
doing OS int before found some

1519
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,780
interesting systems where you can just

1520
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:30,560
search

1521
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,990
seems freely-available doesn't require a

1522
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:36,980
login it's run by a government is that

1523
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,600
dangerous should I stop doing

1524
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:45,290
presentations about it I don't I don't I

1525
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,720
don't want to hinder anybody's security

1526
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,790
research that is not what I want to do I

1527
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:52,430
just want to make you more aware of the

1528
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:55,040
fact that the general public the big

1529
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,140
world out there first of all they don't

1530
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,510
understand what you do okay that's the

1531
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,050
first problem

1532
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,540
second of all they're what people don't

1533
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,070
understand they're absolutely frightened

1534
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:06,800
by alright so when you I mean the what

1535
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,690
you were doing is it like what exactly

1536
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,820
are you doing like are you you give him

1537
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:14,330
the microphone back I feel like so it

1538
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:16,340
was literally just sort of taking the

1539
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:19,610
idea of we got a person's name and black

1540
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:22,490
box testing dig into their life see what

1541
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,410
we can find out about them going deeper

1542
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,480
than social media networks to court

1543
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,860
cases they might have been in because

1544
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,510
those are public information well as

1545
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,380
long as the informations available

1546
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,230
publicly then your civil liability would

1547
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,270
be very limited right all right how does

1548
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:44,240
that work across borders we talk about

1549
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,340
how countries are different - I mean

1550
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,990
first of all don't go across the border

1551
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:51,220
with any of that information but yeah

1552
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:55,370
and second of all I don't know I don't

1553
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:56,810
know how they treat that in the States

1554
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:59,660
okay that's fair I'm free to admit when

1555
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,100
I don't know things and I definitely

1556
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,810
don't know that but I wouldn't risk it

1557
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:06,710
either we had permission from the person

1558
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:08,540
in question ah I don't know if that

1559
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:14,500
changes anything it does change scenario

1560
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,820
definitely it depends type scenario

1561
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,780
which is not the same as I don't know

1562
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,590
thank you you're welcome

1563
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:26,300
does anyone else have any questions all

1564
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:31,850
right yes just a comment on the the

1565
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:33,980
borders situation there the if you're

1566
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,750
accessing data in the States from Canada

1567
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,940
that public information for the most

1568
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:38,930
part if you're talking about like

1569
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:40,900
property deeds and things like that is

1570
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:43,190
public information provided to US

1571
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,240
citizens

1572
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,549
and given that you're not a US citizen

1573
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:49,099
you do have inherent risk in that you

1574
01:01:49,099 --> 01:01:50,809
are not the intended person to access

1575
01:01:50,809 --> 01:01:53,750
that data so consider that I don't know

1576
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,549
the actual Leibert legal percussions but

1577
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:57,770
I have been as someone who still dealt

1578
01:01:57,770 --> 01:01:59,480
with a lot of OSINT there I have noticed

1579
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,339
a lot of laws surrounding that specify

1580
01:02:01,339 --> 01:02:04,160
that or imply that it was for the

1581
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,380
greater good of the u.s. citizens and so

1582
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,000
given that that exists within the laws

1583
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,250
there you may run up against some issues

1584
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:17,329
it depends depends alright so that's it

1585
01:02:17,329 --> 01:02:21,670
thank you everybody very much
