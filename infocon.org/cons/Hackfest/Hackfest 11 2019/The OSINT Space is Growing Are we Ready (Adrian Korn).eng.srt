1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,790
so hello everyone my name is Adrian Gorn

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,650
thank you so much for having me here

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,099
tonight if his talk on ocean space is

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,830
growing just to give a little bit of

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,450
background on myself

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,079
so I go by a k47 Intel as well my

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,880
background professionally has been in

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,180
security operations Incident Response

9
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,250
threat intelligence and OSINT while

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,380
working for organizations into financial

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,150
services and technology space and some

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,859
other stuff I do I also work right now

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,050
for an enterprise DNS provider called

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,520
blue cat where I do a threat

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,430
intelligence strategy I also work for an

16
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,680
offer profit called trace labs where we

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,790
do crowd-sourced

18
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,920
open source intelligence to help find

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,530
missing people and I also run a local

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,270
DEFCON trapped er I'm where I'm from so

21
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,620
just go over the agenda for tonight

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,770
we're going over a few things so first

23
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,230
off we're gonna talk about what own

24
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,329
scent is and where did it all start

25
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,250
you know going back in history a little

26
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,530
bit we'll talk about the common uses of

27
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,650
us and we're seen today the challenges

28
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,950
with that as well new applications that

29
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,170
were also seen in this space and then

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,299
what the future will actually hold for

31
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,680
that so what is open and where did it

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,080
all start we'll start off with that so

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,939
there's really a lot of definitions

34
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,280
floating out there about what OSINT

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,409
really is but really my personal

36
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,869
definition is that Osen is the

37
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,560
collection analysis processing of

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,240
publicly available data that is

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,070
determined to be of intelligence value

40
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,500
and when I say intelligence value I mean

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,479
it has some type of value to an

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,759
intelligent stakeholder meaning if they

43
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,020
consume that intelligence they can

44
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,420
actually make some informed decision or

45
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,549
you know gain some strategic value as

46
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,460
well and where can we find OSINT we can

47
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,890
find it from a lot of places the surface

48
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,490
web deep web dark web social media news

49
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,909
media even government databases that are

50
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,890
public as well so why don't we explore a

51
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,038
little bit about where this OSINT stuff

52
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:12,480
started because I know it's started to

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,890
emerge over to pass a few

54
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,260
years why don't we just take a look back

55
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,040
in time so looking at the evolution of

56
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,160
ocean tear this all really started back

57
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,250
in the World War two ERA this was really

58
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,310
where the government or US government

59
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,230
government was trying to find new ways

60
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,140
to get intelligence in this war they

61
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,140
were fighting and what they determine is

62
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,940
that there was all this open radio

63
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,590
communication out there that they could

64
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,330
take advantage of and start gathering

65
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,090
intelligence from there so they started

66
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,840
off trading a branch of FCC at this time

67
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,510
called the foreign broadcast monitoring

68
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,480
service this was really tasked with just

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,880
looking at open radio for any propaganda

70
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,280
material that might have been beamed at

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,190
the US and as they started to do this

72
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,290
they saw a lot of intelligence value

73
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,440
very quickly so they expanded the scope

74
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,440
of its program and they later rebranded

75
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,780
to the foreign broadcast intelligence

76
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,180
service actually and they started

77
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,769
expanding the collection of all the

78
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:20,130
stuff to physical materials as well so

79
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,840
one thing they did is they actually set

80
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,459
up stations around the world and

81
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,220
collected public newspapers and what

82
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,780
they would do is have these intelligence

83
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,120
operators around the world catalog all

84
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,190
these newspapers write up intelligence

85
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,890
reports and disseminate that back to the

86
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,170
home base so I was like the real first

87
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,700
documented use of Oh sent out there fast

88
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,260
forwarding to you know

89
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,500
2005 and Beyond era we saw social media

90
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,100
become to start to emerge we saw like

91
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,989
everyday users start taking advantage of

92
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,269
the internet for you know more than it

93
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,850
was like intended for and beginning so

94
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,470
in this time period we started to see

95
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,799
the pool of OSINT start to grow we saw

96
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,900
social media sites such as Facebook

97
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,019
Twitter MySpace YouTube emerged right

98
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,000
around this time and it was still very

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,910
new to everyone they really didn't know

100
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,380
you know what it was gonna provide to

101
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,600
the space but this was really where Osen

102
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,690
started to peak and also around this

103
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,870
time we saw the u.s. open up the first

104
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,960
open source Center and that was really

105
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,070
tasked with gathering

106
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,060
look data from the internet databases

107
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,400
newspaper radio any public data you can

108
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,140
think of they started to gather it for

109
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,940
their intelligence purposes and it's

110
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,950
expanded way beyond the scope than they

111
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,750
originally started what's back in the

112
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,060
World War 2 era now moving forward to

113
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,940
2009 we saw a social media expand even

114
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,130
more and we also saw the emergence of

115
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,980
smartphones and it seemed like everyone

116
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,930
had a smartphone with their Facebook app

117
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,330
or Instagram and they started to share

118
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,690
more and more of their personal moments

119
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,610
publicly via their smartphones than ever

120
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,120
and in turn in doing this the pool of

121
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,280
oceans started to grow more and more and

122
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,830
a lot of these social media sites would

123
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,610
have a default public setting on it so

124
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,350
that people would be sharing this stuff

125
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,350
publicly without knowing so in this time

126
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,880
era from about 2009 to 2016 we saw that

127
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,030
you know pull votes in grow immensely

128
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,480
and then fast forward to a few years ago

129
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,080
to present date we saw the ocean space

130
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,450
really starting to kick off here where

131
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,640
all these online dress hair started to

132
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,100
see that they could use all this public

133
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,380
data out there and not really have any

134
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,440
special access but still be able to take

135
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,240
an online investigation from start to

136
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,270
finish just using public data so really

137
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,890
this is where we started to see the

138
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,510
growth immensely over the past few years

139
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,590
now I'm going to talk about some common

140
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,330
uses of ocean today because there are a

141
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,310
lot of them but I'll focus just on these

142
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,060
four up here so we have the first three

143
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,250
your typical cybersecurity use cases

144
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,920
your blue team investigations your red

145
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,350
team your thread actor attribution and

146
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,150
we also have stuff like business

147
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,100
intelligence which I'll dive into a

148
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,250
little bit later as well so looking at

149
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,710
the blue team's side if we start off

150
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,840
here as a blue team er if you've ever

151
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,580
worked in a stock before you're probably

152
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,190
familiar seeing an alert pop in your

153
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,700
ticket Q something like this over here

154
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,290
typical alert in this scenario here you

155
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,240
might see you know malicious Word

156
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,990
document

157
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,990
detected by endpoint or on end

158
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,940
and the context that you're probably

159
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,460
provided to start is very limited you

160
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,830
might get the data was detected

161
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,740
maybe the file name and if you're lucky

162
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,560
you'll get a hash so if you do get a

163
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,410
hash you're in luck because OSINT can

164
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,240
actually help you here and a blue to me

165
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,280
investigation you can take something

166
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,550
like a sha-256 hash pop that into a

167
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,350
public tool like virustotal

168
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,480
and see what virustotal knows about it

169
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,610
and start to take advantage of all its

170
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,770
own sent out there to help with your

171
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,320
investigation so if I was of sake

172
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,970
analysts looking at that alert my first

173
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,800
question would event is it a false

174
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,200
positive well I can already rule out

175
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,880
that it's not a false positive because

176
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,640
it's matching on over 40 antivirus

177
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,660
hidden engines on virustotal you can

178
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,300
also take that same hash and pop it into

179
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,600
Google put quotes around it to an exact

180
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,090
string search taking advantage of Google

181
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:37,600
dork

182
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,340
techniques and you can see what other

183
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,800
OSINT might be available about it here

184
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,260
so here if we look at the search that we

185
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,660
did here you can see this first result

186
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,950
here might be a little bit hard to see

187
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,530
appear but this first result thumb says

188
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,890
e motet from any dart run and for those

189
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,930
of you are familiar emo Ted is a very

190
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,360
prevalent banking Trojan out there it's

191
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,980
been around for a few years targeting

192
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,970
various industries and any dot run is a

193
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,730
public malware of sandbox website that

194
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,650
allows you to upload any file and

195
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,500
actually interact with it in a public VM

196
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,900
and detonate it and do some malware

197
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,820
analysis on that get a whole bunch of

198
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,340
output from there so from an ocean

199
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,380
perspective if I was looking at this I

200
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,770
would already see that this file is

201
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,020
well-known as being bad and we have some

202
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,030
further context as well from the

203
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,950
intelligence side that it might be this

204
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:34,059
a motet banking Trojan if I want to go

205
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,490
further as well we can even look down

206
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,890
here to list at this URL that's been

207
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,559
classified as malicious by this open

208
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,110
source feed called URL else and what

209
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,360
they do is they essentially intake a

210
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,700
bunch of malicious urls from industry

211
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,220
researchers and we can see here that you

212
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,030
have one URL that's linked to that hash

213
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,920
also has a file name down there that's

214
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,050
similar to the one we saw in the first

215
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,990
alert so if you took that URL and you

216
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,600
popped into a different tool still using

217
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,700
OSINT here you can use something like

218
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,800
your else can I Oh

219
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,980
which is a public URL detonation sandbox

220
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,830
and you can see what analysis has been

221
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,800
done on that URL before and in this case

222
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,570
here we're gonna see it's been

223
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,270
classified as malicious and it's also

224
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,580
returned and application slash

225
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,580
ms word mime type one and analyzed at

226
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,070
that time that kind of coincides with

227
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,900
our original alert of it being a

228
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,990
malicious word doc delivered to an

229
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,200
endpoint so taking this alway if I was

230
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,900
in a sock or on a blue team I would want

231
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,300
to try to figure out how this you know

232
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,880
malware gone try network so using just

233
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,010
that URL you could look at something

234
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,710
like email logs and search all your

235
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,960
emails to see which email hasn't matched

236
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,690
for that specific URL and maybe you're

237
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,720
gonna find you know a nicely themed your

238
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,900
requested scan is ready email and that

239
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,850
would be kind of your original point of

240
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,990
infection in this case here now moving

241
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,460
on from the blue team use case and to

242
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,320
talk about how red teamers are using

243
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,990
OSINT for anyone here an audience who's

244
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,910
a red teamer that's pen testing or any

245
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,040
of that you're probably familiar with a

246
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,830
recon phase of every engagement this is

247
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,150
where you're really looking to see what

248
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,250
you can gather on your target whether

249
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,400
that's actual person or infrastructure

250
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,520
for an organization and OSINT really

251
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,140
comes into play here when you're looking

252
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,920
at stuff like domains IPS you can use

253
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,200
stuff like the public Whois database to

254
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,750
see who might own that domain and what

255
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,510
IP is my resolve to that or what IPS

256
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,160
have resolved to it historically as well

257
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,520
and then you can also use tools like

258
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,790
shodhan to look at the applications are

259
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,740
associated with a given domain or IP

260
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,500
starts you see what has been already

261
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,080
found out about that without even having

262
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,480
to do n map scan or anything about

263
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,610
nature yourself you can already see what

264
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,440
other people have analyzed on that

265
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,860
infrastructure just using showed in and

266
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,959
the second use case here would really be

267
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,899
around targeting personnel so how can

268
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,089
Oak scent really help there well the

269
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,649
number one thing any engagement is you

270
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:18,959
look at the employees of the company

271
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,790
that you're targeting look at their

272
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,230
social media presence like their

273
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,510
LinkedIn Facebook and see what they're

274
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,360
posting it's very common to see people

275
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,880
posting their ID badges people having

276
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,459
sticky notes with passwords up it's very

277
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,390
common

278
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,459
if you can get that stuff ahead of time

279
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,920
in just a recon phase I could push you

280
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,570
forward a number of steps in your

281
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,149
engagement so this is something very

282
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,130
commonly done by red teamers here and

283
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,589
then lastly there's this other technique

284
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:49,680
I like to call counter OSINT and this is

285
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,810
really where I'm a red teamer or even a

286
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,940
threat actor will try to use OSINT

287
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,329
against their target so if a threat

288
00:11:57,329 --> 00:11:59,310
actor spins it up a campaign they have

289
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,920
their malware they have their known

290
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,870
indicators or they're going to come out

291
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,019
of that like domains or IPs or even

292
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,570
hashes what they can do set up google

293
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,449
hours and analytics to see if anyone is

294
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:14,870
searching for those specific indicators

295
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,760
they can also set up monitoring on their

296
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,610
domain using Google Adwords and such as

297
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,860
well to see if anyone's actually going

298
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,930
to there and if it's a custom domain

299
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,570
they stood up for just one campaign but

300
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,130
they know was only targeting one person

301
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,500
it's likely not it can be visited a

302
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,690
whole lot so maybe they can go look to

303
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,459
see what the public IP hitting that

304
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,560
server is and that's really where they

305
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,350
can arm oesn't against the defenders as

306
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,610
well now a third use case that we see

307
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,800
Osen being use for out there industry is

308
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,100
right actor attribution Brian Krebs is

309
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,870
one of the people who were most famous

310
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,180
for doing this where he's famous to Docs

311
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,329
a lot of people that he investigates

312
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:59,220
there was one dock scene report he put

313
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,250
out a few years back after he suffered a

314
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,690
DDoS attack on his public web site so he

315
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,160
kind of sent out on a mission to uncover

316
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,310
the true identity of this threat actor

317
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,949
behind the Mirai botnet at this time and

318
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:16,399
what did he use in his investigation

319
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,600
well he had some clothes source

320
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,240
intelligence he got from some sources

321
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,820
then he used that and pivoted off OSINT

322
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,660
using stuff like twitter linkedin pace

323
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,190
van wayback machine to look at

324
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,380
historical websites and he was able to

325
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,480
kind of piece together the identity of

326
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,240
his person or so he believes the person

327
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,399
to be and he kind of posted this full

328
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,100
doxing report outlining all the steps

329
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,200
that he did using Osen to kind of

330
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,080
confirm who he thought the person was so

331
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,910
that's a very common use that were seen

332
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,250
for OSINT as well because all these

333
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,200
threat actors are leaving trails out

334
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,580
there and internet if they've ever

335
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,800
posted or malware to the hacking forum

336
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,200
in the past and there's some indicator

337
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,610
there they're links to a current one

338
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,830
that they're using it can be very easy

339
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,839
to stitch together who that person is

340
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,830
from just SAP now the last use case here

341
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,240
I'm going to talk about it's really

342
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,950
using OSINT for business intelligence

343
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,760
corporations are starting to see the

344
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,290
value of all this public data out there

345
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,180
and they're starting to mine it for

346
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,209
business purposes as well so if a

347
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:23,010
corporation is looking to venture into a

348
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,230
new market they might use OSINT to

349
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,600
figure out you know what the opportunity

350
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,640
is there look at the competitors in the

351
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,160
space see their revenue models what

352
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,180
they're doing out there

353
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,920
and there's a lot of public information

354
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,130
that they can just glean just from that

355
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,320
they might also use Osen to identify

356
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,870
business risk so if you're looking at

357
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,209
risky behaviors from their employees

358
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:48,209
under public digital footprint they can

359
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:51,600
be looking at social media personal

360
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,020
email accounts phone numbers and looking

361
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,940
to see what that links to on the public

362
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,220
internet to see if there's any risk to

363
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,079
the corporation just from that employee

364
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,910
and what they're doing in their personal

365
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,360
life

366
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,399
it's very common you're seeing internal

367
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,890
corporate investigator team stood up in

368
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:12,060
large organizations something else that

369
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,820
we're seeing is really where

370
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,320
corporations will monitor competitor

371
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,420
activity so really looking at the

372
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,390
marketing campaigns and such that other

373
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,100
competitors are doing see if there's

374
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,320
anything that they're missing just

375
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,610
looking at what they can glean from that

376
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,310
and then there's also on the flip side

377
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,770
researching target audiences for new

378
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,140
markets as well I'm looking at social

379
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,160
media campaigns

380
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,470
sascha see who might be interested in a

381
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,360
new product they're trying to put out or

382
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,560
something to that extent now bringing

383
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,149
this all together when we talk about

384
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:48,089
OSINT really I find it's such a broad

385
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:51,060
term broad space as well because we're

386
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,519
starting to see that OSINT is now coming

387
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,230
at the intersection of these other

388
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,649
intelligence disciplines like geo and

389
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:03,149
HUMINT SIGINT and MASINT as well so in

390
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:05,250
the past maybe like 10 years ago before

391
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,100
o scent was prevalent if you wanted to

392
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,930
partake in navy's other intelligence

393
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,269
disciplines you have to have special

394
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:14,759
access to tools like if you're doing geo

395
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,860
and you might have to have access to

396
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,110
satellites or drones or something about

397
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,170
extent but now using ocean you can just

398
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,629
use Google Earth Google Maps Google

399
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,000
Street View and start to kind of walk

400
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,129
the streets just from a public internet

401
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,839
connection and start to do

402
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,759
investigations that way and do some

403
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,970
geospatial analysis as well

404
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,019
when we talk about humans before

405
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:40,769
intelligence operators would have to

406
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:44,040
manually go surveil their targets to get

407
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,230
some information around them but now

408
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,970
because everyone's on social media and

409
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,649
active there and posting about their

410
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:51,930
lives you can get a whole bunch of human

411
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,579
too just from observing their public

412
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,470
social media activity as well so really

413
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,860
Oakland I find it's like a multi-purpose

414
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,670
intelligence discipline at the end of

415
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,109
the day it kind of intersects with

416
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:08,250
everything now what are the challenges

417
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,039
that were seen with Osen today there are

418
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,289
some in just in the space it is a very

419
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:14,970
new industry that were kind of entering

420
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,030
into the first challenge I haven't seen

421
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,490
a lot is that there's really no clear

422
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,689
definition of what good OSINT is second

423
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:27,209
challenge is there's so many sources of

424
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:30,240
Osen that are popping up and then some

425
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,400
are going down at the same time that you

426
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,710
have to keep up with all the new tools

427
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,020
and sources at a moment's notice they

428
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,880
can go down and then you have to kind of

429
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,740
switch your tactics and techniques from

430
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,049
an online investigation point of view

431
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:45,510
and then the last challenge I'm seeing

432
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,549
is really there's a lot of tools out

433
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,110
there and they really fall into two

434
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,929
different categories one being

435
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:53,610
single-use and then one being used case

436
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,100
specific and I'll discuss that more in a

437
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,570
bit just give some more context there so

438
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,490
really the first challenge what is good

439
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,650
Olsen like how do we define it I mean if

440
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,809
I load up montego putting some data

441
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:09,240
points get this nice-looking graphs is

442
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,640
that good OSINT well maybe not maybe

443
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,840
there's something better I can do so I'm

444
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,080
gonna go ahead and just define a few

445
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,910
definitions out there of good Oh sent

446
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,190
and replay a little game of Olsen trivia

447
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,230
to see which one everyone thinks is like

448
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,860
the most correct out there so number one

449
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,040
good OSINT would be pivoting from one

450
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,410
public data point to another in an

451
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,390
efficient manner to produce intelligence

452
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,419
that would be the first option number

453
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,700
two good ol sent its collecting

454
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,280
processing and analyzing large amounts

455
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,760
of data to produce intelligence and a

456
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,070
number three would be good assent is

457
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,320
driving meaningful and actionable

458
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,669
intelligence from open source data so

459
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,559
how many of you would agree with number

460
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,330
one okay how many of you would agree

461
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,260
with number two and how about number

462
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,080
three okay I would agree with number

463
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,450
three too

464
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,240
so really I find all three are correct

465
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,460
to some extent but really the main thing

466
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,500
you're trying to get out of OSINT is in

467
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,230
actionable intelligence like you can go

468
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,000
take a phone number and then find some

469
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,370
you know email address associated to

470
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,230
someone but if no one can really act on

471
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,900
that information it's not good OSINT you

472
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,240
could go analyze large amounts of data

473
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,210
put it all into a report have 50 pages

474
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,270
is that good OSINT well only if it's all

475
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,419
actionable also pivoting from data

476
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,630
points officially or efficiently that's

477
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,490
great to have from like an investigator

478
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,770
skill perspective but really your

479
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,419
intelligence stakeholder is only care

480
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,220
about what you're outputting of being

481
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,390
valued to them at the end of the day so

482
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,190
that would be why I would choose that

483
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,230
third option every time as most correct

484
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,610
now we're seeing a lot

485
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,769
new sources of Olson's are popping up

486
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,429
fast in the field as well so it seems

487
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:10,490
that for every five that you know

488
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,090
disappear ten more pop up as well and

489
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,320
because of this you really need to stay

490
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,510
up-to-date with all the tools all the

491
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,419
techniques what api's are available

492
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,240
today what are not tomorrow and then

493
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,549
also we're seeing a lot of the valuable

494
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:28,649
OSINT sources are starting to disappear

495
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:31,019
because companies are tightening up on

496
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:33,929
their security and privacy so starting a

497
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:36,720
limited access there and one good

498
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,970
example this is when Facebook actually

499
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,720
closed off their graph search API this

500
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,450
was really one great source of Osen for

501
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,700
all the investigators out there it was

502
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,029
used to do a lot of human rights

503
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:53,760
activism investigations and geopolitical

504
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,980
stuff as well stuff that was more like a

505
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,380
not-for-profit sized social causes and

506
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,899
Facebook closed this off in an effort to

507
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:04,110
strengthen the privacy of your users but

508
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,760
now from an O sent investigator

509
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,799
perspective everyone lost access to

510
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,950
valuable data we could do mass analysis

511
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,100
on likes photos and posts from any

512
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,809
number of users that you're searching

513
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:19,169
with that API and then also most

514
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:22,230
recently actually Instagram changed the

515
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,899
way that they display the following tab

516
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:27,539
on their app as well so before you could

517
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:29,220
go look at the following tab for someone

518
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,649
and really see you know how they're

519
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:34,130
interacting on their feet what people's

520
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,269
pictures are they liking and all of that

521
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:38,250
now they've actually taken that away so

522
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,500
that's another Austin store so we just

523
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,840
lost and might have been dependent for a

524
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,039
number of tools out there and and really

525
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,019
when you look at those and tools out

526
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:51,360
there there's this one framework called

527
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,980
open framework it's a website you can

528
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,649
take in any data point here like a user

529
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,889
name or email address domain name and it

530
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:00,899
will show you all the different tools

531
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:03,029
out there that you can put that piece of

532
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:05,519
information into and then help you get

533
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,309
like another output for example the

534
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:12,059
username section right here there's a

535
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:13,889
site called name check and you can go

536
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:16,090
take someone's user name and see if

537
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,640
it's available across multiple social

538
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,860
media and online platforms and then if

539
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,960
you see it's not available and can kind

540
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,179
of gleam that they have alternate

541
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,070
accounts up there and you can maybe go

542
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,100
and investigate those more the email

543
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,720
address stuff there's a lot of

544
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,980
techniques out there where you can take

545
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,590
an email address look at various

546
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,620
different password reset tools without

547
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,539
actually sending the password reset you

548
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:43,539
can get parts of an email address across

549
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:45,789
various different online password reset

550
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:48,190
tools and then you can get you know

551
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,140
email address the phone number very

552
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,059
quickly and there's a number of Osten

553
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:53,440
tools out there that can actually do

554
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,110
this now looking at the current awesome

555
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,120
tool in landscape this is really where I

556
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,610
see the biggest challenge that there's

557
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,220
really your two silos here you have your

558
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,309
single use tools on the left or sorry on

559
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:12,190
the right or my left here which really

560
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,909
serve a single purpose of if I have you

561
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:18,190
know a domain I use who is I can go look

562
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,679
up registrant information but then if I

563
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:22,210
want to do something different with the

564
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,100
output I have to pop that into another

565
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,710
tool and then the same thing for the

566
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,059
next piece of information I'm going to

567
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:30,220
find so they're very good for a one-off

568
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,919
use cases but there's some challenges

569
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:34,090
there because they don't really do a

570
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,850
full fledge you know workflow or

571
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,909
something to extend and then on on the

572
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:42,429
left side here we have your use case

573
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:44,380
specific tools where you have these big

574
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,750
enterprise platforms they're built for

575
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,270
very specific use cases and as soon as

576
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,710
you want to change something in the

577
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,690
workflow you can't because they're built

578
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,270
a certain way so the real big challenge

579
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,789
I see is that there's really nothing in

580
00:23:57,789 --> 00:23:59,649
the middle here nothing that's going to

581
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:03,549
give you the scalability to do your open

582
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:06,039
workflows at scale and then also your

583
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:08,710
customized ability to actually change

584
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,870
parts of the workflow where if we say I

585
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,320
want to go from IP to email to phone

586
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,000
number and then change that phone number

587
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,520
to something else and then go through

588
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,110
your workflow a different way there's

589
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,880
really nothing out there that does that

590
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,260
now the next part of the presentation

591
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,000
we'll talk about is really what are the

592
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,010
new applications of OSINT that were

593
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,190
seen out there in the space one example

594
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,460
is Bitcoin payment tracking just using

595
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,020
the public blockchain that's something

596
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,900
that's emerged because it's so open you

597
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,210
can actually track a lot of transactions

598
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,430
going on there and seem you know what

599
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,830
wallet they're going from and going to

600
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,860
frequency and stuff like that there's

601
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,170
also another new application of OSINT

602
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,020
with the trace labs crowdsource osten

603
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,030
for Missing Persons model that's another

604
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,380
one it's emerged over the past couple

605
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,130
years which I'll talk about but first

606
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,580
you just discussed a Bitcoin stuff you

607
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,560
can really do a lot of things with just

608
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,110
a Bitcoin wallet address to see you know

609
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,060
how that's been used out there in the

610
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,720
public space so typically to the average

611
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,820
user moves not so technical they might

612
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,350
hear about Bitcoin and think it's so

613
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,300
anonymous and everything they do on

614
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,220
there is like untraceable but the

615
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,080
reality is every transaction has written

616
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,440
to public blockchain so if you know you

617
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,110
know the owner behind a Bitcoin wallet

618
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,970
address you can start to look at their

619
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,310
transactions where they're going from to

620
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:40,300
money amounts frequency full timeline

621
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,310
and that's all immutable it's all there

622
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:45,160
publicly and you're starting to see this

623
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,260
type of stuff being used in large-scale

624
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,480
law enforcement investigations so

625
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,460
something that came over to DOJ just a

626
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,040
few weeks ago is they took down a a very

627
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,140
large child porn website just by

628
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,780
tracking the Bitcoin payments they were

629
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,270
going to and from the users on there so

630
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,760
they were actually able to use this type

631
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,660
of OSINT

632
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,590
technique to unmask the identity of the

633
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,950
operator behind the site and they

634
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,980
essentially mapped out all these wallet

635
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,110
addresses here all these domains that

636
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,640
were associated to them that they could

637
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,700
find and inner investigation using some

638
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,130
you know active techniques as well but

639
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,080
supporting techniques from no sense

640
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,450
aside they were able to really come to a

641
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,070
conclusion of who they thought that

642
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,840
person was and then they made an arrest

643
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,420
and took down that website so that's one

644
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,820
great use of OSINT I'm today in those

645
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,330
type of investigations

646
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,720
now the next new application of OSINT

647
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,030
is a project I'm involved in tres labs

648
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,730
where we do crowdsource dosent for

649
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,679
missing persons and what we do here

650
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:53,669
essentially is we take in a number of

651
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:56,950
public missing persons cases that law

652
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,559
enforcement provides we put it into a

653
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:02,020
custom Intelligence Platform and then

654
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,000
people can kind of gather together in a

655
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,440
CTF atmosphere and start to crowdsource

656
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,480
OSINT on these cases to start generating

657
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,450
new leads on the fly and provide that to

658
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,090
law enforcement in real time so

659
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,710
previously it really hasn't been any

660
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,929
model that's done something like this

661
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,360
there has been the one-off forums who do

662
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,600
a lot of missing persons discussions and

663
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,030
like one-off investigate cases but

664
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,039
there's never really been a crowdsource

665
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:33,730
model like this so really when when this

666
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,380
model started we started with like a

667
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,929
problem statement so there's a lot of

668
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:39,820
missing cases out there missing persons

669
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,850
cases that don't always have same level

670
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,220
of urgency for each one throughout its

671
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,130
lifespan and then really it was kind of

672
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,860
pairing the search and rescue

673
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,659
backgrounds of volunteers who go and

674
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:54,070
physically try to help find missing

675
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,919
people in the real world to taking the

676
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:00,039
cybersecurity skillsets and seeing if

677
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:01,270
people with the OSINT

678
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,700
skill sets can actually help out in

679
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,250
these investigations and then ultimately

680
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,950
intelligence value is if we can provide

681
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,750
anything actionable to law enforcement

682
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,960
to further along that case maybe reopen

683
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,419
a cold case or such that's really the

684
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:19,600
value there and then what we're seeing

685
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,450
is it's becoming mainstream it seems

686
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,330
that everyone or anyone who's done any

687
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,850
sort of Osen can kind of get involved in

688
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,130
this and really a lot of people don't

689
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,240
know that they've done

690
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,539
Osen before unless you put a definition

691
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:36,850
to it so if people have ever you know

692
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,770
been a student in school they've done a

693
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,200
research paper they've done some level

694
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,260
of Osen to find information there if

695
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,090
they've ever looked up someone on social

696
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,770
media as well that's another form of

697
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,169
OSINT so really it's all about taking

698
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:52,960
these skill sets from these people bring

699
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,789
them together to kind of contribute to

700
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:57,250
this greater social cause

701
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,700
and really what that looks like is we

702
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,280
have the model here where you have your

703
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,710
intelligence administrators being the

704
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,210
people who are vetting all this

705
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,470
crowd-sourced OSINT

706
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,419
you have your intelligence operators

707
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:13,150
which are the people participating in

708
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,980
these CTFs actually on-the-ground

709
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,500
gathering OSINT and it comes into this

710
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,110
platform that we have here and it gets

711
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,059
validated in real time by the

712
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:24,460
intelligence administrators and at the

713
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,900
end of the event what we do is we

714
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,539
disseminate all that Oh sent directly to

715
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:30,850
law enforcement for them to kind of take

716
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,370
in a report and see if there's any new

717
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,169
leads in there that they already didn't

718
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:37,210
have before that can actually further

719
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:41,380
investigation and just to give everyone

720
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,610
a preview of what that would look like

721
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,059
this is an example of a case it's

722
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:48,640
sanitized here but essentially what we

723
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,730
would put in is the source URL of where

724
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,799
that case came from so that would have

725
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:56,440
to be public in our case the missing

726
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,530
person's name disappearance details age

727
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:03,220
any distinguishing characteristics about

728
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,530
them and then this all gets put into

729
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,470
platform I'm typically around 8 cases

730
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,650
and then people can start to look at

731
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,409
those cases and start semane assent to

732
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:17,320
it and what we've done to kind of game

733
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,720
of viruses we've created these 9

734
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,179
different flight categories were you can

735
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:24,370
choose to look at the social media

736
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,590
footprint of a missing person that would

737
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,240
score you some points you can look at

738
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,700
more advanced stuff like trying to find

739
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,789
IP addresses or phone numbers that would

740
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:36,220
score you even more points and really

741
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,590
what you do is every piece of ocean do

742
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,780
you find you kind of show your work so

743
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,330
you provide the actual URL where you got

744
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,039
it from and then you provide an

745
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,190
explanation as well of why it's relevant

746
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,620
to that case and then show some

747
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,200
supporting evidence as well to back up

748
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,750
your intelligence claim and then really

749
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,130
what that looks like at the end of an

750
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,700
event just to give you guys a example

751
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,679
this was some stats we pulled from a

752
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:05,289
recent event in Australia where we had

753
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:08,049
around 350 contestants across the

754
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:11,060
country all crowdsourcing OSINT in just

755
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,850
six hours so in just six hours we were

756
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,130
able to find all this information you

757
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:19,850
see here Oh close to 4,000 potential new

758
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:22,580
leads on these cases and then we were

759
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,900
able to provide that directly to law

760
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,790
enforcement and now they have some new

761
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,920
information to look at I can maybe

762
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,710
reopen a case or two so to kind of bring

763
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:36,680
this all into perspective but was the

764
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,490
future hold for OSINT really so the way

765
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,290
I see the future going is we're gonna

766
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:45,080
see more crowd-sourced intelligence

767
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,660
models around OSINT because there are so

768
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,040
many people who are starting to emerge

769
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,900
with that skill set you're gonna see

770
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,430
it's starting to be used for some type

771
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,830
of social cause similar maybe to the

772
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,660
Tres office model I start I expect to

773
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,690
see more of those what I also expect to

774
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,480
see is really more dedicated OSINT

775
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,910
platforms there's a lot of platforms out

776
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,470
there that really are specific to maybe

777
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,930
threat intelligence or business

778
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,850
intelligence but really I think we're

779
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,980
gonna see more Lucent focused platforms

780
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,680
as well and then something else that

781
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,780
we're gonna expect to continue to see is

782
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,140
the shifting of OSINT sources so the

783
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,240
stuff we have available just today it's

784
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,010
probably not gonna look like that again

785
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,930
in a year from now it's all gonna be

786
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,790
different as you know different tools

787
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,490
change different sites strengthen their

788
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,040
privacy and such and really those are

789
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,540
gonna be the roadblocks that we're gonna

790
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,480
have websites start to tighten up their

791
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,550
security and privacy it's gonna kind of

792
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,710
close off some of the olson sources but

793
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,840
I expect the community to get creative

794
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,570
and finding new ways to still find that

795
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,210
OSINT

796
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,850
and with that comes the conclusion of my

797
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,280
talk I want to thank everyone for

798
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,340
joining me here tonight for this and if

799
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,200
you want to chat anything about on soon

800
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,760
after you can always hit me up on

801
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,930
Twitter at ak-47 Intel also tomorrow

802
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,840
morning cure hackfest my cell phone at

803
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,000
race labs team are running a full day

804
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,660
missing CTF in the CTF room downstairs

805
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,700
that will start at 10 a.m. if anyone is

806
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,290
interested to come and learn more about

807
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,890
the work we do at race labs kind of test

808
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,020
out your Olsson skills contribute to

809
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,040
cars we

810
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,440
welcome you to join and what's that I

811
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,150
will take questions if anyone has any

812
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:49,340
okay any questions oh all right I think

813
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,610
we're good
