1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,510
thank you all for coming um I'm just

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,059
gonna you know it's I wasn't expecting

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,679
to be up here the first time I actually

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,590
went to a con ever was hackfest a couple

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,320
years ago so this is the second time

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,289
I've been back and it's pretty surreal

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,119
to be speaking up here so thank you all

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,260
for coming and I hope you enjoy my next

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,230
hour rant on cyber warfare also known as

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,940
war in the fifth I mentioned and I'm

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,530
gonna be giving you a bit of an overview

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,329
of some of the problems that we face

13
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,460
when we sort of investigate what cyber

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,300
warfare is and how we deal with it um

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,570
okay

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,870
oh well okay I accidentally deleted my

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,710
about me site so you know I'll talk a

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,480
bit about about myself I do some pen

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,699
testing at security compass so our booth

20
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,199
is out there if you haven't seen it go

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,469
say hi in the past I did healthcare

22
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,410
governance and I also did a bachelor's

23
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,270
degree which I just finished recently

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,680
and that's actually why I have this

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,869
research because I did this as my

26
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,270
capstone so I'm pretty happy to be able

27
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,070
to bring it to a bigger stage now I'm

28
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,590
just gonna talk a little bit about the

29
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,509
experience of going through the research

30
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,729
before I get into the nitty gritty stuff

31
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,979
so you know when you started research

32
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,960
you think it's gonna be pretty simple

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,330
right like you think a topic you do the

34
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,280
research you make a report out of it and

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,600
then you know it's gonna be fine it's

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,369
gonna be like the greatest thing that's

37
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,070
not how it goes

38
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,930
when you start out researching such a

39
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,000
broad topic as cyber warfare you feel a

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,790
little bit like this and I think you all

41
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,689
know how this meme like goes right you

42
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,189
know you think oh if you just google

43
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,200
cyber and war it's gonna be fine like

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,970
you'll find exactly what you want it's

45
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,329
not like that as you keep you know you

46
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,649
start to find out that like there's a

47
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,030
million different terms that people

48
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,579
agree or disagree on what cyber warfare

49
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:57,570
should be called

50
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,729
I love them say you know it's actually

51
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,130
cyber terrorism or cyber espionage and

52
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,409
cyber warfare doesn't exists and that

53
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,880
we're actually you know just part of a

54
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,520
giant cold war that's happening already

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,360
and then you find out there's like a

56
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,300
massive 600 like page rule book about

57
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,010
how this is supposed to happen

58
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,629
but like none of its definitions in the

59
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:17,730
book are actually accurate and then

60
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,989
you're reading about weird stuff like

61
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:21,269
you know exactly how many kilometers

62
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,030
under the sea counts as like a

63
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,010
communication cable for submarines or

64
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,230
something and you know these are this

65
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,780
like the small issues that have to be

66
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,660
reimagined when we talking about cyber

67
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,180
warfare so this is you know it's a bit

68
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,590
overwhelming so they sort of come across

69
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,720
like such a wide breadth of problems so

70
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,069
you sort of feel you feel a little bit

71
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:43,769
in lightened you say ok maybe I can put

72
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:45,209
like these problems into some wide

73
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:47,819
buckets so maybe if it's like a function

74
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,170
of political social and economic

75
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,629
outcomes you can start you know mapping

76
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,750
relationships to each other and then you

77
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,549
know at some point after you've been

78
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:59,790
doing like six months of just just pure

79
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,190
reading and research and late nights and

80
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,459
crying you finally get to this and you

81
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,109
get this like weird thesis that's like

82
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:09,090
the fifth dimension of warfare is

83
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,620
intangible because the spatial and

84
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,810
temporal planes are simultaneously

85
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,480
condensed and stretched which like means

86
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,160
like nothing right but it actually means

87
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,290
everything and then the next stage is

88
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,900
this when you and you know my professors

89
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,959
told me this they warned me oh yeah

90
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,150
you're gonna have to like put this into

91
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,919
a paper that looks kind of like that and

92
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,380
you realize you've read like hundreds of

93
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,180
articles hundreds of newspaper like

94
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,169
whatever and yeah so if you little bit

95
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:42,720
like the house is burning down and my

96
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,579
professors also warned me about this too

97
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,470
because even after you do all that work

98
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,419
you get to this point where like you

99
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:50,400
have your thesis and then you know you

100
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,919
come across like what's essentially the

101
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,200
thesis but in different words but like

102
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,370
some other guy on the other side the

103
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,709
planet said it and your reaction is just

104
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,970
kinda like yeah and even after that you

105
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,250
know you you think like the process is

106
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,519
done it's fine but you still reminded so

107
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,049
you know when you're a broke-ass Tyrion

108
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,750
and you don't have money you're trying

109
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,639
to find like all that free research so

110
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,199
you got to like put your actual email

111
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,599
address it in and get like the influx of

112
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:21,000
research papers and then you know

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,880
sometimes you wake up to reminders of

114
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,990
the experience that you went through

115
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,780
with you know little reminders like

116
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,340
like all I wanted to know is is this

117
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,710
gonna result in nuclear warfare I didn't

118
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,720
need to know but like the other 47,000

119
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,550
you know indicators of nuclear warfare

120
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,430
Thanks

121
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,470
so without further ado I'll stop talking

122
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,220
about myself

123
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,120
and I'll start off why but by describing

124
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,980
what exactly is the fits I mentioned

125
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,139
because you know it sounds it sounds

126
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,030
very abstract it sounds like maybe I'm

127
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,430
trying to sell you some snake oil it's

128
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,560
actually you know a legit term that

129
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,510
people use so the first time that we

130
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,500
really saw it was an Air Force chief

131
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,440
said this quote or wrote this quote in

132
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,740
one of the military sort of publications

133
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,220
and so he said there that information

134
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,050
has and it's ending and transcending

135
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,490
influence so everybody you know that's

136
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,090
that's a pretty bold statement and he

137
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,790
decides that you know it has an effect

138
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,070
on society and our military forces and

139
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,010
that we should call it the information

140
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,810
operations also known as the fifth

141
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,169
domain of warfare and he closes by

142
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:32,490
saying that this is gonna be a really

143
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,740
important thing to secure in the future

144
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,200
um because it has you know so much

145
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,090
impact on society in the military and

146
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,320
luckily for him this didn't you know

147
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,960
become some weird like obscure reference

148
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,430
that you can only find by like Google

149
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,380
Dorking it's actually pretty common so

150
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,570
you can find a reference to the fifth

151
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,020
dimension like everywhere

152
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,400
you're probably wondering though okay if

153
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,020
this is the fifth I mentioned then what

154
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,450
are the other four dimensions and what

155
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,490
he means by the fifth dimension is in

156
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,770
reference to the original four

157
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,880
dimensions of warfare

158
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,580
so lens era see in space I think it's

159
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,960
pretty self-explanatory you're like you

160
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,729
know land is like tanks or whatever

161
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:13,979
error is like planes flying through the

162
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,960
air seems like worships of submarines

163
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,080
space you know space stations and stuff

164
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,930
like that and then we have cyberspace

165
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,910
and so cyberspace is the new fifth

166
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,860
domain that he's talking about and this

167
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,169
is different from Lloyd what we call

168
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:31,680
kinetic space kinetic space refers to

169
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,690
the fact that things that happen in that

170
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,669
space are tangible so we can like see

171
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:37,919
and feel them and you know experience

172
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,659
when they're happening cyberspace is a

173
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,880
bit different because it happens

174
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,150
so fast and really you know any actions

175
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,890
that happen in cyberspace actually

176
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,690
happened physically in like a small box

177
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,330
in like a server room and so that's not

178
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,890
the same as let's say like a plane

179
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,900
flying in the air with a bomb

180
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,610
you can't like see or feel or touch that

181
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,470
right it doesn't have what they call a

182
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,330
kinetic outcome or kinetic consequence

183
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,890
which might be you know like an

184
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,790
explosion or something

185
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,500
in other cases when we talk about what

186
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,100
exactly is unique about that dimension

187
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,660
and to skated back into terms of that

188
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,400
thesis I came up with that everybody

189
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,120
else also kind of had space and time

190
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,610
stretch and condense and what I mean by

191
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,340
that is um things can happen really fast

192
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,610
and have like you know explosive effects

193
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,050
or they can happen really slowly and

194
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,420
still have the same effects so if you

195
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,750
think about let's say a missile flying

196
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,910
through the air and you know what's

197
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,440
coming at you if that missile goes

198
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,080
faster than the obvious implication is

199
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,480
that the missile is going to reach you

200
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,310
sooner and then the damage that happens

201
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,050
because of that missile happens sooner

202
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,420
in cyberspace that doesn't happen so if

203
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,040
we think about the Stuxnet that's like a

204
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,900
you know it Allah straights this example

205
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,420
really well because when you think about

206
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,370
the transmission of the actual malware

207
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,320
from Hawk to hawk that only took like

208
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,900
probably milliseconds to happen but the

209
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,520
actual damage that it did to the

210
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,770
centrifuges so if you're not that

211
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,120
familiar with the Stuxnet

212
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,320
um events that happened because the

213
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,020
malware would make the centrifuges spin

214
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,250
on a faster rate than they were supposed

215
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,410
to and hence wear out the equipment

216
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,650
before it was supposed to so you know

217
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,020
nobody noticed for a good like almost a

218
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,180
year until all these like centrifuges

219
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,770
started breaking down and the staff at

220
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,450
the nuclear facility were like why do we

221
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,950
have a bunch of centrifuges that like

222
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,420
broke down you know wait earlier and

223
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,309
they were supposed to and so it really

224
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:34,679
paints the picture of this contrast

225
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,549
whereas cyberspace allows it does allow

226
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,990
things to happen faster and have you

227
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,000
know larger more kinetic outcomes but it

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,039
also gives you the option to slow things

229
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,590
down let it happen over time and sort of

230
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,330
let it happen under the radar under

231
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,660
under the radar

232
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,470
um this being said you're probably Oh

233
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,970
I'm missing another slide somehow sorry

234
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,490
so this thing said some doctrines have

235
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,390
sort of asked you know what exactly can

236
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:12,450
we do to define this and they sort of

237
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,740
came up with a definition of a

238
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,770
cyberattack sorry one second I just want

239
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:24,720
to make sure this is the right oh yeah I

240
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,510
just deleted an extra slide I'm sorry um

241
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:36,000
going back from here so the slide that

242
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,100
I'm missing is a quote about cyber

243
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,730
attacks and essentially what sort of

244
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,310
some legal scholars have tried to do is

245
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,910
define you know what a cyber attack is

246
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:55,140
and so wait I'm so sorry okay this is

247
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,810
supposed to come after I did this like

248
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,180
really late at night last night so and I

249
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,590
was like trying to cut stuff out I said

250
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,150
way too many slides I know too much

251
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,790
about the subjects okay okay

252
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:15,090
there we go so yeah okay how this like

253
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,130
space and time concepts um but the

254
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,780
question you have to ask what even is

255
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,670
cyber warfare right so there's a lot of

256
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,620
agreement on different things that are

257
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,780
cyber warfare as you can see this like

258
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,670
wonderful mind map that we have there's

259
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,780
a lot of different things that come into

260
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,250
play whether that's like directly

261
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,830
related to the military or sort of

262
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,630
things that happen sub-lethal II in the

263
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,010
world and the aspect of added cyber to

264
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,900
the word warfare right actually becomes

265
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,720
really complicated because warfare you

266
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,140
know implicates a lot of things the word

267
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,180
cyber you know implicates digital

268
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,820
technology and everything is part like

269
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,589
now has digital technology in it so

270
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:54,300
cyber implicates all of those things

271
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,790
it's a lot of things to implicate when

272
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,980
you talk when we look into how people

273
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,280
define cyber warfare we can first look

274
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,750
at like you know easy stuff on the

275
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,400
internet so Wikipedia is a great first

276
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,350
example they sort of say it's just

277
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,070
basically anything that

278
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,570
happens with technology in cyberspace

279
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,020
not wrong but doesn't really give us an

280
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,540
accurate sort of depiction of what that

281
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,350
is Google gives us a little more of a

282
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,550
grounded definition they say that it

283
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,470
needs to disrupt the activities of a

284
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,050
nation-state or some sort of large

285
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,480
organization and that there has to be

286
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,890
this sort of concept that there's an

287
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,080
intense of attacking them for like

288
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,420
military advantage because you know

289
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,400
obviously cyber warfare or just warfare

290
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,110
in general happens between nation-states

291
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,030
and we can see the Google also

292
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,710
conveniently it gives us a nice little

293
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,110
graph of the term cyber warfare so it's

294
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,630
not you know actually on you like boys

295
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,030
word term although I'm you know low-key

296
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,440
kind of waiting for some Twitter

297
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,550
accounts to be like hey do you want to

298
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,530
buy my like AI blockchain like crypto

299
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,330
currency cyber warfare protection but

300
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,110
we'll get there

301
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,750
the first occurrence of this actually

302
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,080
came up when ARPANET was sort of being

303
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,480
developed so if you're not aware of what

304
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,110
ARPANET is it's like the og internet

305
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,180
that was used in the United States

306
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,670
between all of the educational

307
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,500
institutions and the military so there

308
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,820
was this basis of trust because you

309
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,410
assume that everybody that was using it

310
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,240
trusts you know the other nodes on the

311
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,330
network and so a lot of papers that you

312
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,990
can read from you know publications at

313
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,360
the time they actually talked about how

314
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,700
people were you know proposing that

315
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,650
cyber war was going to be a problem but

316
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,710
as anything happens in development

317
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,970
there's deadlines to be met and no one

318
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,360
wanted to you know push back no one

319
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,310
wants to block like the publication of

320
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,250
the first-ever Internet so you know that

321
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,890
got vetoed it created more problems in

322
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,140
the 1970s when the Morris way worm came

323
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,640
out and even though that technically

324
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,560
wasn't cyber warfare a lot of people

325
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,880
sort of threw around that term because

326
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,460
it's it was the first sort of mainstream

327
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,370
virus that ever happens and then even I

328
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,260
don't know why exactly there's a diff we

329
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,730
kind of stopped caring for a bit and

330
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,170
then all the sudden in the last few

331
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,400
decades you know a lot of nation-states

332
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,960
have been going at it so that's sort of

333
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,010
where that that starts again oh yeah

334
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,090
this was the missing slide

335
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,550
um so what exactly is the cyberattack

336
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,119
given those definitions so this

337
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:31,350
publication which I'll talk about more

338
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,610
in depth soon it talks about sort of

339
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,579
just warfare law in general and they try

340
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,110
to define cyber attacks so they say

341
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,600
there's a concept of being offensive or

342
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,600
defensive but the main component is

343
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,920
really that it's expected to cause

344
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,999
injury or death to persons or D um two

345
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:53,660
persons are damaged I'm sorry I don't ok

346
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,299
or destruction to objects so you know

347
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:59,819
you have to either essentially like

348
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:02,970
people need to die or something needs to

349
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,369
like get destroyed so this this is

350
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:06,779
getting closer to you know what we think

351
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,360
about generally if we just think of the

352
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,949
word war that's probably pretty closely

353
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:13,110
associated but there's sort of some

354
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,360
unanswered questions the first one is

355
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,489
how much damage injury death or

356
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,139
destruction do we actually need to call

357
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,529
this a cyber attack there's also to WHO

358
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,139
and by whom are we actually doing this

359
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,379
attack and the last one is what are

360
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,179
objects because objects could implicate

361
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:33,230
like a lot of things that exists so

362
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,170
cyber warfare governance is a

363
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,660
contentious legal issue

364
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,170
yeah even NATO so as you're going to see

365
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,029
the manual that they put out regarding

366
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:47,699
this they it's confusing they've got you

367
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,309
know some problems to sort out um I'll

368
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:52,139
talk a little bit first about just

369
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,689
international law in general so we have

370
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:56,069
this concept of the object and purpose

371
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:58,199
of international law so you know in or

372
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,790
international law supposed to do

373
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,769
something they do things by providing a

374
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,869
legal framework with working definitions

375
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:08,579
because we all know anything that needs

376
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,199
to be regulated needs to be defined

377
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,709
before we can enforce regulations on it

378
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:15,990
there's also a sense of encouraging

379
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,239
legal obligation and state practice so

380
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:20,369
what that means is you want to enforce

381
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:22,290
sort of like what is the moral standard

382
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,449
that nation-states in the world will

383
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:26,970
follow and then we tell a nation states

384
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,470
that don't follow that standards that

385
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,389
they're you know bad and then maybe

386
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,769
sanctions happen and that's sort of like

387
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:35,069
the softer reinforcement that we have on

388
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:35,220
it

389
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:35,730
there's

390
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,439
concept of state practice as well so

391
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:40,350
there might be laws but for laws like in

392
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,609
cyber warfare where they're not very

393
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:43,499
well developed states are sort of

394
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:45,419
expected especially the more powerful

395
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:47,970
states to take precedent on events that

396
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,619
happen in the world so if they're the

397
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:51,899
first ones to react to an incident or if

398
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:54,269
they're the first ones to perform some

399
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:55,769
type of action than other states will

400
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:57,089
look at them and say hey look that

401
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,889
powerful guys doing this thing I can do

402
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:01,529
it too um so you hope that really

403
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,329
powerful states won't do like atrocious

404
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,529
things and then all of the other states

405
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:09,720
follow we also use international law to

406
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,730
reduce conflict and mutual escalation

407
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,540
this concept essentially means when you

408
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,189
have let's say a few nation states were

409
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:19,049
just enemies in general interacting with

410
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:21,480
each other and they do something in

411
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,579
that's like damaging for the other one

412
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,980
then the other ones gonna respond in

413
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,569
kind essentially or they're gonna make

414
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,579
an even worse response so as that

415
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,799
escalates you know it becomes let's say

416
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,049
like something like hacking can somehow

417
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:35,819
escalates like missiles and then like

418
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,619
nuclear warfare that's sort of the

419
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:39,449
conceptualization of that concept and

420
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:43,169
all of this sort of comes under the main

421
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,789
goal of maintaining international peace

422
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:47,459
I mean there's a lot of contention over

423
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:51,119
whether international law even works if

424
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:53,759
you were more of like a real politic

425
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,059
sort of enthusiasts then you might say

426
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,100
well none of this is either even real

427
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,720
like we can't actually enforce this

428
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,649
because there's no overarching

429
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:03,629
government in the world to like you know

430
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:05,549
lay down the law and sort of punish

431
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:08,490
other nation states for the purpose of

432
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,409
the rest of the presentation we're just

433
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:12,148
going to assume that like international

434
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:14,579
law is like somewhat valuable but that's

435
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,169
sort of like the alternative view that

436
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:22,230
we have so there's been like attempts at

437
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,939
war for regulations so these are the

438
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:26,398
three main ones not cyber warfare

439
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:28,169
regulations though I should state

440
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:30,510
clearly so in the last couple of

441
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,730
centuries probably heard of like the

442
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,620
Geneva Conventions at least and United

443
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,649
Nations Charter The Hague conventions is

444
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:38,970
another one if you're more familiar with

445
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,409
international law that is sort of the

446
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,960
other main component and essentially all

447
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,389
of these try to regulate a couple

448
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:47,429
different concepts they try to talk

449
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:49,440
about what happens before war

450
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,809
during more and after war so when you're

451
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,039
talking about before war it's sort of

452
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,360
like what is the premise where you are

453
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,570
sort of morally allowed to start a

454
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,070
conflict with someone else

455
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,019
the laws within war are you know once a

456
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:06,389
war is happening what's like sort of not

457
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:08,399
acceptable for causing unnecessary

458
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:10,679
suffering or damage to people outside of

459
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,840
the war and then the last you know post

460
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,940
war is when you talk about okay the

461
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,289
worst happened but we have to do all

462
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:17,580
this cleanup because you know

463
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,500
everything's a mess how we're gonna deal

464
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,580
with that and so these three sort of um

465
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,529
doctrines are the main sort of

466
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:27,509
international legal bodies that we talk

467
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:30,330
about today in cyber warfare know though

468
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,200
there are no rules there is no you know

469
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,720
equivalent of the Geneva Conventions for

470
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,360
cyber warfare even though we've had

471
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,250
symposiums and stuff like that it's not

472
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,590
really the same nature where people like

473
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,480
sat down for this exact purpose of

474
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,899
creating like a doctrine of law that you

475
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:50,190
know multiple nation states actually

476
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,350
sign into and agree to adopt so you know

477
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,779
this has been recognized as like a real

478
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:01,230
problem so it's not to say that the

479
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,480
Geneva Conventions will never happen but

480
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,750
there's been attempts to do so and that

481
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,809
quote that I had earlier it comes from

482
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:11,850
this book with this wonderful graphic

483
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,460
that's some on the internet made it's

484
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,559
called the tile in manual 1.0 and so

485
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,009
this came about because when the 2007

486
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:22,200
Estonia bronze talent soldier attacks

487
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,690
happened this was a cyber attack over a

488
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,990
disagreement of moving a war monument in

489
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,820
Estonia there was a lot of the the Hawks

490
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,590
sort of aimed that like every single

491
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,809
component of Estonia it was like banks

492
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:40,309
you know banks and like corporations and

493
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,899
like different sort of social

494
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:45,480
institutions and so people start

495
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,559
realizing you know this is gonna be a

496
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,690
problem later on and so they just said

497
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,850
well let's reimagine international law

498
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,179
in the fifth dimension and so a body of

499
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,759
NATO that you can see there as well as a

500
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:59,490
couple other organizations that deal

501
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,019
with the international problems they

502
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:03,630
sort of like collaborated together to

503
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,790
make this manual and the main sort of

504
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,100
sources that inspire this manual our

505
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,380
warfare doctrines so this might be stuff

506
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,760
that like they actually give out to

507
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,100
people in the military about like how to

508
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,559
be you know a soldier or whatever they

509
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,360
also had conventions and protocols and

510
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,800
treaties so that's like The Hague and

511
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,990
Geneva Conventions and then they had

512
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,260
significant international court cases so

513
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,520
again going along with that state

514
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,550
precedent idea if you if there have been

515
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,900
past examples where there was a

516
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,429
contentious issue and we didn't know how

517
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:34,080
to solve it let's look at you know what

518
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,760
the doc what the verdict was in the past

519
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,720
cases and so this was it was a pretty

520
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,970
good effort but NATO decide at some

521
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,460
point that it's not good enough because

522
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,100
it only really focused on the idea of

523
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,840
what's happening during war and it

524
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,250
totally neglected you know what happens

525
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,350
before war and after war so that's how I

526
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,550
Manuel 2.0 came out and yeah if there's

527
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,740
anything I can say about this book it's

528
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,929
that it's thick like it's it's like 600

529
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,820
page you know I was gonna bring it in I

530
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,640
forgot it and I'm not on it today haha I

531
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,679
have it though like if you want to see

532
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,900
it after it's like it's it's like this

533
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,790
thick um and it talks about everything

534
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,760
so it mentions you know what happens

535
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,990
during word but there's also a lot of

536
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,700
talk abouts just sort of other

537
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,920
international humanitarian law concepts

538
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,630
like you know do people have rights to

539
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,840
digital privacy or what sort of Rights

540
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,400
do they have in terms of like attacks

541
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,929
that were caused by some sort of like

542
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:33,090
hack or something there's also like the

543
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,320
weird stuff like I was talking about

544
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,730
about like you know land air and sea

545
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,429
space and like how those exist in

546
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,220
cyberspace and what's the implication of

547
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,929
hacking them versus like in the kinetic

548
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:44,910
world world would just maybe like bomb

549
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,260
them or something

550
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,940
I don't I could go on forever I'm not

551
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,410
gonna go on forever because this book is

552
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,030
like it's got so much stuff in it also

553
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,340
it's like mostly in Latin I should say

554
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,900
mostly but it's got a lot of Latin in it

555
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,150
so yeah it put me through some things

556
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:05,580
that's all I can say so the teller

557
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,700
manual is not official and that's why it

558
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,860
sort of has you know I said it it's not

559
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,840
really a digital Geneva Convention and

560
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,850
it says this explicitly like in the

561
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,650
preface it's it

562
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,900
the sort of thought experiment for the

563
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,330
people who made it and they explicitly

564
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,200
say that there is this sort of concept

565
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,000
of what the manuals supposed to be so

566
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,430
let's Lada which essentially translates

567
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,770
to the law as it exists it's sort of the

568
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,660
focus of the tally manual so they took

569
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,100
all of these cases that have happened

570
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,770
and sort of analyzed you know this is

571
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,390
the issue that has happened and this is

572
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,950
how people would have dealt with it or

573
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,390
maybe this is the discourse that has

574
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,060
been surrounding it but it expects it

575
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,430
explicitly rejects the idea of being Lux

576
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,960
Ferrando which is the law as it should

577
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,300
be so what is the law and I in an ideal

578
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,510
world I'm going to go through a couple

579
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,940
of key concepts in the book and just

580
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,920
show you you know exactly what NATO

581
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,590
doesn't know about cyber warfare

582
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,020
the first one is sovereignty

583
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,240
that's essentially you know the idea

584
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,740
that a nation-state like owns all the

585
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,500
stuff in its own State um so I should go

586
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,580
through it you'll see that it's very

587
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,740
kinetic and geolocation 'el which

588
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,880
doesn't really match up with cyber

589
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,680
warfare because as we know cyberspace is

590
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,410
a bit intangible there's the concept of

591
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:23,070
the use of force so this is sort of the

592
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,460
idea of like how much can you cause

593
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,620
damage to another entity and like one

594
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,850
this has become acceptable or not

595
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,540
acceptable

596
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,360
it's literally undefined military

597
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,340
objects again going back to that objects

598
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,490
concept what exactly is an object in the

599
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,030
context of law and finally we'll talk a

600
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,890
bit about international actors because

601
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,780
as we all know non-state actors are very

602
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,110
powerful in cyberspace but it doesn't

603
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,490
really address that thoroughly and

604
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,770
before we begin also I will just give

605
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,520
you a quick picture this is what a rule

606
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,290
from the teller manual looks like I

607
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,420
honored the 12 year old and myself and

608
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,070
picked you know cyber booby-traps

609
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:05,850
because that's hilarious the rule itself

610
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,380
is kind of boring though so is really

611
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,760
disappointed

612
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,620
but essentially you know you see the

613
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,800
rule it has a definition and sort of it

614
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,900
has numbered comments and so essentially

615
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,510
these comments will go through you know

616
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,980
how this rule is derived so which

617
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,540
sources they sort of pulled from from

618
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,880
all that inspiration to define you know

619
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,010
what the rule is and the terms in the

620
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,080
rule they talk about a majority and

621
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,060
minority consensus so the process of

622
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,630
making

623
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,669
was actually to have a bunch of experts

624
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:34,620
collaborate and sort of share thoughts

625
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,240
on whether they agreed on like the

626
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,250
statement of a rule so sometimes not

627
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,539
everybody agreed so they'll talk about

628
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,880
what different viewpoints are and then

629
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,620
they'll outline difficult like scenarios

630
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,390
related to the rule and sort of talk

631
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,000
about the different nuances in them so

632
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,580
without further ado let's go into

633
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,330
sovereignty

634
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,799
I'm also gonna have like a drink because

635
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,330
this is this is gonna be painful

636
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,970
okay sovereignty so essentially what

637
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,590
sovereignty means and this was like a

638
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,220
it's a pretty old term um we came up

639
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,080
with this concept of sovereignty when we

640
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,549
talk about warfare and it means that

641
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:14,039
like a nation-state has control over the

642
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,630
things on its territory specifically

643
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,760
like its physical territory so if

644
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,890
something is within your borders then

645
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,480
like the king or whatever has you no

646
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,260
control over it

647
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:27,750
um and so the first opening rule in the

648
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,720
book is just the sovereignty as a

649
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,150
general principle and so the first

650
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,640
definition says bluntly sovereignty

651
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,280
applies in cyberspace so that's fine the

652
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,809
second one this is like where it shows

653
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:41,730
it's sent to acuity because it talks

654
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,080
about the supreme authority of the

655
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,840
prince or King if you look at monarchies

656
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,590
only like 43 out of 195 nation-states

657
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,210
have a monarchy and it's actually like

658
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,500
less monarchies than that because some

659
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,690
of them have multiple nation states so

660
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,809
it's a pretty not current definition of

661
00:25:57,809 --> 00:25:59,370
you know how the world actually runs

662
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,289
they sort of try to like rush it up by

663
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:03,750
saying more modernly the state but um I

664
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,100
just really want the show you know

665
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,750
that's sort of the gap in like where

666
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,960
this term and concept has really come

667
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,750
from in the next call in one of the next

668
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,900
comments they say the sovereignty exists

669
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,340
in the physical logical and social

670
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,669
layers of cyberspace so like at first

671
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:22,049
thought like that totally makes sense

672
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:25,289
right but sovereignty has a lot of

673
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:27,780
connections to other concepts in the

674
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,000
manual

675
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,289
especially jurisdiction and we already

676
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:34,490
know as cyber experts jurisdiction is

677
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,690
complicated in cyberspace because you

678
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,940
can have let's say a server you know

679
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,919
existing physically in one place but

680
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,260
then like the data on that server it

681
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,820
belongs to someone

682
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,800
so when you talk about like just

683
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,540
combining all of these layers and like

684
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,640
icing is in a certain nation-state this

685
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,830
becomes a problem because we can't say

686
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,530
that anything in cyberspace actually

687
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,930
definitely definitively is owned by

688
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,480
whoever owns that territory around it if

689
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,700
someone you know owns that data overseas

690
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,100
then this concept sort of falls apart

691
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,780
and I want you to keep that in mind as

692
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,730
we go through the next concepts so the

693
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,670
next concept is the armed conflict and

694
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:18,150
the use of force essentially they tried

695
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,940
to design words to sort of specifically

696
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,340
talk about what counts as like an active

697
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,670
war and what counts as less than that

698
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,260
and I'll map it out for you just to make

699
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,710
it easier to UM imagine as we go through

700
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,440
some of the quotes essentially someone

701
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,030
can start out with an armed attack and

702
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,130
this grants them the right to do

703
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,830
self-defense and so self defense is

704
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,100
essentially an action that is equally

705
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,750
damaging as the armed attack that

706
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,520
happened to you and then once

707
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,920
self-defense happens this initiates like

708
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,860
an armed conflict and over time you know

709
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,900
this will happen repeatedly so we can

710
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,460
see your armed conflict is like an

711
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,500
overarching essentially like war and

712
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,260
then the sort of single instances of

713
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,240
battles are what they would call armed

714
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,950
conflict or self defense um so you know

715
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,360
that sounds pretty straightforward right

716
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,870
but once we get to actually sort of

717
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,220
defining this it falls apart a little

718
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,680
bit so the definition of an armed

719
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,900
conflict according to the manual is that

720
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,550
it's a hostility between two or more

721
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,220
states that's fine we get to the next

722
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,370
one though and it sort of says that like

723
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,260
we don't really know what threshold of

724
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,590
violence sort of counts as armed attack

725
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,420
and this becomes really problematic

726
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,660
because as we all know in cyberspace a

727
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,730
lot of things can happen with different

728
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,130
sort of levels of damage and it can also

729
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,290
happen not instantly as I you know going

730
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,680
back to that space and time concept so

731
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,360
the manual sort of tries to address this

732
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,470
by saying you know some of these

733
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,690
operations can count as an armed attack

734
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,330
even if they don't instantly you know

735
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,020
destroy our lives or buildings they can

736
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,470
cause

737
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,150
seriously serious suffering or deaths

738
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,830
such as in the case of let's say you

739
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,539
know the equivocal chemical radiological

740
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:07,110
or biological attacks the question is

741
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,179
though how many lethal attacks have

742
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,520
actually happened today and we don't

743
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,770
really know there's no official

744
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,350
statistics on this I could only find one

745
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,020
case which I will talk about later where

746
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,059
people may have died and it's not even

747
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,679
like you can't even find the DEF count

748
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,590
so for them to sort of outline this

749
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,070
concept where you know we're assuming

750
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,590
that an active war is like leads leads

751
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,159
to death and extreme damage it kind of

752
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,750
you know makes me question is cyber

753
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,610
warfare even real then because we don't

754
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,380
even know if there are any attacks that

755
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,440
fall under this category the telling

756
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,330
manual and international law try to also

757
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,120
address this concept of being under the

758
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,450
threshold of armed attack so they call

759
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,200
this the use of force and what they say

760
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,360
is that you know the definition of use

761
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,510
of force is that it's any sort of action

762
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,760
that is against the territorial

763
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,710
integrity or political independence of

764
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,789
any States so that's pretty

765
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:07,140
straightforward like if you do something

766
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,669
through a state and they're a sovereign

767
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:10,320
state they're supposed to be allowed to

768
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,049
do whatever they want as a state and so

769
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:14,429
if you stop them from being able to do

770
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:16,890
that that becomes a use of force now

771
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,270
when you get to defining the use of

772
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:22,980
force though this is no longer true we

773
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,380
say okay the scale and effects of use of

774
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,730
force essentially the nature of these

775
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,340
and force meets the rise to the level of

776
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,960
use of force so you know kind of quotes

777
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,900
itself and then the next comment says

778
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,120
there is no authoritative definition of

779
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,890
the use of force so this is not really

780
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:42,330
useful right however it does explicitly

781
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:45,870
say within that same comment that we

782
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,960
don't include economic coercion

783
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,370
psychological operations terrorism or

784
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,890
espionage in the use of force so this

785
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,510
really makes you question like what is

786
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,919
the use of force because we already said

787
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,039
it's not an act of war we already said

788
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,740
that like it has sub-lethal effects

789
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,630
effects but like most of the things that

790
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,610
cause sub-lethal effects are like

791
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,289
exactly those four things I don't know

792
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:09,450
what else you would call them so this is

793
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,390
kind of problematic visualize it just

794
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,549
to me just to summarize the concepts you

795
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:16,320
know we have armed conflict up there

796
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,530
there's injury death destruction that

797
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,480
sort of implies armed conflicts under

798
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,309
this is the use of force

799
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:25,380
it's literally undefined but it's a you

800
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,660
know not that bad but it's not any of

801
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,030
those things so what is the use of force

802
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,280
then like in that middle area I don't

803
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,370
know

804
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,870
okay the next concept they'll talk about

805
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,870
is military objects um this was like

806
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,179
hands down the weirdest one that I like

807
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,640
went through you started like seeing

808
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,940
these these papers about like you know

809
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,860
the root of the word objects and like

810
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,780
the fact that it was created in like

811
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,400
international law and like modern Europe

812
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,200
and they start like analyzing like

813
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,179
different languages and like what object

814
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:58,950
means like is it like object like thing

815
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,770
or like object like objective and so it

816
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,350
sort of like makes you have this like

817
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,270
existential questioning about everything

818
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:10,799
and it's a problem that also exists when

819
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,980
we talk about cyberspace so this rule

820
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,470
you know defines objects and military

821
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,169
objectives the definition has a few

822
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:21,540
different components so one is that

823
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,970
they're not military objectives so okay

824
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,850
we can create this like very easy graph

825
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,620
you know they're not the other thing

826
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,490
they're mutually exclusive it says their

827
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,730
nature location purpose or use has to be

828
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,610
for the military so that makes sense you

829
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,110
know it's like the difference of like a

830
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,059
tank is like probably obviously used for

831
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,190
the military whereas I don't know

832
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,580
something else is not and this sort of

833
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,820
object has to contribute to gaining some

834
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,940
sort of military advantage and finally

835
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,340
it ends by saying cyber infrastructure

836
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,220
may qualify as a military objective so

837
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,470
like at a base level this makes sense

838
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,150
right like one is not the other that's

839
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:03,919
great

840
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,330
but then when you think of computers it

841
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,610
becomes more complicated so if you think

842
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,040
of let's say again the tank is very

843
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,290
clearly your military objects a civilian

844
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,820
object might be I don't know like a

845
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,980
spoon or something like that's not a

846
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,740
military objects but when you talk about

847
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,390
computers someone can sit down at their

848
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,130
computer and they can send you know like

849
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,380
world the storing malware or they can

850
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,190
send

851
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,960
like check their emails and so now how

852
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,759
do we classify the computer it's just

853
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,620
you know it can be used for both it's a

854
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,860
dual use sort of object and so that

855
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,570
would live somewhere in the middle of

856
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,509
those two things and this becomes

857
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:41,340
problematic because we use military

858
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,980
objects to sort of scope out what is

859
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,610
acceptable to attack during war and then

860
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,379
when computers come along we have this

861
00:33:49,379 --> 00:33:51,120
question of like well it's used for

862
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,830
personal things but it's also used for

863
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,879
military advantage so now you know are

864
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:58,649
all computers sort of like safe from

865
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:00,600
military warfare or are they

866
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,059
automatically included and as you all

867
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:04,950
know attribution is a problem so it's

868
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,080
really hard to definitively say that

869
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,149
like a computer can be used just for one

870
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:12,929
or the other and so it kind of addresses

871
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:16,349
I in the next comments they say that the

872
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:19,918
entire internet could like conceptually

873
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,349
become a military objective if was used

874
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:24,359
for military purposes the irony is that

875
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:26,040
like originally it was used for military

876
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,129
purposes but it's really unlikely that

877
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:32,040
the entire internet would become you

878
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,219
know used for military purposes so now

879
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:37,260
we have this question of leg ok it's

880
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,379
it's not a question that people use the

881
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:41,760
internet for things that we would call

882
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,520
cyber warfare today but now this

883
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,409
international legal concept is saying

884
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:48,030
that unless like literally the entire

885
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,159
internet is used for that then it's just

886
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,409
a civilian object and so this you know

887
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:54,750
it could it asks the question like what

888
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,969
exactly can we use the internet for or

889
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,690
not for and how does this light sort of

890
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,450
let cyber events that cause damage fly

891
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,040
under the radar because we haven't

892
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,079
considered like it to be a military

893
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,640
object it's not like a thing that

894
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,810
happens in warfare the final concept is

895
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:17,339
that of actors so I'm sure you'll like

896
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:19,440
solve that Trump tweet at some point you

897
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,109
know everybody thinks like hackers are

898
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:24,810
interesting people um the thing is

899
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,329
though like they have a lot of power as

900
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:29,490
you all probably know there's like tons

901
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,410
of malware that spread worldwide and you

902
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,880
know massive bunch of things up like

903
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,410
want to cry and you know that was

904
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,560
created essentially by like two people

905
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,910
the teller manual doesn't really address

906
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,580
this so

907
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,530
from a high level this is essentially

908
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,960
sort of the different types of let's say

909
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,150
if you have two nation-states sort of

910
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,950
what classifications of actors the

911
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,050
permutation of which actors they are so

912
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,790
you can have you know it's an

913
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,590
international conflict which falls under

914
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,930
international law and that is because

915
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,340
it's a state interacting with another

916
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,310
nation-state there's also this concept

917
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,950
of non international law which they sort

918
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,170
of mention in the Tala manual but don't

919
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,630
you know thoroughly go through and this

920
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,460
falls under domestic law and so this is

921
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,590
interactions either between a nation

922
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,070
state and a non-state actor or it's just

923
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,080
two non-state actors the thing is though

924
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,120
we all know that you know cyberattacks

925
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,720
can be heavily damaging so it seems kind

926
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,300
of unfair to like consider this domestic

927
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,830
law if something like want to cry you

928
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,150
have spreads across the world to

929
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,020
different countries in one of the rules

930
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,440
against about self defense so they don't

931
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,030
have any rules specifically about actors

932
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,650
but they talk about it in other rules

933
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,720
there's a lot of contention over what

934
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,250
this really means they start off in this

935
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,380
rule by saying that the issue of whether

936
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,000
a non-state actors can actually be an

937
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,330
armed attack is not really defined but

938
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,180
then they also say that when 9/11

939
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,830
happened this was characterized as an

940
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,750
international attack it was seen as like

941
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,880
an attack on the nation-state by like

942
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,770
another country even though it was

943
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,300
technically like a terrorist group that

944
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,600
wasn't you know acting under the state

945
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,560
and then they further say that states

946
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,860
have sort of established a practice of

947
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,110
having being able to act in self-defense

948
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,750
so that means again you know reacting in

949
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,770
kind causing the same amount of damage

950
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,330
when it happens by non-state actors

951
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,640
without the involvement of a state so

952
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,040
that sounds great but like there's so

953
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,980
many clauses in the Italian manual that

954
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,900
some talk about that not being allowed

955
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,060
and then so they say there's just

956
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,850
significant uncertainty regarding you

957
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,370
know how organized a group has to be to

958
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:47,220
mount an armed attack so as you are

959
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,720
probably aware there's different levels

960
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,120
of our organization you know you can

961
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,010
have like one person that's a non-state

962
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:53,609
actor

963
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:55,380
or you can have let's say like a

964
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,849
hacktivist group and maybe they're a

965
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,319
little bit disorganized or you can have

966
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:00,599
you know really organized terrorist

967
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:04,619
groups um and so essentially they've

968
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,299
said we really just don't know what to

969
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:08,640
do about any of those groups unless it's

970
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,349
like very clearly a nation state that

971
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:14,489
presents itself as a state so given all

972
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:16,470
of these sort of issues I've talked

973
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,180
about none of them are really well

974
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,339
defined we can ask you know what exactly

975
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,869
is the nature of cyber warfare we don't

976
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:25,410
know but I can tell you at least sort of

977
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,390
some of the cyber warfare events that

978
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,769
have happened in the real world and

979
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:31,130
maybe you can make your own judgement so

980
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,499
we'll talk about a couple different

981
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:36,089
things where there may have been kinetic

982
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:38,489
consequences to cyber attacks and sort

983
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:42,299
of the nuances of how using the rules in

984
00:38:42,299 --> 00:38:44,359
the manual this would look if we try to

985
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:46,049
organize it and that's sort of like

986
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:49,799
metric in the real world I'll just talk

987
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:51,749
briefly these are the significant cyber

988
00:38:51,749 --> 00:38:54,359
players today so I mean if you read the

989
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:55,470
news at all you're probably are aware

990
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,150
this already these are the six

991
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,710
nation-states that sort of invests the

992
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,319
most into cyber warfare warfare or cyber

993
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:03,420
defence technology or have been

994
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,170
exchanging blows in cyberspace the

995
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:10,589
couple that I've focused on what I was

996
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:12,359
going to do all three of these cases the

997
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:14,400
Ukrainian power grid attacks the DNC

998
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,809
hack and Hamas versus Israel Israel

999
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:19,980
turns out I had like way too many slides

1000
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,109
and I know too much about this so I had

1001
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,269
to cut out Ukraine power to talk but you

1002
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:25,619
can think about it after because you'll

1003
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:27,650
see the methodology how it happens and

1004
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,940
sort of think about what it means to

1005
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,210
attack a power grid so the first one is

1006
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:37,400
the Democratic National Committee hoc

1007
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,980
and I'm sure you've probably all at

1008
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,170
least heard of this heard of this at

1009
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:47,369
some points I won't go too thoroughly

1010
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:49,769
through all of the events because like

1011
00:39:49,769 --> 00:39:50,999
if you've been following it all it's

1012
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:52,289
just way too complex there's so many

1013
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,359
things happening at any given time so

1014
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,670
many parties interacting over the course

1015
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,559
of two years but I'll give you some of

1016
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:04,190
the main events oops

1017
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,390
so we have the DNC we have the bears

1018
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:12,870
from Russia they sent a spear phishing

1019
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,380
email to some people at the DNC

1020
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,980
specifically in 2015 they sent these to

1021
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,310
the X agent and X tunnel malware and in

1022
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,620
2016 fancy bearer sent see daddy and

1023
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,140
PowerShell I was gonna like you know put

1024
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,790
icons for that but then I thought you

1025
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,740
know representing X Asian and external

1026
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,810
kind of hard I don't want to try to

1027
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:35,580
represent seed out of you that's not

1028
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:40,410
gonna work out well for me but anyways

1029
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,630
they sent these two malware samples uh

1030
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,490
allegedly they actually didn't know

1031
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,350
anything about each other attacking it

1032
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,850
so they were like separate operations

1033
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:51,030
from Russia um and they sort of

1034
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,430
exfiltrated some things what this

1035
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,230
resulted in is some knowing a lot about

1036
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,300
the DNC and so the first sort of big

1037
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,340
result was the WikiLeaks document leaks

1038
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,110
there were a couple I think there were

1039
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,820
two separate leaks one of them was like

1040
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,500
the twenty thousand emails and eight

1041
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,280
thousand attachments the other one was

1042
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,930
another like fifty-eight thousand

1043
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:12,150
documents so that was like you know a

1044
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,370
lot of bad press for the DNC especially

1045
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,260
with election day coming up

1046
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,860
they also found when they investigated

1047
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,150
this so there were several third-party

1048
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,310
investigations by like you know like

1049
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,050
Mandy and fire are and like I know a ton

1050
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,480
of other organizations as well as by the

1051
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,460
NSA and they found eventually that's the

1052
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,360
Russian sort of Intel bodies they had

1053
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,060
done a bunch of different information

1054
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,290
operations and so one of them was that

1055
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:43,320
they bought a bunch of targeted ads and

1056
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,770
they sent them to specific areas in the

1057
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,020
United States where there was sort of a

1058
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,270
more Trump approach from sort of

1059
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:55,950
consensus they also tried to support the

1060
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,230
pros from consensus by creating this

1061
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,660
slogan so it was associated with the

1062
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,360
black lives matter movement and that's

1063
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,610
very contentious for a lot of reasons

1064
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,290
but essentially like they didn't even

1065
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,940
try to do anything specific they just

1066
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,350
tried to blow this like out of

1067
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,510
proportion and make it a bigger a bigger

1068
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,550
deal so that more people were divided

1069
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,830
about the issue and then finally they

1070
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,900
found that they had actually planned

1071
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,740
in case Hillary won they had planned

1072
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,600
sort of like a campaign of spreading

1073
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,800
this hashtag the democracy rest in peace

1074
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,850
just the sort of like you know give a

1075
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,180
final last glow the outcome of this is

1076
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,720
sort of there's a consensus that yeah

1077
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,220
this did influence the election but it's

1078
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,450
kind of weird too because no one

1079
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,310
directly hacked the election no one

1080
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,780
directly tried to hack the voting

1081
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,100
machines or the servers that may be

1082
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,710
collecting the data about it um so that

1083
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,530
puts it in a really weird place the

1084
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:52,770
attribution that happened afterwards as

1085
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,090
I mentioned the third-party

1086
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:58,080
investigations the NSA um very clearly

1087
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,030
stated like you know we know this is

1088
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:03,390
Russia Obama put sanctions on a bunch of

1089
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:05,700
Russian diplomats - and sent them home

1090
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,450
and Putin was not very happy about that

1091
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,040
they attributed specific groups so the

1092
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,050
internet research agency is sort of the

1093
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,240
one that has like Patrol factories and

1094
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,920
whatnot and the main and television

1095
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,470
intelligence Directorate which is

1096
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,110
abbreviated as the GRU because that's of

1097
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:27,060
the words work in Russian and that's

1098
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,540
sort of like their main Intel body Putin

1099
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,820
denied this like all the time he

1100
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,830
suggested that maybe oh like it wasn't

1101
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,650
us there was patriotic hackers that sort

1102
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:41,030
of you know we're non-state actors and

1103
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:45,510
he stated he also had sanctions in

1104
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,850
response to Obama's sanctions and he

1105
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,320
cited that it was just like a bad

1106
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,520
relations sort of scenario so it's

1107
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,980
interesting though because all of these

1108
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,840
would sort of say you know a

1109
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,510
nation-state has an adopted

1110
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,800
responsibility on Russia's side so and

1111
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,540
that's the sort of the prerequisite if

1112
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,070
you're talking about cyber warfare it's

1113
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,780
like both of the nation states have to

1114
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,840
assert themselves as like owning a piece

1115
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,280
of this conflict and like you know

1116
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,680
engaging in it together

1117
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,500
despite this there's this sort of

1118
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,070
general agreement that this was cyber

1119
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,570
warfare so you can like you don't go

1120
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,370
just on the area and look up the DNC

1121
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,960
hack and there's like so many headlines

1122
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,970
that sort of point to the fact that this

1123
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:29,910
is cyber warfare if you actually try to

1124
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:32,520
break it down

1125
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,950
it's not really that it's not that easy

1126
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,190
to assert so we can ask okay is this an

1127
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,440
armed attack there was no direct kinetic

1128
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,060
consequences in terms of like you know

1129
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,690
violence or death so probably not

1130
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,790
election tampering though I mean now you

1131
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,020
have to ask like what does the word

1132
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,210
violence mean is tampering with like the

1133
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:54,230
democratic rights of a people a sort of

1134
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:57,510
active violence per se you can ask

1135
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:00,330
whether it's a use of force and this can

1136
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,160
be I don't know it can be seen as yes

1137
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,010
but it can also seen us know so if you

1138
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,869
talk again about that prerequisite of

1139
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:08,700
territorial integrity or political

1140
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,589
independence you would think like

1141
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:12,119
Hawking an election is a pretty clear

1142
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:14,580
sort of breach of you know someone

1143
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,450
else's territory territorial integrity

1144
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:19,710
that being said though in the same

1145
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,050
definition we exclude psychological and

1146
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:23,609
media manipulation which is really how

1147
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:25,710
all this attack happens there was no

1148
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,839
attack on the actual infrastructure that

1149
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,710
you know under held the election itself

1150
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:36,810
is it state to state we would think yes

1151
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,670
because like everyone attributed Russia

1152
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,349
and it seems like pretty clear that it's

1153
00:45:40,349 --> 00:45:42,960
Russia but on the Russian side they deny

1154
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,160
the attribution and again you need to

1155
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,990
explicitly say that you know it was me

1156
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,150
that engaged in this act of warfare so

1157
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:50,070
yes but also no and then finally

1158
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,500
military objects are again confusing

1159
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,650
because going back to what I was saying

1160
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:57,089
you have to ask you know are the DNC

1161
00:45:57,089 --> 00:45:59,760
targets civilian themselves is this

1162
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,710
technically like because they're part of

1163
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,300
a government does that make them like a

1164
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,849
military objects and you also have to

1165
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:09,480
ask the civilians that were part of this

1166
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,880
so the people were they saw the social

1167
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,940
media campaigns and whatnot were they

1168
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,800
actually an operational object can you

1169
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,020
count just like civilians as a military

1170
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,240
strategy or are they normal people that

1171
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,830
you know shouldn't be included in war

1172
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:26,099
and also I didn't mention us here but

1173
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:28,170
like also generally again is the

1174
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:29,940
internet like is it a military object

1175
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,410
itself or do we need to preclude the

1176
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,680
entire Internet to call it war so it's

1177
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,770
the the verdict on this is that we don't

1178
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,720
really know this might be cyber warfare

1179
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,700
it might not be pretty much every

1180
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,900
category says like it's confusing I

1181
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,350
personally would put

1182
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,330
I'm sort of middle ground between cyber

1183
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,490
operation and cyber warfare because

1184
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,950
again hacking something like an election

1185
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:54,120
is sort of central to like what a

1186
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,090
nation-state does but at the same time

1187
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,310
no one died nothing was you know

1188
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:03,810
destroyed physically so maybe not the

1189
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:07,350
second case study happened conveniently

1190
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,180
I should say conveniently it happened

1191
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:12,960
really recently um back in May 2019

1192
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,120
and it didn't have a lot of press so you

1193
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,890
might have not heard of it it was an

1194
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:18,890
exchange between Hamas which is a

1195
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:22,020
religious group and that occupies the

1196
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,790
Gaza Strip and Israel so this one is a

1197
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:29,700
bit simpler of a scenario you have Hamas

1198
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,240
there's hackers they send a cyber attack

1199
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:38,070
to Israel and Israel responds by posting

1200
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:43,590
this tweet one day yes so essentially

1201
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:48,120
they sent a missile strike to this

1202
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,490
building in response to this alleged

1203
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:53,070
cyber attack the cyber attack we don't

1204
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,530
know anything then they about the nature

1205
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,020
of it at least not publicly so we don't

1206
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,510
know you know how long it happened or

1207
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,610
what exactly what kind of damage it did

1208
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:05,480
to Israel's assets or anything like that

1209
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,400
the air strike itself happened in May 20

1210
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:15,480
19 is real sort of explicitly attributed

1211
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,030
itself about the air strikes so if you

1212
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,650
read like one of the translated website

1213
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,350
pages they say that you know they caught

1214
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,360
the operation coming from the Gaza Strip

1215
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,170
and they noticed that it was trying to

1216
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:29,910
damage their assets and so after that

1217
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,890
they decided to not only handle the

1218
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:33,450
cyber dimension but also the physical

1219
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:38,310
dimension so this seems like maybe okay

1220
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:40,860
it should be closer to warfare cyber

1221
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,900
warfare because there was some damage um

1222
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,880
I think it's interesting though the

1223
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,800
contrast towards the thean Seahawk is

1224
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,540
that no one really says it's cyber

1225
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,100
warfare you know you've got that like

1226
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,080
one word or article up there that says

1227
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,330
maybe it's cyber war or it it means

1228
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,420
something for the future of cyber war

1229
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,400
but all of the other things call it a

1230
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,160
cyber

1231
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,050
or something similar if you break it

1232
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:05,350
down we also see that even though there

1233
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,300
was kinetic destruction there's sort of

1234
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,880
contention around this so was it an

1235
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,760
armed attack this becomes difficult

1236
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,410
because now you have to argue are you

1237
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,940
going to consider the whole conflict as

1238
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,070
like one thing or you're gonna divide

1239
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,080
like the cyber attack versus the kinetic

1240
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,990
attack so if you want to talk about you

1241
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:24,220
know both of them together there was

1242
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:27,310
definitely a kinetic response allegedly

1243
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,620
some people in the building died and

1244
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,660
also the property was destroyed however

1245
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:35,680
we don't know if the cyber initiation

1246
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,730
attack was sort of at the same degree of

1247
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,590
damage we don't know if it would if it

1248
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:43,180
would have warranted like an act of

1249
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,660
self-defense if we look at the use of

1250
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:50,980
force are all all armed attacks are uses

1251
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,510
of force it's just like a worse use of

1252
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,820
force but again we still don't know

1253
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,770
about the cyber attack so we can't say

1254
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,390
like the cyber attack itself was a use

1255
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,760
of force we can ask okay what did this

1256
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,950
happen between states this one's

1257
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:05,050
interesting too especially because a lot

1258
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,910
of cyber warfare attacks happen between

1259
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:09,280
like either just hacktivists groups and

1260
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,860
like a state or like you know two nation

1261
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,840
states hamas is kind of special because

1262
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,330
it's what they call a sub state actor it

1263
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,840
has occupied this space and it's not

1264
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,250
officially a government but it's sort of

1265
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,050
like has taken over the functions of a

1266
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:24,430
government for quite a while

1267
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,110
so now we have to ask you know it it

1268
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,490
basically does what a government does

1269
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,830
but like technically if we wanted to

1270
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,120
count this as an act of war it's not

1271
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,870
going to be and then finally what is um

1272
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:38,560
whether it's a military objects we don't

1273
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,720
know exactly what the cyber attack it's

1274
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,390
hats we can assume though maybe it was

1275
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:46,690
part of the IDF's assets so that would

1276
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:50,170
make it a military objects and it's

1277
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:51,880
unclear if that so they you know

1278
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,890
mentioned and the thing that um the

1279
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,290
headquarters that was attacked is like

1280
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:59,350
um a headquarters for Israel but we

1281
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:00,370
don't really know if it's like an

1282
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:02,530
official military headquarters so

1283
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:04,720
whether or not those two count as you

1284
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,550
know military objectives is contentious

1285
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:10,300
my final verdict on it is that the cyber

1286
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,000
component is not cyber warfare because

1287
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,900
again there was no

1288
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,250
source of damage that happens at the

1289
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,410
ends that being said though the kinetic

1290
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,299
response is unlawful because if there

1291
00:51:19,299 --> 00:51:21,190
was no explosive damage from the

1292
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,950
cyberattack then you know it's not

1293
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,809
really fair for them to act in self

1294
00:51:25,809 --> 00:51:28,059
defense by destroying lives ends a

1295
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:31,450
building and so if we want to just map

1296
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:34,359
it so I'm just gonna summarize all of

1297
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:37,960
this taking the same issues did it count

1298
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,849
as any of these things you can see

1299
00:51:39,849 --> 00:51:41,349
there's a lot more accident question

1300
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:43,569
more to spend there are check marks and

1301
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:45,430
so really the point I'm trying to get

1302
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:47,950
you is that the sort of framework that

1303
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:50,740
we try to use to the finest it doesn't

1304
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,460
do the job we're still very confused and

1305
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:58,329
yeah NATO is pretty confused too so what

1306
00:51:58,329 --> 00:52:00,369
exactly do we need given all of this

1307
00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:02,260
we've established that it doesn't really

1308
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,849
work we probably need something new

1309
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:06,339
because cyber warfare is gonna become a

1310
00:52:06,339 --> 00:52:11,170
bigger issue it's not gonna stop the

1311
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,930
first sort of ideal thing that should

1312
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,940
happen is that someone needs to sort of

1313
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,980
create a metric or risk framework to

1314
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,690
define all of these things because you

1315
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:21,400
can't have a regulation if you don't

1316
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,109
have definitions for all of the things

1317
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:25,779
like this in the regulation and there's

1318
00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:27,279
been like suggested things and the

1319
00:52:27,279 --> 00:52:29,500
telling many will they talk about some

1320
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,880
sort of things about the use of force

1321
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,799
and like maybe some metrics one of them

1322
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:34,900
have been official and even when they

1323
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,160
sort of talk about these different

1324
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,859
subsections they you know mention

1325
00:52:38,859 --> 00:52:40,990
explicitly in the rule is like how

1326
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,270
contentious it is to sort of adopt this

1327
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:47,349
a kind of like related issue and one of

1328
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:50,710
the other cyber attacks talked about you

1329
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,599
know is it physically damaging to a

1330
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:54,430
computer if you destroy its operating

1331
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,410
system or like what level of damage it

1332
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:58,210
to the software on it you know counts as

1333
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,640
like destruction to the object so these

1334
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,049
are the kinds of things that we need to

1335
00:53:02,049 --> 00:53:04,599
sort out before we can decide this the

1336
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:07,089
second one is to include non stay and

1337
00:53:07,089 --> 00:53:08,589
sub state actors in this equation

1338
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:11,319
because again as we all know significant

1339
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:13,839
you know world ramifications can come

1340
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,670
from attacks other caused by just one

1341
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,380
person so it really doesn't make sense

1342
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:20,710
to only observe how this happens between

1343
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,420
nation states if anything it happens

1344
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:25,720
more between you know non-state actors

1345
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,730
and then finally we

1346
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:29,859
need to sort of resolve this dichotomy

1347
00:53:29,859 --> 00:53:31,540
between the military and civilian

1348
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,670
objects because essentially all

1349
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:36,700
computers are contentiously you know

1350
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,270
both and neither at the same time so it

1351
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:41,830
becomes really hard to regulate you know

1352
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:43,150
what are we allowed to attack and

1353
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:44,980
whether we not allowed to attack if we

1354
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,810
don't make a decision on how we're gonna

1355
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:50,650
define these objects um at a more meta

1356
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:55,020
level you know there's Medic inclusions

1357
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:58,000
the expansion of the temporal and

1358
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,250
spatial planes are non-academic and so

1359
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,140
in general like if we were to make a new

1360
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,630
legal framework just any concept and it

1361
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,609
cannot be you know defined by the kind

1362
00:54:06,609 --> 00:54:08,050
of dichotomy it doesn't work anymore

1363
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:10,960
because again with the full condensing

1364
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,910
and stretching idea in space and time on

1365
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:15,490
pretty much anything any concept you

1366
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:16,720
conceive in that space it's not gonna

1367
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,450
work there's like a weird conclusion

1368
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,520
about extra dimensions like I don't know

1369
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,810
I think it's pretty significant that we

1370
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:24,100
just like the sides they like call

1371
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,910
another dimension something it makes me

1372
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,140
wonder you know they were talking about

1373
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:33,030
that in the 1950s now it's 20 almost 20

1374
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,619
21 on computing is basically at that

1375
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:37,330
stage they say oh you know if it's gonna

1376
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:38,890
work out it's gonna work out in 50 years

1377
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:40,630
so just waiting for the quantum

1378
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:42,100
dimension to happen that's gonna be

1379
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,520
crazy and then finally international law

1380
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,410
cannot just rely on being kinetically

1381
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:50,410
based so you know the base the really

1382
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:52,150
the base concept of all of this law was

1383
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:54,010
sovereignty that's a kinetic concept

1384
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:55,390
that cannot happen anymore we need to

1385
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:57,430
create something new on a more practical

1386
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:01,030
level sort of the steps that we could

1387
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,520
take to do this solve those like

1388
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,280
framework conceptual loopholes again all

1389
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,840
of those contentious definitions where

1390
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,600
you weren't really sure what happened

1391
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,859
maked cyber Geneva Conventions like

1392
00:55:11,859 --> 00:55:13,300
everyone kind of recognizes that like

1393
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,890
everybody needs to really collaborate on

1394
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:16,780
this and do something about it but it

1395
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,820
hasn't happened yet I don't know why and

1396
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,440
finally make the framework actually

1397
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,420
official because you know the teller

1398
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,760
manual does as much as it has its issues

1399
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,359
it's a pretty solid reimagine ation of

1400
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:30,100
like what's actually happening now but

1401
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,130
none of it is really it's it's not gonna

1402
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,040
help when actual events happen and are

1403
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,690
evaluated if it's not official because

1404
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:39,430
you know nation-states have to agree

1405
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:41,380
that they actually want to follow it for

1406
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,560
if you have any use in that space so

1407
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,170
yeah that's kind of the end of my

1408
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:50,020
overview question-and-answer time now's

1409
00:55:50,020 --> 00:56:05,440
your time to roast me hello

1410
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,660
do you ever think that the reason why we

1411
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,580
don't have policies eeeh is because the

1412
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,440
generation that would be making these

1413
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,860
policies are not aware of like cyber

1414
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,860
technology in general yes absolutely

1415
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:21,030
actually and so you know before I even

1416
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:24,460
did this like did this research as like

1417
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,770
a capstone I came across that idea they

1418
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:28,480
explicitly say in a lot of research

1419
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,310
articles the issue is like a lot of

1420
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:32,230
people who are making laws and

1421
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,460
international law and working at the

1422
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,710
policy level just simply have not been

1423
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:40,150
around to experience technology as like

1424
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,380
you know people younger people growing

1425
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:44,500
up to do and it's it's both out there

1426
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,810
younger and also because law experts are

1427
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:51,610
not IT experts and it's their what I

1428
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:53,080
essentially you I think what needs to

1429
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,210
happen is we need to include IT experts

1430
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:57,280
more in this discussion they technically

1431
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,460
did in the teller manual it was like 18

1432
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,450
international law experts and like two

1433
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,730
IT experts so not a really good balance

1434
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:04,900
when you think of it and I think it

1435
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,820
really shows and how some of those rules

1436
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,300
were laid out
