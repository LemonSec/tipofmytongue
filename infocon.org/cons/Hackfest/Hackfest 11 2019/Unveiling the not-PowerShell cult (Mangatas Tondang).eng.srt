27
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,360
info thing like developing the rules

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,880
trying tools like this not partial tools

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,010
hacking tools and I will build detection

30
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:25,909
against it

31
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:28,460
trail intelligence we follow like news

32
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,340
on like apts we create the era rules we

33
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,159
deployed and training development we

34
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,420
also have a training actually for

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,890
PowerShell for our analysts so they

36
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,619
understand what's going on inside the

37
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:41,720
power saw itself previous experience

38
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,760
application security security auditing

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,190
I'm also currently part of CTF challenge

40
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,820

41
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,430

42
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,530
security program is there anyone here

00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,360
from Sheridan of course it's my friend

44
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,119
just you know yeah it's a good program

45
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:03,409
if you see some other people from

46
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:05,119
Sheridan and you want you want to hire

47
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,989
people talk to them they're good people

48
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:12,170
disclaimer I'm speaking for myself and

49
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,280
not from my employer

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,040
so the opinions are mine and not theirs

51
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,650
just to protect myself get objective so

52
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,719
when you walk out from that door over

53
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,390
there

54
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,930
I want you to know that these tools this

55
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,780
is not PowerShell clothes does exists

56
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,760
I'm gonna talk about like how they work

57
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,550
how's the engine like under it I'm gonna

58
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,030
share ways for detection of these tools

59
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,490
to all booty murmurs here and if in red

60
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,530
teamers can use it to improve their you

61
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,960
know like attacking skills and most

62
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,810
importantly to have fun that's what I

63
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,230
want

64
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,930
yes so let's talk about the content for

65
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,470
the for the appetizer we get into

66
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,690
because I don't think everyone here

67
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,570
knows PowerShell in and out not even me

68
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,420
I will talk about the tools there's four

69
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,600
of them we'll talk about detection for

70
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,950
each one of them there's multiple

71
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,830
detection for each one of them and then

72
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,540
I'm gonna give you some take away and

73
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,790
then there's like some other outro stuff

74
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,300
so let's before we start these are the

75
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,340
terms because I'm pretty sure there's

76
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,290
like students here like they're not in

77
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,370
the field they don't know they don't

78
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,120
know what city are but seem there's MCC

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,989
where CLM that is specific to PowerShell

80
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:34,800
they're low bus really a popular in red

81
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,590
teaming and also like tree hunting

82
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,300
there's dll like you've probably heard

83
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,270
about it it's like exe but it's just

84
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,850
library import import import in for

85
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:50,370
whatever yeah so keep this in mind all

86
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,560
the acronyms some explanation I'll give

87
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,280
you five seconds one two three four five

88
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,400
that's the first five seconds but okay

89
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,770
let's talk about PowerShell yes

90
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,780
the powerful PowerShell it's not just

91
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,630
some icon in your Windows machine you

92
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,130
never use probably a question here who

93
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,329
is here ever use PowerShell oh that's

94
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,000
actually a lot of people that I expected

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,660
this here never use for so at all okay

96
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:31,410
that's fine so for anyone who uses

97
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,360
PowerShell do you know what is

98
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,810
PowerShell

99
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:43,900
boom talk with me okay so yeah it's a

100
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,900
pretty much a command-line shell for

101
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,490
sysadmin

102
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,790
it's especially for sysadmin which

103
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,770
instead of returning text it's returning

104
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,419
the donate object as you say so and it's

105
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,919
it's really interesting because it's not

106
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,930
as simple as text there's like a lot of

107
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,490
underlying there's lot of library under

108
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,910
the donut framework it's crazy so the

109
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,870
feature of power so there's common let's

110
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,389
see em deletes or ever you call it so

111
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:16,330
you type it you do stuff it's extensible

112
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,290
you can make your own scripting yes more

113
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,580
execution you don't want to leave it to

114
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,220
any trace yes you can do it flexible you

115
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,770
want to use text editor not but plus

116
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,840
plus you want to use Visual Studio yes

117
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,450
you can do everything system define an

118
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,580
environment variables you can access it

119
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,040
from anywhere any folders any directory

120
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,110
you don't need to you know like full pad

121
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,330
whatever

122
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,919
PowerShell comes oh sorry

123
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,140
remote come on and access it's gonna be

124
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,120
fun for lateral movements for sure

125
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,270
PowerShell comes installing every single

126
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,250
Windows after seven and 2008

127
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,610
just a reminder 2008 is 11 years ago so

128
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,910
pretty much everyone know I so like what

129
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,080
of 2000 2000 surfer and so but yeah

130
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,070
there's a lot of surfer and you know

131
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:11,200
endpoint still using the Windows 7 up so

132
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,870
the question is what can use for so for

133
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,160
for blue team you can use it as ax

134
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,620
assignment and also for blue team you

135
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,050
can get information either on the server

136
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,169
itself but my computer itself or you can

137
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:30,940
do it in the whole eighty active

138
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,210
directory you can schedule tasks you can

139
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,910
automate fear scripting you can set

140
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,570
variables encoding encryption alias just

141
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,820
to make everything easy you can start

142
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,070
stop suspend process file management

143
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,409
create delete move even lock management

144
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:49,930
for blue team you can query like locks

145
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,870
is

146
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,730
you can download file of our networks

147
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,440
and also upload file over their networks

148
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,390
forget to put it there

149
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,280
this is one of simple hopefully you can

150
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,150
see it it's a simple test connection if

151
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,000
it's so if it's it's pretty much thing

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,580
if you connect to that address and is

153
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,590
successful and then it's not done if not

154
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,290
it's done and then it's an email to the

155
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,800
you know like l1 l2 analysts technician

156
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,680
or ever tell them the surfer is done for

157
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,000
a team Empire we who are here using

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,910
Empire right teams

159
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,590
rest in peace right okay because just

160
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,300
like we don't want to maintain it

161
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,060
anymore and it which is a post explosion

162
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,500
framework really popular with the right

163
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,950
team power cat it's a net cat but in

164
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,620
power shell power sploit it's like

165
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,470
Empire but not as good Empire no maybe

166
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,150
as good I don't know

167
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,640
Sheryl walk through please play Watson

168
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,320
so it's like a vulnerability scanner

169
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,660
used by right team and then it will try

170
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,140
to exploit whatever they found in their

171
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,090
mission all-in-one offensive security

172
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,980
framework one of the example after this

173
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,020
is actually from mission power teeth

174
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,990
it's a credential stealing on Internet

175
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,850
Explorer so your last bus your one pass

176
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,990
they still from hit all the info

177
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,970
Asterix get a strike you can find it

178
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,970
everywhere and get help us millions know

179
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,510
probably like thousands so yeah this is

180
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,440
the skip I mention about about the

181
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,690
initial so it's pretty much getting all

182
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,870
the registry values all the fun stuff

183
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,160
there's net that Sh so and then you can

184
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,169
find all the information related to the

185
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,880
computer from this cable and there's

186
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,219
like hundreds of this scrape like this

187
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:40,580
out there what about the apts or

188
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,740
advanced persistent threat or malware's

189
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,059
they use it a lot

190
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:49,070
do you guys hear this law like Microsoft

191
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,450
Word launches PowerShell why why not

192
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,960
yeah because these people they use it to

193
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,830
execute some stuff for the apt 29 they

194
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,210
don't love the pale

195
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,930
decedent malware

196
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,300
they also do execution of course

197
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,580
encoding and decoding of the command

198
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,550
just to bypass security group known to

199
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,990
download and execute also a motet it's

200
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,000
known to download malicious binary and

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,970
one of them is mimic ads which red

202
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,280
teaming tools that they use in one of

203
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,330
the banking Trojans that I have so from

204
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,370
everything up there we can see like

205
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,510
there is some overlap why red teamers

206
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,830
and sis I mean like them both of them

207
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,200
coming from the threat hunting so minor

208
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,590
attack is really big in our community

209
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,160
it's pretty much like our guidelines so

210
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,730
there is 12 tactics initial access

211
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,650
execution persistent blah blah blah blah

212
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,420
blah blah you can find it on their

213
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,420
website it's a fable but for PowerShell

214
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,020
interestingly from those 12 there's only

215
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,890
one of them execution and I will raise

216
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,650
the question can PowerShell perform

217
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,250
those tactics can they of course they

218
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,890
can okay it's it's really good

219
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,200
you know like framework power so you can

220
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,470
achieve frame everything all the twelve

221
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,700
even though it's only in the execution

222
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,520
I'm linking it back to the previous

223
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,680
example from the blue team so the next

224
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,390
question is for reading for hackers for

225
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,390
whatever if our shell is so good why

226
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,730
bother killing the not PowerShell like

227
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,490
my the title of my talk why they created

228
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,220
it's because PowerShell loves to Boonton

229
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,080
back in 2015

230
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,910
PowerShell is like some important

231
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,330
updates that is pretty much give power

232
00:10:54,330 --> 00:11:00,150
to the blue team's how new security

233
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,790
features on first and five blue team get

234
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,710
more locks

235
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,210
you get script block logging again

236
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,870
module logging this too is really

237
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,680
essential because it will monitor

238
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,020
everything inside the Power Cell

239
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,290
activity I'm the integration will submit

240
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,060
the script to the anti-malware surface

241
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,540
engine and then it will block it if it's

242
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,720
malicious and then yeah so it's the

243
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,210
render useless and then CLM mode which

244
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,810
is a concern language mode so for like

245
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,140
sensitive environment for example active

246
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,600
sorry what do you call it like the

247
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,690
highest one forget a name but yeah that

248
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,700
thing everyone okay so it reduces the

249
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,620
capability of the PowerShell

250
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,140
so it cannot do some stuff that is

251
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,250
really powerful like admin level why

252
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,700
this is bad for red team because if blue

253
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,300
team make rules on their same logs it

254
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,100
means more landmines for blue team's

255
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,920
sorry for items and MC it's actually

256
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,150
blocking the right team tools

257
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,670
mimikatz walk there's a bunch of the

258
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,770
tools block so it's not just like hey we

259
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,610
make this incredible stuff it's actually

260
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,140
working

261
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,210
CLM it's equivalent to living in your

262
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,890
parents home you can really do anything

263
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,330
encoding and obfuscation becoming

264
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,440
useless because when you run the office

265
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,090
carried code or like the encoded code in

266
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,850
PowerShell the logs that they receive

267
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,790
it's the what the real code not the

268
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,680
scalar code so they know what's going on

269
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,990
they can figure out what's going on in

270
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,950
there and it will faster you will fast

271
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,340
and they're you know like ir a process

272
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,750
so let's talk about the tools so the

273
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,660
first one is in feces show the tag line

274
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,940
for that I've made it sure we can hook

275
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,420
you up

276
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,710
because sorry later I'm gonna explain

277
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,410
why it's official you can find it on

278
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,110
github created by amazing people from

279
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,710
Java and networks and you can see the

280
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,880
presentation on derbycon

281
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,750
2018 I show they

282
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,050
presented back in 2008 in SPOC what's

283
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:22,660
the feature of this tool it's hooking so

284
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,580
you pretty much avoid the usage of

285
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,760
PowerShell the logging mechanism the MC

286
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,930
detection by hooking certain things for

287
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,600
example the system energy by automation

288
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,360
DLL which is like the engine of

289
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,110
PowerShell so it's pretty much we first

290
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,360
engineered PowerShell and then they take

291
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,420
that function out and then they just I'm

292
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,210
gonna put it the next slide because you

293
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,000
don't you don't need to cook for the

294
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,260
function because they just return it

295
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,880
back to the function so it's do the job

296
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,430
it just continue doing the job just not

297
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,740
doing the security stuff you don't need

298
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,360
admin privilege because they have the

299
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,460
free flex escalation module in their

300
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,020
thing so you can just run the bat-file

301
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,150
as you know like normal user and you can

302
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,090
get admin privilege and they're really

303
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,800
smart they detach everything after they

304
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,630
are done living no trace

305
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,430
and also cleaner functionality because

306
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:22,030
for the non admin portion they're gonna

307
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,770
add some registry key but when you're

308
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,150
done with it they take it off they

309
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:29,740
delete everything for the components

310
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,990
there's two things you need to bring to

311
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,660
the victim machine the DLL the dynamic

312
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,820
loading library the exe that is pretty

313
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,210
much library it will provide all the

314
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,790
hoop modify job functionalities it's

315
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,560
really complicated I try to look into

316
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,760
the code like they have the source code

317
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,030
and github yeah if you like leaf or g3

318
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,790
first engineering go go look at it I'm

319
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,810
not a big fan of re you can so you also

320
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,330
need either one of this bat file you can

321
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,950
run it as admin you can only ask not

322
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,040
admin will perform environment profiling

323
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,880
so it will know which process the DLL

324
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,850
need to connect which is like really

325
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,310
smart and then I'm gonna play a video of

326
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,050
demo of an official

327
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,540
so yes so we are in the different viewer

328
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,020
so it's a logging system in the windows

329
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,640
descended here you can see everything

330
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,270
here and then we are currently looking

331
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,990
at the Flower Show which is depressional

332
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,720
and then we can refresh just to make

333
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,570
sure it's working first and we can clear

334
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,430
everything out because you're gonna try

335
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,440
the tools because they claim when you

336
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,910
run the tools there will be no logs at

337
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,860
all so yes so we get the DLL over here

338
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,650
we get the two bad file that's all you

339
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:04,490
need and then sorry double-click the bat

340
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:09,580
file run PS so that's our show

341
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,360
let's try some comments oh and also up

342
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,400
there you can see because I run the non

343
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,050
admin version so they are doing that

344
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,140
they are adding the registry key that

345
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,730
value pretty much this DLL is a

346
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,780
privilege so they are making it on the

347
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,160
registry key so let's test echo yes it's

348
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,640
working

349
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:37,150
Who am I of course that's the surfer get

350
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:42,020
process PowerShell style task manager

351
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,840
and then yeah you get everything and

352
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:52,220
then we'll see there's power shoulder so

353
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,470
if it's working properly you should

354
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:00,640
record everything right let's refresh it

355
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:06,710
don't there refresh and oh do it again

356
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,599
maybe I mean it's quite thick

357
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,800
oh nothing so I guess there's nothing in

358
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,060
there just to make sure let's open

359
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,460
PowerShell and then to see if it's

360
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,980
working properly the whole logging

361
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,180
system right

362
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,440
can I enter the Sun command pretty much

363
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:32,020
it got tests but from PowerShell

364
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,809
[Music]

365
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:40,950
that's from powershell get computer info

366
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,720
so will this all the info on your

367
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,970
computer it's doing the magic that done

368
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,040
that magic and then you get everything

369
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:53,520
and then let's refresh the loss it's

370
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,990
there everything is there

371
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,620
so yes their claim is true everything is

372
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,210
bypass all the logs for 1:04 which is

373
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,600
the script block text for 1:02 even ID

374
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,880
up there which is the module logging so

375
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,250
we get everything there so let's move on

376
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:19,100
to the to the second tools which is our

377
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,070
DLL the tagline is yes we got DLL for

378
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:28,890
that this is the link to the github we

379
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,350
got all the information here created by

380
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,960
Penta you get all the number of star and

381
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,179
everything over there there's two modes

382
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,860
you can launch the DLL using acid yellow

383
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,690
or you can do it as exe you can profile

384
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,160
your script to it you can fit your

385
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,780
script or you can do it interactive

386
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,210
console just like normal powershell

387
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,429
requirements its dotnet 3.5 for the DLL

388
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:59,460
mode donate 2.0 for the exe moon so they

389
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:06,960
use this 5 exe binary they are known as

390
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,610
a proxy execution for malicious code

391
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,900
part of log bus I mention a bus and the

392
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,340
introduction so it's living off the

393
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,750
binary application and also script so

394
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,179
it's pretty much all the exe by

395
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,220
Microsoft that attacker can use because

396
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,190
it's already there so this matter is

397
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,580
also signed by Microsoft so all the time

398
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,740
usually there were listed by them

399
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,410
each one of them under to have TTP's

400
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,870
under execution tactic from the miter

401
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,260
attack and on

402
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,429
Exe modes they use the PowerShell engine

403
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:49,679
the system management automation and

404
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,639
then automation and spaces you can see

405
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:54,990
this is from their source code they're

406
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,480
using importing the automation

407
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,490
automation and space and they will load

408
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,639
this to dll's so they can do the

409
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:10,950
function I will do the demo really

410
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:24,029
quickly burning okay so yeah all you

411
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:28,110
need are so this is the exe mode

412
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,720
this is the DLL mode I'm gonna run the

413
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,909
DLL mode first so you need to run it

414
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:39,029
from common line there's five exe that

415
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,100
you can use but I'm choosing around

416
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,929
yellow 32 so it's already open so this

417
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:50,159
is your PowerShell screen pretty much we

418
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,549
do the usual tests Who am I

419
00:20:53,549 --> 00:21:01,019
get computer information and then I will

420
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,909
display everything just like PowerShell

421
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:09,510
would we're done with this we'll see on

422
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,580
the task manager so this thing is not

423
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,919
launching power cell at all you can see

424
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,440
there so did Randall 32 but it's not far

425
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,570
so I can see the DLL that they are

426
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,549
loading so no PowerShell at all anywhere

427
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,559
nothing

428
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,389
well it's the same thing with the exe

429
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,130
the difference is you just double-click

430
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,080
it you don't have to type the command on

431
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,159
the or whatever oh so the next tool is

432
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,340
for Allah Shah the tagline for it

433
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,010
I made don't worry we get all of us for

434
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,169
that because the main idea at the end

435
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:48,750
this so is using all best to compile and

436
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,549
also to do like some defense evasion

437
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:56,570
there's yes it's mr. unique odor you'll

438
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,080
know him if you do ring 0 CTF I like it

439
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,559
a lot think it's based in Montreal so

440
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:06,409
the feature is it will compile the

441
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,399
payload at the victim machine using

442
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:12,769
msbuild which is all bus instead of

443
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:14,899
execution it will compile your code to

444
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:18,919
like exe it will compile either

445
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:22,459
PowerShell or like shell shell code the

446
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:25,190
funny thing is instead of using the real

447
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,299
MS bill did they actually copied and

448
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:31,279
then rename it to something else

449
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,369
so copy XC you can even change the name

450
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:39,259
to random like ABCD 1 2 3 exe so the

451
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:42,139
feature also using certain utility XE to

452
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:44,539
decode the code so before you compile it

453
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:49,009
they happily encode it so it's hard to

454
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:50,899
understand what's going on in there they

455
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:53,869
also support the awareness mechanism so

456
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:56,089
only executes when the condition is met

457
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:58,549
for example the user domain let's say if

458
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:00,169
the user domain is hackfest

459
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:03,829
don't do anything if this registry key

460
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:06,369
let's say locomotion Windows PowerShell

461
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:11,209
doesn't exist don't do anything so

462
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:14,779
components there's two of components but

463
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:16,789
this one you'll need this to compile it

464
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:18,859
in your machine in the attacker machine

465
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:22,909
and then it will spit out a CS profile

466
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:25,009
it's really uncoded you can see here

467
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:27,169
like this is like a random mumbo-jumbo

468
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:28,729
you don't know what's going on it's just

469
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:33,259
like random characters but when you

470
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:35,059
compile it it will compile it to your

471
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:37,820
code so it will do real job we'll do the

472
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,700
demo here

473
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,080
the code then I'm gonna use simple one a

474
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,730
co-ed process Who am I so this is the

475
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:56,770
code all these things that doesn't make

476
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,400
any sense

477
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:05,550
- blue team analyst if they see it then

478
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:10,150
this is the bat file that will run the

479
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,940
thing when you see this thing in your

480
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,900
sim like what's going on here do I want

481
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,190
to do something about it probably no

482
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,800
false positive and then you can see down

483
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,240
here Ms bill copy Ms bill - MSS SDXC

484
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,020
which is another exe by Microsoft and

485
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,930
then compile the code and then delete

486
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,930
everything clean everything up so we

487
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:39,340
will run these tools so all you need to

488
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,940
do just bring the bat file to the victim

489
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,250
machine and then it will compile the

490
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,620
code you can see the results this is my

491
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,070
hello world echo this is my get process

492
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:54,220
and then at the bottom there should be

493
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:00,180
the machine identity that's good no

494
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,210
PowerShell just the power should yellow

495
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,040
sorry that's not the right thing it's

496
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,900
from the last thing but yeah there's

497
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,790
gonna be like powerless show what we

498
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,210
call a process

499
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,580
so moving on the last tool no PowerShell

500
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,700
it's an active net libraries only please

501
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,570
for the tag line because yes they are

502
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,560
just using donut libraries only there is

503
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,660
no system management automation DLL

504
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,840
nothing links over here bits admin

505
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,630
really this is something the newest Oh

506
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,880
like recently get updated on july 2019

507
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,980
so the feature it's implemented in c

508
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,610
sharp

509
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,910
they don't use any powershell engine

510
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:56,890
they don't give any damn about that only

511
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,110
use native dotnet library it's pretty

512
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,870
much like we make

513
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,000
PowerShell so you're running something

514
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,640
else but it's not really working with

515
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,150
the PowerShell dll's

516
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,790
library reference so there's two modes

517
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,250
of execution you can run it using run

518
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,730
dl32r DXE we can load it to cobots right

519
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,800
which is another tool that is used by

520
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,140
Red Team it's really good

521
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,430
three thousand five hundred dollars for

522
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:28,220
one person per year expensive yeah for

523
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,010
the cobalt right mode you need to bring

524
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:31,940
the power show itself

525
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,429
wxe and then the cobalt strike file

526
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:38,240
which is DNA for a DLL mode you have two

527
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,780
options it depends on your you know like

528
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,360
system if you're attacking a 32 bits

529
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,179
take the 32 and then if you do 64 take

530
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:49,280
64 and then you need to load one of

531
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,230
these using round yellow one of the low

532
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,230
bus we talked about it a lot before

533
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,100
pretty much like similarly like

534
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,540
PowerShell the other because it's

535
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:02,030
loading delouse so on the demo let's do

536
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:09,470
this yeah so you have the two dll's

537
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,300
there to bring oh this is the demo just

538
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,820
for the Randy all thirty twos and then

539
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,720
this is the CNA in the show if you have

540
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,140
Cobras right

541
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,710
so yeah just turn out on one of them run

542
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:27,890
using brandy ll d ll go to the main boom

543
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,929
this is the best one so far because it's

544
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:33,320
actually color blue like PowerShell

545
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,710
how hard is it right and then Who am I

546
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,170
it's notice it's different because

547
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:42,440
usually it's like the sir and then slash

548
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,450
administrator it's a remake so they try

549
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,050
to provide more information as much as

550
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,720
they can for example for the get

551
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:59,120
computer info computer info yeah you

552
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,580
will see they have less compared to the

553
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,840
PowerShell because they cannot find

554
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,320
everything from the dotnet itself it's

555
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,630
our it's a lot of work and they're

556
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,030
building one by one the CMD let's on the

557
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,560
project so if you want to help them you

558
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,850
can go to the project and

559
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,950
what's your book so it's there and the

560
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,080
other 32 but we're not gonna see any

561
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,320
PowerShell we don't do PowerShell here

562
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:32,020
and yep nothing there so moving along so

563
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,490
the tools really awesome if you're a

564
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,840
team there's like a bunch of writing

565
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,350
over there

566
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:40,580
it's really awesome but unless you're a

567
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,260
blue team were here with blue team were

568
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:48,710
here not so much fun right yeah but good

569
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,140
thing is I'm a blue team or myself so

570
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,930
I'm building detection for this so I'm

571
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:56,270
gonna share it also for you okay

572
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,150
question is what can blue teamers do is

573
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,970
there anything you guys can do it all

574
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:09,590
yes utilize your blocks by using Simpson

575
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,110
filter data in building alert

576
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,870
you know like spline oak oxide I'm

577
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,640
wearing splint t-shirt but I don't work

578
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,510
for Sloane I work for Bell Canada so

579
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,360
there's still option with locks box can

580
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,170
kill you

581
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,690
final destination to or locks can

582
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,180
protect you in the nice warm lock house

583
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:35,510
so you pick your locks so detecting that

584
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,690
not PowerShell there's three locks that

585
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,270
can help us with this windows even locks

586
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,000
system on logs windows etw if and

587
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,300
tracing for windows and I'm offering two

588
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,340
types of detection here the low-hanging

589
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,590
fruits it's easy to make easy to bypass

590
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,640
just change the name you get bypass

591
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,290
tools behaviour which is like something

592
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,300
that you need to modify the whole tools

593
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,560
to bypass him so let's talk about

594
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,770
Windows Event log so there's a fable by

595
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,750
default in Windows you can use even

596
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,830
fewer you can ship it to Alfia will of

597
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,110
b-spline using the forwarder arcsight

598
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,900
using the connector there's five types

599
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,660
of them but the one that we care the

600
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,970
most it's applications security setup

601
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,350
and system

602
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,690
there's hundreds of them the even IDs

603
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,190
and each one of them have different

604
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,910
information let's talk about this one

605
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,460
who is familiar with this one blue team

606
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,380
yeah you should even the right thing or

607
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,120
yeah they're familiar with this one

608
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,150
because they try to avoid it right it's

609
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:47,330
more even IDs from hundreds compared to

610
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:50,990
22 it's not that much but the simple

611
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,350
right

612
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,480
it's this even IDs is really powerful

613
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,840
and then it will ship talks to your sim

614
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,450
and then you can create rule and better

615
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,890
detection they can use correlation

616
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,470
aggregation same thing with previous you

617
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,200
can pretty much do it in all sim

618
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,150
solution explan oxide I get even lock

619
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:18,830
etw locks so this one is a little bit

620
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,350
more complicated its current level event

621
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,410
tracing so all those even at is like on

622
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,660
the top they're coming from this guy at

623
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,160
the bottom so there's filling them

624
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,900
everything but make it you make it

625
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,900
simpler it will lock Colonel an

626
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,700
application define defense to a walk

627
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,950
file you can query it using PowerShell

628
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,680
you know like lock management's right

629
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,590
Lockman dot exe or a Microsoft message

630
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:46,640
analyzer not all same support etw logs

631
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,180
currently I try to use message analyzer

632
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,210
and then it's all Macross my you know

633
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,740
like testing server because there's so

634
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,840
many things going on like all the calls

635
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,960
trace calls all the dll loads like

636
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,680
everything is there crazy so as a blue

637
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,370
team we we protect we attack and most

638
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,880
importantly we try to detect the

639
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,880
the most favorite tools so if you should

640
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,420
show you guys forget about it right no

641
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,420
oh cool so yeah it's pretty much the

642
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,310
hooking everything hooked hook

643
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,350
everything it's privileged and

644
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,480
escalation it's included using the

645
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,730
registry keys custom DLL

646
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,300
loading so let's detect them low-hanging

647
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,260
fruits the DL our names a fishy profile

648
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,190
or DLL

649
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,850
the hashes and when

650
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,000
the bad file name you can try to monitor

651
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,139
it if you see this file in your system

652
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:52,759
100% sure it's it's digital the next one

653
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:55,460
when you this one is the behavior so

654
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,159
when you initialize the tools for some

655
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,110
reason I don't know why I will launch

656
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,440
just PowerShell code so the thing you

657
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,690
can correlate it with this parent common

658
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,820
line so it's the parent that launching

659
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,399
that process always contain a bad file

660
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,649
because you need that bad file to LA to

661
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:14,870
launch the thing and then it will also

662
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,840
launch by the exe which is the CMD or

663
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,220
maybe some other even there on the LXE

664
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,990
so you can build with action on using

665
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,740
correlation of both of them for

666
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,350
pre-flight scalation

667
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:34,190
in common line you will see this thing

668
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,809
here it will always appear when you run

669
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:42,980
the process and then you can also see

670
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,799
the registry app pretty much to the

671
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:48,500
clsid this this thing can be different

672
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,070
all the time and also you'll have the

673
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,620
dot dl l /f so if you build affection on

674
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,690
that you can pretty much attacked it you

675
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:00,139
can make it more you know like less

676
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,509
false positive by correlating it with if

677
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:05,980
the parent command-line have a bad file

678
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,929
registry contents because when you

679
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,119
launch the process before it will create

680
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,609
this registry so so this dll is located

681
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:19,909
and c user desktop or downloads or

682
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:23,540
whatever right they like attacker

683
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,250
they're not gonna paste it they don't

684
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,339
gonna copy it to system 32 so you can be

685
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:31,369
able to action by any dll that is not a

686
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,589
system 32 because all the important dll

687
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:35,300
usually is system 32 because it's from

688
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,770
Microsoft and then just watch this

689
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:46,989
target object this is most important

690
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:51,870
because PowerShell will load

691
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,239
the official profile red yellow this

692
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,780
will never happen company question mark

693
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,910
it should load something from Microsoft

694
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,140
because it's PowerShell and also you can

695
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,600
correlate more by saying is it signed by

696
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,690
Microsoft or other companies no it's not

697
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,610
there's no signature styles so you can

698
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,770
build election on top of this tooth

699
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:17,190
number 2 power CD allow its loading DLL

700
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,940
using the five floor bus load custom DLL

701
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,570
also so detection for this the

702
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,870
low-hanging fruits so there's a section

703
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,490
in the source code that you can actually

704
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,850
modify the name and everything but if

705
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,410
your script kiddies or if you are like

706
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,060
too lazy to do anything you just take

707
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,490
that paste it and the victim machine run

708
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,340
it you'll see this stuff so if they

709
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,960
forget to change that if you build the

710
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,370
texture on top of this the description

711
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,010
partially oil company Porsche DLL you

712
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,650
can pretty much detect name for the

713
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,720
better detection why would Randall 32

714
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,490
loading PowerShell related DLLs there's

715
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,580
no reason for that so if you see any

716
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,110
around the other 32 or the other four

717
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:08,130
rack a sphere directory to loading any

718
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,890
one of this it should raise an alert

719
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,180
because they're not supposed to do that

720
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,160
watch the loaders so yeah exactly aren't

721
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,400
yellow 32 are not supposed to load

722
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,390
anything and sign because my company

723
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:28,110
will sign their dll there exe so if it's

724
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,920
unsigned which is sign false and

725
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,420
signature service is unavailable you

726
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,310
sure is an alert and this is firms this

727
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,470
money 497 sorry I should talk about it

728
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,370
more

729
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,010
this phenomena even 97 is for the other

730
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,230
loading if an ID one is for the common

731
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:47,730
line so for the process creation so yeah

732
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,470
but why this thing might be required

733
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:53,850
because it's actually you'll be amazed

734
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,040
like how company do their stuff for

735
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,780
example not bypass press like loading

736
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,500
dll's for for what I don't know the next

737
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,000
tool PowerShell

738
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,730
using MMS bill using certain util

739
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:09,090
copy and rename the exceeds a different

740
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,640
name dot exe and then they also

741
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:18,780
load dll's so low-hanging fruits so when

742
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,180
you install dotnet when you finish

743
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,000
installing it and then one year later

744
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,100
there is a process that is creating a

745
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,900
file a yaksa file inside your

746
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,350
installation are you gonna be like what

747
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,170
the hell is going on and yes you should

748
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,020
say that actually because you're not

749
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,270
supposed to have that even usually when

750
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,570
there's updates will write like hundreds

751
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,150
of files delete hundreds of files but

752
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:49,950
this is only one you should erase an

753
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,870
alert on that this is from system Oni

754
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:57,680
fanatic 11 which is file creation power

755
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,640
light scratch she'll still PowerShell

756
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,710
the toast didn't claim to be failing the

757
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:09,030
logins and it's not so when you do this

758
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,190
when you launch the tool you do your

759
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,620
scrape you can still see it in the even

760
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,650
ID for 1:04 from the powershell logs so

761
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,690
you can see my coats get process Who am

762
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,750
I so if if they run like info me me cats

763
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,690
or whatever other tools you should see

764
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,640
it here so it's up to you to build the

765
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,260
error detection on the powershell

766
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,100
side so you need to correlate the the

767
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,920
cert util execution and also the MSP

768
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,860
execution here so let's talk about the

769
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,230
show you two so on the comment line you

770
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,900
will see this on the description it will

771
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,300
always be so utility XE the only way you

772
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,980
change this description is to reverse

773
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,720
engineer the tools and then deploy it on

774
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,810
the environment which is not something

775
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,690
easy to do on the circuit till you will

776
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:59,520
always see is shaking the circuital on

777
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,900
the description and then there's a

778
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,020
decode hex options if you see that on

779
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,650
your cm and then let's say the next

780
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,360
second the next minutes

781
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,140
you see ms bill with the description ms

782
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,670
bill they might name it as SMSs whatever

783
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,380
exe

784
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,070
doing some compilation of this file so

785
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,860
you use from that from the source code I

786
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,800
learned that the name will be random

787
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,740
from 5 to 25 characters that's the

788
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,730
encoding so if you see ms bill combined

789
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:38,490
with this random 5 to 25 combined with

790
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,320
cert you till you can really sure that

791
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,560
it's the I don't remember which

792
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,620
Tuesday's special it's doing stuff in

793
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,980
your you know like environment process

794
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,760
must curating so this is one of the tool

795
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,200
sorry one of the detection and my

796
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,420
co-workers actually built it's really

797
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,960
brilliant

798
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,510
so I mentioned about the description

799
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,430
field that you need to reverse engineer

800
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,760
it to do different things in it so if

801
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,730
it's not matching just like yeah it's

802
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,430
it's they're much curating something so

803
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,930
you should wrestle or that this is from

804
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,300
system and if another one which is

805
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,700
process creation or like versus

806
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:25,230
execution don't net loading so if you

807
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:30,080
see some random exe loading the dotnet

808
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,470
building that is supposed to be called

809
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:38,280
by the msbuild or exe it's suspicious so

810
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,080
you can create alert on this even 97 DLL

811
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,130
loading this is really interesting this

812
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,830
money finally 10 it's just complicated a

813
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,020
lot of things that you can read I create

814
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,830
a snippet here

815
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:56,190
system management omission vll which is

816
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:01,380
the PowerShell engine why would you know

817
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:08,340
like msbuild fake msbuild calling making

818
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,660
call or try to access the process of the

819
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,590
system automation which is the

820
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,000
powershell the other you can bill

821
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,400
detection on this if you see anything

822
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,690
here that's containing this on the is

823
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,820
the call trace field you should raise an

824
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:28,890
alert the last two are detection it's

825
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:32,090
you can deploy it with commas right

826
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:35,240
you can load custom DLL using Randy l32

827
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,850
DXE low-hanging fruits assembly infrared

828
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:44,180
CS from the source code you know like

829
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,650
the description product if you're

830
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,550
watching that should be easy to detect

831
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:52,340
come on strike more detection where is

832
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:57,260
it well we don't have copper strike so

833
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,870
we cannot test it and if anyone would

834
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,580
like to donate Cobra strike for our team

835
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,290
you can meet me at the back I'll be

836
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:07,730
happy but all I've heart on a few blue

837
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,530
team er if your thread hunting if your

838
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,390
red team are also you probably know this

839
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:16,430
guy so from the system on if a 98 for

840
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:19,610
some reason maybe just him that no maybe

841
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,700
the creator of the tool that no it will

842
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,080
always target the process address zero

843
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,950
b80 I'm not sure why but it was always

844
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,200
do that you can find more details on his

845
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,470
block medium of Hartung blah blah blah

846
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,650
we can all share the slides for sure

847
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:42,440
DLL modes again similar to run the other

848
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,930
32 using system only 497 the other

849
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:49,550
loadings watch for any Randy ll that is

850
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:55,010
loading not sign DLL and also

851
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,780
unavailable signature white listing

852
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,330
might be required because not bad plus

853
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:03,290
plus happen bonus detection this is more

854
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:07,070
like not really specific but some of

855
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,200
these tools require lower net version

856
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,570
the current version is 4.5 is deployed

857
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:14,180
but you can activate the dotnet version

858
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:18,050
3.5 and also 2.0 which is not good lower

859
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,930
version usually means less security so

860
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,420
you can look it's really interesting if

861
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,460
you don't have if you need the lower

862
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,960
version they will install it for you

863
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,700
right away if you double-click the exe

864
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,080
and they're like oh we need a large

865
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,520
portion oh let me just install it for

866
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,830
you so if you want if you see this in

867
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:36,170
your walks which mean an application is

868
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,530
trying to use the lower version of the

869
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:44,600
dotnet may be legitimate maybe not

870
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,650
that's why why this require not

871
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:51,010
PowerShell detection like in general

872
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:54,230
just the big idea like I keep telling

873
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,970
about this system management automation

874
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,790
on DLL it's the library for PowerShell

875
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,130
if it's not PowerShell why is it

876
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,650
accessing that there's no reason for it

877
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:07,460
so it should be suspicious you can

878
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,000
create alert on that if Windows

879
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,790
PowerShell 494 1:03 the model logging

880
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:21,650
which means it will log the PowerShell

881
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:25,430
will only will lock - for 1:03 only

882
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:29,000
PowerShell so if you see any other host

883
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,770
application that is not PowerShell

884
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,990
logging to that that's kind of weird

885
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:35,540
because it's only specifically for

886
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,830
PowerShell so etw it's I tell you what's

887
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:42,290
the problem it's really big a lot of

888
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:44,300
data in it but if you have time you

889
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,070
wanna explore this - it's really

890
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:50,330
important for the.net so you can see for

891
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:53,150
they're not PowerShell tools you need to

892
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,150
exclude some unnecessary data so the

893
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:59,480
takeaway for the red team use PowerShell

894
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,780
if you haven't use those not PowerShell

895
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,940
tool tools if you have and then the blue

896
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,400
team attack on the PowerShell use that

897
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,670
tools this is open source it's so easy

898
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:13,160
to modify change the description name

899
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,790
change the name file everything make

900
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:18,320
sure you deployed on the right machine

901
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,490
don't deploy it on Linux for be nice to

902
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:27,710
blue team blue team okay update your

903
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:30,280
PowerShell to the first in five because

904
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,480
Microsoft can love you if you don't know

905
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,060
sure PowerShell enable all the security

906
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,700
features the Logging's detect the

907
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,410
PowerShell downgrade because like the

908
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:41,390
dotnet downgrade it can also happen to

909
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:44,960
PowerShell utilize your logs create the

910
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,820
rows above like I mentioned how to

911
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,180
detect it ingest the logs above 2 cm if

912
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,160
you haven't if you have seen I'm pretty

913
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,070
sure you have seen try to upgrade the

914
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:58,460
basic rules maybe at some like encoding

915
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:01,490
detection stuff like that while it is

916
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:04,069
required sis I mean we always use

917
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:06,710
randoms do random stuff I have story

918
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:10,849
from my co-workers who here use Empire

919
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:14,930
before yeah sis I mean using Empire for

920
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:18,650
managing surfer because it's good so

921
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,349
yeah so well they do that and then like

922
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:23,150
what do you do you want list I guess the

923
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,510
username this guy is using Empire and

924
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:29,150
lastly be nice to write team because at

925
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:37,250
the end of the day yeah red blue and

926
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,980
others management finance interesting

927
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,680
whatever we want to be a Megazord we

928
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,319
want to build the bigger better security

929
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:47,650
posture in your company

930
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:51,530
yeah that's it's way better actually

931
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:54,890
acting with PowerShell and Kali Linux so

932
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:57,349
this is all true I would like to extend

933
00:46:57,349 --> 00:47:00,319
my thank you for bail sock for the full

934
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,059
support letting me do the research

935
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:03,770
letting me it's actually my day off

936
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:07,520
today I can present here Scooby MTL and

937
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,369
39 it for inspiration guide and feedback

938
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:12,619
Tree of Life for allowing me to steal

939
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:14,599
some of his powers or training materials

940
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:17,569
good guy my other co-workers they gave

941
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:20,210
me feedback allowing me to do this

942
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,490
presentation better I do the dry run

943
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:26,089
yesterday and I do it the real run now

944
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:29,030
the amazing the for tools make a really

945
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:33,220
amazing big brain Red Team Blue team

946
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,230
should be grateful for them the hackfest

947
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,119
organizer and the tool skater for

948
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:40,609
letting me stand here and then talk and

949
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:43,549

this is my team our after hunting team

953
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:53,030
at Bell soft we have blog posts I will

954
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:58,220
try to make this for tools I will try to

955
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:02,210
make it to four-part blog posts this is

956
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,579
our medium we post some other stuff

957
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:06,619
there's like ms-excel a bunch of like

958
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:07,700
from TTP's

959
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,579
we love that we'll have research myself

960
00:48:10,579 --> 00:48:12,020
theater github

961
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:15,110
not many things here and late then if

962
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:17,270
you want to connect with me you can scan

963
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:21,070
this barcode to get some slides maybe

964
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,540
malware email subscription I don't know

965
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,820
one one of the above hopefully it's good

966
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,680
all right now that's it thank you so

967
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,520
much and I have question no I don't have

968
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,050
question you have question who have

969
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:54,440
question with the Linux subsystem yeah I

970
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,560
haven't really look into that we I'm not

971
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,710
sure when are we deploying it I haven't

972
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,270
really looked into that so I'm sorry I

973
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:03,470
can't really answer the question but

974
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:07,100
I'll say there's gonna be like a back

975
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,990
draw because they introduce new things

976
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:12,770
right we're gonna wait until then they

977
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:14,690
introduce the new security feature for

978
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:15,770
those updates

979
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:19,160
so that's my opinion I think yeah is

980
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:25,370
there any more questions thank you so

981
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:27,549
much
