1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:03,810
thank you so much thank you and yeah so

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,210
my name is masa I'm here today to talk

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,890
about as he mentioned recent

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,929
developments in designing price table

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,389
cryptocurrencies also known as stable

6
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,960
coins so a little bit about myself I'm a

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,690
PhD student and also blocked an engineer

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,820
I'm doing research at the Concordia

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,470
Institute for information system

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,689
security Concordia University in

11
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,859
Montreal and I've also been a research

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,308
intern at the capex regulator AMF where

13
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,770
I worked on decentralized exchanges and

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,129
markets and I've given quite a few talks

15
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,780
and blockchain Bitcoin and

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,059
cryptocurrencies in different venues

17
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,579
including last year's HEC fest and at

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,579
the end I'm mainly doing research on dog

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,460
chain technology financial technologies

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,309
and also decentralized finance I've done

21
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,110
some research on TLS and see a trust

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,960
model plus usable security so here's

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,719
what I'm here for today it's our very

24
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,099
recent research paper

25
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,560
it's the systemization of knowledge and

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,830
stable coins and yeah let's dive in so

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,990
let's start with the motivation of our

28
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,049
work so I am not sure how many of you

29
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,270
guys have traded crypto currencies in

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,540
this room or yeah so even if you have

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,130
not you know that all the crypto

32
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,479
currencies are volatile and by this

33
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:32,340
volatility I mean huge volatility not

34
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,920
not in any anywhere near to fiat

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,799
currencies and I just realized that

36
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,770
yesterday was bitcoins birthday and I

37
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,860
thought why not let's have let's have a

38
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,860
kind of a chart here that shows how

39
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,159
bitcoins price has been fluctuating in

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,680
nine years since it was born so as you

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,110
can see here it's it is volatile and

42
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,290
it's not stable and again to emphasize

43
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,469
more on this volatility we have a little

44
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,990
chart here it compares three main fiat

45
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,509
currencies including euro Canadian

46
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,419
dollar and British pound and we compared

47
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,230
with Bitcoin from 2016 to 2019

48
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,720
and as you can see here these three fiat

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,909
currencies almost show a very stable

50
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:19,920
value through these years

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,409
however bitcoin has been really

52
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,930
fluctuating in these three years and

53
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,140
again to show how significant these

54
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,230
fluctuation is just look at the brexit

55
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,959
here this is when the brexit happen in

56
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,110
2016 and when British Pound lost its

57
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,260
value and it was huge but in our little

58
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,690
chart it's a very little slope here with

59
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,329
men we compare it to bitcoins

60
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:47,069
fluctuation so the volatility we're

61
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:49,860
talking about here is huge and that was

62
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,500
the motivation of our work and also all

63
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,239
of those stable coin projects that came

64
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,150
into existence

65
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,930
another reason for accessible coins to

66
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,120
be around here is the three main

67
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,690
properties of what we call money and for

68
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,890
anything either

69
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,040
currency or cryptocurrency in order to

70
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,200
be able to act as money they have to

71
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,049
meet three main requirements the first

72
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:18,030
one is it should be able to act as a

73
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,900
medium of exchange what it means is you

74
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,970
should be able to use it in exchange for

75
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,280
goods and services for others let's say

76
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,220
Alice is only accepting something either

77
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,950
currency or cryptocurrency from Bob then

78
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,540
she's confident enough that there will

79
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,669
be somebody out there who's willing to

80
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,680
accept this money from others in

81
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,769
exchange for other goods and services

82
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:42,419
Bitcoin is a good medium of exchange now

83
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,209
because people are being able to trade

84
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,180
Bitcoin for different stuff the second

85
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,989
property of money is it should be able

86
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,359
to serve as a unit of account what I

87
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,639
mean is you should be able to price

88
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,030
stuff in that in whatever you can money

89
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,049
and although things are being bought and

90
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:07,049
sold in Bitcoin it's they're not really

91
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,209
being valued or priced in Bitcoin and

92
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,560
they're still being priced in u.s.

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,290
dollar so bitcoin is not really serving

94
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,989
as a good unit of account and at the end

95
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,589
we want money to be stable it should it

96
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:23,659
should preserve the stability value and

97
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:26,360
we know that Bitcoin night

98
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,710
the Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies

99
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,750
are stable and people are not willing to

100
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,849
accept their salaries for example in a

101
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:34,400
volatile crypto currency or currency so

102
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,939
what we thought is what what if we have

103
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:41,449
a good crypto currency that is almost a

104
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,099
good medium of exchange let's say

105
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:46,400
Bitcoin and we can make it stable and if

106
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,830
it's like it's continued to be stable

107
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,280
for for a while maybe later in future

108
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,310
people can sort of use it as a unit of

109
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,990
account so that was the motivation

110
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,419
behind our word and also other several

111
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:00,500
current projects that came into

112
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,009
existence and that was why 2018 was

113
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:06,879
called the year of the stable coin and

114
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,889
every like we were over them but by all

115
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,319
those stable current projects that were

116
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,080
born and we know all of them I only

117
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,240
included some of them here maker Dow

118
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,949
that are USC new bits and bases coin

119
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:25,520
which raise 133 million dollars in

120
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,800
venture capital but they had to give it

121
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,870
all back because they didn't feel they

122
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,289
could meet comply with the regulation

123
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:36,169
and so we have a lot of stable coin

124
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,110
there's there's a lot of blog posts

125
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,659
working papers white papers but if you

126
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:44,300
even try to go and read this blog post

127
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,580
or white papers you get over them

128
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,409
they're using a lot of jargon x'

129
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,750
financial terms and they're not really

130
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,050
clearly say the details of how they what

131
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,360
is the mechanism they're using how they

132
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,539
create these stable coins and as a

133
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:02,960
researcher we tried a lot but every time

134
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,909
we faced a lot of jargons like senior

135
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:07,060
chairs feedback collateralized back and

136
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,029
it wasn't really clear so at the end we

137
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,979
were left with a question of how to

138
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:15,800
design a stable coin in plain word like

139
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,509
what are what are the mechanism you can

140
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:20,629
create a stable coin bit and I'm happy

141
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:22,099
to say that that's the reason why I'm

142
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:24,650
here today in this table that you can

143
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,229
see here is the meat of our paper so we

144
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,919
were able to create some classification

145
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:33,050
of mechanism by which you can create a

146
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,719
stable coin so don't get overwhelmed by

147
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,089
disable because like I'll spend the rest

148
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:39,740
of my talk it

149
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,509
explaining each and every category but

150
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,150
just to give you an idea how we created

151
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,300
this table was as I told you it was a

152
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,370
lot of stable coin projects out there so

153
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,590
there wasn't really a source that gave

154
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,080
us the list of all the project so what

155
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,509
we did is we went to the coin desk which

156
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:58,490
is a very famous new source for

157
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,259
cryptocurrencies and boxing technology

158
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,930
and we search for a price stable stable

159
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,460
coin and stability doing so we got 185

160
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,289
articles that were talking about these

161
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:12,650
three keywords and then we read and

162
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,380
studied each and every of them we got 25

163
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,990
projects that were alive working for

164
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,620
which we could find something some

165
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,880
documentation in English that we could

166
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,240
read and yeah using that we were able to

167
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,180
study the project and then create a

168
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,430
table like this that explains what are

169
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,319
the ways one can create a stable coin

170
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,599
and I have to point out the coins here

171
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,550
are ranked based on their market cap

172
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,130
from the coin market cap website which

173
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,889
ranks the coins that are actively

174
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:47,360
trading in decentralized exchanges so

175
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,060
yeah as I've said let's dive into the

176
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,580
categories and see how we can create

177
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,310
stable coin the main two categories are

178
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,750
backed and intervention ones and yeah so

179
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,490
we go back to the table at the end so

180
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,870
that you can match the project you've

181
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,000
maybe seen before and you can really

182
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,919
match them to the categories that I'm

183
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,810
going to explain now so the first

184
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,960
category is the backed ones in the coin

185
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,479
in this category they try to match the

186
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,180
stability of a second asset and in fact

187
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,889
they cannot exist without their

188
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:21,860
underlying asset and the back category

189
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,530
itself it falls into three categories

190
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,270
the first one is the one that are

191
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,370
directly back with the underlying asset

192
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,919
and they're not redeemable the second

193
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:32,539
one is the exact same thing they're

194
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,219
directly back but they are redeemable

195
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,559
and the last one which is a little bit

196
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,958
more challenging is if we call them

197
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,820
indirectly back so they directly back

198
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,690
category the coin in this in this

199
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,520
category is like they're trying to

200
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,920
directly back their value to an

201
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,060
underlying asset

202
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,640
for example they for each stable coin

203
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,050
that gets issued they store 1 USD let's

204
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,480
say in a physical location let's say in

205
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,170
a bank account or like a reserve and as

206
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,910
you may have realized they needs to be

207
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,860
odd they need to be audited why because

208
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,480
we have to make sure that they really

209
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,090
have those underlying assets in that

210
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,710
physical location that they're claiming

211
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,920
and this coin they don't offer any

212
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,930
redemption for their underlying asset

213
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,630
and I have to point out that this is

214
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,270
really like the old idea of this the

215
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,520
coins in this group is the digital money

216
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,960
with the only difference that

217
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,210
transactions are now decentralized but

218
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,880
still issuance and redemption are being

219
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,800
done off chain why because you're

220
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,710
storing that underlying asset from which

221
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,440
the coins inherits the stability or

222
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,540
volatility in a physical location so we

223
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,160
can't really do that on chain the second

224
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,430
group is the exact same idea with only

225
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,320
difference that their offer Redemption

226
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,720
you can go back to the physical to that

227
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,610
bank account or whatever that is and you

228
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,100
can redeem your coin for the underlying

229
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,070
asset the third one is actually what was

230
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,690
really interesting to us and it was a

231
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,130
little bit challenging to understand

232
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,470
because the coins in this category they

233
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,930
offer decentralization in everything

234
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,910
I mean issuance transactions and

235
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,160
redemptions but because there is no

236
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,070
notion of USD on a blockchain such as

237
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,440
ethereum what they do is they're using a

238
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,660
cryptocurrency such as ether and a

239
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,030
currency such as US Dollars and they're

240
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,950
they getting it exchange rate between

241
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,130
ether and US dollar and they're kind of

242
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,680
indirectly backing their coin with US

243
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,330
dollar through ether

244
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,330
so to get to get more involved in this

245
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,090
group this is the very basic idea of

246
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,390
this coin in indirectly by category so

247
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,290
we can assume that they get some coin I

248
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,440
call them fairly volatile coin just with

249
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,480
respect to what they create after so

250
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,370
they create two positions the first one

251
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,860
is extremely volatile and is extremely

252
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,470
volatile even more volatile than ether

253
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,930
ether itself is really volatile but this

254
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,690
one is extremely volatile and then they

255
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,410
create save

256
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,910
so they're kind of pushing the

257
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,010
volatility around to the other position

258
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,960
so that they can get this table coin out

259
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,170
of it we have an example here to make it

260
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,300
more clear for you let's say in this

261
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,490
system Alice wants to create stable

262
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,620
coins so what she has to do is she has

263
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,930
to go on a thorium and she creates a

264
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:27,710
smart contract at this point of time the

265
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,840
exchange rate between ether and USD is 1

266
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,330
and because if there is volatile we

267
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,800
don't want to be exposed to ethers

268
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,240
volatility so Alice has to always put

269
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,610
more than equivalent of 1 USD and that's

270
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,110
what we call over collateralization

271
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,110
ratio and it's a fixed number in a

272
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,690
system the system decides for that here

273
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,100
we can imagine is 1.5 1.5 so in order to

274
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,540
have a same account Alice has to lock up

275
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,870
1.5 ether and when doing so she creates

276
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,730
two positions in line the first one is

277
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,520
the stable coin that is one ether equals

278
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,620
two ones USD and the first the second

279
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,100
one is whatever is remaining and she can

280
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,320
then sell the stay back on to Bob and

281
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,510
now Bob is holding stable coin which is

282
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,460
one USD and at this point of time one

283
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,430
ether but ethers when you can go up or

284
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,010
down let's say ethers value goes up now

285
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,920
we can get one USD with a less amount of

286
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,560
ether let's say ether is equal to 2 USD

287
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,230
so if at this point of time Bob comes

288
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,910
back to the smart contract and he wants

289
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,040
to redeem his coin he can still redeem

290
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,660
it for 1 USD but it's only 1.5 ether and

291
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,990
then Alice would get more in compared

292
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,850
with what she she would get in the

293
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,040
previous one so she gets one ether at

294
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,780
this point and the coin still has its

295
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,490
stability because it's being traded at

296
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,730
one dollar users when you can go down as

297
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,100
well let's say one in turn now equals to

298
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,460
a 75 USD now we need more ether in a

299
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,310
smart contract to be able to trade it at

300
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,440
one dollar the trade to stable coin at

301
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,750
one dollar so at this point if Bob comes

302
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,820
along and he wants to redeem his coin he

303
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,370
can still do that but he would get one

304
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,340
point three ether which is now one USD

305
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,589
the coin still stable and Alice gets a

306
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:17,420
little bit less than what she would get

307
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,750
in previous ones one point two

308
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,660
but this is the catastrophe that we

309
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,820
could imagine let's say ethers value

310
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,970
goes extremely down let's say ether now

311
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,700
equals to 50 cents so we need in order

312
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,330
to have 1 USD we need to Ethernet but in

313
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,700
smart contract only contains one point

314
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,070
half ethers so at this point if Bob

315
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,440
comes along he would redeem the coin but

316
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,870
he would only get 75 cents the coin is

317
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,760
not being traded at one dollar anymore

318
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,850
and Alice doesn't get anything so one of

319
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,920
the project that is indirectly back is

320
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,750
the maker Dow and they're using this

321
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,970
mechanism to create their stable coin

322
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,980
die and what they do to combat this

323
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,720
situation is that they have some

324
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,740
liquidation threshold and there they

325
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,990
have Watchers in ethereum anybody can

326
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,060
watch this smart contract they go and

327
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,399
they see if the heaters exchange rate is

328
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,520
hitting this threshold and if it ever

329
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,190
hits they just liquidate the smart

330
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,680
contract and at this point Bob and Alice

331
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,410
gets whatever exists in the smart

332
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,709
contract and just say between conflict

333
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:32,510
its maintains its stability so the other

334
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,209
categories are the intervention one so

335
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,260
these coins

336
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,910
unlike the backed ones they're

337
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,829
standalone currencies that they allow

338
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:43,760
for intervention either by human or

339
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,730
algorithm to maintain stability and

340
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,760
reduced while volatility so as I've

341
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,020
mentioned they're not backed by any

342
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,120
asset instead they use intervention to

343
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,399
make the stable coin to have remained

344
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,980
stable coin stable and of course they

345
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,660
have various design decisions such as

346
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,149
when to intervene and most of them are

347
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:07,610
using the exchange rate between a fiat

348
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,820
currency such as us to know when to

349
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,680
intervene and what kind of an

350
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,980
intervention some of them they decrease

351
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,240
or increase the supply of money and how

352
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,490
to decrease or the increase some of them

353
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,899
do it directly some of them do it

354
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:26,089
indirectly and at the end what are the

355
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:27,920
participants in the system miners

356
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,209
holders shareholders whoever there is so

357
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:34,010
the intervention ones

358
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,830
they are either money supply adjustment

359
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,360
or asset transfer and these are the

360
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,160
terms that we chose for these categories

361
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,980
I hoped it would be descriptive the

362
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,960
first one is the money supply adjustment

363
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,420
which the coins in this category they

364
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,910
directly increase or reduce - subscribe

365
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,520
it's really easy and they do it either

366
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,130
based on algorithm or a human discretion

367
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,970
and we studied them they either given

368
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,060
you many to minors or all the holders or

369
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,130
they decide to remove money using a

370
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,670
mining algorithm from the miners or all

371
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,510
the holders but this is the other group

372
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,970
which was really interesting for us to

373
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,400
study which we call as a transfer so

374
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,230
it's the same ideology they increase or

375
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,030
decrease the supply of money but they

376
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,910
use an indirect way to do that to bring

377
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,590
money into circulation or withdraw it

378
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,190
from the market so I have an example

379
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,230
here to show that what I mean by that

380
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,380
let's say we have a system which is

381
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,840
using this method and stable coin is

382
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,600
supposed to be traded and $1 but at some

383
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,600
point in time that the price goes above

384
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,390
$1 and the system now wants to expand

385
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,030
this supply so that it would bring the

386
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,400
value of stable coin back to $1.00 so

387
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,380
what it does it just creates the stable

388
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,870
coin new stable coins and it gives it to

389
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,490
people that are waiting in some

390
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,460
positions in line and then they would

391
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,410
get the money they would get disabled

392
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,550
coin they would go back to the open

393
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,069
market start spending that stable coin

394
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,050
and hopefully that would bring the value

395
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,230
of stable coin down back to $1.00 but

396
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,300
I'm sure that there is a question in

397
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,950
your mind now that how would people

398
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:17,750
stand in this line and that goes back to

399
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,210
when the price of stable coin comes

400
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,329
below $1 so in in this situation what

401
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:26,180
the system does is it auctions of these

402
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,300
positions in the line and it options

403
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,610
enough to the highest bidder so people

404
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,070
will come they are incentivized to bid

405
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,460
and because their bid in the if they bid

406
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,070
using the stable coin so they're paying

407
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,230
disable they're paying for this position

408
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,940
using the stable point when the stable

409
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,620
coin is being traded less than one

410
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,540
dollar

411
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,360
and then the payment will be removed

412
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,400
from the market it will be burned and

413
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,300
then that would hopefully bring the

414
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,980
price of stable coin back to one dollar

415
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,050
so this is really great motivation for

416
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,020
them to do that because later on when

417
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,210
the price of stable coin would go more

418
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,670
than one dollar they would get stable

419
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,640
coin back and then they will benefit

420
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,600
from the system so yeah that concludes

421
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,910
my talk and there are a lot more details

422
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,460
in our paper which I couldn't talk about

423
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,860
because of time but I do encourage you

424
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,790
to go it's public open to public access

425
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,040
and it's called the mystifying stable

426
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,200
coin you can find it on SSRN website and

427
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,950
also you can ask me any questions after

428
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,110
or even now and this is my twitter

429
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,600
handler and also there's a github repo

430
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,670
where you can find all the details and

431
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,440
texts and stuff thank you so much
