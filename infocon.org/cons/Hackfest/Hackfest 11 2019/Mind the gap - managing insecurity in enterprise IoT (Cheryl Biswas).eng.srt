Halloween and I've made my slides a

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,610
little festive for you again this year

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,930
Biswas I'm from Toronto sorry I work

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,050
with a major financial institution sorry

11
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:52,260
I'm also happy to say I'm the founding

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,280
member of the Diane initiative and we do

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,590
great work to promote diversity and

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,570
inclusion and encourage women to come

15
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,660
and join us in this amazing space so

16
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,069
that we can continue to grow and learn

17
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,220
from each other I also am a member of

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,820
c3x where we do cyber simulations for

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,590
college students this was our third year

20
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,759
and it was absolutely awesome on Twitter

21
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,790
you can follow me as encrypted and let's

22
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,799
begin

23
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:24,900
finally the obligatory disclaimer the

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,060
views expressed here are mine mine alone

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,530
and not of any employer so I wanted to

26
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,710
do this talk because I think we need to

27
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,920
take a bigger picture view of threats

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,350
and risks to our enterprise environments

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,680
based on what's coming inside of them

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,790
our current security frameworks our

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,310
existing regulations are not aligned to

32
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,909
what's actually there my hope today is

33
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,869
that I can better explain to you what

34
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,000
IOT and enterprise is through

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,969
definitions some examples how the

36
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:05,820
threats work and attacks and then give

37
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,710
you some takeaways that you can bring

38
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,840
back in action in your own environment

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,360
and hopefully better secure your

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,980
existing frameworks and Paul

41
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:20,670
this okay so welcome to IOT which is

42
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,040
essentially IOT in your enterprise

43
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,870
everybody knows what i OT is right

44
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,080
anybody it is the Internet of Things

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,030
there's lots of other acronyms for it

46
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,860
but let's stick with that one so

47
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,560
essentially it's what happens when we

48
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,590
bring all of those things that connect

49
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,959
but just into our organic organizational

50
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,230
networks I want you to think about that

51
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,349
for a second because I'm so totally got

52
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:56,910
a handle on IOT right oh not a chance

53
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,879
and that is why I'm here because I think

54
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,819
there's a lot we need to talk about so

55
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,090
according to Gartner all of those things

56
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,150
that connect are supposed to double by

57
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,750
2020 from 2018 we're replacing older

58
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,180
stuff of course with newer stuff we're

59
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,040
gonna have something like 5.8 billion

60
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,230
endpoints to secure that's great news

61
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,480
Wow the job security in this place

62
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,430
what's projected to really boom however

63
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,069
is building automated building and

64
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:36,150
automation automotive no surprise there

65
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,709
and connected lighting yes because that

66
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,160
really is a thing now there's a lot of

67
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,169
talk about the benefits of being able to

68
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:49,650
do this and what it brings to business

69
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,209
and business's bottom line so we're

70
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:52,470
looking at things like of course

71
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,069
improving efficiency right and being

72
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,489
able to combine innovation with

73
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,299
collaboration not arguing these are all

74
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,650
good things these are things we

75
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,139
definitely want but as the saying goes

76
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:14,129
with great reward will come great risk

77
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,560
and you need to be careful what you wish

78
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,320
for kind of like The Sorcerer's

79
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,020
Apprentice so when it comes to IOT we

80
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,169
don't exactly understand what it is

81
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:31,020
we're doing we're bringing all of that I

82
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,439
Oh tea into our enterprises onto our

83
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,810
networks without actually having a real

84
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,780
plan or security in place the biggest

85
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,300
industries at risk to this because of

86
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,620
their growth projections are

87
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,849
manufacturing transportation and

88
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:52,889
utilities there's a whole lot that can

89
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,280
go wrong there and here's another big

90
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,650
number I'm gonna throw out at you over

91
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,949
90% of the data in the world and we know

92
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:03,779
what we're dealing with now in terms of

93
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:06,930
data shall I say the word Dujardin oh

94
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,050
sorry

95
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,419
over 90% of that data has been created

96
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,680
in just the past two years who would

97
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,750
like to take a gander take a wild guess

98
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,930
in bytes per day of how much data we

99
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,060
generate throw it the biggest number you

100
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:31,729
can think of come on whoo that's a lot

101
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:34,919
is that bigger than 2.5 quintillion

102
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,180
bytes I didn't even know quintillion was

103
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,180
a number until I did this research yeah

104
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,150
and we just keep making more of it if I

105
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,819
had candy I would give it to you I

106
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,229
almost took somebody's eye of the last

107
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,349
time I threw candy at the audience and

108
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:54,740
not anymore

109
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,839
okay so let's talk about this when IOT

110
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,210
becomes enterprise technology

111
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,599
well that surface increases and by

112
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,460
surface I mean our attack surface and

113
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,500
when the attack surface increases well

114
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,849
we're talking about liability that's a

115
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:16,500
dollars and cents amount right there

116
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,629
that's a bottom line for anybody who's

117
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,129
in industry that they should be paying

118
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,729
attention to some of that is engaged in

119
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,610
terms of operational technology but all

120
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,310
of it is tied to achieving the goals and

121
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,740
outcomes of the business so in

122
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,139
manufacturing we're looking at things

123
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,490
like automation sensors scanners robot

124
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,370
on the floor in healthcare

125
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,020
well it's crucial in healthcare because

126
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,380
it helps in terms of cutting costs and

127
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,480
also in terms of improving the patient's

128
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,820
experience but it also helps us do

129
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,190
really important work like servicing

130
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,699
people who are far away from available

131
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,830
medical facilities so we're looking at

132
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,470
telemedicine we're also looking at the

133
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,080
devices that literally keep us alive

134
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,979
whether it's um pumps pacemakers MRI

135
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:11,010
machines been gonna not done that

136
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,919
patient monitors this really matters and

137
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,620
I don't know about you but I have been

138
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,470
to some excellent talks about the risk

139
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,290
factors associated with the growing

140
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,800
number of connected medical devices the

141
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,440
risks the dangers are just continuing to

142
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,940
grow and it's really important for us to

143
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,100
be able to share that and sound the

144
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,080
alarm on it and get involved in helping

145
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,229
to secure this better you may not be

146
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:38,789
aware of this but the fact is there are

147
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:43,320
up to 15 connected devices per hospital

148
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,010
bed then of course there's what's going

149
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,370
on inside of our businesses so

150
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,100
corporations use smart TVs they also use

151
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,669
digital conferencing and then we have

152
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:58,080
got our connected printers and scanners

153
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,240
and the joys of those retail retail uses

154
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,010
it everywhere that it can it's not just

155
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,870
the scanners it's not just the payment

156
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,060
machines its beacons to try to get you

157
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,460
to buy more products and it's smart

158
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,990
shelves that keep them alerted to the

159
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,430
fact that we've run out of toilet you

160
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,860
know towels in Aisle three and it's also

161
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,190
for being able to to track theft and to

162
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,370
do loss prevention transportation and

163
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,169
logistics is a huge user

164
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:27,389
we've got warehouses where we have to

165
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,789
maintain industry as well as in some

166
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:32,010
cases temperature control and safety

167
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,320
we've also got it on those big trucking

168
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,809
rigs because if they're transporting

169
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,599
valuable perishables you have to

170
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,120
maintain the temperature and the coolant

171
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,740
otherwise something's gonna arrive and

172
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,180
somebody's gonna get food poisoning or

173
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,730
it's going to spoil it's also used to

174
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,890
track things like where they are on

175
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,400
their route possibly to reroute them to

176
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,240
check their fuel consumption

177
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,610
there are now wearables for people so

178
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,160
that employees can communicate back and

179
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,800
forth with each other and then of course

180
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,130
in our buildings we've got security

181
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,470
webcams locks lighting and of course

182
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,899
HVAC that's a lot of vulnerability just

183
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:22,740
waiting to happen oh and yeah our mini

184
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,050
bars those also are connected so here's

185
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,120
your first and possibly your most

186
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,350
biggest takeaway today our procurement

187
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,500
is not in line with our secure men of

188
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,520
things and if the greatest projected

189
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,430
source for end point electronics next

190
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,890
year is gonna be connected cars and

191
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,140
network printing all I can say is we are

192
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,930
so hacked so let's talk about what it is

193
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,910
we think we know when it comes to

194
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,450
defining IOT has anybody seen this

195
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,339
picture before everybody touches a

196
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,630
different part of the elephant they

197
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,920
don't know what it actually is cuz

198
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,120
they're blindfolded and they come up

199
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,060
with a different explanation what it is

200
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,920
what they think it is I think that's

201
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,360
really us around IOT and we have to

202
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,220
understand i OT if we're going to talk

203
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,400
about it in the enterprise realm

204
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:29,700
surprise this is not I Oh t now they say

205
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,910
that a picture is worth a thousand words

206
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,870
looks like there's a thousand words and

207
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,850
I'm sorry for the resolution but this is

208
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,089
the complexity of what it takes to

209
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:43,950
connect essentially basic things into

210
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,120
our networks we've got a wrath of

211
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,310
protocols billions of sensors out there

212
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,000
we have to factor in api's all kinds of

213
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,010
different manufacturers they're

214
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,470
specialized firmware it's far more

215
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:07,380
complex than I believe we realize so

216
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,420
yeah

217
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,070
simply put IOT devices are non-internet

218
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,740
things that now have been enabled to

219
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,440
connect I'm going to say this over again

220
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,610
because I don't think we really

221
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,660
appreciate how important this simple

222
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,910
statement is and that that is at the

223
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,940
heart of the matter then we allow them

224
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,550
to communicate with each other and with

225
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,360
other devices IOT comes in different

226
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,980
flavors because there's of course the

227
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,810
industrial Internet of Things

228
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,480
there's healthcare Internet of naming

229
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,070
centers of course what we call the

230
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,370
enterprise of things it's technology

231
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,380
that communicates either machine to

232
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,610
machine or mobile to mobile but

233
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,589
regardless of what flavor it is what we

234
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,920
are doing is extending that connectivity

235
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,500
to ordinary objects physical devices and

236
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,120
again we got to remember these were

237
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,550
things that were not intentionally

238
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,660
designed to connect and we're giving the

239
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,459
inbuilt them the ability to communicate

240
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:18,860
online to all of those other devices so

241
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,570
what I see here is that we are expanding

242
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:26,199
beyond our defined security parameters

243
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,699
we're bringing in something that we

244
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:32,000
haven't really defined and we're adding

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,579
that digital intelligence to enable

246
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:37,579
communications but then we're taking us

247
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:41,839
the humans out of the equation and in

248
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,560
that sense we're handing over control to

249
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,380
the machines I'm just gonna leave that

250
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:55,149
with you let's talk about unmanaged

251
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,089
endpoints these are devices that do not

252
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:01,870
have security in them or at least

253
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,459
security to the extent that we can go in

254
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:07,790
and configure it properly plug-and-play

255
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,620
is a good example it's what it is

256
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,839
convenience my friends has become the

257
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,680
root of all evil and many IOT devices

258
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,769
are just that unmanaged endpoints

259
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,119
they can communicate with a whole bunch

260
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:25,730
of other devices they've got the ability

261
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,850
to not just process but also to transmit

262
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,759
information they have an operating

263
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,709
system on them it's basic but it's an

264
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:38,179
operating system however try as me white

265
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:39,889
curse as much as we do

266
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:43,339
we cannot configure or manage the

267
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:46,069
security on them using what we

268
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:49,819
conventionally use and they won't let us

269
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:52,429
configure them to be better we are stuck

270
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:58,160
with what we get so how bad could that

271
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,379
be let's think of refrigeration on those

272
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,089
transport trucks I don't know about you

273
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:07,269
but I really enjoy seafood and shrimp

274
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:12,049
well if the temperature starts to fail

275
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:13,939
the temperature controls and it starts

276
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:15,559
to heat up and the sensors don't alert

277
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:18,189
that truck arrives at the destination

278
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:22,459
with a ton of spoiled seafood well

279
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:25,489
that's lost revenue what have we talked

280
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:29,660
about a greater loss let's talk about

281
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,740
the HVAC systems where we work where we

282
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,769
live where we come to play in your

283
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:41,449
hotels and what if we had an outbreak of

284
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:44,839
an airborne contagion a recent example

285
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:47,869
is Legionnaires disease does everybody

286
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:52,040
heard of Legionnaires disease yeah it's

287
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,309
serious and it can be fatal and that is

288
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:57,110
not the only kind of an airborne

289
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,740
outbreak we could be facing through

290
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:05,240
monitored HVAC systems think in terms of

291
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,059
quality control which we rely on for

292
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:11,290
things that we use for food that we eat

293
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,540
so what would happen if somebody got in

294
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,209
and just you know messed around with

295
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:22,189
those settings would we know how would

296
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:25,689
we know how could we tell are we able to

297
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:30,110
monitor that are we monitoring that you

298
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,770
can call me paranoid we've seen

299
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,870
what happens when ransomware takes down

300
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,600
hospitals and it's an ongoing situation

301
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,420
so we rely on these devices these

302
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,330
sensors these monitors to be reliable

303
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:52,550
and to notify us we trust them what is

304
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,470
our rule in the security community

305
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,260
around trust anybody throw it out for me

306
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,370
[Laughter]

307
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:06,560
zero trust yeah so let's talk about

308
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,890
hyper connectivity it's that

309
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,560
consumer-driven need to take everything

310
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,460
and plug it in and that of course has

311
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,110
made its way right in new enterprise

312
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,130
environments we face a rush to market so

313
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,600
there's there's no real security

314
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,940
happening in software-defined life

315
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,520
cycles we're facing supply chain risks

316
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,230
and the possibility for the liability so

317
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,640
devices get shipped that can't be

318
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,520
updated or like we said that have only a

319
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,670
limited capacity to be updated and that

320
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,040
risk it gets pushed down along the

321
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,280
supply chain until whoever buys it owns

322
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,890
it and essentially it rests with the

323
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,760
hapless consumer according to a pony

324
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,490
Monde survey that was done around March

325
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,840
of 2017 most organizations were not

326
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,360
inventory in

327
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,980
because they did not have centralized

328
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,890
control over the IOT devices and the

329
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,839
Associated applications that were coming

330
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,920
into their workplaces well I don't think

331
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,109
we're gotten any better and I would say

332
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:22,160
hello shadow shadow IT so how are you

333
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:32,270
inventory 'uncle will you see it would

334
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,720
you recognize it for what it is we call

335
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,790
this BYO IOT

336
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,940
I'm just gonna say this because it only

337
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:54,710
takes one just one so yeah let's

338
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,100
consider it an open invitation to shadow

339
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,680
IOT through an increasing unmonitored

340
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,490
unsanctioned BYOD and everybody wants to

341
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,310
bring their stuff in and not everybody's

342
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,910
gonna tell anybody that they should tell

343
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,220
that they brought it that they connected

344
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,490
I think the saying is it's better to ask

345
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,330
for forgiveness than for permission this

346
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,700
seems to be an unwritten policy so as

347
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,890
IOT continues to move further and deeper

348
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,320
into enterprise environments driven of

349
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,690
course by that consumer demand we have

350
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,430
got a real growing problem in terms of

351
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,550
shadow IOT in our enterprises we've got

352
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,010
new challenges and risks that our

353
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,590
current policies and regulations around

354
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:48,080
compliance don't address so um I'd love

355
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,490
to see a show of hands and I'll just ask

356
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,550
informally does your current security

357
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,330
policy manage the IOT of your third

358
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,700
parties this is something that has even

359
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:10,220
come up yeah so in an article from 2018

360
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,020
in CSO 97% of risk professionals said

361
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,150
that a data breach or a cyber attack on

362
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,830
their network that was caused by

363
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,000
unsecured IOT devices would be quote

364
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,790
catastrophic for their organization but

365
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,320
a lot of people saying the same thing

366
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,690
and catastrophic is a very powerful word

367
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,740
if we look at this I'd like to do the

368
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,660
analogy in terms of a medical

369
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,360
environment so you have a lot of devices

370
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,540
connected that could be at risk

371
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,990
highly at risk however those IT teams in

372
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,000
hospitals but these could be IT teams

373
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,360
anywhere don't have the visibility to be

374
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,300
able to see what or how many of these

375
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,140
types of

376
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,420
IOT devices are actually connected to

377
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,670
the network without that critical

378
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,580
insight they don't have an understanding

379
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,370
of the threats the possible attacks and

380
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,510
the risks that they're facing so how do

381
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,480
we get there we need to be looking at

382
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,100
what's on the network we need end-to-end

383
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,470
visibility but we also have to be able

384
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,590
to detect these for the objects that

385
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,650
they are these devices are getting

386
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:29,420
attacked for their data but the problem

387
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,250
with this is once the attacker is in

388
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,140
your network they can do a lot more harm

389
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:38,960
than just taking the data so here are

390
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,960
some takeaways from this section we have

391
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,340
an understanding of what makes IOT

392
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,900
different when it's inside of your

393
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:53,060
network we're looking at an increasing

394
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,070
risk of shadow IOT in enterprise

395
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,190
environments and what we need to go

396
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,990
hunting for it because it's not gonna

397
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,370
stand up and say hello

398
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,810
I'm IOT and then we need to work

399
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,910
together to make IOT a shared

400
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,010
responsibility within our groups it

401
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:17,090
can't just fall on one group we know

402
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,680
that the road to hell is paved with good

403
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:24,500
intentions right so I heard a talk given

404
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,530
by Christine gladbury she's the head of

405
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,120
product security operations at

406
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,910
blackberry and she talked about how the

407
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,910
Internet of Things has exponentially

408
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,490
grown within the consumer space but also

409
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:40,340
moved into enterprise environments and

410
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,790
enterprises are excited to use these new

411
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,230
endpoints they want to use them for

412
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,360
their business value and the projected

413
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,720
opportunities they want to create

414
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,370
organizational efficiencies this is good

415
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,750
business talk these are good words to

416
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,860
bring back when you're talking to the

417
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,200
c-suite and so you're using that

418
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,470
combination of sensor data and

419
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,750
algorithms so that you can streamline

420
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,660
business processes right dollar value

421
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,570
there increased productivity dollar

422
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,580
value there develop

423
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,960
edge products because we're so

424
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,910
competitive and yes dollar value there

425
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,870
however great reward equals great risk

426
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,750
as we venture further into these unknown

427
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,620
tech territories and face it we really

428
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,220
do not have a handle on the risks and

429
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,320
threats associated with IOT as much as

430
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,870
some people some groups would like to

431
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,090
think that they do it's still an unknown

432
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,780
how we're finding things that 20 years

433
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,540
ago were not even considered a threat

434
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,600
were not even known to be a threat

435
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,220
what's the potential that we're sewing

436
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,860
with this so what is it that were not

437
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,680
considering and what are we not thinking

438
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,630
of in terms of risk an attack and

439
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,690
possibility a lot of these devices have

440
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,100
the ability to listen to us to take away

441
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,570
snippets and other important things from

442
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,680
our casual conversations also we don't

443
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,320
really have a handle yet on cloud don't

444
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,630
shoot me we don't but that happens to be

445
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:19,750
the home of IOT so we face serious

446
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,910
capability gaps and issues when we're

447
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,950
trying to integrate IOT into our

448
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,160
existing networks part of the problem is

449
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,990
we're not able or we're not taking a

450
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,570
holistic or a big-picture view we focus

451
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,960
on just one part of it and think back to

452
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,730
the elephant we only see the part that

453
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,730
we're focusing on or think back to that

454
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,830
$7,000 pen I think it was that NASA

455
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,050
developed for the astronauts to take up

456
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,550
into space that a bunch of different

457
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,550
people in silos worked on it leaves out

458
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,650
the organizational capabilities and the

459
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,390
change management functions that are

460
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,350
essential when you are rolling out

461
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:05,900
large-scale initiatives yes so even with

462
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,550
all that we know and understand about

463
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,610
the inherent security risks of IOT yes

464
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,860
the Internet of as we like to call

465
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,970
it aptly and with increased targeted

466
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,360
ransomware attacks going through 2019

467
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,760
it's at least a hundred and eighteen

468
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,730
percent over last year

469
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,130
attacks on industry and municipalities

470
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:33,620
and hospitals and schools there are no

471
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,500
real regulations or enforcement's to

472
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,990
ensure security here okay now we know

473
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,440
what it is and why we should care let's

474
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,570
talk a little bit about how it actually

475
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,680
works

476
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,050
I'm no expert so I'm gonna just stick to

477
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,030
the basics here to help put everybody on

478
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,320
the same platform

479
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,080
I'll ask first is anybody here actively

480
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,710
working on IOT or IOT security nice to

481
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,750
meet you and if you need to correct me

482
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:10,910
on anything I will appreciate it okay so

483
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,070
I'm gonna present this in three basic

484
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:16,970
layers the first layer is physical so

485
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,850
these are sensors actuators smart

486
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,650
devices the things so IOT things

487
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,120
interface and they communicate to the

488
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,820
cloud and they use a gateway to do this

489
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,820
they communicate typically through Wired

490
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,780
or through localized radio frequency RF

491
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,530
networks now some of these things come

492
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,340
internet-ready

493
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,560
right out of the box for a plug-and-play

494
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,020
experience but there's a lot of older

495
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,180
and legacy items out there that need a

496
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,190
little help to connect so they'll use

497
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,950
things like analog or serial connections

498
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,760
and then they get connected by

499
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,480
microcontrollers you may know what some

500
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,450
of these things are there are systems on

501
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,360
modules or Psalms there's single board

502
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,100
computers cult or SBC's arduino x'

503
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,390
raspberry pi's love raspberry PI's then

504
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,810
there are the IOT gateways so these are

505
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,700
your middlemen they have an important

506
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,110
role to play because they work as both

507
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,060
the messenger and the translator for the

508
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,560
things and the cloud there's software

509
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,540
programs that run within the field to

510
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,980
help this happen they're in close

511
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,040
proximity to the physical devices and

512
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,040
what they'll do is they will normalize

513
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,300
connect and then transfer the data

514
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,760
between the physical devices layer and

515
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,179
the

516
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:42,080
cloud they don't have just that limited

517
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,090
capability many of these devices now are

518
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:47,080
able to support additional computing and

519
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,309
peripheral functions and those will

520
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:52,340
include telemetry support for multiple

521
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,830
protocol translations this is important

522
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,119
cuz there's a lot of different languages

523
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,730
being spoken in that space artificial

524
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,639
intelligence you're dealing with reams

525
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:03,679
and reams of raw data so you need things

526
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,499
like pre-processing and filtering so you

527
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,779
can weed out what's just never going to

528
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:10,759
be used we're talking billions and

529
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:13,399
billions and billions of bytes coming

530
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,830
through there's provisioning device

531
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:19,389
management the good news is there's also

532
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:22,269
security being put in at this layer and

533
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:24,350
monitoring and we want to see more of

534
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:28,610
that and data encryption because ideally

535
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,499
what we would like is data encryption

536
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:34,789
from end to end last but not least is

537
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:37,399
the top the cloud layer where the

538
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:40,070
applications reside so this communicates

539
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,990
of course with the Gateway through the

540
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,200
internet and also use a wired or a

541
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,649
cellular connection to do this and the

542
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:50,659
reason the cloud is so ideal is because

543
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:52,909
for all that data coming in you're gonna

544
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:55,879
need a huge expanse of space for storage

545
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:58,639
and an enormous amount of power for

546
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:02,590
processing so big data a lot of storage

547
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:08,090
analytics these wireless sensors and

548
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,759
actuators provide the connection between

549
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:14,049
the physical realm and the digital and

550
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:16,429
they work together so that they can

551
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:18,559
produce and collect vast amounts of data

552
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,450
and I'm gonna use as an example your

553
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,730
cell phone so you would have your camera

554
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,580
and your mic gathering in the

555
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,619
information there the input they are the

556
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:31,129
sensors to make this into actual

557
00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:33,830
information you can use we've got the

558
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:39,740
speaker and your screen that's it so how

559
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,919
many are there

560
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,019
billions and there will be billions more

561
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:48,289
of these IOT sensors you may not know

562
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:50,299
this but your average home creates

563
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:52,390
enough data to fill

564
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,430
300 I phones with 32 gigabytes storage

565
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:58,340
in just a year and a lot of this is not

566
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,590
necessary and needs to be filtered out

567
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:05,810
it's my favorite speaker oh this is

568
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,889
gonna get even better folks

569
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:28,820
she said you've Fonte all right now an

570
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,220
example of how much doesn't get used on

571
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,370
a gas rig with 30,000 sensors just for

572
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,160
maintenance planning only 1% of the

573
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,130
information was being used and on

574
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,830
average companies are using

575
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,940
approximately 10% of what they're taking

576
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,960
in now an important point about the

577
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,670
actuators is that they have the ability

578
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,470
to make decisions so that they could

579
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,530
physically move equipment or shut off a

580
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,900
device and I want you to think back to

581
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,730
when we talked about handing over our

582
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,160
control taking ourselves out of the

583
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,440
equation and letting the machines make

584
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,310
the decisions how did they communicate

585
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,580
there's four primary types of

586
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,740
communications device to device device

587
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,860
to cloud device to Gateway and cloud to

588
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,410
cloud I could go into it it's not

589
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:21,020
terribly interesting it's just so that

590
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,780
you know how they're communicating as we

591
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,120
go into talking about why attacks are

592
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,690
different so when we are talking about

593
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:34,130
IOT architecture here's the requirements

594
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,040
the wishlist I'd call it so we need

595
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,230
support right we need support for the

596
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,760
data collection we have to be able to

597
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,890
analyze and control what's coming in

598
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,160
from all of those sensors and actuators

599
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,930
we need efficiency in terms of the data

600
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,730
handling so that we can minimize raw

601
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,440
data coming in to make it more

602
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,680
actionable and useful connectivity

603
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,660
communications what we'd really like is

604
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,020
flexible robust protocols we want

605
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,700
support between those sensors and

606
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,670
actuators and the cloud we need to be

607
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,450
able to make it scale

608
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,009
and I think a lot of people are

609
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:09,869
developing more appreciation and

610
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,159
understanding for what that term

611
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,840
actually means and the pain associated

612
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,799
with it security let's start with

613
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,220
end-to-end encryption monitoring and go

614
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,679
from there we want to have that

615
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,450
availability as well as quality of

616
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:28,999
service fault-tolerant minimum latency

617
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:32,489
yes we want it to be modular flexible

618
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:34,409
and platform independent because we have

619
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:36,239
a lot of things to connect in a lot of

620
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:40,139
languages being spoken open standards

621
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:41,700
and interoperable so that a lot of

622
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,789
people can work with this and continue

623
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:47,549
to develop it and improve it device

624
00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:49,440
management for updates and automation

625
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,379
and defined api's because this will

626
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:55,320
allow for easier integration with

627
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,690
existing applications and other IOT

628
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,779
solutions and that brings us to this

629
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:01,320
point

630
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,840
enterprise architecture because we have

631
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,409
to integrate all of this fast-moving

632
00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:10,919
innovative IOT into a currently existing

633
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:14,720
state with established constraints so

634
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,580
think of Enterprise Architecture as

635
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,100
urban planning for the systems and

636
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,559
networks and integration all of the

637
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,090
things have to live somewhere right and

638
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,169
then systems engineering that's for one

639
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:32,999
component like a building EA is for all

640
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:35,100
of the buildings and that's the

641
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,440
challenge trying to incorporate these

642
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,080
exciting new buildings into the existing

643
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,070
community so you can think in terms of

644
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,559
rigid and traditional because it's very

645
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:52,200
hard to do this that's the pain point EA

646
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,929
isn't necessarily designed for speed and

647
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:57,960
agility at this level we want innovation

648
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,009
we like innovation but we also need to

649
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:03,869
understand and adhere to the security

650
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:06,299
and the structures in place for the

651
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,769
existing tenants of our community and

652
00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:14,909
IOT is constantly evolving so it's a

653
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,470
challenge in terms of bringing

654
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:20,370
enterprise architecture up to

655
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,250
speed to be able to recognize and work

656
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,180
with that

657
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,550
does anybody here actually work in terms

658
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,400
of enterprise architecture or have to

659
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,620
design for incorporating these kinds of

660
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:36,059
systems do you find this - what kind of

661
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:37,559
challenges are these is this what you're

662
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:46,860
experiencing the challenge is to

663
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,360
convince the businesspeople to put the

664
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,340
security features in the product thank

665
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,550
you

666
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,830
so that's right you can see that

667
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,860
security doesn't make the list of needs

668
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,270
this is a it's a I'm sorry if it's hard

669
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,310
to read but this is an example of trying

670
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,159
to flow across three different networks

671
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,530
when you're building enterprise

672
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,980
architecture to incorporate this what I

673
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,870
wanted this to bring across to you the

674
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,360
point I wanted to hit home was the

675
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,020
complexity of connecting basic physical

676
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,918
devices it's kind of an irony kind of

677
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,860
like jumbo shrimp

678
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,960
we've got physical devices with firmware

679
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,210
issues and logical layers and third

680
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,580
party ap eyes and a lot of different

681
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,699
protocols

682
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:47,699
okay so takeaways for this section three

683
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:48,560
different layers of architecture

684
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,330
physical the Gateway and then the cloud

685
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,280
how many physical devices were dealing

686
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,600
with in just in terms of the sensors

687
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,430
along the billions monitoring data

688
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,130
across these different layers and these

689
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,620
different networks the challenge of

690
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,950
trying to get everything to play nice

691
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:14,730
and the issues around integration and

692
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,810
we're security fits into all of this ok

693
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,890
so let's talk about how IOT EO tax

694
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:29,130
attacks are different first and take

695
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,910
this away with you

696
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,760
we think in terms of attacks or breaches

697
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,430
being primary and focused on data

698
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,130
exfiltration why because it's monetized

699
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:45,040
there's identity theft credit card fraud

700
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,440
there's Desjardin sorry I'm gonna keep

701
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,700
throwing that out we've worked a lot on

702
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,609
that too um but in the IOT world there's

703
00:35:54,609 --> 00:35:56,760
some of this but those connected devices

704
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,550
actually have a lot riding on them they

705
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:03,000
tend to be found where they run

706
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,359
mission-critical

707
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:09,160
or life saving systems hospitals but

708
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,839
also critical infrastructure

709
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,980
I work in threat intelligence and when

710
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,000
you're talking about critical

711
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,220
infrastructure we move up to the level

712
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,470
of the games that nation-states like to

713
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,470
play so in some cases we will find

714
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,630
attackers who want to turn those devices

715
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,599
against the company and it'll become

716
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,530
about disruption or destruction and the

717
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,560
impact that's measured is in terms of

718
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,319
dollars and that will present a

719
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:40,480
challenge beyond our normal CI a

720
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,150
triangle of confidentiality integrity

721
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,990
and availability and the attackers can

722
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,490
carry out attacks that are man in the

723
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,829
middle or spoofing or cloning or

724
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:52,750
software attacks that can steal the

725
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,540
credentials of the users or encryption

726
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,690
attacks so that they'll target key

727
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:03,460
algorithms I took this from the ER detto

728
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,160
global report from May of this year was

729
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,530
a survey of 700 enterprises in five

730
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,940
different countries including China

731
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,270
Germany Japan the UK and us these are

732
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:16,030
some major manufacturing nations they

733
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,440
have a lot of impact on the global

734
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,369
economy they stated a distinct lack of

735
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:23,829
optimism about the future security of

736
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:26,109
IOT devices within these organizations

737
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:30,369
and 82% of the organization's

738
00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:33,040
manufacturing IOT devices were concerned

739
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,460
that what they were developing were not

740
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,359
adequately secured from cyberattack in

741
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,420
the UK Germany and China a hundred

742
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,510
percent of IOT device users felt that

743
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:46,990
the cyber

744
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,480
security of their devices could be

745
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,140
improved a lot that's a rather alarming

746
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,140
finding considering how much consumer

747
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:01,930
devices are growing now 49% are making

748
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,660
security of their product design

749
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,340
lifecycle process a thing and

750
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,970
approximately half of these

751
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,250
organizations are conducting continuous

752
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:17,740
security or code reviews that's good but

753
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,450
it's not good enough if all it takes is

754
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:24,190
one one device uh does anybody here know

755
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,440
about mesh cart has anybody here heard

756
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,520
about mesh cart mage cart are a group of

757
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,250
threat actors who very very cleverly

758
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,850
manipulate the JavaScript code in

759
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,590
on-line payment systems they find that

760
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,140
exact point of entry where the consumer

761
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,170
enters their credit card information to

762
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,420
make their online purchase they swap out

763
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,240
that information with their specialized

764
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,500
built in payment skimmer and boom siphon

765
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,960
that off they did a really good job of

766
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,359
it and they hit some major organizations

767
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:00,369
British Airways for example who just got

768
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:02,680
taken to the bank on a huge fine for

769
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,020
that but they've hit Newegg and they've

770
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,000
hit Nike and they've hit a hell of a lot

771
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,440
of other industries through that

772
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:14,800
manipulation that so if you're not

773
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,440
checking your code and in the cases of

774
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,650
these people this was third party code

775
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,770
that they had purchased and relied on

776
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,380
and expected would be fine and it was

777
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,980
fine until it wasn't very powerful

778
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:36,550
example this survey found that over one

779
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,350
in four of the organization's didn't

780
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,450
have software protection technologies

781
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:44,350
built into their business and even less

782
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,869
had mobile application protection I

783
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:49,330
don't know about you but I live on my

784
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,550
phone I do a lot of stuff on there I

785
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:58,690
think I'm doing it safely but am i all

786
00:39:58,690 --> 00:39:59,500
right

787
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,000
this was from a forest through survey

788
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,319
they they asked some pretty interesting

789
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:05,599
questions I'm hoping you can see it from

790
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,670
here but my slides will be available so

791
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:12,140
you'll be able to read it further this

792
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,960
is just taking a pulse check on how

793
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,210
vulnerable people feel the enterprise

794
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:22,880
devices are so what are your policies

795
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,720
around firmware updates

796
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,160
do you have automation to enable you to

797
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,789
do this

798
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:33,700
how about defaults configurations a

799
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,900
painful illustration as the number of

800
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,079
reach is caused by all of those

801
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,329
databases whether they're Amazon or

802
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:44,510
 or couch that are found by

803
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,609
security researchers looking for them on

804
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:50,270
shodhan with default configurations open

805
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:55,280
to whomever finds them so another point

806
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,619
is what's turned on by default when you

807
00:40:57,619 --> 00:40:59,539
get these devices are you checking for

808
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:01,670
that you'd be surprised because you

809
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,920
could turn that off and decrease your

810
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,520
risk universal plug and play and certain

811
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,279
ports maybe miss configuration is the

812
00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:14,650
root of all evil

813
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:18,500
ok so in April Microsoft's threat

814
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,510
intelligence Center discovered it

815
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,819
targeted attacked by a group known as

816
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:28,609
apt 28 or strontium Russia they went

817
00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:32,180
after a VoIP phone a printer and a video

818
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,579
decoder these were the group of attacks

819
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,260
they were the group of devices they were

820
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,079
attacking it hit multiple locations and

821
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,170
used these devices as access points so

822
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,220
that they could get into the wider

823
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,369
corporate networks two of the three

824
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:49,400
devices carried factory default settings

825
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,470
and the software on the third had not

826
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:58,130
yet been updated lessen points of

827
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:06,130
ingress will lead to further access so

828
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,330
why

829
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,250
that I work in strategic threat Intel

830
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,920
which is fascinating always interesting

831
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,600
stories the unites Lino's tells you

832
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,800
everything that I could tell you right

833
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,930
now but we follow the games that

834
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,330
nation-states like to play and yes they

835
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,430
target critical infrastructure they know

836
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,470
where to hit where it's gonna hurt who

837
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,230
here has heard of Stuxnet maybe I should

838
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,990
say who has not heard of Stuxnet I used

839
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,220
to tell this to my kids as a bedtime

840
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:36,190
story but there's other targeted and

841
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,900
destructive malware out there for

842
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,770
example who has heard of Shamoon yeah

843
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,000
Saudi Aramco got hit hard and Triton

844
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,320
who's heard of this one yeah this is

845
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,560
going after the security features within

846
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,410
our critical infrastructure stuff we

847
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:00,310
rely on for lights so international

848
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:03,220
economic sanctions as we know provoke

849
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,650
retaliation Iran has a history of going

850
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,140
after f5 for this but other things as

851
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,640
well so does North Korea thanks to the

852
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,760
release of Merai source code who here is

853
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,740
familiar with Moriah if not you should

854
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,610
definitely be botnets oh my god yes

855
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:24,340
DDoS remember that time we couldn't

856
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,140
connect to anything Facebook went down

857
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,030
Twitter went down oh my god there was no

858
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:31,120
Netflix was terrible yes we have a

859
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,280
plethora of weaponized botnets please

860
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,480
don't get me started because I love

861
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,060
talking about that too they're out there

862
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,320
and they can do a hell of a lot more

863
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,740
than DDoS and this is all about power

864
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,560
and control

865
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,450
so what are the consequences of our

866
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:49,510
inaction there's more from the Forrester

867
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:55,180
survey so yes here are some takeaways

868
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,120
from this section we need to increase

869
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,710
the awareness and understanding of the

870
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:03,130
risks because unmanaged Internet of

871
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,950
Things is far more vulnerable to attack

872
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:09,370
than our conventional manage devices we

873
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,860
cannot apply the same attack scenarios

874
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,680
or threat models to this group of

875
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,680
devices and we need to evaluate what

876
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,380
we've got in place because the attackers

877
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,170
can leverage

878
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:23,180
and then they can pivot and go deeper

879
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,240
each end point will become a point of

880
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,130
ingress for further access what we're

881
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:34,540
using ain't cutting it

882
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:40,790
all right only takes one so who here has

883
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:42,829
had to deal with or is familiar with the

884
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:48,740
problem of crypto miners yes it is a

885
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,109
growing issue it's across all the

886
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:53,900
platforms and you know what they love

887
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,049
enterprise environments why because it's

888
00:44:57,049 --> 00:45:01,160
so much power and they go relatively

889
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,650
undetected they show up as potentially

890
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,380
unwanted programs if you're doing a

891
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,809
cursory scan so you don't really address

892
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:11,299
it until you notice a significant dip in

893
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:15,140
your CPU levels how are they spreading

894
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:18,290
believe it or not eternal blue really is

895
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,710
still a thing it is leveraged and it is

896
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,140
leveraged to the hilt there are a lot of

897
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,270
vulnerable systems and devices still out

898
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:29,809
there some of the targets include docker

899
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:32,510
containers and we talk about container

900
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,150
escapes because what is the point of a

901
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,549
container if what kids in there can

902
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:40,690
escape out of there all right

903
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:45,109
we've talked about ransomware who here

904
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:47,540
had not heard about the attack on norsk

905
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,630
hydro is everybody familiar with the

906
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,569
attack on norsk I think it's up to sixty

907
00:45:53,569 --> 00:45:55,130
million dollars now in terms of

908
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,609
remediation these guys got hit and hit

909
00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:01,549
hard but it exemplifies the series of

910
00:46:01,549 --> 00:46:04,369
attacks on industry in terms of targeted

911
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:05,660
ransomware and there have been new

912
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,280
varieties that came out this year like

913
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:13,460
lock or Goga right or ryuk or mega

914
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:18,140
cortex for example Wolters Kluwer but

915
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,460
they don't they didn't exactly admit

916
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,049
that it was ransomware but there was a

917
00:46:21,049 --> 00:46:22,910
lot of chatter on the boards

918
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,069
unofficially that this was mega cortex

919
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:26,930
and and they took them right out right

920
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,750
at the point of tax season a lot of

921
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:32,690
people actually had to file taxes these

922
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,330
are accounting firms had to file taxes

923
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:37,010
after the deadline with special

924
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,980
dispensation because they couldn't use

925
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,870
the software because of the ransomware

926
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:46,700
attack case in point this can happen

927
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,490
with unsecured and unmanaged IOT devices

928
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:54,380
on your enterprise networks so Silex

929
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,440
malware came out in June of 2019 and it

930
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,770
was a brief but powerful interlude it

931
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,530
bricked mm I Oh T devices when the space

932
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,340
of just hours the wipe the firmware

933
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,780
similar to what Bricker bought did back

934
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:12,230
in 2017 does any anybody here know about

935
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:16,130
brick or bought excellent

936
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,320
so yeah let's talk about what happens if

937
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,820
something completely goes after and

938
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:22,580
destroys what you've got wipes out

939
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,720
storage drops firewall rules removes

940
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,930
network configuration halts the device

941
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,180
and come just stopped short of literally

942
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,360
trying the circuits you could reinstall

943
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,280
the firmware but unfortunately most

944
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,160
people can't and won't and many don't

945
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,420
even realize they've been hit by this

946
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:47,840
malware they just toss it crack this

947
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,180
went after millions of first generation

948
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,340
Amazon echo devices an eighth generation

949
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,910
Amazon Kindle who's got an Amazon echo

950
00:47:54,910 --> 00:48:00,620
or Kindle exactly these are the actual

951
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,480
vulnerabilities from 2017 that were

952
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,370
leveraged and it could be used by

953
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:06,950
attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle

954
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:11,420
attacks on protected wpa2 networks so

955
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:13,550
that it could steal the information from

956
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:16,280
those targeted devices and then it could

957
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,670
do a denial of service attack a replay

958
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:23,270
attack decrypt the data Forge data

959
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:28,220
packets everybody uses these frigging

960
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,740
things Polly calms right and with travel

961
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:34,120
budgets being cut people need to use

962
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,820
teleconferencing well there have been

963
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,770
exploits against major vulnerabilities

964
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:43,810
in these systems and that led to attacks

965
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:48,170
Polycom HDX systems if you've got it you

966
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:49,110
may want to check into

967
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:50,970
this a little bit further because these

968
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,840
are networked fight a myriad of

969
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,910
endpoints globally and remember what I

970
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:00,420
said about one one of these gets hit the

971
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:03,330
whole group of them get infected fast

972
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:05,370
and if I need a more poignant

973
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:09,300
illustration not Pecha that spread like

974
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:14,040
wildfire globally same kind of spread at

975
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,210
the same kind of speed here who has her

976
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,590
divergent 11 because this is actually

977
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,860
really important this affects a ton of

978
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:26,250
devices by major manufacturers you may

979
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:28,650
not realize you may be hit it's huge

980
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,630
because six of these vulnerabilities can

981
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,720
lead to remote code execution it affects

982
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,630
a range of versions spanning thirteen

983
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:40,350
years and it's about the system known

984
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:41,760
it's an underlying operating system

985
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,940
known as a vxworks it's pervasive it's

986
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,430
on so many things and attackers can

987
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,770
circumvent the NAT and the firewalls to

988
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,690
control these devices remotely by the

989
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,750
tcp/ip stack it can go undetected

990
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,320
because according to the network

991
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,480
nothing's wrong here this is normal and

992
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,730
there's no user interaction required

993
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:06,090
once you have it in place you don't even

994
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:11,460
have to manipulate the devices here's

995
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,400
what you need to know here's some of the

996
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,640
companies here's the kinds of devices

997
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:23,610
it's in your network there are proof of

998
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:25,680
concepts of attacks online that you can

999
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,300
look at this is for a SonicWALL

1000
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,910
SonicWALL firewalls we expect our

1001
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:32,430
firewalls to defend and protect us not

1002
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:37,740
to get pwned or for network devices like

1003
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,210
a printer so that it can literally

1004
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:44,550
bypass and come right in so now we

1005
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,350
understand how the attacks can be

1006
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:49,710
leveraged the growing wrist of crypto

1007
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:53,480
miners and botnets how targeted

1008
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,940
tax that with specialized malware can

1009
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:00,130
work the poly cons are not so safe and

1010
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:03,070
about urgent 11 go home and check

1011
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:07,790
alright you need to make it better or

1012
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,640
else if anybody's seen the movie I Robot

1013
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,020
it was good

1014
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,300
Attila wasn't so good right and that

1015
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,490
sums it up when we've got IOT

1016
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,590
infiltrating enterprising it's not

1017
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:21,470
obedient the way we expect it to be not

1018
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,600
like our laptops not like our cell

1019
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,940
phones these interact differently and

1020
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,550
they behave differently and they operate

1021
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:32,510
with little to no human intervention so

1022
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,580
I'm just gonna say this too automating

1023
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,090
convenience with inadequate supervision

1024
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:42,140
is gonna end badly this whole section is

1025
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,590
a take away I'll start here no your

1026
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:49,270
attack surface strong authentication

1027
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:52,640
network segmentation absolutely you got

1028
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,850
to keep him separated utilize and set up

1029
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:57,800
your firewalls and your VPNs for this

1030
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,200
use automation so that you don't have to

1031
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,790
rely or make mistakes you can use

1032
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,700
automation to update firmware to look

1033
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,540
for and monitor the devices behavioral

1034
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,609
monitoring so that you can check for

1035
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:12,859
anomalies oh my god inventory everything

1036
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:16,660
that's Lee's we wish we dream of this

1037
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:20,480
work together we need actual IOT policy

1038
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,820
and compliance in place you need to put

1039
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,680
the right people in place to do this and

1040
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,210
you need to make a commitment to it as

1041
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,460
an organization there are frameworks

1042
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:32,600
from NIST and CIS to start with this is

1043
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,520
an example of what you could build off

1044
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,920
of the questions to ask to get the

1045
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,170
information you need and hopefully get

1046
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:42,680
the buy-in you want let's not play

1047
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,390
hide-and-seek with the devices anymore

1048
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:46,640
let's automate how we identify what's

1049
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,119
going on the network there's even zero

1050
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:54,590
trust privilege so bottom line we got to

1051
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,550
spend the time and the money to defend

1052
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,650
against the IOT that's sneaking in on

1053
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:03,830
our networks we need to give them their

1054
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,780
own space their own place for our own

1055
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,510
safety lesson

1056
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:10,090
in the people the policies and the

1057
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,190
procedures to really commit to this and

1058
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:16,740
do it right let's invest in automation

1059
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,940
we need to work together and collaborate

1060
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,980
take down the silos and talk about what

1061
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,570
we're seeing what we're doing to make it

1062
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,490
better and then let's build better

1063
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:27,730
security policies and that's it merci

1064
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:31,770
beaucoup thank you so much
