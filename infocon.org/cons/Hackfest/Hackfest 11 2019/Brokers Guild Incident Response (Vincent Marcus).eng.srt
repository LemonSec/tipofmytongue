1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,160
so good afternoon everybody I'm here to

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,629
talk to you guys about an incident that

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:07,950
happened a few years ago it's with a

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,840
it's actually with a group that plays an

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,340
online video game it's called the

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,210
brokers killed and so why am i talking

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,990
about it first off any other incident

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,480
that I have privy and information to and

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,680
stuff is protected by MDA

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,260
so this is pretty much all I can talk

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,130
about by the way I've got about 17 years

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,140
of experience managing IT teams in the

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,420
financial services industry of a managed

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,000
security teams system administrators

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,829
DBAs and stuff and currently I'm

16
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,989
managing a group of DevOps people so

17
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:44,789
this is I this is pretty much how

18
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,250
Thursday October 19th the 2017 started

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,920
out for me had my coffee sat down sir

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,440
going through my emails got this message

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,899
impending shitshow today what had

22
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,120
happened was a there's been a hundred of

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,430
us we all participated in a slack

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,730
channel called brokers guild and there

25
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,040
was a group of people that were getting

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,590
ready to basically expose us

27
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,159
so for a little background to start off

28
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,840
with we all played this video game

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,610
called ingress ingress is played it's an

30
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,170
augmented reality game that's played on

31
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,250
your cell phone

32
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,619
it was my antics first really big hit

33
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,720
game actually I don't even think you can

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,159
call it a hit not a lot of people played

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,290
it but it led to Pokemon go and Harry

36
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,400
Potter which is how they make their

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,400
money we still play it all three games

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,350
basically all around the same concept

39
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,229
there are places of interest all around

40
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,700
the world and you go and you interact

41
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,110
with them and and that's how you score

42
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,570
points in the game ingress is unique

43
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,759
because in ingress there's two factions

44
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,470
or teams

45
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,280
one is called the enlightened

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,439
represented by the green freaky eye

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,799
thing and the cool blue key that's the

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,310
resistance those are the good guys

49
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,020
so you when you sign up you go yeah pick

50
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,460
a team and the players that join and

51
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,780
play the game and stuff they're called

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,360
agents and among everything it ends up

53
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,038
with this very spy versus spy sort

54
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,169
attitude you end up if you get really

55
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,090
sucked into the game you start building

56
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,650
communities

57
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,750
you start trying to get intelligence on

58
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,670
the other communities and stuff and it's

59
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,140
all around how you score and stuff in

60
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,519
the game so the biggest way you score is

61
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,819
you capture those portals places of

62
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,349
interest you capture them for your team

63
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,940
you link them to other ones and if you

64
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,379
form a triangle in the ingress it

65
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,440
creates a field and the score for the

66
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,060
field is dependent on the size of the

67
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,950
triangle and the population that the

68
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,870
triangle is covering so as you can

69
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,190
imagine there's an awful lot of pressure

70
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,170
for you to build big triangles that

71
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,700
cover really populated areas and those

72
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,030
links can't cross so a lot of effort

73
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,349
goes into these operations especially

74
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:54,780
the ones that cover continents and and

75
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,720
countries and stuff like that these

76
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,280
operations will involve hundreds if not

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,150
thousands of agents all around clearing

78
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,160
the lane and stuff and the the

79
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,959
operations they'll have a primary plan

80
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,269
the backup plans the backup plans will

81
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:11,280
have backup plans you got to imagine

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,599
there's an awful lot of pressure there's

83
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,650
a little pressure for the people that

84
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,760
are on the ground trying to throw the

85
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,950
Lynx pressure and for the people who are

86
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,239
on the ground trying to clear the Lynx

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,819
and there's pressure for the people who

88
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,200
are sitting here behind their computer

89
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,000
watching on Intel just trying to make it

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,600
all happen

91
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,660
it's expensive to you you got paid for

92
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,120
the gas time is money you hike a

93
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,190
mountain top you're seriously invested

94
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,569
in that and you are sitting up there on

95
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,069
the peak and you're waiting for somebody

96
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:36,840
to clear a little kilometer long link

97
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,690
and sometimes they don't so the other

98
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,010
big thing that happens in ingress are

99
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,639
anomalies this is the Vietnam War

100
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,700
Chicago anomaly a few years ago

101
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,910
anomalies a huge effect anomalies are

102
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,989
probably the only reason that I still

103
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,959
play the game thousands of people

104
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,120
hundreds of thousands people get

105
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,700
together battle it out in one of these

106
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,269
sites and at the end of it you know we

107
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:07,709
end up with one faction winning and the

108
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,280
other one losing so for those of you in

109
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,940
the back i zoomed in so there's me and

110
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,370
Dallas and Tony and we all flew in from

111
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,668
Utah for this one in Chicago so so it's

112
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:22,830
a great time and part of the problem is

113
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,270
is that when you play ingress and you

114
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,880
start you start really playing

115
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,380
in the the field sir you're making the

116
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,450
big ones and you start doing the

117
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,920
anomalies you start making friends all

118
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,020
around the world and the challenge is

119
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,370
that is that there's not a lot of

120
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,600
opportunities to get together and

121
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,340
anomalies do that so you get together

122
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,990
you have a couple beers you go out play

123
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,470
the game

124
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,560
hopefully you win this one we did by the

125
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,910
way so so then go talk a little bit

126
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,370
about scrapers here scrapers are

127
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,170
software programs that basically I mean

128
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,720
you guys should be familiar it's same as

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,520
with any website you know we collect the

130
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,850
data and stuff out of it organize it

131
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,810
display it in different ways and stuff

132
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,480
scrapers in ingress are against the

133
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,890
rules they've been around since the very

134
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,070
first day of ingress probably originally

135
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,230
they were used to actually score little

136
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,060
tiny mini anomalies community sized

137
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,060
anomalies and then people started

138
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,440
finding other interesting things you

139
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,120
could do with us when you imagine it and

140
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,100
stuff you're trying to throw a link from

141
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,090
California to Boston and all along that

142
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,490
way somebody could throw a cross link

143
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,350
yeah I think I have somebody that's

144
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,490
gonna be sitting there staring at the

145
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,710
screen all day and all night looking at

146
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,300
every little inch long that way looking

147
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,500
to see whether or not there's something

148
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,840
blocking it or you end up writing a

149
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,120
program to automate it so a lot of

150
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,430
people end up doing that another good

151
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,130
example is at the anomalies and stuff

152
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,790
there are special weapons called viruses

153
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,400
ADA's and Jarvis for the names and

154
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,830
they're very powerful but when you use

155
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,600
them on a portal the problem is is that

156
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,330
that portal is then immune to another

157
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,420
virus for an hour and so scrapers are

158
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,070
used to actually keep track of when the

159
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,550
portal was was inoculated and how long

160
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,870
it is until we can actually use another

161
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,670
virus on it so not all scrapers are

162
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,850
considered really bad so bovine ethology

163
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,640
here one of the problems with the

164
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,720
ingress is when you take a look at the

165
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,370
scores it really doesn't make any sense

166
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,010
especially with those big fields you can

167
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,740
throw a big field covers you know a

168
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,690
province or a state and you could throw

169
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,670
a bigger field over that field and you

170
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,740
get a small you get a lower score it's

171
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,600
it almost seemed like magic and stuff

172
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,580
and so a group of players actually got

173
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,219
together they wrote this bovine ethology

174
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:42,919
the scores measured in in what they call

175
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,560
mind units are moves and so that's the

176
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,490
reason for the name bovine ethology but

177
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,659
what I what they did is they got

178
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,919
together they scraped together a whole

179
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,930
bunch of data they analyzed it and they

180
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,610
started to figure out exactly what all

181
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,199
went into that scoring you know another

182
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,120
guy named Tariq Assad he had a site and

183
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,909
track Azad was actually well known for

184
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:06,469
collecting the data from anomalies and

185
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,629
other large events and then basically

186
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,610
printing it back up again so that it was

187
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,740
easier to understand so NPN IO is

188
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,169
actually a collection of scripts and

189
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:19,610
tools and stuff that are used for

190
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,229
anomalies and putting together a large

191
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:24,020
large fields it actually ties back in

192
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,389
with a whole bunch of the other scraper

193
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,279
databases and stuff so this right here

194
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,719
is the Guardian badge and if there's

195
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:37,250
something that ingress agents know it's

196
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,240
drama they create it like nobody else

197
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,580
and this badge is probably probably

198
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,279
responsible for more drama than just

199
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,930
about anything else in the game

200
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,759
in fact if somebody can figure out a way

201
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,620
to turn drama into electricity we could

202
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,080
probably replace fossil fuels with this

203
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,729
badge so it's the problem is is that is

204
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,500
that you earn this badge by owning a

205
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,849
portal for a hundred and fifty days

206
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:06,610
that's how you get it and so pretty easy

207
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,539
turned out to be a player versus player

208
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:11,150
game after all you know people you

209
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,759
didn't like you you stalked them you

210
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,110
figured out exactly where their portals

211
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,819
were and you killed him before 150 days

212
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:19,599
and a lot of people didn't like that I

213
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,949
got worse when you when you incorporate

214
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:24,919
scrapers especially because the scrapers

215
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:28,520
are technically illegal you know because

216
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,430
then you kill if you kill a Cardian

217
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,049
portal legitimately everybody accuses

218
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:37,610
you of scraping it you know so right

219
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,750
back to Thursday October 19 2017 so what

220
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,370
had happened was a member of the workers

221
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,860
guild had he'd become disillusioned or

222
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,410
something and he had decided to hook up

223
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,680
with a member of the other faction and

224
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,430
provided them with a whole bunch of

225
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,660
screenshots that show

226
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,710
everything that was going on in the

227
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,530
broker skills included every screenshot

228
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,690
that showed who all the members of the

229
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,790
workers guild were which chats they were

230
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,430
in a bunch of his stuff he also provided

231
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,660
him with screenshots of a tool called

232
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,840
riot riot was a big database containing

233
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,280
lots of information and stuff that had

234
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,530
been scraped had a really easy-to-use

235
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,730
user interface I'm very proud of it

236
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,520
so with all that information and stuff

237
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,720
him and a bunch of his friends had

238
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,830
gotten together and they decided that

239
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,210
they were gonna create a wordpress site

240
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,980
they're gonna release all this

241
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,420
information and they were gonna release

242
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,770
it in a way that made it look like the

243
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,330
brokers guild did nothing but Guardian

244
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,000
hunting which isn't necessarily true

245
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,890
we'll admit there was a guardian hunting

246
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,740
channel but a lot of the brokers guild

247
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,750
was around anomaly organization other

248
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,760
big events and stuff like that it was

249
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,200
800 people around the world it was a

250
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,180
great place in order to make you know

251
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,160
connections and make things happen so

252
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,620
that was the ANU of our incident so it's

253
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,320
a first step in any Incident Response

254
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,350
activity is preparation this is all for

255
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,890
fun games it was a toy there was none no

256
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,090
preparation we a bunch of the things

257
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,680
that we didn't necessarily do we didn't

258
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,750
have anybody identified from a legal

259
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,250
standpoint who'd respond to requests

260
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,990
there was nobody that was that would

261
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,490
manage PR and marketing we didn't know

262
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,860
exactly you know in the event that that

263
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,480
data like this leaked out who is

264
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,980
actually responsible for hunting down

265
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,270
and figuring out exactly what had

266
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,070
happened

267
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,620
none of those roles were identified this

268
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,230
event actually gave me a newfound

269
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,730
appreciation for the preparation

270
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,270
Stefan's Incident Response the before I

271
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,040
was always checking the boxes you know

272
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,810
you got it you know do we have somebody

273
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,180
that's responsible for marketing yeah we

274
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,930
do do they know what they're doing do we

275
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,670
have somebody responsible for legal do

276
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,710
they know what they're doing you know by

277
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,360
and large for the most of the IT steps

278
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,950
and stuff we had that stuff down it was

279
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,050
all this stuff that's around and in the

280
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,420
brokers guild that was exactly the

281
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,770
problem that really didn't end up being

282
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,630
a technical issue it ended up being a PR

283
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,520
marketing issue and then eventually a

284
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,170
legal one identification is pretty

285
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,800
fortunately we had moles mentioned

286
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,990
earlier that you know there's kind of an

287
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,210
intelligent aspect to this game we had

288
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,350
moles that were inside this organization

289
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,810
clean ingress and they were feeding us

290
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,730
bits and pieces and information and

291
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,530
stuff and so we knew what they were

292
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,480
planning on releasing how they were

293
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,160
planning on releasing but we didn't

294
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,600
actually have the data of what they were

295
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,160
planning to release so we got to

296
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,200
containment pretty quickly

297
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,420
not the only thing that we could do we

298
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,160
had to shut down the slack had to turn

299
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,740
off the tools you know couldn't afford

300
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,540
to have this person who was providing

301
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,950
the screenshots we didn't know who it

302
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,170
was couldn't afford to have them digging

303
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,460
through there and finding more dirt

304
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,010
against us especially because we didn't

305
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,780
know at that point exactly what the

306
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,310
narrative was going to be exactly what

307
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,420
the information was going to be that

308
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,070
they're gonna push out there and more

309
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,690
importantly we didn't know how Niantic

310
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,430
was going to react or how the other

311
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,990
people in the user community were going

312
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,700
to react so that takes us to eradicating

313
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,050
and this is where the fun begins

314
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,510
so the only thing we can really do to

315
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,610
eradicate it is we have to find out

316
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,560
exactly who it is that's leaking this

317
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,540
information and we've got to kick them

318
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:23,090
out of our systems so we didn't have the

319
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,740
information at first I believe I

320
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,390
mentioned that we didn't know we didn't

321
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,950
have copies of the screenshots we didn't

322
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,410
know the exact text and stuff until they

323
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,480
actually released this site later that

324
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,850
day these steps that we had taken in

325
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,820
containment in order to minimize the

326
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,230
footprint and what they could get access

327
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,390
to in the future and stuff like that had

328
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,980
alerted them to the fact that we

329
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,390
actually had a mole that was inside

330
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,370
their organization and it drove them to

331
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,810
actually release a little bit earlier

332
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,780
than they were planning to so this is

333
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,850
the website it's still up brokers guilt

334
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,590
wordpress.com if you ever want to read a

335
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,450
completely biased hit job against me and

336
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,470
my friends you're more than welcome to

337
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,980
so located on there was a list of

338
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,260
everybody that had access to the slack

339
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,180
they had gone through and meticulously

340
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,890
typed in every single name out of those

341
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,080
screenshots made it so it was easy to

342
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,890
search and stuff user number 108 on that

343
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,070
list it was alphabetical by the way

344
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,450
me boy plankton so they're their copy

345
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,190
the list that they didn't publish

346
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,500
included information and stuff that we

347
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,520
don't know exactly where they were

348
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,050
getting it from but it included like

349
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,730
where you played and all sorts of stuff

350
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,440
so they could get back to people and

351
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,030
have them look up your information so

352
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,380
the brokers guild did actually have

353
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,820
interfaces tied into it with scrapers

354
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,460
there was four of them and they they

355
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,840
identified in that release they

356
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,270
identified three of the four radar riot

357
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,730
and omnivore they conspicuously left out

358
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:01,690
you know that IO so once we had the

359
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,790
screenshots and then we could start

360
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,930
going through and actually going through

361
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,400
the hard work of actually identifying

362
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,810
who it was that it snapped the

363
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,510
screenshots so from the information that

364
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,820
we had gotten we knew everything about

365
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,480
the cell phone

366
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,160
we knew the resolution of the screen we

367
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,350
knew the ratio we knew that it was on a

368
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,830
Verizon 4G network whoever it was played

369
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,890
clash of clans and they always had their

370
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,350
alarm set that actually worries me I

371
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,850
play clash of clans and I have my alarm

372
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,560
set too so on the desktop side it was

373
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,810
actually a really weird resolution 1366

374
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,840
by 768 the Windows version appeared to

375
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,030
be Windows 10 and the chrome profile

376
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:44,320
Nate was named evil so lots of stuff to

377
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,060
go off of there none of it really

378
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,090
helpful we did try looking and do things

379
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,910
like isolating everybody that was using

380
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,970
a verizon cellphone tax that's right

381
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,520
lots of people use Verizon cell phones

382
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,080
we also looked into you people used

383
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,360
Chrome on Windows 10 lots of people use

384
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,790
Chrome on Windows 10 there was also

385
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,800
another problem with that it turned out

386
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,330
that the whistleblower wasn't actually

387
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,950
using Windows 10 they were using Windows

388
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:15,580
8.1 so this was the screenshot of riot

389
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,880
that they published so you can see

390
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,230
there's an awful lot of information here

391
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,300
some of it useful for Guardian hunting

392
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,510
some of it not and they went through and

393
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,860
if this reminds you guys of the Moller

394
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,840
report they were they were the ones that

395
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,100
went through and redacted watch the

396
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,570
information and they did it to try to

397
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,120
protect the whistleblower they knew that

398
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,870
if we could identify

399
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,089
by what the screen was we could get back

400
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:40,180
to the whistleblower and ironically this

401
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,050
is the screenshot they did the most they

402
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,790
redacted the most and it is the

403
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,170
screenshot that was used to actually get

404
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,130
back to the whistleblower so what do we

405
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:51,670
have here

406
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,760
in the upper part of the screen there's

407
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,589
a green box it's got that bit of

408
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,120
information but the important part is

409
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,550
that it's a green box it being a green

410
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,920
box means that the agent whose profile

411
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,420
was being displayed happen to be an

412
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,550
enlightened agent if it was a light blue

413
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,080
box it would have been a resistance

414
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,720
agent the next thing that we can see

415
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,290
here they had a Google+ link on their

416
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,839
profile in ingress they have linked

417
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:18,640
their Google+ profile to their English

418
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,550
profile and riot had captured that

419
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:27,130
information and then finally um they had

420
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,490
a TGT of 78 seconds one of the things

421
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,140
they never talked about on the clean

422
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,990
ingress release is what TTT stands for

423
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,810
it stands for time to train and it

424
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,279
happens to be the amount of time that

425
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,510
was measured in between somebody

426
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,880
creating an account and finishing their

427
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,440
training steps and the reason why that

428
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,089
was there is it was there to help

429
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,279
identify accounts that have been

430
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,930
automatically created and automatically

431
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,240
trained if it was trained in an

432
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,100
impossibly fast amount of time there was

433
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,410
a good chance that it was a robot or as

434
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,880
an account that somebody was starting up

435
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,430
just to go spoof things with and all

436
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,890
sorts of other stuff so it was a really

437
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:08,459
really useful piece of information so

438
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,770
DBAs went and ran some queries and turns

439
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,689
out that 78 seconds was actually really

440
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:17,020
unique only two accounts had a TTT of 78

441
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,339
seconds only one of those accounts had

442
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,470
ever had their profile reviewed in riot

443
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,630
and only one riot user had ever reviewed

444
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,800
the profile in riot

445
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,570
so congratulations in the first 30

446
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,800
minutes we've identified who the

447
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,700
whistleblower is except a couple hours

448
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,440
later after we got done patting

449
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,870
everybody on the back and stuff realized

450
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,650
that wasn't the case DBAs didn't know

451
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,150
the TTT field in the database was

452
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,030
minutes not seconds

453
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,760
so that gold everything back started the

454
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,150
whole process over again so there's a

455
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,470
lot of confusion about how to properly

456
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,330
convert the field I don't know if you

457
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,700
guys are converted things from a from a

458
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,500
floating-point value to an integer but

459
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,930
you lose a lot of precision and so you

460
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,490
have to understand the rounding rules of

461
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,660
how it's going to be displayed on the

462
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,460
screen in order to make that connection

463
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,110
this is all stuff that should have been

464
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,740
done in the first place

465
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,850
whoops yep so we're back to square one

466
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,440
what do we know it's an enlightened

467
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,150
agent that's about 50% of the uses in a

468
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,540
day base they've got a link G+ profile

469
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,670
there's actually a lot of those that

470
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,400
doesn't do a whole lot to filter and

471
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,850
they've got a TTT of 78 seconds for real

472
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,500
this time

473
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,260
so once we've once the DBAs had all that

474
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,550
they had everything figured out and

475
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,190
stuff that whittled it down to 75

476
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,480
possible agents that could be that

477
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,440
profile a lot more than two and

478
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,340
unfortunately the only thing that we had

479
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,440
else were to go off of to filter that

480
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,260
down was those two lines over there on

481
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,500
the right we're looking for a time when

482
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,270
those 75 agents when they would have

483
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,220
only owned two portals that had been

484
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,559
captured on a Saturday within 10 days of

485
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,320
having been captured and the reason we

486
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,510
know it's within 10 days it's because we

487
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,429
know the next badge is gonna be on a

488
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:10,960
Tuesday and the only times that that

489
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,440
would happen

490
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,910
is for the bronze and the silver badges

491
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:18,880
so somebody noticed something and we got

492
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,550
a little bit lucky and this is important

493
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,510
and go back a slide real fast that query

494
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,420
there to look for that situation when

495
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,970
there's only two portals that somebody

496
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,130
could have owned in a 10 day window was

497
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,720
going to be very very expensive to run

498
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,160
it was gonna be very expensive to run

499
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,230
for each of those 75 agents and we're

500
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,830
talking weeks or months to complete that

501
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,929
and so people were not terribly thrilled

502
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,000
about that and they didn't even know how

503
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,590
to where start but again we got lucky

504
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:57,100
the in this it's hard to see but if you

505
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,990
look at all the other redactions they're

506
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,650
a lot blockier

507
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,500
don't scribble as much as this one and

508
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,110
if you look at the bottom of that right

509
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,900
where the the red curly brace is kind of

510
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,480
pointing to there's almost a little bit

511
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,010
that's pointing out that's jetting out

512
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,660
from underneath it and somebody had

513
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,940
noticed that that meant that the second

514
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,850
letter in there was probably an Ag JQ or

515
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:25,850
Y only two out of the seventy-five had a

516
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:31,190
second letter of a g JQ or Y and only

517
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,450
one of them had ever captured two

518
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,650
portals on the Saturday

519
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,090
that Saturday happened to be October

520
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,190
14th well they had captured two portals

521
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,440
many Saturdays only one of them had ever

522
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,890
captured two portals on a Saturday and

523
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,290
held them that we were able to find that

524
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,270
window where they only owned those two

525
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,920
portals at a time and that happened to

526
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,260
be on October 14th which was just a few

527
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,750
days before the brokers killed before

528
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:01,120
the screenshots were taken and stuff so

529
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,890
so now we know who the profile is and

530
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,400
we've got that information so now we

531
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,540
have to go back and we got to look at

532
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,200
the access logs and stuff turns out that

533
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,640
there was a few people and stuff that it

534
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,130
seemed that profile but there's a couple

535
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,570
other details that were actually in this

536
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,840
screenshot the menu options

537
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,780
there's only 55 agents out of everybody

538
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,090
who had access to riot only 55 agents

539
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,560
that had the roles that were necessary

540
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,180
to have the exact same menus as the

541
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,770
whistleblower would have had only seven

542
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,770
agents in in the history of riot had

543
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,960
ever viewed that page the one that we

544
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,880
had identified as being that that

545
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,200
profile screen out of those seven agents

546
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,360
only two of them were in that group of

547
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,540
55 agents that had the same roles to

548
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,230
have those menus and only one of those

549
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,580
two agents had viewed the profile

550
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:04,460
between October 14th and October 18th so

551
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,860
this is the timeline we've actually

552
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,390
identified the whistleblower at this

553
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,700
point because of this we know on October

554
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,500
14th the portals were captured by the

555
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,299
agent the profile

556
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,830
we know on October 18th The

557
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,109
Whistleblower logged into riot they

558
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:20,269
visited the agent profile and that is

559
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:22,249
the point right there October 18th

560
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:25,820
13:39 in 19 seconds when the screen

561
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,409
would have looked exactly like that a

562
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:29,839
few hours later another agent likely a

563
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,959
friend of the whistleblower went and

564
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:34,429
neutralized the other two portals and

565
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:36,049
then shortly thereafter the

566
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:37,580
whistleblower returned to riot and

567
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,139
verified that the screen no longer

568
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:40,369
matched the screenshot that they had

569
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:45,049
taken so going back to the screenshots

570
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:48,079
and stuff we mentioned this before the

571
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,969
Windows version turned out to be not 10

572
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,899
but it was really 8.1 and when we went

573
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:57,320
through the the whistleblowers Google+

574
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,299
profile they had published a whole lot

575
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:00,739
of screenshots that actually matched

576
00:23:00,739 --> 00:23:02,929
both sets of these the cellphone

577
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:04,879
screenshots and the desktop screenshots

578
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:09,619
so here's an example of the desktop of

579
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:13,669
the cell phone screenshots so you can

580
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:16,549
see right there they match up at the top

581
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:21,559
same Verizon 4G logo um

582
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,739
the clock is the same the alarm is the

583
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:32,029
same and the screen size is the same and

584
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:37,009
then this is the desktop and it's tough

585
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:39,799
to see but both of them have the evil

586
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:42,349
for the name on the chrome profile which

587
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:44,409
probably should have gotten masked and

588
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:48,379
and that weird screen size is exactly

589
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:52,669
the same the 1366 by 768 if I remember

590
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:59,929
right so there was not a lot to recover

591
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:04,399
here the the big problem that we had was

592
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:07,459
is that pretty much by about the time

593
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:08,389
that we were figuring out the

594
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:11,029
whistleblower and stuff everything has

595
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:13,269
already done it was out in the public

596
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:16,909
the there was a giant social media

597
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:20,029
campaign that was being run to to really

598
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:22,669
you know keep us out of doing this

599
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:28,130
anymore the tools radar and riot

600
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:34,070
and Omni had all been shut down and then

601
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,420
eventually we got to the point where the

602
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,280
Niantic actually contacted the owners of

603
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,900
the slack the people listed as the

604
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:47,180
owners of the slack and sent them legal

605
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,000
orders to never play the game again so

606
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,930
if I and and then they they announced to

607
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:59,870
people that those had been pushed out it

608
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,980
wasn't actually a really great time

609
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,410
there was 800 of us that that had had

610
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,790
our information and stuff pushed out

611
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,970
there people did things that they

612
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,920
probably shouldn't have done this is

613
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,260
probably one of the worst as one of the

614
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,340
slack admins had a car window smashed in

615
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,370
the among the other things there was

616
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,830
websites created that actually doxed a

617
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,450
few of the people on lowest pretty

618
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,730
heavily when in the details about their

619
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,690
family their jobs their home we had one

620
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,420
guy who we did a fundraiser for in order

621
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,690
to buy him a security system because he

622
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,430
was so worried

623
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:42,170
and then we had inside the game you have

624
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,470
this the ability to submit new portals

625
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,100
and a lot of us ended up with portals

626
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,280
being submitted of our homes called um

627
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,960
brokers guild headquarters so it was

628
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,020
actually a really nasty few months after

629
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,850
that so so there wasn't anything really

630
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,890
to recover and for the most part

631
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,810
everything kind of fell apart a lot of

632
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,370
everybody kind of spread out and you

633
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,750
don't really see a whole lot of brokers

634
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,100
kill people anymore so it's kind of

635
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,730
nasty so let's go to lessons learned

636
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,200
preparation is the key to Rapid Response

637
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,680
and covered this is the very beginning

638
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,170
we were not prepared at all nobody had

639
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,140
ever experienced or nobody expected

640
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,560
anything like this nobody expected that

641
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,030
first of all that anybody was going to

642
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,170
turn on us like that

643
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,810
nobody expected that the

644
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,690
the way the community would react to it

645
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,730
nobody expected the way Niantic would

646
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,340
and we didn't have anything in place to

647
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,990
deal with that and it was especially

648
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,300
seen especially when when the DBA

649
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,740
started going and pulling their queries

650
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,010
you know and you see that the the 78

651
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:01,700
second TTL you know we several hours are

652
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,340
initially wasted because we didn't

653
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,690
really even understand the data you know

654
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,600
so the those redactions they were

655
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,890
effective in delaying the response not

656
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,420
terribly effective but they were

657
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,680
effective they slowed things down and

658
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,000
they served the purpose they never

659
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,830
served their purpose fully we did figure

660
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:29,780
out the whistleblower was we could have

661
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,670
done more to segregate and segment

662
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:34,240
everything to limit the blast radius and

663
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,440
this is a big one

664
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,020
sticking 800 strangers in a slack and

665
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,570
then expecting them all to keep secrets

666
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,760
is a mistake

667
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,640
it's you know it's it's difficult to

668
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,770
keep tab 3 people keep secrets but to

669
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,690
have 800 that's a that's a big challenge

670
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,330
and to tie them in with all these

671
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,460
sources of data and to give them the

672
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,950
opportunity and stuff to use it I don't

673
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,340
necessarily think that was a mistake but

674
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,660
this is the challenge everybody always

675
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,520
has going forward as they work on

676
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,980
projects and stuff like this to do they

677
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,670
do they make it a big group and have the

678
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,320
potential of the information leaking out

679
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,870
and having a big negative reaction more

680
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:22,310
likely but the information is in more

681
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,140
people's hands and is more effective and

682
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,730
people are able to get out there and use

683
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,130
it better or do you keep it small and

684
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,040
tight and controlled and you don't have

685
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,010
as effective a use of that information

686
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:36,280
you not only see that in in video games

687
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,720
but you see that in industry and you see

688
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,640
that in government and stuff figuring

689
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,020
out the size of that pool of individuals

690
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,210
who should have access to what is always

691
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:52,650
a big part of the challenge so this

692
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,390
is actually near and dear to my heart if

693
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,090
I ever end up working on any sort of

694
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,950
project like this again this is really

695
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,360
important to me the the things that that

696
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,940
really helped us identify who the

697
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,850
whistleblower was turned out to be

698
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,350
little things that were on that screen

699
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:17,730
you know things you wouldn't expect you

700
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,860
go back and you look at the the green

701
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,340
tint on the box was one thing you look

702
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,950
at the menus and you look in two

703
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,620
different sets of menus and you look at

704
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,179
all that information and there's a lot

705
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,470
of ways that we could actually organize

706
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,200
that there's how many different shades

707
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,420
of green could we have played with you

708
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,210
know and knowing that we could have gone

709
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,070
back instantly and found out who it was

710
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,020
if we did a different shade of grey

711
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,260
green per individual

712
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,200
we could have formatted the menus

713
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,190
according to the user so that there'd be

714
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,940
a code in there you know and then a lot

715
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,900
of people have thought about other

716
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,510
things like can we slide in QR codes

717
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:01,320
into the background or or other ways

718
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,760
that we could actually figure that stuff

719
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,920
out in order to just make it so that we

720
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,630
know from those screenshots that this is

721
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,270
the unique person and the time and the

722
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:13,400
day that they are looking at this screen

723
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:19,700
if anybody out there is interested in

724
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,770
being a whistleblower I think it's

725
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,440
important for y'all to understand you

726
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,150
should take your own responsibility and

727
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,960
redact your own information

728
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,990
four days after everything got released

729
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:37,110
we ended up getting access to the clean

730
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,700
ingress chatroom where they had actually

731
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,300
planned all this and in there we made a

732
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,420
few discoveries first of all that top

733
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,600
image there is actually the screenshot

734
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,610
and you can see right here in that photo

735
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:53,179
does the URL have to be censored to and

736
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:56,070
should have been ok we'll pass that

737
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,910
along that was the moment where where

738
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,710
they tried they made that effort of

739
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,390
scribbling out that name but they didn't

740
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,670
cover just enough of it so that that

741
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,180
actually

742
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,600
just probably weeks in isolating who it

743
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,830
was and this goes back even more you

744
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,570
know this is more important especially

745
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,010
in this day and age for whistleblowers

746
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,570
and suffer becoming a bigger deal in

747
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:21,930
government when you look at the case of

748
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,240
reality winner what had happened to her

749
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,930
happened just a few weeks or months

750
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,840
before the whistleblower before the the

751
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,310
brokers Guild incident reality winner

752
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,010
was a contractor working for the for the

753
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,370
US government in intelligence and she

754
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,390
had printed out a whole bunch of

755
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,370
documents and she sent him off to a

756
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,490
journalist and the journalist published

757
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,340
them and they used a high enough

758
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,350
resolution scanner when they created the

759
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,570
PDF that the government was able to

760
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,210
arrest her later that day and the way

761
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,470
that they did it was they actually

762
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,720
zoomed in and they could see the little

763
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,000
hidden watermark on the printer from the

764
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,180
printer that said what printer it was

765
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,370
that invented it what day and time and

766
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,580
who it was who had issued the print job

767
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,170
and it's actually it's a very very

768
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,480
similar sort of situation in this case

769
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,270
she's relying on she's relying on that

770
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,070
journalist to understand exactly what

771
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,570
the capabilities are of the government

772
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,550
to hopefully you know redact this

773
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,680
information in a in a way that that she

774
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,860
doesn't get caught same way that the

775
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,510
whistleblower in the brokers Guild was

776
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,430
hoping that those guys would understand

777
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,620
exactly what they were up against and in

778
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:42,350
both cases they failed so finally

779
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,310
another subject near and dear to my

780
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:51,060
heart I the I have less of a problem

781
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,500
with people publishing the information

782
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,870
that they did then I do with the fact

783
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,190
that they published the list of names

784
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,530
and they basically put targets on 800

785
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,950
people's backs I can't understand

786
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:05,640
exactly why they did it the to be honest

787
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,860
the the actual released the information

788
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,360
would not have had the impact that it

789
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,540
had without those names without people

790
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,890
being able to look down that spreadsheet

791
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,320
and go and find the people that played

792
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,570
in their neighbors their their cities in

793
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,350
their states

794
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,840
and and be able to point a finger at

795
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,280
them and call them a dirty rotten

796
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,780
cheater it's happened to me several

797
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:31,740
times probably this week so for that

798
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,360
reason masking the names

799
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,060
like if they just wipe them out there's

800
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,780
no way that that was gonna work you know

801
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,210
the problem with hashes is if they've

802
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,990
gone through and even done md5 Psalms or

803
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,060
sha-256 psalms of all the names same

804
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,130
problem somebody that scraped the data

805
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,870
it's got a list of all the names of

806
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,790
everybody that plays ingress and they

807
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,900
would just run them through the same

808
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,630
hashes they'd identify I don't even

809
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,550
think it would take hours to get that

810
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:05,640
done so I kind of like the idea though

811
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,040
of if if you're ever in this situation

812
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,610
you guys want to do this ethically

813
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:15,000
bcrypt or I can never pronounce the

814
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,190
other one but anyway password hashes

815
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,469
write password hashes where you get to

816
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,480
actually set the difficulty of the

817
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,840
password hash you could actually set

818
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,820
that really high and make it so that for

819
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,260
them to test one name for them to go

820
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,870
through the entire list of 800 searching

821
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,400
for boy plankton it's gonna take them a

822
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,400
day right nobody is going to set up ten

823
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,810
thousand computers in order to go

824
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,370
through every ingress agents name ooh

825
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,670
within a couple weeks you know it means

826
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,659
that the people that are actually

827
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:44,699
high-profile agents and stuff that

828
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,080
played the game a lot made a lot of

829
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,489
enemies they're gonna get found pretty

830
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:50,550
quick but the low profile ones they're

831
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,080
gonna stay hidden an anonymous for

832
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,880
several weeks months years you know

833
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,980
tokens work tokens work for the same

834
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,370
reason that tokens work in in

835
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,440
credit-card industry and stuff and with

836
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,270
a token you just you just provide

837
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,650
another value and you've got a lookup

838
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,390
table somewhere you know they could have

839
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,820
provided that publicly and they could

840
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,230
have provided the lookup table deny

841
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,640
antics and my aunt I could have gone and

842
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,320
looked up and seen exactly who it was

843
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,650
that they had found the problem with

844
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,120
tokens is that tokens probably wouldn't

845
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,230
have had the impact that they were

846
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,880
looking for and a lot of this goes back

847
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,950
to marketing and PR campaigns and stuff

848
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:30,660
they really do want to to make a big

849
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,070
impact have people talking about the

850
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,200
and stuff and tokens doesn't give you

851
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,140
that that bang a little better than

852
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,600
tokens for that reason is symmetric

853
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,950
encryption it could have done the same

854
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:45,100
thing with AES 256 just ripped all the

855
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,110
way down the column sent the password

856
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,960
off to Niantic and then publish the list

857
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,950
Niantic could have gone looked it up any

858
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,200
day of the week and nobody would have

859
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,170
been the wiser so and I was a little

860
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,940
worried about this I talked pretty fast

861
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,660
when I get nervous

862
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:16,680
so anybody got any questions cool
