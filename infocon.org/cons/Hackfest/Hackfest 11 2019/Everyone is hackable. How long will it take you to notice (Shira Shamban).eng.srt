1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,460
hi everyone it's a pleasure to be here

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,370
today

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,230
before I get started I have one really

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,610
important thing to say

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,679
so I speak a tiny little bit of French

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,500
so I can you know buy coffee or ask for

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,190
directions but I've been going to some

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,230
some of the talks here in French as well

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,670
and I just have to say that

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,519
cybersecurity sounds so romantic in

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,269
French that really I enjoyed my time

12
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,039
even though I didn't understand anything

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,308
it felt wonderful so thank you so much

14
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,649
for doing this I'm like really excited

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,380
and now we're gonna talk about about the

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,570
cloud and about the fact that everyone's

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,149
hackable so a couple things about me

18
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,340
I'm Sheila I came all the way from

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,410
Israel I do cloud I do security I'm also

20
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,710
a member of the local OSP Israel chapter

21
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,289
I'm collating that chapter yay

22
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,600
I also saw your boot over here so it's

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,219
great to see that we are active

24
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,980
everywhere and also I'm a great

25
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,500
supporter of women in technology and

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,320
women in cybersecurity try to help

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,560
underrepresented communities doesn't

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,810
matter which to get into cybersecurity

29
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,610
because very often it looks like a very

30
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,580
you know male dominant thing obviously

31
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,460
look around you mostly men in the room

32
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,189
but we're trying to make a difference by

33
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,619
helping more people to get into this

34
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,430
this field so please support your you

35
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,270
know co-workers give them a hand help

36
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,009
them learn something new and encourage

37
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,470
them to you know to be better at what

38
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,240
they do it will also help you to be

39
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,180
better at what you do we came here to

40
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,340
talk about security and this is kind of

41
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,460
a diagram of what the old the good old

42
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,520
data center looked like back in the days

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,070
it was really easy to do security in the

44
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,710
on-prem days because all you had to do

45
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,829
is really to put some kind of device on

46
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,840
your way out to the internet it's called

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,229
a firewall and you felt really safe and

48
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,130
really good about it

49
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,500
all the security products we used to

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,979
have at that time had the word

51
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,780
prevention in them data leakage

52
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,920
prevention

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,100
you you were actually able to prevent

54
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,959
hacks from happening because you could

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,060
control everything that was coming in

56
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,250
and out of your data center and these

57
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,459
were very good and naive and happy days

58
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,060
but it's no longer happening that way we

59
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,190
don't know we can't do security by

60
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,740
prevention anymore or it's not enough

61
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,739
these days here's like a bunch of logos

62
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,200
of companies you're aware of you know of

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,230
you maybe use some of them and the

64
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,790
common ground of all of them is actually

65
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,100
that in the last couple of years all of

66
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,180
them had data breaches and as you

67
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,980
probably know these companies have

68
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,769
really really big security budget and

69
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,340
they can hire any security professional

70
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,860
they want and create any security

71
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,709
strategy they want and need and still it

72
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,430
happened to them now these are the

73
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,890
companies that we know of the companies

74
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,320
were who don't appear here even because

75
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,739
I didn't have enough space on the slide

76
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,290
some of the companies are unaware of the

77
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,269
fact that they've been hacked some of

78
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,269
them are being hacked as we speak some

79
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:29,630
of them are hacked not for the sake of

80
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,970
of their data some of them are hacked

81
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,299
because their competitors wants to know

82
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,370
something because they have to they have

83
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,930
to do something with critical

84
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,120
infrastructure of their camp of their

85
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,060
country and some you know criminal or

86
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,390
state-sponsored group wants to hack

87
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,160
their infrastructure for a different

88
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,350
reason so a lot of companies are not

89
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,850
here but that doesn't mean that they

90
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,549
were not hacked for the most likely they

91
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:57,900
have been hacked and they're just

92
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,860
unaware of that these days so as I said

93
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,530
prevention doesn't work anymore and we

94
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,239
need a new attitude when talking about

95
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,500
cloud security today when I talk to

96
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,299
cloud security professional I have to

97
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,489
this is what I feel like when I describe

98
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,238
my day-to-day life and how I do how I

99
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,579
plan security in the cloud today the

100
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,660
average enterprise has between 70 and 80

101
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,780
different security solutions means

102
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,400
that you know their security engineers

103
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,710
need a lot of screens open at any given

104
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,350
moment they have a lot of outputs and a

105
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,650
long queue of tickets they have to

106
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,320
address and even though they have so

107
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,780
many security products they still don't

108
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,000
feel safe they don't feel comfortable

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,940
they buy more products and their CEO

110
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,639
doesn't sleep well at night so why do we

111
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,470
keep on buying this product instead of

112
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,180
just thinking about a different way to

113
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,780
approach this problem and now the cloud

114
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,300
the cloud created us a new parameter

115
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,390
some would say but it definitely created

116
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,580
a lot of new buzzwords that you're all

117
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,310
aware of like server less and kubernetes

118
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,690
and containers but I say that the cloud

119
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,419
is not a new parameter the cloud created

120
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,780
a sub problem of no perimeter at all and

121
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,640
this is what I'm going to talk about

122
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,080
today I'm going to show you a few

123
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,570
examples of why we don't have a

124
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,940
parameter to protect anymore we are

125
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,430
losing it it's really vague it's really

126
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,620
foggy and there is no one simple way of

127
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,590
protecting our cloud infrastructure and

128
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,330
before I dive in I just want to remind

129
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,640
you if you're not using the cloud about

130
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,840
a shared responsibility model so if in

131
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,630
the past when in the good old datacenter

132
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,910
days you had your IT manager who was in

133
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,220
charge of IT no organization and if you

134
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,620
wanted a new server you had to be best

135
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,510
friends with them because it could take

136
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,570
months until you know you you place your

137
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,580
order and until it's coming in and until

138
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,440
it's installed it's gonna take months

139
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,789
until you have that server that you

140
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:10,590
wanted and they were the kings of IT you

141
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,690
really needed their help in order to do

142
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,450
something today it all shifted towards

143
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,400
the dev teams they run the own

144
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,770
infrastructure do they do security I

145
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,450
don't think so good job security for me

146
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,470
because they're just being really

147
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,720
irresponsible about how they do security

148
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,729
they care less about security and more

149
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:33,390
about delivering a new feature so if in

150
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,330
the past the world of the software and

151
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,490
the hardware were the part where it

152
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,070
still belonged to the IT manager today

153
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,400
Louis is in charge of the the bare

154
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,980
metals of the data center we don't care

155
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,230
about them anymore all I have to do is

156
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,050
just click and decide what kind of acid

157
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,150
do I want to spin what kind of operating

158
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,370
system do I want on it and basically

159
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:01,470
that's it it's that simple but we still

160
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,270
have a lot of responsibility about how

161
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,670
we configure these assets how do we

162
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,470
allow and not allow them to communicate

163
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,900
with the world sometimes we forget that

164
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,150
we just choose the default security

165
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,300
configuration coming with with AWS or as

166
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,430
your you know whichever cloud vendor you

167
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,220
prefer and yes it creates a lot of

168
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,550
problems to us let's talk about one of

169
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,790
them Identity and Access Management this

170
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,360
is our way of giving other users other

171
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,000
vendors other third parties a way to get

172
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,480
data or get resources out of our AWS

173
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,900
account it's really good and it's really

174
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,180
helpful but unfortunately a lot of

175
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:51,090
people do mistakes in there I am here is

176
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,360
just one example of users leaving API

177
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,650
keys in github sometimes we have reasons

178
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,000
to leave credentials in our code because

179
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,980
we need to for specific reasons but

180
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,170
these credentials should only give

181
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,990
access to very very very specific

182
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,090
resources according to what your

183
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,700
application needs it should definitely

184
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,830
not be credentials to your AWS account

185
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,670
but these things happen and then I talk

186
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,620
to users about it and they go to their

187
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,840
github and they change the code and they

188
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,450
remove the hard-coded credentials but

189
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,800
they forget that this is a repository

190
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,410
and I have older versions of your code

191
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,460
so they still have access to some of

192
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,620
your resources which you did not want to

193
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,469
give a other people access to so please

194
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,919
don't forget to change all the versions

195
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,970
as well other things that we have seen

196
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,240
is hard coding credentials again in

197
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,750
mobile apps and in this example

198
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,570
had users we had developers living

199
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,880
credentials that gave access to users

200
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,140
data so you you think that people don't

201
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,960
make these kind of mistakes but they do

202
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,240
so this is something you really need to

203
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,760
pay attention to let's talk about

204
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,910
storage services so in AWS we know we

205
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,690
all know the s3 buckets and if you log

206
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,810
in to shorten right now you're gonna see

207
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:28,140
a few a dot thousand dozens of you know

208
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,990
s3 buckets logged to the internet with

209
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,150
the public IP address and you can easily

210
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,210
see what kind of data they store but

211
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,270
there are plenty of other you know

212
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,700
storage services in AWS or in Azure blob

213
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,250
or you know whichever security vendor

214
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,560
you choose whichever cloud vendor you

215
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,320
choose and these mistakes still happen

216
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:58,410
in Amazon for example in a in Amazon in

217
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:04,050
this example we had so I forgot what

218
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,800
they want to say about this one but in

219
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,240
facebook they also used a third party in

220
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,839
Mexico who lost data of 400 million

221
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,570
users which probably means that they

222
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,750
have some of our data over there so

223
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,900
users very often make mistakes the data

224
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,150
I want to talk about before the example

225
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,560
was users under EBS leaving keys which

226
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,760
they forgot about enabling other users

227
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,580
to just log into their AWS account very

228
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,030
very easily with no problem at all

229
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,040
let's talk about compute power which is

230
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,580
also something very very exploitable in

231
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,470
the cloud we see a deny of wallet

232
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,170
attacks means someone is just using your

233
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,839
cloud to do whatever they want and

234
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,850
you're paying the bill one of the

235
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,040
examples is of course a crypto mining

236
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,930
which again you're paying the bill and

237
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,380
the hacker is is taking the Bitcoin or

238
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,450
whatever

239
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,060
their own pocket in the last couple

240
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,200
years we saw less ransomware attacks

241
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,320
because it required you know some

242
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,060
interaction between the attacker and the

243
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,900
account owner so in the in the in this

244
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,340
example there is no really

245
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,510
communication required I can just

246
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,600
install or spin up some really high GPU

247
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,480
assets mind my own Bitcoin mind my own

248
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,430
business and someone else is going to

249
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,900
pay the bill and if they don't pay

250
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,440
attention to their AWS bill they're not

251
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,240
gonna know that someone is abusing their

252
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,670
account of course this is also useful

253
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,130
for proxy attacks so I just want to use

254
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,190
someone else's infrastructure to hack

255
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,980
someone else and make it look like I had

256
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,080
nothing to do with it so again using

257
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,210
someone else's compute power it's very

258
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,240
good for that we saw one interesting

259
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,720
example with Tesla who had a kubernetes

260
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,960
cluster spinned up but they forgot to

261
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,810
put a password on their console so

262
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,940
someone was able to get access to one of

263
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,400
their containers the container had

264
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,640
credentials to other AWS account of

265
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,160
Tesla and the hacker was able to mine

266
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,170
lots of cryptocurrency that way another

267
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,260
good example and very important one is

268
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,990
using packages that are found online

269
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,690
it's really good and easy it's also

270
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,970
headache to update them afterwards maybe

271
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,570
to require some refactoring so in one

272
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,110
case we just saw in a node.js package

273
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,840
that in addition to what it was supposed

274
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,760
to be doing it was also looking for

275
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,320
wallets and just stole the coins that

276
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,480
were in those wallets this is what the

277
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,220
code was doing additionally of course

278
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,410
and then we recently saw a malware

279
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:09,530
called X boomer who is just using AWS

280
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,250
infrastructure in a no need to download

281
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,970
kind of kind of malware so yeah it's

282
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,730
happening all the time it's very easy

283
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,350
now I'd like to talk about a real

284
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,550
example

285
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,550
that actually happened recently to a

286
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,330
bank an American bank called Capital One

287
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,460
Capital One has a very very strong cloud

288
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,400
security team so again it's just another

289
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,760
one of those examples were it's not some

290
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,430
esoteric small organization who didn't

291
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,170
have the resources to protect their

292
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,360
cloud they had a very very strong team

293
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,090
to do that and still unfortunately it

294
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,670
happened to them as well so let's talk

295
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,010
about the stuff that we know what was

296
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,950
the damage it was caused so first of all

297
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,330
a user data of 100 million users or

298
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,880
potential customers because it also hurt

299
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,190
users who just asked for credit from the

300
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,370
bank even though they were denied so

301
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,920
their social security numbers names

302
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,070
addresses emails and so on everything

303
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:18,620
was leaked they had more victim victims

304
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:24,470
about 30 others including Europeans for

305
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:30,470
the the car manufacturer universities so

306
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,450
a lot of other other companies that were

307
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:38,089
hurt and crypto mining as well let's not

308
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:42,350
neglect that is the money option so in

309
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,820
addition to stealing the money the

310
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,339
hacker also installed some great crypto

311
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:51,950
mining machines on that account so let's

312
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,500
try to go over the steps as we

313
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,080
understand them to how this attack

314
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,330
actually happened of course we don't

315
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,850
have all the information about how it

316
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,370
happened there is some information

317
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,380
available online and some of it we just

318
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,140
had to kind of guess how would we do it

319
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,650
ourselves if we were the hackers so it

320
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,020
started with a scanner that was looking

321
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,120
for web servers that will were

322
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,370
vulnerable to SS RF attacks SS RF is a

323
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,460
server side request forgery

324
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,850
it means that I can in a in a certain

325
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,010
way it depends on the web server I can

326
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,010
get to the backend server and make it

327
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,930
make requests

328
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,720
that I actually told him to do so in

329
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,240
this case the hacker found a bunch of

330
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,570
web server that again were vulnerable in

331
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,270
the application layer to this kind of

332
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,149
attack and was able to create requests

333
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:54,410
by using that back-end server in this

334
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,830
example the the hacker made requests to

335
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,970
the metadata server service in AWS there

336
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,700
is a metadata service for every asset it

337
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,279
means that all the actions and all the

338
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,790
information about that asset live in

339
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,200
that server and you can actually make

340
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,630
requests like show me what kind of

341
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,640
credentials do we have or tell me the

342
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,560
last action that was taken on the server

343
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,190
and so on and this attack shows very

344
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,520
good understanding of how AWS works and

345
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,640
how it can be exploited

346
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,540
so the metadata service in this case the

347
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,220
hacker was able to ask for tokens now

348
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,260
it's really small so you can't see but

349
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,580
I'm going to show you a video in a

350
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,529
couple of minutes I we created a fake

351
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:48,500
web page just to try how this attack is

352
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,870
going to work and we made a request to

353
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,820
the metadata server it looks really

354
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,260
small but you can see the IP address

355
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,720
it's it's always the same IP address for

356
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,420
the metadata server because it's a it's

357
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,570
an internal IP address and then you can

358
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,420
see in the URL it says metadata and then

359
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,520
underneath you can see all the stuff you

360
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,209
can ask from the metadata service so you

361
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,189
can ask for credentials you can ask for

362
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:16,730
I am you can ask for IP addresses and so

363
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,400
on everything just appears here so the

364
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,410
next phase was obviously to ask for

365
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,920
credentials and you can see on the top

366
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,339
security credentials and we named our

367
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,860
credentials bedroll a wide s3 access

368
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,820
this was our role and we were able to

369
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,030
ask for a token with this with these

370
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,630
kind of credentials so you all you have

371
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,150
to write in the URL is security

372
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,600
credentials

373
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,090
and this is this is a token this is a

374
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,760
real token that you just copy-paste and

375
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,679
use for whatever you want to do so now

376
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,559
we have a token and we have access to

377
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:06,530
the AWS account so all we have to do is

378
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,010
list all the s3 buckets as the hacker

379
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,070
did and then sync them it means that we

380
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,380
download everything that the hacker had

381
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,220
that the s3 bucket has to the hackers

382
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,190
computer it's really that simple and of

383
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,690
course don't forget to install your

384
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,080
miners just in case so this is what

385
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,890
happened in this hack and could this

386
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:36,950
have been prevented or what should you

387
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,780
be doing to prevent this kind of attack

388
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,760
so first of all you need to know the

389
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,890
roles that you have in your account

390
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,050
because in this example a web server had

391
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,470
a role with access to all the s3 buckets

392
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,059
of the account instead of just having

393
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:53,330
access to the bucket that had JavaScript

394
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,480
code and the images that the web server

395
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,450
needed so know what kind of roles you

396
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,700
have and obviously don't give too broad

397
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,980
permissions if it's unnecessary the list

398
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,679
privilege principle of course don't give

399
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,679
to users or machines access they don't

400
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:15,260
need to areas in your application they

401
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,750
don't need it's it goes the same for

402
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,420
users who don't need access to the

403
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,700
production environment or to specific

404
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,950
databases in your production environment

405
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,510
monitor who is running commands and

406
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,150
where they do it from one of the things

407
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,480
we noticed while doing this research was

408
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,520
that first of all the hacker was using

409
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,140
tor and you know tor has their the nodes

410
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,550
available online so this is something

411
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,950
you can kind of hold the updated list of

412
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,429
of tor nodes and notice when someone is

413
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,830
using tor when they try to access your

414
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,800
application you might want to allow it

415
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,440
you might not and you might want to say

416
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,860
that ok I'm using tor by itself is not a

417
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,410
bad thing but if I see someone trying to

418
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,300
access

419
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,540
our AWS account from a tor IP address

420
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,030
then this is weird because my DevOps

421
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,520
engineers are not using tor or I don't

422
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,620
expect to see any token creation with

423
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,200
the Tor IP address so this is something

424
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,050
you can very very easily identify and

425
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,750
and prevent any further malicious

426
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,380
activity in your account and this is

427
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,810
what the log of this activity looked

428
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,810
like it's a real AWS log from Cloud

429
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,600
trail and in this case we were able to

430
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,280
see that where you see I and zero one

431
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,450
see this is the name of the machine that

432
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,040
the hacker was trying to get to of

433
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,990
course this is just a simulation that we

434
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,450
created it's not a real log from the

435
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,410
real hack but we see some kind of weird

436
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,380
string coming before and it means that

437
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,390
someone is trying to assume that troll

438
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,930
it's not the real machine trying to make

439
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,320
the action it's someone else assuming

440
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,170
the role of that machine so again you

441
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,660
have all the data in your logs you just

442
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,270
need to know what you're looking for and

443
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,030
as we as you can see we I talked about

444
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,000
the bed roll with why s3 access you can

445
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,330
see that this is the role that was used

446
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:33,620
in this activity and then I can the log

447
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,780
is very big so I just split it into two

448
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,510
parts so in this part I can see the IP

449
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,560
address that that the hacker was trying

450
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,620
to work from and then I see that it was

451
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:50,780
using Kali again you need to know your

452
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,480
developers and I assume most of them are

453
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,260
not using Kali for no real reason and I

454
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,680
see that there was the CLI activity AWS

455
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,880
CLI and I don't think that most of you

456
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,570
are using Kali to make CLI actions with

457
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,030
your AWS account so again this data is

458
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,120
in your AWS logs so it's very easy to

459
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,360
create a rule asking to see

460
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,000
any action that was made with the CLI

461
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,270
with Kali and to monitor that either

462
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,640
these actions don't happen or that

463
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,460
you're well aware if they do and you go

464
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,200
ask that user what hell are you doing so

465
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,920
very very easily detectable now I will

466
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,590
show you short let's see if the video is

467
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,340
going to work this is our simulation of

468
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:49,610
how the attack happened this is as show

469
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,490
showing that we have no access to an s3

470
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,850
bucket we try to log in and we have no

471
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,030
access to it just proving that we are

472
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,330
not cheating in this demo and then we

473
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,250
went to the app where I showed you

474
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:09,260
screenshots before and you can just it's

475
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,850
kind of a web book that shows what we

476
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,950
can what with what kind of answers we

477
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:21,590
can get from it and now we go to the

478
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,100
meta data service and we see all the

479
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,490
things we can ask from this service so

480
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:41,559
we're gonna go for I am and we have a

481
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:47,330
bedroll credentials over here so we ask

482
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,250
for them and we're gonna get the tokens

483
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,910
of the bedroll this is the token and it

484
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,059
has a time to live we copy paste it and

485
00:23:56,059 --> 00:24:01,820
we go to our cali machine to use it we

486
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,110
just wrote a short script to you know

487
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,230
kind of create the token to be useful

488
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,179
for us we didn't manipulate it in any

489
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:19,299
way we just put it in a txt file and

490
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:22,840
we're gonna run it

491
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,200
and we're gonna go to the s3 bucket and

492
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,960
we see that we have access to all the

493
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,600
buckets and we have a sensitive bucket

494
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,290
of data

495
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,090
so obviously it's well it's going to be

496
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,129
the first one we try to we try to get to

497
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,710
now we try with credentials and we have

498
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,779
a secret dot txt file so this is how how

499
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:09,250
we did it and it's something that all of

500
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,010
you can do at home in your AWS account

501
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:19,809
of course now before coming to this

502
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,640
conference I was told that listen since

503
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,740
this conference is in Canada how about

504
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,059
if you talk about an incident that

505
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:27,820
happened in Canada so like okay let's

506
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,890
see what happened in Canada and I heard

507
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:33,760
about a bank bank I called the Sheldon I

508
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,730
hope I'm pronouncing it correctly

509
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:39,190
originally from Quebec and actually one

510
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,409
of the biggest financial institutes in

511
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:44,850
North America so it's a pretty big bank

512
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,279
and just in June we heard that it was

513
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:51,610
hacked and the data of 2.8 million

514
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,360
people was stolen and also about a

515
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,070
hundred and seventy three thousand

516
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,890
businesses were affected by it and now

517
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,649
we see this number 2.8 million it looks

518
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:05,230
nothing compared to the 100 million in

519
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,100
the u.s. but I think that it's almost 10

520
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,830
percent of the Canadian citizens or

521
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,020
something like this so here this number

522
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:19,029
means a lot and once again Social

523
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:21,909
Security numbers names addresses and so

524
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:26,049
on were stolen by this hacker that acted

525
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:28,000
completely differently from the hacker

526
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,470
that we saw in the capital one incident

527
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,240
what happened here so as I said before

528
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,690
this was publicly published in June of

529
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,539
2019 but the whole thing actually

530
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:44,529
started in December of 2018 when the

531
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:48,490
bank notices unusual transactions now I

532
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,250
couldn't find information about what

533
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,250
kind of unusual transactions were

534
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,850
detected but they were unusual enough so

535
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,350
that the bank would approach the police

536
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:02,590
and ask this to be investigated and it

537
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,460
was investigated

538
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,130
six months later May of 2019

539
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:13,330
the police notifies the bank that some

540
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,539
of their customers data was found in the

541
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:19,390
wild so it means that the data was

542
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,940
already exfiltrated and the hacker was

543
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,250
maybe trying to sell it or just to

544
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,700
spread it around and then we all heard

545
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,169
about it in June so this means that it

546
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:34,539
took the bank a very very very long time

547
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:38,590
to notify its users that something bad

548
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,340
is going on here and this is actually a

549
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,679
question for four people from the bank

550
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:46,840
like why would you notify your users

551
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,299
that late why didn't you ask them to

552
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:52,240
rotate passwords before it means they

553
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,080
put a lot of people at risk for a very

554
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,820
long time now we don't know exactly how

555
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,710
this thing happened but in this case

556
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,419
there was probably very good social

557
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:07,539
engineering because that employee the

558
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:09,490
hacker was actually an employee of the

559
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,890
bank until he was fired because of what

560
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,909
he did so he gained the trust of his

561
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:19,240
fellow co-workers and for some reason

562
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,659
they gave him their permissions and then

563
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,370
he was using everyone's and his

564
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,909
permissions to steal data and

565
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:30,309
exfiltrated and actually the police

566
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:33,100
found out that he was involved with

567
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,830
different crime groups trying to sell

568
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:39,280
this data to including street gangs and

569
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,820
also international syndicates so he was

570
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,130
really trying from every direction to

571
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,320
sell this data and this is probably how

572
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,840
the police found out about it and about

573
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,500
the data that was exfiltrated so to sum

574
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,780
up what we talked about today if the

575
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,299
best ones are hackable it means that all

576
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:04,510
of us are no matter how hard we try no

577
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,700
matter how many security products we buy

578
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,490
no matter how many people we hire on our

579
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,370
security team we are all hackable at

580
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,809
some point it's going to happen to us

581
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:16,330
and we have to be prepared and to have a

582
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:19,840
good reaction plan to detect it as fast

583
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,220
as possible

584
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,710
the detection and contamination time is

585
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,920
too long today

586
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,340
recently IBM published their date cost

587
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,150
of data breach survey and said that on

588
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,520
average it takes two hundred and seventy

589
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,060
nine days to detect and contaminate a

590
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,120
data breach so this is almost a year

591
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,640
it's a very very very long time a long

592
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,970
time for a damage to be created you

593
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,740
don't want to wait six months before you

594
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,050
notify your users you want to detect it

595
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:57,380
as soon as the token is stolen from your

596
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,900
web server then you cancel the token and

597
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,270
then you understand how it was even

598
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,160
stolen from your web server you do not

599
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,940
wait until the s3 buckets are listed and

600
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,860
all the data is stolen from them faster

601
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,590
detection can save you from very very

602
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,850
massive damage and don't forget that and

603
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,830
use your logs like the cloud trail I

604
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,590
showed you before to detect faster

605
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,870
unusual events it's not that hard you

606
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,410
don't need fancy machine learning

607
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,690
algorithms I showed you the log the data

608
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,120
is there the roll is there you can see

609
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,190
that an unusual IP address is using a

610
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:40,880
roll that is very very wide you can very

611
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,190
easily see that and you don't need this

612
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:47,810
really fancy fancy products how are you

613
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,660
going to detect so log I showed you the

614
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,610
cloud trail you have the flow logs you

615
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,890
have many other logs that your security

616
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,880
products and your IT is providing so

617
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,740
keep them and keep them in a place where

618
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,540
they're accessible to you don't just

619
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,330
dump them in an s3 bucket and forget

620
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,370
about them because in the day you will

621
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,320
need them it will be very hard to

622
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,820
extract them and then use them again

623
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,380
look for anomalies as I mentioned before

624
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,720
it's really easy you don't need the

625
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,450
really fancy algorithm is you know who

626
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,460
your users are you know usually at what

627
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,280
times do they work and you know freight

628
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,290
user pretty much what roles do they need

629
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:30,500
so if one day they request for a broad

630
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,410
role you're gonna know that yeah maybe

631
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,929
someone is working from home on a

632
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:38,539
you project but also maybe someone is

633
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:43,869
using that users credentials priorities

634
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:46,610
it's very hard all of these products

635
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,980
create a lot of tickets for us to handle

636
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,799
and you need to prioritize as security

637
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:53,840
professionals you know that the tokens

638
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,809
are very important to hand us and with

639
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:58,700
handling we don't want them to be abused

640
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,149
I'm not saying that patching machines is

641
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:04,340
not important it's also very important

642
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,889
but my guess is that each and every one

643
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:09,340
of you has dozens of machines with

644
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,009
hundreds of patches needed needs to be

645
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:16,190
that needs to be installed so prioritize

646
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:20,029
don't neglect that but we need to decide

647
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:22,279
according to each organization what is

648
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:26,480
more dangerous to you and the last thing

649
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,639
is automatic response if possible the

650
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:34,070
credentials example that I mentioned yes

651
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,499
if you will create a rule that if

652
00:32:36,499 --> 00:32:40,100
someone is requesting for a token using

653
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,509
a tor node you will stop the session I

654
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:47,570
don't think it will create a damage to

655
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,820
your production environment so I think

656
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,519
it's okay to create an automation that

657
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:58,039
if this happens delete this token or do

658
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:01,039
something like invoke this user or do

659
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,220
something like that you can automate the

660
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,200
really dangerous activities that are

661
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,490
happening in your account because I

662
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,850
expect that they happen very rarely you

663
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,279
can also automate the very the things

664
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,619
that happen 20 times a day and you also

665
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,950
always respond in the same way this is

666
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,720
also very easy to automate and this will

667
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,240
save you a lot of time and leave you

668
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,460
enough time to handle the really serious

669
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,259
and unusual events that happen in your

670
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:31,460
account that's it thank you very much

671
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,899
because it's my pleasure to be here

672
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,600
and they think we have time for

673
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,910
questions so I can take them here or

674
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,809
outside
