1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,520
hey everyone

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,480
welcome to uh our singing english talk

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,280
of the day

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,519
uh we will be talking about ibm power

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,759
system and ibm ios

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,720
the historian security uh sorry for the

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,920
little delay but

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,160
things happen and we're going to start

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,080
this with amit shah

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,279
from red cannery hey good afternoon

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,000
everyone

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,640
i hope you're all enjoying ihack my name

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,599
is ahmed

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,399
and i'm a security analyst at red canary

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,680
and we're based in

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,719
ottawa so as patrick mentioned i'll

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,760
be talking about ibm power systems and

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,800
ibm ios history and security next slide

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,038
please

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,559
uh so i'll be covering why customers are

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,840
using ibm power systems in ibm i

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,600
and what is it exactly um the history

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
uh and and how the systems have

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,920
the platforms have evolved uh security

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,240
hardening issues to be aware of

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,360
and uh challenges in doing research and

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,119
resources that you can use

28
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,240
to do your own research so i'm going to

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,799
apologize in advance because

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,000
a lot of the terminology it might get

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,159
confusing so when i refer to ibm i i'm

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,040
referring to

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,720
the operating system if i refer to

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,000
power system i'm referring to the server

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,560
and if i refer to just power cpu or

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,280
power

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,000
it's referring to the cpu that's inside

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,680
the power system

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,079
it it can get a little confusing uh

40
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,000
you'll see in the history

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,200
um how the branding issue uh how

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,159
branding was

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,240
done uh throughout the history of the of

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,079
the platform and

45
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,799
where it was and where it is today uh

46
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,680
next slide please

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,920
uh yes so why are customers choosing

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,360
uh ibm power systems with ibm

49
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,680
ios so the ibm i os is a proprietary

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,760
os for ibm powers uh it's

51
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,000
using an ibm power cpu this cpu is not

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,599
an x86

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,239
instruction set where they intended to

54
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,120
have

55
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,599
uh windows uh be used as an operating

56
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,560
system or

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,239
ubuntu so why is this niche product

58
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,360
uh used in a lot of fortune

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,599
uh 100 companies and also small

60
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,120
small businesses who are actively

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,640
trying to maintain their system um

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,080
in a world where x86 is widely adopted

63
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,680
and windows is available and ubuntu is

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,720
widely available as well so if you look

65
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,560
at some of the companies

66
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,319
that are using it and some of the early

67
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,640
adopters these are companies

68
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,280
that existed for a very long time some

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,360
of these companies have existed since

70
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,640
the 1800s and if you could imagine a

71
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,519
company that

72
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,280
is uh that's uh quite old

73
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,000
uh how often they had to do

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,560
infrastructure updates

75
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,040
such a upgrade to the latest greatest

76
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,680
hardware

77
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,840
latest greatest uh operating systems

78
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
so it was kind of a fun experiment this

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
morning i just took the windows

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,799
executable

81
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,120
uh from a minesweeper from windows 3.1

82
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,040
and i threw it into windows 10 to see if

83
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,319
it would work and

84
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,599
and it doesn't there is a

85
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,319
reverse compatibility but i saw up to

86
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,680
probably 1995.

87
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,840
so if you look at these companies that

88
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,680
are running a lot of these

89
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,360
legacy applications um

90
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,720
they are looking to have a platform

91
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
where something that was probably

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,120
written uh 30 years ago

93
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
by someone who's probably retired or

94
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,640
not available anymore no longer with the

95
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,680
company

96
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,959
uh sorry can you go one slide back

97
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,759
uh yeah no longer at the company um

98
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,320
there they can't make any updates have

99
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,479
these legacy applications uh

100
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,680
run uh in in

101
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,160
current modern day times and have it

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,360
running

103
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,720
um with little uh influence to

104
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,600
their operations when it comes to doing

105
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,000
uh

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,560
migration activities of updating their

107
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,759
hardware

108
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,880
infrastructure um

109
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,800
so with the ibm power system and idmi

110
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,320
and the legacy of the as400

111
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,080
one of the i believe the selling points

112
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,160
that customers that goes towards

113
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,960
customers is

114
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,000
the low cost of migration towards

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,960
the latest greatest another reason

116
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,320
customers might be looking

117
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,000
to using these niche systems is

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,560
their high level of uh high level of

119
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,520
insurance

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,160
so they advertise the 99.99

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,520
nine uh a percentage uptime which is

122
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
uh in one year probably five percent uh

123
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,120
five minutes

124
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,240
of unplanned downtime for a single node

125
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,639
and the

126
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,199
this is not considering you know having

127
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,800
um

128
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
kind of a dual node system

129
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,280
um so one of the

130
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
selling points is switching from a

131
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,759
primary system to a secondary system in

132
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,840
just a matter of seconds

133
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,400
and one of the testaments to how

134
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,840
resilient

135
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,280
their their cpus are is their cpus are

136
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,880
used in a lot of nasa missions the cpus

137
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,360
are not

138
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,759
necessarily the ones that are taken

139
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,199
commercially off the shelf

140
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,720
they're really uh hardened

141
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,360
but it kind of speaks to the importance

142
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,720
of uh

143
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,840
you know if you send a probe to mars

144
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,360
there's no technician that's going to be

145
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,840
able to be there to repair it or

146
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,720
boot it up so high assurance is very

147
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,840
important

148
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,840
uh next slide please

149
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,880
so now we'll be kind of going through um

150
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,560
the history and evolution

151
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,720
of the platform so as i mentioned in the

152
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,560
previous slide

153
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,199
uh legacy support plays a very important

154
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,000
role

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,960
into why customers continue to use the

156
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,440
platform

157
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,639
so if you look at the predecessor system

158
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,840
so back in the late

159
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,400
70s and early 80s there was a system 38

160
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,599
and the system 36 and

161
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,080
the primary languages at this time were

162
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,199
rgp

163
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,280
rgp and cobalt and the system 38 had a

164
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,080
flat

165
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,000
file system base which means that there

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,199
was no

167
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,680
directory hierarchy uh file names and

168
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,039
the system had to be

169
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,080
all unique uh so another interesting

170
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
thing about the system 38 was it was

171
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,280
using a single

172
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
uh level storage system where the

173
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,039
pointer

174
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,919
between memory and the hard drive was

175
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,360
shared

176
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
so eventually these both both of these

177
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,319
systems the 38 and 36

178
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,599
came to came to merge to

179
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,639
create the as400

180
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,000
and at this point in time c became

181
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,360
a very popular uh language

182
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,160
so one of the things that um noticed in

183
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,919
the history of kind of researching the

184
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,280
history of this

185
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,960
is that not only are they looking to

186
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,280
support kind of legacy programs but

187
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,879
they're looking to make sure that the

188
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,680
system

189
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,800
um is kept kind of up to speed speed

190
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,440
with um what the market demands

191
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,639
so c plus plus is very popular so they

192
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,360
added c

193
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,400
plus plus into the system uh from there

194
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,520
on

195
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,560
it went from as400 the branding to

196
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,599
ibm i series was what the hardware is

197
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,800
called

198
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,240
uh and now it's uh power systems

199
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,120
and when it comes to doing research it

200
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,960
can be kind of difficult because they're

201
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,560
if you're doing it for the first time

202
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,479
like there's something called the i

203
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,280
series but there's also the ibm i

204
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,360
which is the operating system it's not

205
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,039
your ios

206
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,559
on your but mac phone yeah it's so

207
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,440
paying attention to to the branding

208
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,479
that's being used is quite important

209
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,240
um so today uh the platform is using a

210
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,120
lot of modern

211
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,320
uh languages such as python ruby and

212
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,440
node and

213
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,640
uh r and kind of ours suggests that uh

214
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,080
it's used a lot in research uh so you

215
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,800
see at the top

216
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,959
at the top right of the picture uh what

217
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,480
the uh

218
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,240
the old system 3836 probably looked like

219
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,600
in the middle is what the uh

220
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
the uh green quote unquote the green

221
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,360
screen the terminal kind of looking

222
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,560
access

223
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,080
and at the bottom uh is uh kind of if we

224
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,399
are looking to buy a system on ebay how

225
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,399
much they can kind of go for i'll go

226
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,040
into that

227
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,480
uh later next slide please

228
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
so i'll be going through kind of

229
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,800
security hardening issues

230
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,959
uh to be aware of uh next slide

231
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,160
uh so this is something i just noticed

232
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,200
uh

233
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,720
recently in in one of the

234
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,120
portals that i have access to so this

235
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,000
this is a

236
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,040
website for a very big company

237
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,480
managing probably billions of dollars in

238
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,519
assets

239
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,680
but something that stands out is they

240
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,040
have uh

241
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,399
an unusual password policy from

242
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,839
eight to 10 characters

243
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,240
and this is something kind of reminds me

244
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,760
of something existed

245
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,079
in in the 90s but in this particular

246
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,200
platform in 2021

247
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
they have this unusual password

248
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
requirement

249
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,040
um next slide please

250
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,880
uh so on the right uh is is

251
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,959
it's just something i kind of noticed

252
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,399
when i was doing the research that

253
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,959
this platform could be i i don't know

254
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,040
but it could be using

255
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,320
an as400 uh type platform in the

256
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,680
background

257
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,200
um with a password level zero

258
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,160
so the as400 has uh four different

259
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
password levels and level zero is the

260
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,519
lowest

261
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,000
and with that uh you know the password

262
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,800
level zero

263
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,839
has you know a maximum of uh 10

264
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,279
characters

265
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,120
and with the what you see on the right

266
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,200
is um

267
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,880
uh one way to access uh

268
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,680
uh administrative functions for the

269
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,920
platform so this is the web interface

270
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,680
what the web interface looks like

271
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,440
for uh the password level uh next slides

272
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,880
please uh

273
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,560
the ibm power system with ibm iaos has

274
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
multiple ways you can do administrative

275
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,680
activities

276
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,920
so we just looked at one of them was

277
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
kind of the web

278
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,800
the the other approach is using um it's

279
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,839
kind of old school

280
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,440
quote unquote green screen which is a

281
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,480
terminal access and this says using

282
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,000
a something called a terminal emulator

283
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,959
to connect over a telnet port

284
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,519
so here if you look at that green dot

285
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,120
i'm running a

286
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,279
command to display cisval

287
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,399
and password level of of the system

288
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,160
so this is my uh my own system that

289
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,839
i'm using next slide please

290
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,519
uh so in in here you can kind of see

291
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,519
uh kind of a different way of looking at

292
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,279
that same password level

293
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,519
zero till you won't see uh three

294
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,279
but if you go to more you'll see the

295
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,920
other the other password level

296
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,439
um so next slide please

297
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,760
so yeah one signatures of a poor

298
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,040
low level password level being used is

299
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,639
you know a maximum of 10 10 characters

300
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,839
uh something else that is interesting is

301
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,240
uh there's no password there's no case

302
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,680
sensitivity

303
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,560
so if you um say you're sending a

304
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,800
password with uppercase

305
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,480
you can log in with lowercase um

306
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,680
and and uh most likely the reason why

307
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,120
they have this maximum length is uh

308
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,160
for legacy supporting of

309
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,920
um you know way back

310
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,240
when when systems that were very tight

311
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,079
on memory

312
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,839
uh next slide please

313
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,920
uh so another thing to look at um

314
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,440
if you're looking at a ibm as400 type

315
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,639
system

316
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,880
is the amount of online services that

317
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,480
are available so if you do

318
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,920
an nmap scan on on the machine

319
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,639
uh you'll probably come across a lot of

320
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,839
a lot of ports

321
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,079
and some and some of them kind of seem

322
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,600
to be duplicate

323
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,040
of the same services but one is open and

324
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,480
insecure the other one is

325
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,399
uh secure um so in the first

326
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,760
port uh port 2001

327
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,800
that is so as i mentioned before

328
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,639
there's many different ways to do

329
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,000
administrative

330
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,199
functions with the platform so 2001 is

331
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,040
an insecure port

332
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,480
access to to the website to do your

333
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,399
administrative functions

334
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,600
um to and

335
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,440
some of these things will show the

336
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,800
secure

337
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,639
ports that you can do the exact same

338
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,839
functions but one is

339
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,240
secure and insecure so this is kind of

340
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,360
highlighting that

341
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,519
if you do kind of an nmap scan you're

342
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,560
going to see a lot of

343
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,000
uh services and um

344
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,120
it's a good idea to evaluate each one

345
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,040
lock them down to make sure the um

346
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,240
the the threat landscape is is reduced

347
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,440
uh next slide please

348
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,279
yeah so when you if you do a scan and

349
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,440
you'll probably encounter a lot of

350
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,959
service ports

351
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,959
that are not encrypted

352
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,240
so you might have a case where you

353
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,240
create a new user

354
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,760
but you think the new user is

355
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,760
a low privileged user but

356
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,880
but it was an observed like what what do

357
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,320
they have access to

358
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,199
so if you create a new user where you're

359
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,120
intending that they only have access to

360
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,610
that green screen

361
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,720
[Music]

362
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
by creating that user new user by

363
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,279
default they might also have access to

364
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,639
port 21 and

365
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,839
port to the administrative console

366
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,160
where you know all you want them to do

367
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
is access the green screen to update a

368
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,959
timesheet

369
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,240
or or something like that

370
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,680
so with insecure ports uh you you know

371
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,519
this uh with the screen capture you see

372
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,440
there is an example of running running

373
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,360
wireshark

374
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,680
capturing credentials for data in

375
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,560
transit

376
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,800
and with an insecure data transmission

377
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,720
you can apply man in the middle

378
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,000
techniques

379
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,440
so it's good to lock down um or

380
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,399
close down your your insecure ports um

381
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:12,800
like

382
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,240
like likely the secure ports are

383
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:23,839
are already open uh next slide please

384
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,079
uh so as mentioned before um

385
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,959
the uh administrator you can there's

386
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,240
multiple ways to do

387
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,680
administrative functions and if you

388
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,839
have a what you think is a low

389
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:38,880
privileged user

390
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,720
that you think is only supposed to have

391
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
access to the green screen

392
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,240
uh they might also have access to ftp

393
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
um what's unique about ftp in uh

394
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,880
the as400 is that you can

395
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,519
not only download upload files traverse

396
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,680
the file system but you can also

397
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,680
run remote commands through ftp

398
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,000
another way to do administrative

399
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,039
functions is through

400
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,799
powershell um through the rnt

401
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,720
cmd command and one interesting thing is

402
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,240
let's say the user has access to

403
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,039
ssh they log they're able to log into

404
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,280
the system

405
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,720
and for whatever reason you can

406
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,839
traverse the entire file system

407
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,919
or certain or only certain parts of the

408
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,360
file system

409
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,919
uh one thing that could be done is uh in

410
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,120
the home directory

411
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,039
if you create a username

412
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,360
a new directory of the username of an

413
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,520
existing user

414
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,559
and create a dot profile file you can

415
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,600
add a script in there

416
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,640
that if that user logs in

417
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,360
that script will execute on their login

418
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,880
um like i said the threads landscape can

419
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,400
be very big

420
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,919
uh make sure that you're locking down

421
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,919
your services and ports

422
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,760
because there can be occasions where

423
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
what you think is a low privileged user

424
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,559
will be able to get access to not only

425
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:12,880
that

426
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,520
management console maybe they can get

427
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,360
access to it but they won't be able to

428
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,160
do anything

429
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,160
uh any kind of write operations with it

430
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,440
uh but they'll probably also have access

431
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,080
to

432
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,520
the db2 database and

433
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,039
if they have access to the db2 database

434
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,679
there could be restrictions on uh

435
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,640
permissions on

436
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,160
inside the tables but there could be

437
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,400
relaxed permissions for some of the

438
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
elements in the table where they're

439
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,120
defined as public next slide please

440
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,280
one interesting tool that was created by

441
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,960
uh bert coulash

442
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,160
as uh pack 400 it's available

443
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,360
on github uh so what this tool can be

444
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,360
used is to attempt uh privilege

445
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,960
escalation

446
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,880
so the user qsec ofr

447
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,200
you can consider this to be equivalent

448
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,840
as root this is the

449
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,960
maximum super administrator of

450
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,240
the as400 system so he

451
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,080
had the experience where if you have um

452
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,480
an older system uh i think this worked

453
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,080
with version

454
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,320
ibm i version 7.2

455
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,080
uh if you attempt to privilege escalate

456
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,039
you put in the user username that you

457
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,280
think is the lowest privilege user you

458
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,240
simply click on you log in click on the

459
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,640
user that you want to escalate

460
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,919
and that's it you press a button uh it's

461
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,679
any tool has a nice gui

462
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,400
very uh easy to use uh there's a lot of

463
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,200
interesting other interesting tools

464
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,799
in uh arts uh

465
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,320
github that can do uh scans

466
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,080
but this is a based i believe on an

467
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,400
exploit or a vulnerability he found in

468
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,440
profile handling next slide please

469
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,000
so next is challenges in

470
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,080
research um

471
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,600
so uh next slide please

472
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,280
uh so some of the challenges in research

473
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,400
like uh

474
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,919
it's it's the complexity of domain um

475
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,159
you know there's not as much stack

476
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,360
overflow

477
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,000
uh entries as there would be for you

478
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,400
know

479
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,320
linux or windows it's also a different

480
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,280
domain from

481
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,880
x86 and windows it's it's different

482
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,360
it's a different mindset of looking at

483
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,720
things

484
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,240
and there's also with that usage of

485
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,799
old or different terminology versus new

486
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,240
terminology

487
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,039
uh like the usage of lpar is that

488
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,320
equivalent to

489
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,399
virtual machine um

490
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,520
or um the concept of files so

491
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,919
it's take for granted that you know when

492
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,159
we think of something in it

493
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,000
a directory it's a file but looking at

494
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,200
terminology it was

495
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,200
used way back it's considered object

496
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,720
um if you want to get access

497
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,840
to a an ibm i system

498
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,919
uh an ibm i os platform

499
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,200
it it has kind of a complex

500
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,360
license scheme licensing scheme so it's

501
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,280
not straightforward

502
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,440
as uh you know you buy the operating

503
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,559
system and

504
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,559
you have free rein on it you you might

505
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,280
have to deal with entitlements such as

506
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,159
well

507
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,720
does the license entitle you to how many

508
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,360
cores

509
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,280
does the license entitle you to how many

510
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,200
concurrent users

511
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,400
however there are uh available resources

512
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,320
despite there's no

513
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,559
as far as i'm aware of kind of open

514
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,000
source uh

515
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,080
tools or something freely available that

516
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,440
you can use

517
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,280
there's something called pub 400

518
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,960
com so these guys are great uh they set

519
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,200
up

520
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,559
a a idmi server

521
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,679
that people have free access to you sign

522
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,360
up for an account

523
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,000
and uh you can go into the system you

524
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,400
can

525
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,640
create scripts run programs however you

526
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,440
won't have

527
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,000
access to administrative functions

528
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,360
so that company does have paid for

529
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,400
version where they host ibm i

530
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,320
at cost um one interesting thing is if

531
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,520
you want to

532
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,159
uh buy your own physical hardware with

533
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,320
the ibm ios

534
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,240
so this is an example of just looking on

535
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,840
ebay

536
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,760
for right now ibm is at version 7.4 this

537
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,240
is for

538
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,159
version 7.1 which has the look and feel

539
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,440
of uh of the most modern um os

540
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,360
iteration um so

541
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,960
this particular one it has the

542
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,559
entitlement for apparently

543
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,280
unlimited users i just kind of shopped

544
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,400
around on

545
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,600
kijiji and uh it's kind of interesting

546
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,120
that

547
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,919
they will advertise uh somebody will

548
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,559
advertise that they have an as400 or ibm

549
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:38,880
i

550
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,640
or an i system or whatever

551
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,039
um but if you try to ask what what are

552
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,039
the entitlements and so on and so forth

553
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,360
they might not know or have an

554
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,400
understanding of what

555
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,159
what they're selling it's it's mainly

556
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,760
because um

557
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,799
these systems were probably bought from

558
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,600
an auction or

559
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,799
some something at wholesale and they're

560
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,000
not entirely sure what

561
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,279
it is uh so something that's interesting

562
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,000
is it doesn't

563
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,720
really come with a vga port or reports

564
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,679
for

565
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,480
you can hook up a monitor and click away

566
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,320
and access you you would have to know

567
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,679
what ports to access and um

568
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,960
you know to access online and all that

569
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,240
kind of stuff

570
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,440
um so it's kind of like buyer beware

571
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,279
if you ask questions that's not unusual

572
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,799
that the person that's selling the

573
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,480
system knows entirely

574
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,520
entirely what their what they're selling

575
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,279
but there are companies out there that

576
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,799
do sell

577
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,520
second hands second hand hardware and

578
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,200
with idmi

579
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,840
that will know uh next slide please

580
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,320
uh so one one approach uh to doing

581
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,120
research is

582
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,240
uh over the cloud uh so this

583
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,840
is uh what i'm using is um a a cloud

584
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,720
instance of um

585
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,159
ibm i over um a virtualized power system

586
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,760
uh so the uh the cost

587
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,960
uh is calculated to be uh

588
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,200
low like if you were to leave if you

589
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,960
were have a pay as you go account

590
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,799
and leave your instance on for about a

591
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,039
month now that cost is probably about

592
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,240
500

593
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,279
dollars in one month so just

594
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,640
pay attention to if you're if you still

595
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,799
have your instance open uh just shutting

596
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,480
it down

597
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,520
um but it's uh it's a quick way

598
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,720
uh to do some validation and testing and

599
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,799
uh and experiment with uh the ivmi

600
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,120
uh the one interesting thing is i didn't

601
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,720
see the latest greatest

602
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,799
version um which is version 7.4 and we

603
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,200
saw

604
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,760
seven point four uh three it can be

605
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
virtualized

606
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,480
uh some other interesting things that

607
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,760
can probably be

608
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,520
that would be of interest in terms of

609
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,960
research

610
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,000
is uh ibm i i think version

611
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,080
7.2 is using smb version one

612
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,799
so that might be an opportunity to do

613
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,919
research into

614
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,120
um into uh smb

615
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,799
vulnerabilities uh using in packet

616
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,600
um another thing to look into when it

617
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,240
comes to

618
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,320
uh probably contributing to the

619
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,000
community is uh

620
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,120
uh probably extending uh bert kulash's

621
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,520
uh

622
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,039
hack 400 tool so as i mentioned

623
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,279
the tool has kind of a one of the tools

624
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,720
he has a

625
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,120
as kind of a scanning tool to look at

626
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,240
vulnerabilities

627
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,320
in inside the as400 so one opportunity

628
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,080
to look at is probably extending that

629
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,520
tool

630
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,320
next slide please

631
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,960
uh yeah so another thing to be aware of

632
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,200
is the difference between a mid frame

633
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,880
and a mid range

634
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,320
um so if you're looking at a as400 it's

635
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,799
not

636
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,279
a mainframe so mainframes are different

637
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,240
from

638
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,919
the as400 and the as400 is

639
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,120
the the the column on the on the on the

640
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,240
right

641
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,640
um so if you uh hear a conversation or

642
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,520
hear things about

643
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,399
a mainframe it's a different uh

644
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,840
processor with different uh instruction

645
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,320
set uh

646
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,880
and with that uh different operating

647
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,720
systems distribution

648
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,880
with the mainframe i believe there are

649
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,159
emulators out there

650
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,760
for uh there are emulators out there for

651
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,440
i think something called hercules which

652
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,720
for really old uh the really old

653
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,799
processing architecture

654
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,039
um that stuff uh the mainframes are

655
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,039
intended to be extremely

656
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,200
uh redundant and fault uh fault tolerant

657
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,880
with very high uh uptime and the size is

658
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,200
uh

659
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,080
you know for for is about the size of a

660
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,440
fridge but

661
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,960
the ibm as400 or

662
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,720
power system that hardware that power

663
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,760
system can run

664
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,799
ibm i an ibm idmi

665
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,919
aix and a custom

666
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,840
linux distro called linux for on power

667
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,960
systems and that size

668
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,080
uh as you saw through the pictures could

669
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,559
be

670
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,600
you know the size of a 2u up to the

671
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,960
the side is a fridge uh next slide

672
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
please

673
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,200
uh so here are some interesting uh

674
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,000
resources

675
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,440
uh currently used for the presentation

676
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,880
um so that's uh bart's uh link to

677
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,320
his uh hack 400 tool they can use to

678
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,679
assess if your system is vulnerable to

679
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,760
privilege escalation

680
