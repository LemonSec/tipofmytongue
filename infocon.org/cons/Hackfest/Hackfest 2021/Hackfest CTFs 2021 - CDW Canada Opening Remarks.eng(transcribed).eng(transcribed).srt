00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
thanks to patrick and the organizing

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,200
committee

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,520
along with the sponsors and volunteers

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,720
who have allowed this to be possible

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,200
lest we forget we also want to thank all

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,920
of the attendees and you the ctf

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,479
participants for your participation this

25
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,400
year

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,320
this conference cannot happen without

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,960
your continued support

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,280
each of us have had a very challenging

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,799
past 20 months

30
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,520
cdw canada notwithstanding

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,479
but it is the persistence resilience and

32
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,399
indomitable spirit

33
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,320
of individuals like yourselves who

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,560
continue to push forward despite

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,840
adversity

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,040
and to enable clients and companies to

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,240
maintain

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,399
a resilient cyber security posture

39
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,080
i would like to share a quote from jim

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,879
lohr who has spent his career developing

41
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,360
high performance athletes not only in

42
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,239
sport but also in corporations

43
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,440
normal people just like you and me

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,520
lord wrote in his book the power of full

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,879
engagement

46
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,160
stress is not the enemy in our lives

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,400
paradoxically it is the key to growth

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,959
we've all heard this saying no pain no

49
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,080
gain

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,239
but what that saying misses is what lear

51
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,599
preaches

52
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,080
that conversely we also need to take

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,519
adequate time to rest and revitalize in

54
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,879
order to promote exceptional growth

55
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,879
indeed

56
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,360
a person who certainly embodied these

57
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,599
precepts for me and who i'd like to

58
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,280
commemorate this year's ctf2 is a fallen

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,920
comrade a dear friend of mine

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,120
hackfest and cdw canada's stephen

61
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,400
mcelray

62
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,239
the lone ferret

63
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,360
who i had the blessing to work with

64
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,720
stephen was dedicated to his craft

65
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,600
he knew how to work extremely hard at it

66
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,759
but he also knew when he needed to slow

67
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,639
down

68
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,079
enjoy life

69
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,040
and to smell the roses

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,320
in person

71
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,320
certainly

72
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,120
as you compete today cdw canada hopes

73
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,560
that you will embrace the spirit of

74
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,000
competition

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,520
and come away with a sense of

76
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,759
accomplishment and satisfaction from a

77
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,520
job well done

78
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,919
it is with great pleasure that we

79
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,080
declare the hackfest ctf 2021 open

80
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,520
good luck and thank you

81
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,840
very much
