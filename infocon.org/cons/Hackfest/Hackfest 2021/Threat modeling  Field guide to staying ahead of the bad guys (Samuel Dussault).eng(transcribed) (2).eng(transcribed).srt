1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,639
yes so this talk will be in english so

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,880
uh i'm sorry in advance for those who

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,880
were hoping for french talk to to close

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,480
this uh this hackfest so first of all

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,800
thank you very much to uh everyone for

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
taking the time out of your day to to

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,720
check out my my talk i think it's been

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,039
an amazing amazing hack fest so far

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,119
we've seen a lot of great talks uh both

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,960
yesterday and today and i know most of

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,320
you must be really tired from playing

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,880
the the city half but hopefully it will

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,280
be it will be worth your while

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,360
so uh yes

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,280
uh today we'll be talking about threat

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,520
modeling this presentation is meant to

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,239
be

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,280
both

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,680
uh like a high level overview of what

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,760
treadmill is what it's all about how to

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,440
do it and also a quick start guide so

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,840
that hopefully as a as a cyber security

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,840
professional or as a as a developer you

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,199
will be able to start doing threat

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,120
modeling and applying the concepts to

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,680
your daily work as well

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,079
so uh before we start who am i so some

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,160
context on my on my background so my

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,400
name is sam i'm an application security

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,320
architect at genotec i've been working

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,840
in tech for

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,439
the better part of 10 years now or just

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,200
over 10 years actually

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,479
i have been working as a as a qa first

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,640
then a software developer team lead and

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,360
then i moved on to application security

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,680
uh i have as far as certifications go i

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,080
have my oscp and oswe so i think it's

39
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,000
definitely fair to say that i'm

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,759
generally on the more offensive side of

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,119
things so both on the the cloud and

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,400
web application security field

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,240
so my passion is basically i love to

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,159
make and break things and teach people

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,000
how to do it so i've been giving classes

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,720
in different schools universities

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,360
co-workers a lot of a lot of different

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,880
clubs as well

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,399
so you might have you might definitely

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,720
have seen me around a couple times and

51
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,200
uh the easiest way to reach out to me is

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
through linkedin so i do check it daily

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,040
and i would be more than happy to get a

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,560
connection request from

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,680
from everyone that's attending this talk

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
so first thing first to give some

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,799
context to this presentation we will be

58
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,479
answering five simple questions so

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,000
unfortunately it's not going to be a

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,760
very long talk we're not going to be

61
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,000
able to dive too deep into any of the

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,680
any of the concepts but basically my

63
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,599
goal for today was to answer these five

64
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,440
questions so the first one would be what

65
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,959
second one who

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,720
why how and when

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,360
so uh let's get right into it so the

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
first one is what so the this is the

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,519
part where we define threat modeling and

70
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,120
i think it's really important before we

71
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,599
go any further before we start defining

72
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,760
how to do it and and so on and so forth

73
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,959
to make sure that we all have a good

74
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,760
understanding of what it is

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
and and what it entails

76
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,120
so uh first off i want to give a huge

77
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,800
shout out to the the track modeling

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,959
manifesto people so it's a it's a group

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,840
of uh 15 professionals with some of the

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,920
the industry leading experts such as

81
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,239
adam shostak we have chris romeo we have

82
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,400
ellie similar we have a grand total of

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,239
15 people that have been working on that

84
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,319
for uh for a little while now and it's

85
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,640
based off of the the agile manifesto so

86
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,480
it's meant to be super readable super

87
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,800
easy to understand and what it does is

88
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,280
basically define a bunch of key values

89
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,200
and principles which i will also be

90
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,879
covering in this presentation so

91
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,040
hopefully by the time you you come out

92
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,440
of uh after this talk you will have a

93
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,560
good understanding of what it's all

94
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,159
about but in case you you weren't so

95
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,040
sure

96
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,959
do do check it out it is an amazing

97
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,000
resource on that topic

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,599
just me

99
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,200
make sure there's no question so far

100
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,000
perfect okay so uh threat modeling what

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
what is it so basically it's a

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,840
repeatable process that established

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,680
security requirements

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,440
identify and quantify threat and

105
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,120
vulnerabilities and determine and

106
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,200
prioritize remediation methods so that's

107
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,599
that's a lot of words it can seem a bit

108
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,840
a bit heavy but basically what it boils

109
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,080
down to is basically just having a

110
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,159
recipe or process that you can follow in

111
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,480
order to identify threats

112
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,080
and uh remediate and plan your remediate

113
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,720
radiation for them

114
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,080
uh so one one of the key concepts

115
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
of treadmilling is really just trying to

116
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,280
identify

117
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,760
what if hits the fan so

118
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
really often when we design software

119
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,079
when we develop software we assume that

120
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,279
everything is just going to go as

121
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,440
planned and everything's going to work

122
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,840
the way the way it's meant to and it's

123
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,919
it's simply not true so in the

124
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,560
the past couple years the and

125
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,560
yeah for for a while now really

126
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,800
we've been seeing things go awfully

127
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,479
wrong with the the threat landscape

128
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,919
changing at

129
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,759
lightning speed and basically being

130
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,240
impossible to to follow for for most

131
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,320
people uh at this point i think it's

132
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,880
it's more than time that we realize that

133
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,520
uh we're we're doing it wrong and we

134
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,280
have to to start from scratch so threat

135
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,440
modeling is really just a new approach

136
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,680
to software security to application

137
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,400
security and a new way to

138
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,160
to identify and remediate threats

139
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,560
so uh in general when talking about

140
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,639
threat modeling there's four main steps

141
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,320
that that we go through so the first one

142
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,199
would be the diagram or identify what

143
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,280
you are working on or what you will be

144
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,320
working on

145
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,960
so uh in this case the the diagram is

146
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,680
basically just the same type of uh data

147
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,360
flow diagram that you would have in your

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,000
architecture documents or as part of

149
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,080
your software um

150
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,280
guidelines and

151
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,160
and

152
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,400
just documentation with the the added

153
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,720
touch of uh trust boundaries so one of

154
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,320
the important concepts here and we're

155
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,639
going to see like an example at the at

156
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,160
the end of the presentation but one of

157
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,320
the the main additions to to this

158
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,840
diagram is trust boundaries where you

159
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,240
identify uh basically different

160
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,880
environments and different uh like

161
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,039
networking and routes that you're gonna

162
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,440
have between some of your components

163
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,000
so once this is done uh the second phase

164
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,320
would be identifying threats so this is

165
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,360
the main phase of uh of threat modeling

166
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
this is the phase where everyone

167
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,039
basically sits down together and review

168
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,440
the diagram to identify threats so true

169
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,560
questions shoot open discussions uh you

170
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
start identifying what what could go

171
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,639
wrong and what would happen if it did go

172
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,560
wrong so you through that process

173
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
through those discussions uh you usually

174
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,880
come out with a bunch of threats or

175
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,280
issues that you that you identify

176
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,120
and you can then move on to the third

177
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,039
stage which would be mitigate or the

178
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,520
mitigation stage where this is the phase

179
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,880
where you basically you open your

180
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,919
tickets so you decide okay so this is a

181
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,600
high priority risk for us it's really

182
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,680
important that we we fix it before the

183
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,720
next release or before the next major or

184
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,639
you basically just uh

185
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,800
determine what what is important to you

186
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,720
and what uh

187
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,039
what would cause the the most damage if

188
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,520
if it was to to go wrong and basically

189
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,240
just prioritize fixes

190
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,919
and then the last step in that process

191
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,639
is to validate so it is really important

192
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,560
to make sure that the the threat is

193
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
properly mitigated in the case where you

194
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,000
don't accept the risk and you really do

195
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,400
want to to patch it and

196
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,479
so this process can be done by

197
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,639
developers and can be done by qa it can

198
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,520
be done by my security and it's it's a

199
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,000
very important stage uh

200
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,400
because it really makes sure that

201
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
you are leveraging your threat models to

202
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,880
their full uh potential so if if you

203
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,199
were to just generate the diagrams and

204
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,039
then let them rot somewhere or just make

205
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,240
a list of threats and then never do

206
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,440
anything with them then the whole

207
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,120
process would pretty much be pointless

208
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,639
right

209
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,440
so

210
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,840
uh as far as handling threats go there

211
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,319
are uh basically four different ways

212
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,759
that you can uh

213
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,360
go around it so the first one would be

214
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,720
to mitigate

215
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,599
so mitigating is probably the most

216
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,880
common one and the one where you

217
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,720
basically just patch the feature so if

218
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,319
you if you identify a threat if you

219
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,280
identify a risk and uh you decide to

220
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,599
mitigate it you would basically just fix

221
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,680
the issue in the code or redesign if

222
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,520
it's a design issue and make sure that

223
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,720
it's not possible to abuse it anymore

224
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,879
the second one would be to eliminate it

225
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,360
so in some cases if there's like some

226
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,400
really glaring design issues if

227
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,160
it would be either too costly or too

228
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
complicated to completely eliminate the

229
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,080
threat then to completely mitigate the

230
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,680
threat then you can simply decide okay

231
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,520
so you know what this feature is just

232
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,919
it's not worth it so like based on the

233
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,759
the income that it would generate for us

234
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,919
based on the demand from customers or

235
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,560
even maybe the current uh usage so if

236
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,240
you're you're able to monitor and see

237
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,479
that not a lot of people are uh using a

238
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,080
specific feature in your product then

239
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,520
you might just decide you know what

240
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,039
let's just remove it all together and

241
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,120
this is one completely valid way to

242
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,360
handle the threats

243
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,440
the third one would be to transfer it so

244
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,679
in some cases yes it might be really

245
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,360
hard to patch it in the code maybe the

246
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,000
architecture issue is too big and it's

247
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,839
it's not possible to simply just go

248
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,000
ahead and fix it but you might decide

249
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,640
you know what i can deploy a security

250
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,120
control i can deploy a firewall or or a

251
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,360
waf and and just make sure that it's

252
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,120
basically impossible to to exploit it

253
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,040
from the outside of the network or from

254
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,720
an authenticated attacker's point of

255
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,760
view

256
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,800
and in some cases it can uh it can work

257
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,399
because at the end of the day your goal

258
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,040
is definitely to understand risk and

259
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
manage it but it's you're never going to

260
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,000
get to the point where you can

261
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
completely eliminate it either so in

262
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,480
some cases it might be acceptable to

263
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,200
partially mitigate the risk and you can

264
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
also do that by transferring the risk

265
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,720
over to your user basically just telling

266
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,120
them hey so like this one feature if you

267
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
activate it there is a risk like uh if

268
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,279
you if you disable rate limiting on this

269
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,440
endpoint that you you need to use then

270
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,880
there is a risk that someone is going to

271
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,800
try to brute force it but you need to

272
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,880
accept that risk

273
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,120
and finally as i just said you can also

274
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,720
accept the risk as a business you can

275
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,360
decide okay so there there is a risk but

276
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,440
either because the impact is not big

277
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,399
enough or because it's uh

278
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,240
it's very very unlikely that it does get

279
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
exploited then you can just say okay all

280
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,519
right so i'm gonna keep track of this

281
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,560
risk i'm gonna have still a ticket open

282
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,240
or some sort of database where i can

283
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,880
track the the risk but as it is right

284
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,040
now i i think it's fine to to keep it in

285
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,760
my product right

286
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,880
so uh once again to take a different

287
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,000
perspective what threat modeling is so

288
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,680
first it is a culture of finding and

289
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,240
fixing security issues early and often

290
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
so if you've if you're a developer if

291
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,560
you've worked with with agile in any any

292
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,240
fashion you should be familiar with that

293
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,800
that type of approach break things fast

294
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
and often and it's it's basically the

295
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,240
exact same thing here so what you want

296
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,480
to do is go through a

297
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,560
somewhat formal security review very

298
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,560
early in the in your process make sure

299
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
that everyone gets a chance to basically

300
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,279
sit down give their input discuss about

301
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,920
the given system and if there's any like

302
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,399
glaring

303
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,079
architecture issues then you can

304
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,760
identify super early in the process so

305
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
that you can remediate them before they

306
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
ever make it to production

307
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,399
uh what it also is is a chance for

308
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,760
people with different skill sets and

309
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,600
background to contribute to the security

310
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,680
of a product so this is a topic that i'm

311
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,279
going to touch on a bit later as well

312
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,200
but basically this is a great

313
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,839
opportunity for your security people

314
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,560
your qa people developers maybe

315
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,480
stakeholders maybe you want to involve

316
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,279
uh

317
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,959
sales people maybe you want to involve

318
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,800
project managers in that process and

319
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,720
have them sit with everyone else and

320
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,040
give their input on

321
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,480
on the thread model and see what comes

322
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,279
out of it very often it's an hour or two

323
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,279
hours that are very well spent in the

324
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,200
case of genetech we do a lot of threat

325
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,160
modeling and it's very frequent that we

326
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,920
come out of a

327
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
of one of these discussions with a head

328
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,000
full of ideas and improvements that we

329
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,240
can make to our products and getting

330
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,360
people with different skill sets

331
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,839
involved is definitely a very good idea

332
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,519
it's also a great opportunity for

333
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,920
developers qa and security

334
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,200
to sit down together and have a

335
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,000
discussion so i think in the case of qa

336
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,639
developers hopefully there's already

337
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,399
good communication channels but for

338
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,480
security and especially from security to

339
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,680
qa

340
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,600
it's very frequent that there's little

341
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,320
to no communication so security just you

342
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,880
know deploys tools and sometimes try to

343
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,560
to police what's uh what's going on but

344
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,920
don't have very good communication with

345
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,839
the developers and trade modeling is

346
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,800
really an amazing way to

347
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,040
somewhat like solve that problem so it's

348
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,480
a very good way for security and

349
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,320
developers to sit down together

350
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,240
get a good common understanding of what

351
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,639
the products are what they do and also

352
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,360
identify some some issues together

353
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,600
and finally it's a systematic yet

354
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,279
creative approach to shifting security

355
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,760
left and identifying risk and issues so

356
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,279
i think shifting security left is a

357
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,560
concept that

358
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,240
everyone should be familiar with by this

359
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,320
point uh basically just

360
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,639
making sure that the security team is

361
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,000
not the

362
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,160
the only team or the only people that

363
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,760
are the owners of the security in the

364
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,320
business and uh i think it's becoming

365
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,160
more and more obvious that this is uh

366
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,120
this is not an option but rather just a

367
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
requirement it's a need like security

368
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,200
should be everyone's responsibility

369
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,959
uh i also thought it was interesting to

370
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,200
maybe define what threat modeling isn't

371
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,519
so uh fit modeling isn't a single

372
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,920
person's job or responsibility

373
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,680
the security team cannot and should not

374
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,760
be the sole owner of the threat model so

375
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,519
once again this is something i'm gonna

376
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,519
i'm gonna dive a bit deeper in two in a

377
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,680
couple of minutes but basically uh it's

378
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,600
just not realistic to have a single rock

379
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,680
star a single person in the business

380
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,480
that

381
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,079
is in charge of everything all the

382
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,560
threat models uh all the analysis

383
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,959
patching the the issues it's just it

384
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,200
doesn't make sense it's not possible so

385
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,600
it's it's really everyone's job

386
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,360
second it's uh it's not an absolute

387
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,160
science so basically find what works

388
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,240
best for you and your team uh there's

389
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,320
many ways to do it there's a million

390
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,040
different tools there's a lot of ways

391
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,120
that you can do it and what works for

392
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,560
another business might not work for

393
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,240
yours

394
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,760
so the truth is security teams have

395
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,079
a wildly different size

396
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,600
based on the on the business and

397
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,720
especially in the case of small

398
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,639
businesses it's really likely that the

399
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,720
security team might be one maybe two

400
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,320
people uh doing their best and uh

401
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,079
obviously you can't have the same the

402
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,920
same processes and you can't have the

403
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,680
same uh

404
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,399
same scope when you have this small team

405
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,959
compared to when you have maybe several

406
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,720
different uh product and application

407
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,720
security teams and a much more scalable

408
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,279
security effort as a company

409
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,760
uh third it's not a formal assessment of

410
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,839
a secu of the security of a product a

411
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,920
shred model is not a penetration test

412
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,440
and i find it really important to stress

413
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,160
that uh so some people will assume that

414
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,040
because uh they went through a threat

415
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,040
modeling phase they don't really need a

416
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,519
penetration test and vice versa so maybe

417
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,519
they will assume that uh because they

418
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,040
had a pen test already then maybe

419
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,440
there's no point in doing chat modeling

420
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,920
because they see it as a as a cost

421
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,560
rather than a investment and they are

422
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,959
completely different

423
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,199
and finally it's not meant to be used as

424
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,360
a way to judge or criticize anyone's

425
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,199
work so once again i think anyone that's

426
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:07,920
been

427
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
a developer or that's worked on a

428
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,440
product at some point remembers their

429
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,399
first uh their first pr uh

430
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,720
review and they can they know how how

431
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,480
hard it can be to have someone else just

432
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,800
criticize or or review your work and

433
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,000
there's always this feeling that the

434
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,240
security team is there to to be the

435
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,320
police and to to tell them like what's

436
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,760
wrong with their products and what's

437
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,120
what's bad with what they're doing and

438
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,440
that's definitely what this

439
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,279
not what this is about this this is this

440
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,199
whole treadmill thing is about the

441
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,120
people it's about making better product

442
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
but it's definitely not about pointing

443
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,279
fingers and trying to

444
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,120
judge the work that that someone did

445
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,279
so moving on

446
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,199
who so who should be involved so i guess

447
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,320
i kind of spoiled this one but basically

448
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,839
i think at this point it's no surprise

449
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,199
that my answer to this question is going

450
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,519
to be everyone

451
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,320
so yes security is everyone's job uh the

452
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,079
worst mistake you can make when threat

453
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,920
modeling is to delegate every everything

454
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,800
to a single person or team

455
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,720
everyone in the company has a different

456
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,320
skill set knowledge of different

457
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
products different interests and by

458
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,959
interest i also mean the interest that

459
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,120
they have as a professional so either

460
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,399
whether it's

461
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,279
customers requirements or features or

462
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,519
lines of codes that have uh

463
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,519
everyone is working on different

464
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,680
objectives and uh

465
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,040
it just doesn't make any sense for a

466
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,440
single person to be in charge of all of

467
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,279
this work

468
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,920
so uh as a dev uh as a developer

469
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,360
you usually have the

470
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,120
best understanding of the technical

471
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,959
implementation and requirements of the

472
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,680
product so obviously and

473
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,360
i was just talking about that but in the

474
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,519
case where you have a tiny security team

475
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,680
it's completely unrealistic to assume

476
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,759
that uh your security people have a

477
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,160
great understanding of every single

478
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,000
product that that you're working on how

479
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,160
your code works all the the tech you're

480
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,920
using and they might not even be up to

481
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,519
date with it and it's it's perfectly

482
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,160
fine uh it's it's already hard enough as

483
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,839
a developer to stay up to date with all

484
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,000
the the new technology

485
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,720
so uh your role when doing treadmilling

486
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,640
should really be to bring that to the

487
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,400
table

488
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,799
second obviously uh the data flow

489
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,839
diagrams so uh and

490
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,480
so this can be kind of a

491
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,240
a hot topic i know some people believe

492
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,599
that it should be the security team's

493
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,520
responsibility to work on that in my own

494
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,600
opinion i think that developers are the

495
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,120
best uh people to to do that and at the

496
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,919
like

497
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,679
once the company grows to certain level

498
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,640
of maturity in a completely ideal world

499
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,520
the developers should be able to uh be

500
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
the owners of that process so start

501
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
working on our chat models whenever

502
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,600
there's you know more sensitive features

503
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,679
or it's a new product reach out to the

504
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,840
the security team work on on them

505
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,640
together but still be the owners of the

506
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,720
other diagrams the process and be able

507
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,480
to conduct threat modeling on like

508
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,640
smaller pieces of the applications or

509
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,000
new features easily

510
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,320
great

511
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,440
okay so uh moving on uh so another

512
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,720
another thing that they should also be

513
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,600
able to do is to be uh able to identify

514
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,440
when you should threat model so one

515
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,600
thing that i get really often because i

516
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,120
i have monthly meetings with the

517
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,799
developers and i try to stay in touch

518
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,480
with the dev teams as much as possible

519
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,840
and one thing one thing that i hear

520
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,000
really often is but it's heavy it's a

521
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,480
heavy process to you know like always be

522
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,640
updating our threat models threat model

523
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,760
every single feature and this is 100

524
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,840
true and it's also the reason why as a

525
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,000
developer you should be able to identify

526
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
hey so this new feature you know it's

527
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,840
not like this application is never going

528
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,480
to run in a like a super sensitive

529
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,799
environment even if it gets uh breached

530
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,200
there's like there's no sensitive data

531
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,360
you pretty much can't pivot from it it's

532
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,039
just like a single page application it's

533
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,120
going to be static then maybe there's no

534
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,799
need for track modeling as a developer

535
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,039
it's perfectly fine to decide make that

536
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,720
decision that you don't you don't need

537
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,799
it

538
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,400
as a qa so as a as a test engineer

539
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,280
or just a qa tester uh so

540
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,000
you have this this weird understanding

541
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,320
of the application and its quirks uh you

542
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,799
understand uh

543
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,640
better than anyone else really how you

544
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,799
can break the software uh because you

545
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,720
just you know through all the testing

546
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,039
all the checklists all

547
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,640
all the work that you do you have a

548
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,320
really good understanding of the way the

549
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,799
application works and the way that

550
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,679
that

551
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,840
a potential attacker could use the

552
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,760
quirks and could use the bugs to their

553
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,160
advantage so by all means uh qa should

554
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,520
be involved in the threat modeling

555
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,559
process

556
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,280
and they can also help to validate the

557
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,760
mitigation controls so in the case where

558
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,480
developers do decide to to patch out an

559
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,120
issue or a problem then qa could be able

560
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,080
to first integrate uh the finding into

561
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,240
their checklist so maybe perform the

562
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,080
same test that was just performed to

563
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,600
make sure that the issue was fixed on

564
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,679
different products or on different parts

565
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,520
of the same product and perhaps even

566
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,679
identify new issues through that process

567
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,520
and also make sure that the fix is

568
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,400
complete and it's uh

569
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
it's it's it's fine like it's adequate

570
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,559
for the for the issue at hand so

571
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,960
obviously uh it might not always be

572
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,080
possible or realistic to expect uh qa

573
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,760
testers to have a really good

574
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,840
understanding of security uh by all

575
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,240
means if as a tester or as a qa engineer

576
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,760
you're interested in security then

577
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,280
please do get

578
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,520
more training in in cyber security we we

579
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,080
really need you guys but uh

580
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,679
there are there's also a need for the

581
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,520
security team to review some of the the

582
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,280
issues and i think it's it's perfectly

583
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,720
fine

584
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,440
speaking of them so the security folks

585
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,120
the security people they bring the

586
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,799
attacker mindset and the compliance

587
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,520
aspect to the table so uh maybe they

588
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,919
don't have the best understanding of the

589
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,600
application that's being worked on or

590
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,280
they don't have all the like the little

591
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
bits and pieces of the of the contacts

592
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,039
that it's going to evolve on but they

593
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,280
know how the attackers are going to to

594
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,960
try to break in and they know what

595
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,559
they're going to try to do once they

596
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,360
they get in so uh once the developers

597
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,039
have their data flows and they're ready

598
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,200
to to talk about their

599
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
their threat models security people come

600
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,159
in and they start talking about okay so

601
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,559
this is how you could uh exploit the

602
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,559
application this is the kind of controls

603
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,559
that would prevent me from doing so is

604
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,760
that something that you guys have in

605
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,640
place

606
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,559
do you have proper authentication do you

607
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,880
have uh you know

608
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,039
proper encryption for data at rest data

609
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,280
and transit and maybe it's even

610
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,720
questions that the developers are not

611
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,559
going to be able to answer right away

612
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,799
and this is perfectly fine uh once again

613
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,480
the goal of track modeling is really to

614
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,400
have an open channel of communication

615
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,799
and to get people involved and uh

616
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,799
improve their their product so threat

617
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,880
modeling doesn't end at the end of that

618
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,960
meeting it's not one hour or two hours

619
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,480
of discussion and then and then that's

620
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,080
it yes there's mitigation but there's

621
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,480
also some some concerns or some ideas

622
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
that that can come out of

623
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,520
the threat modeling process

624
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,679
finally uh stakeholders and when i say

625
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,039
stakeholders it's really a broad

626
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,720
definition in this case it's basically

627
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,120
anything from management to a customer

628
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
support specialist because yes customer

629
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,280
support specialists can also be involved

630
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,159
uh

631
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,159
in the in the process oftentimes they

632
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,840
have a really good understanding of the

633
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,760
way that customers are going to use the

634
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
application and maybe the way they

635
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,600
deploy it maybe some special

636
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,520
requirements that they have

637
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,840
product owners and uh management have a

638
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,960
good understanding of overall uh

639
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,840
the the vision for the product and also

640
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,280
the requirements and the needs of their

641
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,320
customers so through having

642
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,840
sometimes you know sales and uh

643
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,039
sales in mind having direct

644
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,480
communication with the customers they're

645
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,840
more aware of

646
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,280
the way the application is going to be

647
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,600
used and what the application that like

648
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,360
where it's going

649
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,960
and this is this is really a vision that

650
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,640
can bring a lot to the literate modeling

651
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,919
process as well

652
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,880
so uh to that's more user focused and

653
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,480
less technical vision of the product you

654
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,520
can also identify uh additional threats

655
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
and uh so so so some concern that some

656
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,760
people might have is okay but like what

657
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,840
if what if uh

658
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,600
they don't have the best uh technical

659
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,159
understanding of the product and i think

660
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,919
this might not actually be an issue but

661
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,720
rather a strength uh often time we we as

662
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,480
security people and developers will have

663
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,960
a tendency to focus on very technical

664
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,880
aspect of the product while doing a

665
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,799
threat modeling and having that

666
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,880
different vision and these different

667
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,480
questions that will come in can really

668
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,280
help stir the the discussion in a

669
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,520
different direction which might also be

670
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,600
very productive so by all means don't

671
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,679
discount people don't uh

672
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,520
discard people just because they don't

673
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,320
have

674
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,840
technical knowledge or

675
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,679
background okay so by now you should

676
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,039
hopefully have a pretty good

677
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,039
understanding of what track modeling is

678
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,799
uh who should be involved but now the

679
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,080
question might be why so uh if you're if

680
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,640
you're a manager if you're a director by

681
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,799
this point you might be okay cool so you

682
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,640
you're saying a lot of stuff it sounds

683
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,480
it sounds all good and wonderful but so

684
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,919
i already have a firewall i already have

685
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,080
an antivirus i already have endpoint

686
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,080
detection i already have a waff i really

687
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,240
have all these expensive tools maybe a

688
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,600
sas dust sca so so what now why why do

689
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,440
you want to add even more process to to

690
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,120
this whole thing

691
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,559
so this is why

692
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,440
uh

693
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,600
as of 2021 79 of all businesses push

694
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,200
vulnerable code to their production

695
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,480
environment

696
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,320
sometimes because they don't know it

697
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,600
sometimes because they they need to to

698
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,679
meet a really tight deadline so they

699
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,080
just push whatever they have basically

700
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,799
and uh sometimes because they they

701
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,400
assume that the issue is not bad enough

702
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,559
so sometimes even before like without

703
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,480
consulting their security team just by

704
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,080
themselves they decide okay so you know

705
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,159
what this is not like a huge deal maybe

706
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,000
we can just ship the

707
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,919
the poc and see how things go and then

708
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,919
they get they get pound basically it's

709
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,919
just one more way to

710
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,559
to break into your your network

711
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,960
so uh these are some numbers i thought

712
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,919
were interesting as well so uh according

713
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,400
to ibm as of 2021 the average data

714
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,039
breach costs around 6.5 million dollars

715
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,000
u.s

716
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,799
so a lot more than one or two hours of

717
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,760
of work

718
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,200
even if you you have large teams

719
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,000
there are uh around 30 thousand websites

720
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,480
getting axed daily according to texturey

721
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,279
and according to them as well uh 64

722
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,039
percent of companies worldwide is

723
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,039
worldwide have experienced at least one

724
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,320
major attack so i think uh

725
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,159
if by this point you're still wondering

726
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,720
so why uh why do i need to do all of

727
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,000
this this is exactly why so this is like

728
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
tools enough

729
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,919
the tools alone are not enough to to

730
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,760
stop attackers and this is becoming more

731
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,520
and more obvious and

732
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,919
if you rely on tools to uh to protect

733
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,919
your business then you're bound to fail

734
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,720
uh so some of the reasons once again so

735
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,480
we just highlighted what uh what each

736
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,320
person can bring to the the table and

737
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,760
now i thought it was also interesting to

738
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,919
highlight some of the not necessarily

739
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,840
shortcomings but some of the things that

740
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,720
each person might be lacking so

741
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,240
if there's no communication if there's

742
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,400
no exchange between the teams through

743
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,960
something like like threat modeling

744
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,360
uh then this is how you ship uh you

745
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,440
should vulnerable code so

746
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,360
for for developers they often struggle

747
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,200
to meet very tight deadlines and have

748
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,120
little to no time to invest

749
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,400
in improving the security of their

750
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,840
products so this is something that i

751
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,480
hear time and time again uh yeah so we

752
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,840
would love to do threat modeling we

753
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,919
would love to to do cyber security but

754
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,679
we just don't have time like we need to

755
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,120
ship this this new version by next

756
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,360
friday in two weeks we just we don't

757
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,039
have time and then

758
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,360
you get pound or

759
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,799
we don't have time like right now we're

760
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,960
going to the architecture phase of our

761
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,200
new project it's super cool uh but we

762
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,480
don't really have time to get security

763
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,320
involved like we we just really need to

764
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,159
get this poc going and then maybe in a

765
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,919
couple of months time will be we'll be

766
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,919
ready to uh to present this this to you

767
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,679
guys and really you can't you can't

768
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,080
blame the developers for that uh i i

769
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,840
think it's uh one of the the businesses

770
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,840
real but well like realities that you

771
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,240
need to uh to ship your your product and

772
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,360
security uh as a whole rarely ever if

773
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,919
ever drives the the business

774
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,760
and uh

775
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,000
they so there can be a tendency here not

776
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,720
to prioritize security

777
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,559
now then as a security team surely

778
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,720
security should be the the owners of

779
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,360
security right that makes sense

780
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,840
so uh the the issue with that that way

781
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,320
of thinking is first that they often

782
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,240
represent a very small fraction of the

783
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,240
entire development and engineering theme

784
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,320
so i put one to five percent i've worked

785
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,919
in a lot of businesses a lot of

786
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,080
different contexts i think that's about

787
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,880
a realistic number so having you know

788
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,520
one to two security people per 100

789
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,720
deaths

790
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,000
so once again for much larger businesses

791
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,760
there are definitely cases where there's

792
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,440
much larger security teams as well and

793
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,799
there might be some security teams

794
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,840
dedicated to a a product team but in in

795
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,919
most cases for small medium and even

796
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,520
large businesses the security team is

797
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,960
just way too small to uh to keep up with

798
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,399
all the new developments all the new

799
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,640
technology all the new tech stack and to

800
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,559
scale up the efforts as well

801
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,360
so just uh spending so much time on

802
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,480
their tools and uh and training and

803
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,720
best practices is already super hard and

804
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,320
super time consuming so it's just not

805
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,640
realistic

806
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,720
and they also don't always have the

807
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,640
authority to block a release or enforce

808
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,799
a proper usage of the tooling

809
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,120
or processes so very often the security

810
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,360
team will be able to roll out a new tool

811
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
for example you can have something like

812
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,200
a sass so a static analysis tool uh or a

813
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
dust so a dynamic analysis tool that you

814
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
can roll out that you can deliver to

815
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,600
your product teams and hope for the best

816
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,039
basically you just hope that they will

817
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,399
that they will use them that they will

818
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,080
leverage them to their to the best of

819
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,480
their their capabilities but that that's

820
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
about where your authority as a security

821
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,679
team ends

822
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,039
and uh

823
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,480
this is something that stakeholders do

824
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
something that that devs can can bring

825
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,120
to the table

826
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,480
uh as a stakeholder uh i think

827
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,320
so for stakeholders it's a bit different

828
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,399
because stakeholders as i said have a

829
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,520
very like uh customer focused vision of

830
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,679
the product uh they're client oriented

831
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,520
they want they want to ship out new

832
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,919
features and keep the the business going

833
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,559
but uh i think they might have a

834
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,320
fundamental misunderstanding of the

835
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,640
value that cyber security team and cyber

836
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,320
security as a whole can add to their

837
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,640
product so very often they will see that

838
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,360
as a cost rather than an investment so

839
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,440
integrating security really early in

840
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,080
your your development process can can be

841
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
expensive you can you can spend some

842
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,000
some dev time uh through well in that

843
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
network modeling review meeting or

844
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,080
working on the diagrams and this is time

845
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,360
that they won't be spending on uh

846
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,679
on the actual product and this is true

847
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,039
but it's also very important to

848
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,440
understand that first

849
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,360
a lot of businesses are basically one

850
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,039
attack or one breach away from going

851
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,960
bankrupt even if the business is going

852
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,080
very good uh just one major attack can

853
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,159
can take you out of a business or

854
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,640
seriously harm your your reputation or

855
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,679
your your revenues and uh it's also the

856
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,840
smartest thing to do to integrate it

857
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,600
early into your

858
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,360
your development process so once again

859
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
this is something i'm going to go over

860
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,080
in a couple of minutes

861
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,320
uh i think one very big misunderstanding

862
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
when it comes to security as well is

863
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,559
that design flaws and cut issues are the

864
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,120
same thing and they are definitely not

865
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,960
and one of the biggest difference is

866
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,600
that code issues can be picked up by a

867
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,399
tool uh something like assass will

868
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,159
easily tell you hey so there's some

869
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,679
cross-site scripting issues here or

870
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,480
there's a sequel injection there but

871
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,320
very often they won't be able to point

872
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,200
out the design flaws some things such as

873
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,640
hey so maybe you should add

874
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
authentication to this endpoint because

875
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,720
it gives you admin access over another

876
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,240
product system

877
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,960
maybe you should add encryption

878
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,440
and transit between these two services

879
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,760
because you're you're sending data over

880
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,519
the public internet and there is a

881
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,360
chance that someone will try to do

882
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,679
men in the middle or just eavesdrop

883
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,279
this is the kind of issues that will not

884
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,440
be highlighted by tools

885
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,320
and

886
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,240
that you can definitely identify true

887
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,320
proper threat modeling and to just

888
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,240
discussions and a good review of the

889
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,760
architecture of your product so it's

890
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,960
really important to understand that

891
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,080
there are

892
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,960
definitely some great use case for tools

893
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,679
but

894
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,600
you can't base all of your approach

895
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,519
around tools or else there are some

896
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,399
things that you will be missing

897
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,039
so uh this is a quote from one of my my

898
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,519
previous manager uh so he used to tell

899
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,120
me compliance should be a byproduct of

900
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,799
security and not the other way around i

901
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,320
think this is uh

902
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,840
this is very elegant this is very

903
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,960
efficient at conveying the message that

904
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,399
yes pci iso suck

905
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,960
nist whatever framework or certification

906
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,360
that you're working on is important so

907
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
it can

908
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,760
establish and certify a certain level of

909
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,840
security for your business as a whole

910
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,640
but uh it's it's never going to be a

911
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,840
proof that you're 100 secure

912
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,399
uh i think through uh the past couple

913
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,399
slides and to my my message so far it

914
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,279
should it should be really obvious that

915
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,279
uh

916
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,480
security

917
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
that well like as an industry right now

918
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,799
we have to shift security left security

919
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,200
has to be a people's problem and we have

920
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,960
to deal with it together and it's not

921
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,360
just something that we can achieve with

922
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,480
tools or with compliance so uh

923
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,399
by all means don't get uh don't get

924
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,159
flustered uh i know there's probably

925
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,039
some pci or iso iso folks out there and

926
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,440
you guys are super important and this is

927
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,519
by no means a

928
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,679
meant to be an insult or or to say that

929
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,559
it's that's not necessary but uh

930
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,399
you should be always aiming for security

931
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,039
and compliance should come uh with it so

932
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,480
in the world where your application is

933
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
secure you should be compliant by

934
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,840
default or very close to it

935
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,399
okay so i've been talking now for 35

936
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,919
minutes i've given you a lot of

937
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,159
information on what threat modeling is

938
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,080
and who should do it and it's it's all

939
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,679
cool and fun and

940
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,600
i think the one question that comes up

941
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,159
the most often when i talk about uh

942
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,000
threat modeling with with our devs is

943
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,039
basically how so i've like i have a good

944
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,039
understanding of what it is but now i

945
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,000
want to start doing it and i'm not sure

946
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,799
so

947
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,640
uh for your diagrams which should be

948
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,480
your first step there's many different

949
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,799
options there's uh the microsoft threat

950
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,919
modeling tool uh tm7 this one is is free

951
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,240
and it's great there's also two

952
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
different projects from oasp so there's

953
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,559
tread dragon and there's uh pitm so

954
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,440
threat modeling as code so uh if i think

955
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,200
this one is written in python so if

956
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,399
you're familiar with python if you're

957
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,480
comfortable with it uh it's one way to

958
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
generate your diagrams and basically

959
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,559
bring your own tool uh this is not a

960
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,199
sales page this has nothing to do with a

961
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,440
specific tool or a specific way of of

962
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,000
doing things and uh once again i i

963
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,239
really want to make it clear that uh you

964
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,480
as a as a security professional or a

965
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
developer have to to find out what's

966
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,918
what works best for you and these are

967
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,918
just some examples of of what you can

968
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,000
use

969
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,879
uh

970
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,520
so how can i identify threats then uh

971
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,918
one very good starting point is stride

972
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,760
so i'll be presenting that in the in a

973
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,599
minute but in case you're interested in

974
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,520
other other frameworks or other guys

975
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,239
that you can use there's uh so osp again

976
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,239
has two very good projects there's the

977
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,159
asvs so the

978
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,159
basically just the application security

979
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,520
verifications

980
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,839
there's the security testing guides so

981
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,280
there's one for mobile there's one for

982
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,918
web just grab them and uh and use that

983
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,320
as a reference there's the nest

984
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,240
so nist has a lot of guys that are

985
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,400
frameworks a lot of documentation that

986
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,880
you can use as a starting point uh also

987
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
frameworks for standards so maybe if you

988
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,640
work in an environment that needs to be

989
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,760
pci compliant or gdpr compliant you

990
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,359
might want to to take that into

991
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,960
consideration when you're going to your

992
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,599
threat model so either

993
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,240
from a security or the perspective just

994
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,160
make sure that you're you're covering

995
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,560
all the all the basics and you're

996
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,079
compliant with it so obviously this is

997
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,079
never going to be as thorough as an

998
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,640
actual audit or a

999
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,320
certification process but it might be a

1000
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,920
good time to take these into into

1001
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,040
consideration and uh it's also a good

1002
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,839
way to a good time to evaluate your

1003
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,160
existing security requirements policies

1004
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,800
and checklists so maybe qa wants to

1005
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,480
bring their uh

1006
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,240
their regular sweeps and checklist and

1007
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,920
see if uh

1008
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,200
just anything in there that could be

1009
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,680
relevant uh maybe you have a secure

1010
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,599
coding policy uh either to iso 27001 or

1011
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,480
just as a as a company and you want to

1012
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,240
you want to use that as a reference this

1013
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,839
is great this works

1014
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,400
or really just any any document uh it's

1015
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,720
not an absolute science there's a lot of

1016
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,880
resources and a lot of ways that you can

1017
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,200
do that

1018
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,520
uh okay so i did promise uh i was going

1019
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,680
to cover stride uh i find tried to be

1020
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,920
very efficient uh and it's basically

1021
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,000
it's an acronym and acronym that stands

1022
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,040
for spoofing tampering repudiation

1023
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,440
information disclosure denial of service

1024
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,160
and elevation of privileges so basically

1025
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,160
for for each component of the of the

1026
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,119
system for each maybe trust boundary you

1027
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,880
you go through this list and you just

1028
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,920
try to define okay so like if can i can

1029
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,760
i spoof the request like can i pretend

1030
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,880
to be somewhere someone else or can i

1031
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,400
bypass maybe the authorization

1032
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,280
mechanisms uh can i tamper with the the

1033
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,400
request uh can i compromise repudiation

1034
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,119
so

1035
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,640
is there any way that i can perform

1036
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,320
actions without them being logged or

1037
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,240
without the owner of the application

1038
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,839
being able to identify who performed

1039
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:58,640
them

1040
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,480
and so on and so forth so i think pretty

1041
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,640
much all of them are self-explanatory

1042
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,400
and otherwise there's a lot of great

1043
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,240
documentation out there but

1044
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,079
as a starting point for threat modeling

1045
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,440
it's uh

1046
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
i think it's great

1047
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,560
okay so uh maybe some more tips

1048
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,599
uh so break more complex systems down

1049
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,480
into smaller pieces so uh analysis

1050
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,640
paralysis is a huge thing when it comes

1051
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
to tread modeling just trying to figure

1052
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,760
out okay so how do i get started uh is

1053
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,240
my threat model gonna be like perfect is

1054
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
it gonna be good enough and i think it's

1055
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,960
it's a case of really just do it just

1056
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,520
start working on the diagrams just

1057
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,839
pick out like one small use case or one

1058
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,760
small subset of your system and start

1059
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,599
working on it and the rest will come

1060
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,720
from there

1061
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,400
as you gain more maturity as you get

1062
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,240
more comfortable with with threat

1063
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,640
modeling i think it's going to be easier

1064
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,440
to like model your systems and figure

1065
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
out exactly what what you should be

1066
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,640
threat modeling and how you should be

1067
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,280
doing it and as a security team uh you

1068
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,680
will also gain maturity as to the type

1069
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,200
of questions that you should ask and the

1070
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
type of threats that are that are likely

1071
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,560
to come out of

1072
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,160
the system when performing threat

1073
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,640
modeling but uh you shouldn't be aiming

1074
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,119
for perfection you should be doing it

1075
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,280
uh there's also make separate threat

1076
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,280
models to illustrate specific use cases

1077
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,800
and workflows so this one is really

1078
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,200
interesting uh very often when you're

1079
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,480
working on your first threat model

1080
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,920
you're you're going to start wondering

1081
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,280
okay so am i being clear on what exactly

1082
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
this system is doing or like what

1083
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,640
information is being passed around or uh

1084
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,240
exactly what uh

1085
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,800
like what is happening here so you can

1086
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,720
totally have your main thread model and

1087
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,119
have your like some smaller ones on

1088
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,720
smaller subsets of the system and just

1089
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,839
go through this specific use case so for

1090
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,040
example say you want to model out your

1091
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,640
authentication process so you would just

1092
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,560
have your user your authentication

1093
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,720
gateway your service maybe a db and

1094
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,280
that's it and then just just map it out

1095
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,520
just go through the flow and perform

1096
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,680
track model on this specific piece uh if

1097
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,920
it's too small maybe you can do two or

1098
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,160
three thread models uh in the same the

1099
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,520
same track model review and that's

1100
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,200
that's perfectly fine but it really

1101
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
helps to uh

1102
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,640
to like illustrate certain processes or

1103
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,160
where what like what information is

1104
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,440
being passed around without making your

1105
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,240
main threat model too too complicated

1106
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,400
and finally uh there is no such thing as

1107
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,240
a stupid question so obviously this one

1108
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,560
is mostly for the the review part of

1109
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,880
things and uh

1110
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,440
so even if you feel like this is

1111
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,680
something that everyone knows uh just

1112
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,520
ask uh it's very likely that someone

1113
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,960
else will have the same question and

1114
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,440
even if they don't uh there it's always

1115
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,079
a good opportunity for devs or for for

1116
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,599
everyone involved really to make sure

1117
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,400
that

1118
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,320
they have a good understanding first of

1119
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,400
the system and second of what it really

1120
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,680
does because there's a lot of cases

1121
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,760
where people assume that things will

1122
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
work a certain way and they might not

1123
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,280
and there might be some vulnerabilities

1124
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,800
or some threats that are hidden in the

1125
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,119
way that they actually work and maybe

1126
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,640
you might trigger a

1127
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,119
pen test or a more advanced uh

1128
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,880
more advanced review of a specific

1129
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,240
feature or code block uh as a result of

1130
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,000
of what seems like a stupid question so

1131
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,520
just just ask

1132
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,079
next one uh mitigate so i i think this

1133
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,640
one uh i've covered quite a bit already

1134
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,800
but basically just this is the part

1135
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,119
where you open and assign tickets so

1136
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,680
whether you're using jira helpdesk tfs

1137
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,800
or or a combination of all of those or

1138
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,040
i don't know jenkins

1139
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,560
this is the part where you you open

1140
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,280
tickets and just work on stuff so

1141
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,520
uh for this step you can use

1142
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,839
the the

1143
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:38,000
cvss uh

1144
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,400
the cvss score so estimated uh

1145
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,640
vulnerability ranking score as well as

1146
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,960
the impact uh the likelihood of it of it

1147
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,880
happening and so on and so forth you can

1148
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,720
have different criterias based on the on

1149
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,720
your own preferences and

1150
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,680
basically just fix issues

1151
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,680
and uh

1152
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,800
so the last one is uh validate so

1153
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,240
once again i think this is one that i've

1154
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,720
i've started to cover quite a bit but uh

1155
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,200
as dev team gain more maturity it should

1156
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
become easier for them to validate

1157
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,319
security fixes with confidence so uh

1158
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,160
when when you're a bit more junior

1159
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,200
obviously your main focus is going to be

1160
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,880
programming so just understanding your

1161
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,119
tech stack and understanding uh just

1162
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,640
what your code does and how to use

1163
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,160
different tools and and so on and so

1164
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,680
forth but as you get more

1165
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,160
senior and more mature with uh

1166
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,000
with development you might want to start

1167
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,839
branching out into other other areas

1168
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,760
such as security and be able to

1169
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,079
implement and validate security fixes by

1170
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,200
yourself and uh qa is also a good a good

1171
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,440
resource for that so obviously security

1172
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,560
can also

1173
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,119
help validate security issues uh in the

1174
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,000
case of you know like super tricky

1175
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,240
blind sequel injections leading to to

1176
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,160
rce where devs might not have the the

1177
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,000
proper tools to reproduce them or make

1178
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,240
sure that it can be can't be bypassed

1179
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,599
then

1180
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,520
you can you can get the security

1181
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,160
involved as well

1182
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,800
finally uh when so this is the the last

1183
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,079
question

1184
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,240
and uh so what i put there is uh also

1185
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,319
known as just do it uh i think it should

1186
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,359
come to no surprise that uh

1187
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,000
do it early do it often

1188
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,920
and also measure twice cut once

1189
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,040
basically uh it's at the end of the day

1190
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,520
it's not a cost but rather a time saver

1191
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,920
so if there's any like huge architecture

1192
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,920
issues that come out of a of a treadmill

1193
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,960
review first of all great job second uh

1194
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,800
it's much easier to fix them before the

1195
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,720
code has been written before it's been

1196
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,800
shipped to production and before people

1197
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,160
have started using it

1198
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,160
then then it is to do it maybe four or

1199
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,599
five six years down the line where

1200
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,760
people are used to it being like working

1201
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,440
a certain way and you will get a lot

1202
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,040
more friction a lot more resistance when

1203
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,440
you're trying to to fix things and in

1204
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,359
some cases it might uh

1205
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,359
it might really save you so in the case

1206
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,520
where exploitation might have leaked all

1207
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,200
of your customers data then picking it

1208
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,040
picking up on it very early in the

1209
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,280
process uh is going to be super

1210
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,839
beneficial

1211
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,200
so uh

1212
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,119
basically sometimes when you you could

1213
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,960
want to do it is uh when starting a new

1214
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,280
project uh when designing a new feature

1215
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,720
so uh

1216
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,800
there's one concept that is a security

1217
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,480
relevant that can be taken into

1218
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,800
consideration as well so basically uh

1219
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,040
where is this going to be deployed uh

1220
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,720
what kind of data is it going to to

1221
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,119
handle is it going to handle pii so

1222
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,000
personal identification information is

1223
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,760
it going to to handle like super

1224
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,280
sensitive data is it going to have

1225
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,960
access to other production system that

1226
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,040
might be or is it just a very small

1227
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,359
feature that that can't be that can't

1228
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,480
possibly have an impact

1229
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,000
when there's a significant change in

1230
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,839
scope and trust boundaries for example

1231
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,240
if you add new components to your system

1232
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,720
or if uh you're shipping

1233
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,880
an old application to a new environment

1234
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,640
just maybe threat model it to see what

1235
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,960
what impact it could it could have and

1236
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,200
uh now like if if you're not doing chat

1237
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,119
modeling and yet it's a it's a great

1238
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,839
opportunity it's a great uh

1239
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,920
great time to get started uh and don't

1240
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,839
don't aim for perfection basically just

1241
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,440
just do it

1242
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,560
so uh i did intend to to to do a bit of

1243
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,720
a hands-on example unfortunately we

1244
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,960
really won't have a lot of time today so

1245
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,119
i just wanted to give you a very high

1246
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,520
level overview of what uh this could

1247
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,520
look like so basically this is just a

1248
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,400
good old uh data flow diagram with the

1249
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,520
addition here of a truss boundary

1250
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,040
so here we have azure so we're

1251
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,800
leveraging a bunch of services in azure

1252
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,079
so we can assume that it's on the same

1253
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,160
transboundary and

1254
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,400
on the left we have the public internet

1255
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,319
and one very common mistake that we see

1256
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,200
is that people assume that uh

1257
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,119
you can't consider public internet or

1258
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,359
open networks as a single trust boundary

1259
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,119
so in this case it would be a mistake to

1260
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,440
identify the public internet as a trust

1261
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,440
boundary for a simple reason that you

1262
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,200
really have no control over what else

1263
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,960
could be running inside of

1264
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,160
of this environment or uh inside of the

1265
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,240
your public internet or your your public

1266
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,200
uh

1267
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,480
public groups in this case it would

1268
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,240
really only be true to say that the

1269
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,000
right part is a is a trust boundary

1270
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,319
really

1271
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,079
all right then key takeaways really

1272
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,520
quick because i see that we're we're

1273
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,200
about coming up on time

1274
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,760
uh so there's there's basically four of

1275
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,680
them uh first one would be that

1276
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,280
treadmilling is an awesome culture that

1277
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,720
will save you time and you solve

1278
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,359
problems before they happen

1279
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,280
uh i think this one doesn't really need

1280
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,960
any explanations

1281
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,880
shifting security left is the only way

1282
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,560
we will ever be able to face today's

1283
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,319
cyber security challenge

1284
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,480
security is everyone's job you can just

1285
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,160
delegate everything to your security

1286
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,839
team and hope for the best we all need

1287
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,520
to to talk together we'll need to work

1288
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,040
together as a dev as a qa uh

1289
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,359
qa tester or engineer as a security

1290
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,680
professional

1291
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,359
start small and work your way up from

1292
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,160
there uh analysis paralysis is real and

1293
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,920
uh i think it's some treadmill even if

1294
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,680
it's not perfect even if it has huge

1295
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,920
issues it's miles better than having no

1296
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,160
threat model and not taking the time to

1297
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,400
to sit down together and review them so

1298
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,200
just just get started already and

1299
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,960
finally your threat models are only ever

1300
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,720
as good as the actions taken as the

1301
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,160
result of the the risk and

1302
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,119
vulnerabilities identified so uh this

1303
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,640
whole thing is pretty much pointless if

1304
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,720
you're just going to uh

1305
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,280
as i said let's let your diagram sit on

1306
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,440
a sharepoint or a confluence page and

1307
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,520
never touch them or if you're going to

1308
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,040
open tickets and let them rot in your

1309
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,680
back your backlog so you do need to take

1310
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,359
action as a result of

1311
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,160
your threat modeling sessions

1312
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,480
all right then i guess that was about it

1313
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,720
let's see if we have any question

1314
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,598
on the topic

1315
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,560
we had a question on the discord chat if

1316
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,319
you may i can i can read it for you if

1317
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,319
you perfect

1318
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,480
okay we have done that i was asking uh

1319
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,400
what methods have you found work well to

1320
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,319
bring devs and implementation engineers

1321
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,520
to the table

1322
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,440
he says that he finds that in most cases

1323
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,800
they don't want to talk until they have

1324
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,480
a working product and that they want

1325
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,640
like a full thread risk assessment

1326
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,119
performed on he has that it seems like a

1327
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,880
chicken and egg situation

1328
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,560
you can't do a tra until there's an

1329
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,760
architecture and you can't do an

1330
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,440
architecture and so there's a tre then

1331
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,119
nobody is happy

1332
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,520
absolutely yes so uh i think this is

1333
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,599
really a culture thing i think

1334
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,119
depending on the your specific

1335
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,800
environment depending on your your

1336
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,960
development team's culture it might it

1337
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,040
might indeed be really really hard to do

1338
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:21,839
and

1339
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,440
i think at first you're going to get a

1340
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,960
lot more friction this is something that

1341
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,640
you got to slowly uh bring in and

1342
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,800
really make a case for it

1343
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,480
based on on what i've just said what i

1344
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,680
just presented i think there is

1345
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,400
definitely a case to be made that

1346
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,640
threat modeling is super important it's

1347
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,079
going to save you money and it's going

1348
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,920
to solve problems before

1349
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,200
you find them and this is really the

1350
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,640
point that you need to drive home with

1351
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,559
with your dev team and really foster

1352
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,119
that culture of of threat modeling so

1353
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,160
obviously it's it's really not easy and

1354
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,680
even even

1355
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,160
even for me uh so this is this is

1356
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,680
something that that we're really working

1357
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,920
on with our developers and it's been

1358
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,000
working great but there's still some

1359
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,839
friction in some smaller dev teams for

1360
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,359
for the exact reasons that you're that

1361
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,040
you're bringing up so it's uh

1362
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,279
yeah

1363
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,720
do you have any other questions

1364
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,079
it doesn't look like it

1365
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,480
can uh we can end it on this uh just a

1366
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,480
