1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,919
four

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,760
thank you and i'm glad you're here to

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,400
listen to my presentation today uh

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,080
going to try and cover 100 tools it's

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,440
actually going to be more like 50

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,119
probably due to time

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,240
but

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,680
some of the best tools that i've found

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,800
and that have been used by people in

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,240
security industry for a while now

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,279
let me tell you a little bit about

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,000
myself uh

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,800
i'm josh galvez i work as a offensive

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
security operator at log meehan um been

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,120
in the industry for around 15 years or

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,640
more

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,440
and security directly and in it for much

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
longer

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,320
i had my personal credentials uh

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,480
involve much experience in the community

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,719
at defcon at st con

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,280
presenting at various conferences and

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,680
doing what i love

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,399
so

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,280
uh we'll get into it these tools are

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,359
things that i

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,400
pulled and for my own usage and then

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,080
talking to many security industry

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,439
professionals

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,960
and asked them hey what do you use every

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,439
day what's the essential tools what are

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,920
the things that you have to use

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,640
uh to make your life better and these

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,640
are some of the answers that came back

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,720
and so we're gonna go through them

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,759
i'm gonna start with some networking

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,759
tools stuff that

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,000
lets you see stuff on the wire of course

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,520
uh nmap

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,759
is a awesome tool if you haven't used it

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,479
is a network mapper and

42
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,240
it lets you scan a network or a pc or a

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,280
host and enumerate the ports and the

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,000
services available on that workstation

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,280
um i had some fun out of that this

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,320
morning let me share my screen here

47
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,840
and i'll show you an example a live

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,720
example of scan my own media server on

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,840
my network

50
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,680
if i

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,119
change my windows i'm sharing here

52
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,920
to my terminal

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,400
a philippe i'm changing my uh

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
screen do you have to pull that back on

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
to share

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,720
yes thank you so sharing my terminal

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,080
here for example for a live share um

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,840
i scanned my open media about my media

59
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,040
server and it found a whole bunch of

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,160
ports open that i didn't even realize

61
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,360
we're running i should do this more

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,800
often and investigate my own network uh

63
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,720
and it discovered multiple ports here

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,879
and multiple services

65
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,560
i identified particularly the version of

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
ssh that was running uh

67
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,800
which you know which highlights that's

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,200
debian um and many sort of other

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,959
services

70
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,360
inapp is super powerful i'm gonna switch

71
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,480
one more time here back to my slides

72
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,480
this

73
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,040
and i think i just take my slide a

74
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,079
little longer okay

75
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,640
so back to my slides here

76
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,599
thank you um

77
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,640
and memphis has also super powerful

78
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,000
tools and that's where the basic flag is

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,519
some of the things you should learn

80
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,360
with any tools what it can do so here's

81
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,280
some examples for scanning for ips

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,040
identifying operating systems or doing a

83
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,720
mass scan of all the ports uh one of my

84
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,319
favorite flags is of course if you're

85
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,400
using an nmap interactively is the dash

86
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,040
v to make it more verbose

87
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,799
okay next tool wireshark uh wireshark is

88
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,599
by far one of my favorites uh

89
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,599
in all sorts of worlds and whether

90
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,840
you're offensive or defensive uh you're

91
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,120
able to find out all sorts of

92
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,720
information about the environment that

93
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,080
you're in

94
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,480
just passively listening

95
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,080
this morning i was testing this again

96
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,680
and saying okay what's on my network and

97
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,120
i found out that i have this spanning

98
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
tree protocol stp running on my network

99
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,200
i didn't realize that my

100
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
google fiber

101
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,440
router was running an stp a great attack

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,199
surface to be investigated

103
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,520
wireshark is cool

104
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,919
it not only will does network protocol

105
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,240
decoding but it can decode many many

106
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,680
other protocols so whether or not your

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,160
cap if you if you want to capture a usb

108
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,440
you can

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,000
have wireshark capture usb packets uh

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
off your windows or your mac or linux

111
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,600
workstations and you can decode usb

112
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
protocols you need code bluetooth you

113
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,720
can decode uh cam bus from automobiles

114
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,440
so wireshark is a great protocol decoder

115
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
primarily used for networks but for many

116
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,240
other uh interfaces as well so get to

117
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,400
know wireshark and use it you'll find

118
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,320
that you're a surprising amount of data

119
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,560
that's not encrypted and easily decoded

120
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,840
okay so that's it for network tools so

121
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,000
let's go into some defensive tools

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,120
uh

123
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,440
of course your logs um

124
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,360
many people use splunk or an elk stack

125
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,800
or gray log

126
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,199
all of these are great tools for uh

127
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,080
gathering your log data get to know your

128
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,320
log interfaces just how you can parse

129
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,160
those logs how you and identify the

130
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
information in them

131
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
if you don't

132
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,479
from a defensive side you'll be pretty

133
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,639
sad so there's a lot of powerful things

134
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,880
you can do with splunk even as a home

135
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,600
user as a beginning user in

136
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,720
security

137
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,680
splunk has a free tier that you can

138
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,840
throw hundreds of megabytes of logs into

139
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,639
it daily um and get to know it and its

140
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,120
features its powers

141
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,000
okay so continuing on autopsy autopsy is

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,160
a cool tool it's uh for digital

143
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,720
forensics and it can take a

144
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,400
disc image

145
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,240
whether it be from an iphone android a

146
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,840
windows workstation

147
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,520
any device you want you take a disk

148
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,400
image into autopsy and it will

149
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,479
identify and

150
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,199
parse out tons of data

151
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,800
from that disk image

152
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
it will identify pictures applications

153
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,319
documents uh deleted files hidden

154
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,880
partitions et cetera et cetera and let

155
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,960
you parse through it and carve out the

156
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,120
data you're looking for so uh from the

157
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,400
defensive side if you're look you've got

158
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,600
a disconnect you've got a machine that

159
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,199
you're concerned about that's gone

160
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,560
offline um and you've got a mirror a dd

161
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,880
of that drive autopsy is a great way to

162
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,680
tear it apart

163
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,400
that being said as a compliment

164
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,680
another tool you want to look at is

165
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,199
volatility

166
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,479
volatility handles similar to autopsy

167
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,319
but on the memory side

168
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,280
so

169
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,199
it's a there's a shocking amount of data

170
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,120
and private data and personal

171
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,560
information and

172
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,120
malware that's running or anything else

173
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,919
that sits in the ram of your workstation

174
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,680
and so if you ever are curious or you've

175
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,840
seen a compromise workstation

176
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,520
and it's important that you take a

177
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,360
memory snapshot of that so that you can

178
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,520
tear it apart uh volatility has all

179
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,039
sorts of plug-ins all you do things like

180
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,919
even extract the ssh keys from a running

181
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,240
workstation or any server so if you've

182
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,880
got an active ssh session to a device

183
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,400
and volatility will let you extract the

184
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,720
ssh keys from it

185
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,199
so that you can then use those ssh keys

186
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,280
in wireshark

187
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,639
to decrypt that traffic

188
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,120
and so once was encrypted now you've got

189
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,479
the stitch keys you can decrypt you see

190
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,639
what's being what is taking place live

191
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,319
in that tunnel it's pretty awesome

192
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,120
so how do you get these memory dumps uh

193
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,520
multiple ways uh linux memory extractor

194
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,840
called lime is a great tool it works on

195
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,120
android as well

196
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,960
uh it lets you

197
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,039
insert a kernel module uh that's

198
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,319
portable and then dump the memory very

199
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,280
awesome

200
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,039
now on the windows side uh there's a

201
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,680
tool kit called win pet pee pneum uh

202
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,000
that does something similar and lets you

203
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,240
dump the process memory or crash dump or

204
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,400
core dump

205
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,720
so that you can then carry a part in

206
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
whatever tooling you have but volatility

207
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,879
is awesome and the one that i've had

208
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,680
good experiences with

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,400
okay so still on the defensive side uh

210
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,680
you need some vulnerability assessment

211
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,360
tools there's tons and tons of options

212
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,319
out there um i've you know the net

213
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,719
nessus is a uh industry standards and

214
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,958
that's been around for a long time uh it

215
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,320
has some free options out there

216
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,679
but uh something that's really quick and

217
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,679
easy to let you see your attack surface

218
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,880
and see a footprint of what's in your

219
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,959
network and available

220
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,800
okay moving on uh let's talk about some

221
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,599
intelligence tools

222
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,440
uh stuff that can be used for open

223
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,680
source intelligence things to go find

224
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,279
stuff out on the internet and to

225
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,519
identify some common problems uh find

226
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,839
out information that's available

227
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,320
so uh one of the most awesome tools out

228
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,839
there what's something that i've found

229
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,399
extremely useful is showdown

230
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,120
showdown is a cool tool because they

231
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,040
take and they scan the entire internet

232
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,000
regularly they scan for open ports they

233
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,560
log what they find http headers uh

234
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,519
index files uh headers on all four sorts

235
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,279
of various various other services both

236
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,600
tcp and udp um so and i use it

237
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,880
frequently um so showdown uh one of my

238
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,000
most recent uses is i was researching a

239
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,640
vulnerability into

240
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,279
a vulnerability on uh the end phase

241
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,080
envoy uh solar panel microinverter

242
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,519
systems

243
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,720
uh these are systems that uh

244
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,200
connect your solar panels to your house

245
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,959
mains and they log

246
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,360
your usage to itself back to the power

247
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,440
company or

248
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,680
just for your own personal laundry stats

249
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,000
but these devices are smart and so

250
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
they'll get plugged into a home network

251
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,800
or just connect wirelessly and

252
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
are able to give you a web interface

253
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,640
like everything else to

254
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,959
get that data well

255
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,160
in research

256
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,720
found that the endpoint on face envoy

257
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,680
has a hard-coded a hardcore algorithm to

258
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,800
generate a unique password for each

259
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,079
device

260
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,279
that's based off of the serial number

261
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,760
device well um

262
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,160
these devices also use upnp and will

263
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,839
punch holes in

264
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,279
your router as you can see here my

265
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,959
shoulder shutdown search uh simply

266
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,000
searching for on phase on void um pulls

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,720
up

268
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,399
you know the 1987 000 devices here

269
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,079
that

270
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,200
are online and exposing http services

271
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,040
that all happen to be vulnerable to some

272
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,640
cbds out there

273
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,040
with default passwords

274
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,600
so uh people could log in and

275
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
do all sorts of things to these devices

276
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,680
but so showdown has a nice archive of

277
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,560
that to find out information whether you

278
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,079
want to search your own networks or

279
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,079
you're looking for a account of other

280
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,000
vulnerabilities uh showdown is a great

281
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,399
way to gather intelligence

282
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,560
another tool that i enjoy is hybrid

283
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,079
analysis.com

284
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,600
it integrates with virustotal uh

285
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,959
runs applications in crowdstrike or

286
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,120
application databases um

287
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,200
it runs things in various other vms and

288
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,800
will give you a full report on an

289
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,200
application it'll dump out say this file

290
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
has this behavior it's

291
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,279
flagged by these malware has these

292
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,800
indicators in it

293
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,399
hybrid analysis does

294
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,640
multiple scans from various services and

295
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,920
and then

296
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,839
aggregates those details so from a

297
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,279
defensive or intelligence point of view

298
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,120
it's a great tool to tear apart a

299
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,839
unknown file and look for what might be

300
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,040
known about it by others

301
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,800
another tool similar to showdown is

302
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,279
census.io

303
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,440
very similar tool once again they take

304
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,279
census of the entire internet and gather

305
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,760
that data

306
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,760
so about some expensive tools

307
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,760
uh wp scan uh wordpress is the primary

308
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,320
is the predominant uh content management

309
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,440
system on the internet these days it's

310
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,760
simple to set up um

311
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,480
but

312
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,120
it often gets out of date and uh

313
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,320
if you want to be aware what's going on

314
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,440
with the wordpress instance you've come

315
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
across or you're trying to defend your

316
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,360
own i strongly suggest you use wp scan

317
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
on your wordpress instances

318
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,959
it pulls out tons and tons of useful

319
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,760
information about it instance um is able

320
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,160
to help you detect what plugins are used

321
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,000
what themes are used either for your own

322
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,200
uh

323
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,880
identify the surface attack or they will

324
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,720
reference uh known vulnerabilities and

325
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,959
report them to you

326
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,079
nicto

327
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,639
web server scanner so nikto is a great

328
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,600
tool

329
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,279
it

330
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,200
is very effective identifying

331
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,120
vulnerabilities in

332
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,920
known versions of apache and genex etc

333
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,360
and identifying many

334
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:03,440
misconfigurations or problems in host

335
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,680
configurations here's a simple scan of a

336
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,760
random domain of mine that i

337
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
did yesterday that looks like okay i

338
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,440
should probably run some updates on it

339
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,200
um but identified all sorts of uh

340
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,040
interesting directories that are

341
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,560
low-hanging fruits um identifying

342
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,800
the versions of apache open sounds using

343
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,399
which for an old version of php that's

344
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,480
still installed on the host um so nikto

345
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,279
is a great tool for web server scanners

346
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,560
i strongly suggest you give it a try

347
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,240
uh hashcat if you're into password

348
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,519
cracking uh hashcat is cool it does

349
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,720
features a cpu cracker and a gpu cracker

350
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,240
um so it can use whatever resources you

351
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,240
have available and it is the de facto

352
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,480
standard these days um for password

353
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,240
tracking

354
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,560
and so if you have a hash of a password

355
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
either taken from a domain

356
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,920
a

357
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,720
a domain controller or a

358
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,560
mysql database or wherever you happen to

359
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,880
find your hashes uh hashcat's the tool

360
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,959
to run to crack those it will do a

361
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,639
simple brute force but what's more

362
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,000
important about hashcat is that it can

363
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,120
take word lists and then take rule sets

364
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,920
to apply to those word lists and will

365
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,680
let you

366
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,320
create all sorts of variations and rules

367
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,880
to alter your brute force attempts so

368
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,800
you're not just trying every single

369
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,240
letter and every single combination but

370
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,480
you're using intelligence to crack those

371
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,199
passwords quickly

372
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,560
uh metasploit the de facto framework for

373
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,199
uh exploits um

374
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,600
nearly every cve that gets exploits uh

375
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
will end up in a metasploit database and

376
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,399
uh have an easy to exploit tool uh that

377
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,040
you can then utilize um

378
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,920
from a cli to get what to get and

379
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,240
maintain and

380
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,839
post exploit to

381
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,000
exfiltrate your data so

382
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,240
metasploit is an awesome tool it's built

383
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,920
in ruby it runs on linux runs on mac os

384
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,360
you can run it in

385
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,680
windows the

386
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,440
subsystem for linux

387
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
and it's a great tool for

388
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,920
exploiting environments

389
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,399
once again that you can spend days on a

390
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,000
metasploit training but this is just an

391
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,360
introduction to give you a moment to say

392
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,560
hey oh yeah i should check out that tool

393
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,000
uh burp suite i want to show you a

394
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,279
little bit about berkshire so i will go

395
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,600
ahead and switch my display here and

396
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,680
give you a quick demo but burp suite is

397
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,760
a very

398
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,560
handy tool even in the non-commercial

399
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,680
free version

400
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,040
but the pro version is totally worth the

401
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,720
money that it costs

402
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,880
to

403
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,680
manipulate and edit and change

404
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,000
http requests on the fly so let's stop

405
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,600
sharing my screen here and switch to

406
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,920
burp suite

407
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,519
just a moment while i wait for it to

408
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,880
launch

409
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,480
starting kind of slow this morning

410
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,320
okay it's going to take too long i don't

411
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,920
know why it's not starting thank you

412
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,399
live demos

413
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,680
i'm just going back to my slides

414
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,800
but so burp suites cool um let me make

415
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,839
sure that i'm presenting

416
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,320
here emery or philippe

417
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,360
can you

418
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,720
go ahead and present my slides again

419
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,480
thank you appreciate it

420
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,160
so um

421
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,680
burp suite's awesome because basically

422
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,199
what you're able to do is you're able to

423
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,600
use a proxy uh to

424
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,079
intercept your http communications and

425
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,560
it also does web sockets uh the

426
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,519
thing i want to point out to you with

427
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,440
burp suite that makes it really simple

428
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,800
that a lot of people miss is that

429
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,760
there's a built-in web browser so if you

430
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,880
click on the proxy tab and

431
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,640
then go to intercept you're able to

432
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,559
um select

433
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,839
and click open browser

434
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,359
um with this it will launch the built-in

435
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,959
browser that already has the appropriate

436
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,439
certificates installed for uh

437
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,880
https interception and will allow you to

438
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,600
easily modify a request before it gets

439
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,960
sent to the server or modify your

440
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,240
response before it gets back to your

441
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,320
browser

442
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,160
and with the built-in

443
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,080
browser that's based on chrome it makes

444
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,600
it really easy

445
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
literally lowers the barrier to entry to

446
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,360
manipulation

447
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,039
another tool that's similar to burp

448
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,039
suite that

449
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,640
isn't built in java and is a little bit

450
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,039
more native is fiddler

451
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,440
uh it's an alternative um

452
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,120
people have their preferences um so

453
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,440
check it out check out fiddler

454
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,080
if you're working in apis

455
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,760
uh whether what doesn't matter what kind

456
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,440
of api uh

457
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,960
but web-based api um rest apis json apis

458
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,160
et cetera et cetera

459
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,080
you want to check out postman postman

460
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,400
makes it really simple to

461
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,360
parse swagger files uh parse xml

462
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,559
explanations um and then to be able to

463
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,640
uh modify those requests and work with

464
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,360
those apis for fuzzing et cetera postman

465
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,880
is a extremely useful and convenient

466
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,280
tool for that approach

467
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,080
uh from the red team and offensive side

468
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,520
you want to make sure you're documenting

469
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,760
your approach and you're reporting the

470
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,360
hardest part about that is gathering the

471
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,880
evidence gathering the screenshots

472
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,480
recording the times

473
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,039
as you do it and so a tool that has

474
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,960
proven extremely useful for many people

475
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,080
is the tool developed by

476
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,840
um

477
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,960
the

478
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,520
crew at verizon the paranoid and it's

479
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,480
called a shirt and it is a tool for just

480
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,039
that purpose it has a server base

481
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,120
that has a really easy used front end

482
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,360
and then it also has a agent that you

483
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,039
can gather on your workstations to

484
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,559
gather screenshots gather terminal logs

485
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,120
etc etc to correlate all that to make

486
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,640
your report writing simple

487
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,520
so let's talk about some reverse

488
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,240
engineering tools

489
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,360
um if you are reverse engineering some

490
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,880
windows binaries

491
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,360
net framework or even mono i strongly

492
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
suggest dn spy

493
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,840
it gets you most the time gets some very

494
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,160
very clean readable code uh almost back

495
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,440
as close as you can to source without

496
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,200
comments so uh

497
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,799
totally check out dnspy for reverse

498
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,480
engineering and decompiling uh.net

499
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,240
binaries

500
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,200
um a few years ago the united states nsa

501
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,679
released guidra um

502
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,160
ghidra is an extremely powerful

503
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,919
uh

504
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,799
decompiler and disassembler um

505
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,160
that works for multiple platforms and so

506
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,360
be it

507
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,440
windows linux mac os et cetera it's

508
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,919
built in java but also will decompile

509
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,240
and disassemble multiple processor and

510
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,159
platforms everything from mips all the

511
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,919
way up to x86 x64 and r64 etcetera

512
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,159
etcetera um lots of community plug-in

513
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,720
has supported it and it's very very

514
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,320
effective

515
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,840
the same

516
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,440
while you're decompiling and uh

517
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,000
disassembling ida pro is the de facto it

518
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,440
has been for a long time until giger

519
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,400
came around

520
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,280
um

521
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,640
but they recently released a free

522
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,960
version that's actually useful and with

523
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,880
their cloud decompiler it's very

524
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,159
effective and can

525
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,799
turn up some very pretty results so

526
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,480
if you are a student or you're getting

527
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,960
in started in the security industry do

528
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,360
check out ida free um with their cloud

529
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,440
to compiler it's worth checking out

530
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,320
um for

531
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,840
mac os i've actually come to really love

532
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,640
binary ninja though it's not at all ex

533
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,039
specific to it um

534
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,280
it will work on multiple platforms it's

535
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,039
relatively cheap and it's a new

536
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,200
converter to the field but their

537
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,360
ai and machine learning mechanisms and

538
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,159
the way that it presents and a binary

539
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,760
and application

540
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,000
is very very useful

541
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
i feel like they do a great job

542
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,400
still coming along on their

543
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,840
decompiler but they're dissimilar is

544
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,840
awesome

545
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,280
now if you are decompiling or needing to

546
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,320
approach mac marco binaries for mac os

547
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,200
um you do not want to skip hopper hopper

548
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,080
specializes in uh mac os stuff it'll do

549
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,720
other binaries but uh specialize in maco

550
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,120
and object objective c decompilation

551
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,760
so check out hopper

552
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,080
it makes things a lot clearer sometimes

553
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,799
totally worth it

554
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,080
so everything else some of the other

555
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,080
tools some of those things that as a

556
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,039
security pro you don't want to miss

557
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,640
learn sql

558
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,080
uh yeah the structure query language the

559
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,360
thing that you use to talk to sql

560
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,840
databases or mysql or postgres learn

561
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,120
this quill um sql is going to give you a

562
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,400
foot up in many many jobs and many tools

563
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,520
whether you're

564
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,799
trying to exploit web applications and

565
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,480
you're doing sql injection or you're

566
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,600
just trying to understand the data

567
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,360
that's available to you and you need to

568
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
parse it or categorize it or

569
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,400
work with it sql has helped me for years

570
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,200
and has come in useful many many jobs

571
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,159
um

572
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,720
but just because i know and understand

573
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,200
how to join how to union how to do sub

574
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,919
queries how to write functions and views

575
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,760
and and use all the basics sql

576
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,679
so take a minute to take a few days

577
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,000
learn sql so that you can clear sizes

578
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,159
familiarize yourself with it and i

579
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,640
promise it'll help your life

580
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,720
another tool to trade uh the shocked me

581
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,440
i never thought of that but was excel uh

582
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,880
as i queried everybody and i said hey

583
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,000
what tools are essential to your

584
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
day-to-day job what do you use and the

585
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,600
answer came back numerous times was

586
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,559
excel

587
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,640
more than just using a spreadsheet but

588
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,880
being able to write macros being able to

589
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
write functions being able to use a

590
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
little bit of vbscript

591
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,200
or just email these advanced functions

592
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
in a in an excel

593
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,679
cell um to

594
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,200
parse and pivot table et cetera et

595
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,640
cetera has provided extreme value to

596
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,559
many people in security industry and

597
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,880
parsing logs and identifying information

598
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,080
and generating useful reports

599
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,360
uh awesome tool cyber chef this one is

600
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,919
built by the gchq which is the british

601
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,559
intelligence agency um

602
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,679
and it's extremely useful for

603
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,039
handling

604
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,360
data um let's go ahead and try this one

605
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,480
more time let's see if i can do a screen

606
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,000
share i'll give you some examples of

607
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,760
what cybership can do

608
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,960
this one here on screen is an example of

609
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,080
extracting urls from an emoteet

610
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,159
malware document and so you drop it you

611
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,799
just drag a malware dock into cyberchef

612
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,720
and this will extract all the urls and

613
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,080
deepen them make them safe for you to

614
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,600
see but let me show you an example of

615
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,360
some other cool things they do

616
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,880
let's try this one more time so this is

617
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,679
a demo we're seeing

618
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,960
stop sharing

619
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,760
share screen

620
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,480
so the url that i had in my slide there

621
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,919
is actually a url to repo has uh

622
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,880
hundreds of uh useful recipes for

623
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,080
cyber chef i'll pull that back up in a

624
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,039
minute

625
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,799
but here's my cyber chef screen

626
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
and let's say the shame popular okay so

627
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,520
a cyber ship is cool cause you take some

628
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,480
basic input here this is my

629
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
test input

630
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,960
and it lets you drag functions so you

631
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,919
can take an input such as my test input

632
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,679
and you can say let's convert it to

633
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,159
base64 and it'll give you instantly here

634
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,799
in the output the base64 output of your

635
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,120
stream

636
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,559
let's take for example let's say i was

637
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,320
trying to uh

638
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,799
exploit a file from a server and i have

639
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,520
a random image

640
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,840
here and i drag it into my

641
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,120
and on server right take a cap this file

642
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
pipe it to base64 and then it gives me

643
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,720
some base64 output

644
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,880
of a string well i could then paste that

645
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,039
string into my input and i could say

646
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,840
let's take it

647
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,360
so let's see my input and let's take it

648
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,399
to base 64.

649
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:43,240
and so the 264 and it's going to give me

650
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,159
okay this file is going to crash my

651
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,679
browser

652
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,600
there we go so there we go uh

653
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,440
there's basics for output well i could

654
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,640
copy that basically before i put my

655
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,559
input and it would explain display the

656
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,879
file

657
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,559
um

658
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,080
cybershift is awesome all sorts of

659
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,960
tooling

660
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,120
handles files media formats handles text

661
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,960
and other formats spend some time

662
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,840
learning clicking through here and

663
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,360
learning the various tools it can do

664
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,679
also things with the ssl and pen key

665
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,960
parsing it can do all sorts of

666
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,720
encryption descriptions uh everything

667
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,080
from uh roth 13 uh encoding to

668
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,320
encryption such as aes tooling

669
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
even they have implementers for stupid

670
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,039
things like enigma machine um but they

671
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,760
can decode text parse urls uh detect

672
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,840
file types even do just do magic on a

673
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,760
file and say hey tell me about this what

674
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,120
do you see and it will automatically

675
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,918
report back to you

676
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,000
simonship is awesome

677
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,320
um it's a tool that gets used for many

678
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,400
things and um

679
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,159
you know for when you're not scripting

680
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,200
you're not writing your own tooling

681
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,760
instantly cyber ship is a great way to

682
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,559
provide an introduction to that

683
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,000
okay my slide should back here on screen

684
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,480
in a moment

685
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,600
philippe if you could uh pull those

686
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,559
slides back on screen for me

687
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,880
thank you so much um and so once again

688
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,600
for example base64 is uh so back here

689
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,960
that tool up the

690
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
url on the uh

691
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,399
matt not max

692
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,240
repository uh for cybershift has a lot

693
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,760
of cool recipes that you want to check

694
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,960
out

695
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,720
and base64 is useful tool i use it all

696
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,159
the time in excel trading data between

697
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,360
servers piping stuff between places it

698
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,760
basically takes a binary of any type and

699
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,919
is able to represent it in a simple

700
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,559
copy-pastable ascii text that you can

701
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,640
then is portable

702
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,480
another tool that's important to learn

703
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,440
that's useful is curl curls is more than

704
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,159
just a grab an http website it supports

705
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,960
dozens of protocols uh some of them

706
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,399
rarer than

707
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,799
you'd expect some of them really calming

708
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,799
like oh i didn't know it did that uh for

709
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,279
example curl can do imac for pop uh or

710
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,520
older stuff like gopher um

711
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,840
so learn curl uh go read the man pages

712
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,399
for turtle it has dozens and dozens and

713
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,760
dozens of

714
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,520
options that make him can make it very

715
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,880
convenient to do all sorts of things

716
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,919
with it

717
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,240
but don't forget about wget either wget

718
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,159
is simpler than curl uh blacks a lot

719
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,200
fewer options but one of the cool

720
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
features that it does have is it has

721
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,880
recursive download so it can parse an

722
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,039
entire page and download all the files

723
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,640
that are linked on it or all the images

724
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,200
or any of the content so uh learn how to

725
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,679
use kernel wget

726
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,640
another tool that's way useful the jq um

727
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,399
i'm not gonna do a demo here here

728
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,840
because it parts just jumping between

729
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,159
the presentations and windows is proving

730
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,600
to be a challenge

731
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,559
but jq is cool it allows you to take a

732
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,760
json file and make it pretty

733
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,919
which is useful first of all but beyond

734
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,480
that it lets you parse it and so you can

735
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,200
see in the example in my screenshot here

736
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,679
that i have a type jq and i'm just

737
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,880
showing the data element from every

738
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,720
object in this array

739
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,080
so i can even go farther and i can say

740
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
oh show the data element and then show

741
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,760
me just all of the account ids or et

742
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,279
cetera et cetera and so it lets you

743
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,200
parse and

744
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,240
filter and search and

745
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,200
process json data in a structured way

746
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,880
without having to write it in some other

747
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,840
prescription language

748
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,200
learn the windows subsystem for linux if

749
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,919
you're on windows

750
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,880
they've recently added the wscl that

751
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,679
gives you lots of capabilities to run

752
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,279
linux processes

753
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,679
so you can use gnu tools and do lots of

754
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,640
this in an environment that's

755
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,399
comfortable to you

756
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,880
another tooling that i've recently grown

757
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,200
in love with is called proxy chains

758
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,039
proxy chains is a linux

759
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,960
framework allows you to hook

760
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,760
the

761
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,919
network functions of a binary so you can

762
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,840
redirect it to a proxy so if you have an

763
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,279
application that you're trying to

764
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,880
investigate one understands behaviors

765
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,520
but it doesn't respect or have any proxy

766
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,640
settings

767
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,720
this lets you do it at a lower level so

768
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,640
that you can then redirect it to a proxy

769
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,559
for

770
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,880
investigation such as in

771
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,440
burp suite or in other tooling

772
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,840
uh don't forget to virtualize um

773
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,960
all time i've talked to people saying

774
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,720
well i can't run those tools

775
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,880
and like we'll join our virtual machine

776
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,120
if you have a mac run vmware virtualbox

777
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,440
or qmu if you've got windows or linux

778
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,679
you can run all these as well and spin

779
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,520
up a mac os virtual machine on your

780
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,880
windows box spin up a uh ms virtual

781
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,200
machine spin up a mac or

782
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,679
any virtual machine and you can run this

783
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,559
whole operating system in your in your

784
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,640
base operating system and and

785
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,120
run these tools that may not be allowed

786
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,600
or that you may not have access to

787
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,719
so don't forget to virtualize

788
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
i learned to use grip grip is another

789
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,600
one of those basic uh command line tools

790
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,559
it's available on mac os or linux

791
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,880
or windows with wsl and lets you search

792
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,640
and parse and use regular expressions

793
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
grep is extremely powerful there's lots

794
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,240
of various versions of it and

795
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,159
expressions of it um this url will let

796
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,919
you compare them but

797
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,000
learn to use grep

798
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,600
uh one thing that came up all the time

799
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,440
that people loved was their advanced

800
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,240
text editors uh vs code

801
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,559
uh notepad plus plus on windows sublime

802
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,440
text across all platforms bb edit on mac

803
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,399
os

804
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,480
these

805
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,320
tools all support advanced uh pearl uh

806
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,720
pearl compatible or regex type

807
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,880
search and replaces and have plugin

808
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,200
systems so

809
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,240
learn

810
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,159
to use an advanced text editor learn its

811
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,919
plugins and learn powers and the tools

812
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,840
that are available behind it for you and

813
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,799
which

814
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,679
in the things that you do

815
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,919
okay so getting close to the end here

816
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,360
but i want to talk about the collections

817
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,679
a lot of these tools you can find

818
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,200
piecemeal or are already installed on

819
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,320
your environments

820
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,360
but there's

821
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,760
distributions of windows and linux that

822
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,360
also come with them

823
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,080
pre-installed for your convenience

824
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,320
kali linux once in upon time known as

825
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,519
backtrack

826
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,480
it was a tool that um

827
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,080
it is a collection of tools that you can

828
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,760
run into virtual machine or install bare

829
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,200
metal that has a lot of stuff

830
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,360
pre-installed and uh also lets you

831
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,000
install it with package managers

832
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,519
so if you're wanting a linux tool it has

833
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,200
this check out cali

834
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
if you want a windows environment that

835
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,720
has all this tooling and already

836
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,080
installed

837
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,559
then check out the commando vm

838
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,519
so it's deployed by mandiant um but it

839
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,880
is a

840
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,559
set of scripts that lets you convert

841
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,120
your windows installation into

842
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,720
a

843
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,480
penetration testing and security

844
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,159
distribution it installs a package

845
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,320
manager grabs tons of packages and sets

846
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,760
it up into environment that is effective

847
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,760
uh in the same note they have flare vm

848
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,679
which is for the defensive side or

849
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,360
incident response side of the house and

850
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,039
so it's all locked from another a lot of

851
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,559
common tools but then

852
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,200
tools that are more focused for

853
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,600
the blue team

854
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,080
okay and finally um

855
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,480
play capture the flag yeah if you are

856
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,200
trying to learn security tooling

857
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,360
capture the flag is a great way to do it

858
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,200
in a capture the flag especially here

859
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,559
hack fest and either the beginner ctf or

860
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,279
the actual ctf for with the competitive

861
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,200
or the uh

862
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,440
non-competitive play mode um

863
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,559
it

864
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,720
is structured to allow you to learn new

865
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,640
tools to learn

866
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,559
new ways to accomplish things

867
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,320
so if you want to learn new tooling

868
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,279
we'll play capture the flag

869
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,880
be curious

870
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,399
one of the primary attributes and

871
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,640
primary tools that is effective for me

872
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,080
and that i find people ask for all the

873
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,840
time is somebody that's curious

874
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,159
um they want people that

875
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,279
ask questions they want people that

876
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,240
will dig into it and try to understand

877
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,120
why

878
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,679
and how it works

879
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,839
so

880
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,679
those tools i'm asking well why does it

881
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,800
do this

882
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,079
how did it

883
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,440
authenticate me on this site when i was

884
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,760
already on that site how

885
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,040
how does this packet get from here to

886
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,320
here ask those questions and be curious

887
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,399
those tools will

888
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,320
be something that you should

889
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,199
use every day as a security professional

890
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,719
and that's all the slides i have i got

891
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,079
through those way fast because my demos

892
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,239
are broken um but

893
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,599
thank you for coming to listen to my

894
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,040
talk and

895
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,560
thank you hopefully some of these tools

896
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,719

897
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,598
something that you hadn't seen before

898
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,399
