1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,799
thank you very much and thank you to all

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,509
of you for something patiently while I

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,730
figured out what my right and my left

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,980
are no I got it wrong again when my

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,269
right my left and I'm anyway thank you

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,120
for sitting patiently while I figured

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:18,779
out how to make the computer work so

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,820
just to be clear manage expectations

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,820
early on which is a theme we're going to

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,890
talk about a little bit this is not a

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,420
technical talk this is not about the

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,300
technical response in crisis management

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,529
if you are jonesing for a technical talk

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,570
I'll give you a minute you can hop up

15
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,460
and walk out that is not what you're

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,090
gonna get here we're gonna talk about

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,000
the other part of crisis management the

18
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,730
management part which is the bit that

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,850
like often doesn't come quite so

20
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,648
naturally to technical people and that's

21
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,500
why I'm here

22
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,090
so who the hell am i well firstly I'm

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,730
somebody that discovered you can really

24
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:01,370
find anything on the Internet

25
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,370
including a cat ass trophy I

26
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,820
I also apparently like pictures of cats

27
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:12,090
but I am NOT a crazy cat lady no matter

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,279
what anyone tells you so I'm Jen Ellis I

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,009
work at rapid7

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,250
and I part of my job at rapid7 is that I

31
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,530
manage crisis so when something happens

32
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,150
and like clearly nothing bad ever

33
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,390
happens that rapid7

34
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,090
don't worry if you're a customer we're

35
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,189
perfect

36
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,380
but should something happen I would be

37
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,059
the person who would basically boss

38
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,649
everyone else around I'm very good at

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,009
bossing people around

40
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,130
and I've also I came from a

41
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,390
communications background and I had a

42
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,250
strong focus on reputation management

43
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,710
and I've worked with actually a lot of

44
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,310
different companies on crisis response

45
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:56,429
and more recently when rapid7 launched

46
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,770
incident response services if we had a

47
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,350
customer who said hey we also need help

48
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,670
with the non technical side I would be

49
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,579
the person drafted in so I've worked

50
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,220
with a lot of different companies on on

51
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,068
crisis response so what do we mean about

52
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,260
crisis and here's the thing like if you

53
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:17,010
read pretty much any head

54
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,290
I never you will know that as a security

55
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,200
professional you're super unlikely to be

56
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,769
able to avoid crisis forever I think the

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,450
latest stats say like you're 728 percent

58
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,640
likely to have a breach in the next five

59
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,958
minutes so you guys should probably not

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,010
be here you should be off dealing with

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,099
the breaches so it could be breach it

62
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:42,689
could be a vulnerability

63
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:44,429
it could be somebody internally doing

64
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:46,078
something really stupid we had one of

65
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,299
those recently I will tell you about a

66
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:52,440
little bit whatever the situation is

67
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:55,739
crises come up they happen all the time

68
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,900
and as security professionals it's a

69
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:01,079
reality specifically of your world and

70
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,450
while you may be more naturally oriented

71
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:08,120
towards the technical response the

72
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:10,440
chances are that you may have to help or

73
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,680
participate in the sort of larger

74
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,170
response so bad news I really like

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,970
audience participation so I don't ask

76
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,339
quick show of hands how many people in

77
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,849
the room think that they have worked on

78
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,699
a security crisis at some point all

79
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:32,760
right a lot of you how many people feel

80
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:36,829
like they nailed it awesome from how

81
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:40,019
many people work for a security company

82
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:42,449
okay so for all of those of you who

83
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,400
don't work at security companies the

84
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:46,859
chances are that if you have a security

85
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,810
incident the other parts of your

86
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:51,299
business are going to be less familiar

87
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,489
with the the dynamics of security

88
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,500
incidents and you're gonna have to take

89
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,599
more of a leadership role you're gonna

90
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,000
have to help coach them you're gonna

91
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,190
have to get into territory that you

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,139
don't normally think of as yours like

93
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,569
the chances are your comms team if

94
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,250
you're not at a security company

95
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:10,978
probably not experts on how to

96
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,680
communicate around a breach probably

97
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:15,810
also not experts on how to communicate

98
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,150
to security professionals but you guys

99
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,409
are security professionals hopefully you

100
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,590
guys are security professionals right I

101
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:26,370
didn't come to the wrong conference okay

102
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:28,289
somebody over there is so you

103
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,000
can help them you can tell them like

104
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,820
what are you as a security professional

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,500
want to hear what do you need to know in

106
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,419
a situation where you're on the

107
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,680
receiving end so you're gonna end up

108
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,289
having to get involved one way or

109
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,550
another so that's why we're here so

110
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,380
we're going to talk about six things

111
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,180
which is an awkward number I try to do

112
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,650
five but there were just too many I try

113
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,810
to do seven because it's rapid seven

114
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,780
just six is what it is okay we're just

115
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,520
gonna suck it up so I'm gonna walk

116
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:58,888
through each of these individual items

117
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,359
one by one and and I will say like the

118
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,830
legal requirements piece is really sort

119
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,240
of part of planning but it's so

120
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,699
important that I call that as a separate

121
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,430
thing so let's get started we're just

122
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:11,900
dive straight into it so the first thing

123
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:15,289
and I cannot underscore this enough is

124
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,580
above all you need to start planning

125
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:20,310
preparation preparation preparation it

126
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:23,550
is the most important thing you can do

127
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:26,490
so again show of hands how many people

128
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:29,970
have a crisis response plan in their

129
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:32,280
organization oh that is pitiful people

130
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:36,510
come on now all right how many people

131
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:38,280
who have a crisis response plan think

132
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,960
that it's really good and again I'm just

133
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,700
gonna keep my arm down because like

134
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,130
we're working on revamping ours right

135
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,870
now okay good one brave soul thinks that

136
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,620
is really good how many people have

137
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:53,610
participated in a crisis preparation

138
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:57,570
tabletop exercise okay I better better

139
00:05:53,610 --> 00:06:00,110
show of hands there more than one all

140
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:03,240
right okay so it gives you an idea that

141
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,750
where we need to be is not where we are

142
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,780
today

143
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,060
and here's the thing nobody really wants

144
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,070
to get caught in like a snowstorm in the

145
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:15,240
middle of winter with no plan right like

146
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:18,000
you don't want to be the adorable fuzzy

147
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,500
terrifying line you want to get into a

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,849
situation where you have a plan in

149
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,830
advance and you've figured out some of

150
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:24,030
the difficult questions because in the

151
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,150
heat of the moment when you're

152
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,409
scrambling trying to like build trust

153
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,090
trying to figure out who has

154
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,580
responsibility for what trying to figure

155
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,280
out what the workflow should be all of

156
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,050
that stuff in the heat of the moment is

157
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,460
8,000 times my stats are very accurate

158
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,860
by the way it's 8,000

159
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,568
times worse than it is if you can do it

160
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,100
calmly and rationally when you're not

161
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,550
dealing with people breathing down your

162
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,099
neck

163
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,539
so preparation is like the most

164
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:50,979
fundamental thing you can do so what

165
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:54,009
does preparation mean like how do you

166
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:56,889
get going I think the first step is that

167
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:58,780
you really want to build an overwhelming

168
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:05,590
and totally terrifying workflow that

169
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:07,059
nobody can read this is by the way this

170
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,590
is not something that I expect you to

171
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,910
like take a photo of and go back to your

172
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,810
companies and be like I've got the

173
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:16,240
workflow template guys like we're sorted

174
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:20,710
so this is a real workflow that rapid7

175
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,180
used at one point in the past and the

176
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:26,620
process that we went through to create

177
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:29,440
this is firstly we had to figure out who

178
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:32,229
are our core stakeholders in any crisis

179
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,780
response Sacchi let me take a step back

180
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:36,758
the first step is figuring out what kind

181
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,979
of crises you might reasonably face as

182
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,229
an organization what does crisis mean to

183
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,849
you what kind of situations are you

184
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:46,120
thinking about like is it a breach

185
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:50,110
scenario is it a vulnerability

186
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,030
disclosure is it you know something

187
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,740
completely different are you really

188
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,380
worried about malicious internal actors

189
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,750
like what does that look like so

190
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,870
determine what your key crisis scenarios

191
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,180
are once you have that for each of those

192
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,710
scenarios you want to thank who are the

193
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,780
players and the organization that most

194
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,570
need to be involved and I'll tell you

195
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,979
like this is a very fine balancing act

196
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,469
because you want to make sure you have a

197
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:17,380
good strong cross-functional team but

198
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:19,449
you don't want to have you know hundreds

199
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,520
of people across the organization in a

200
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:24,340
crisis being able to move quickly and

201
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,479
efficiently is paramount they're having

202
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:30,070
a lot more fun in the other room I'm

203
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:35,770
sorry guys and in French as well so I'm

204
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:37,659
doubly sorry pardon anymore and I

205
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,880
promised I wouldn't do from glai today

206
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:44,380
but there it is

207
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:46,630
but yes so you want to know like who is

208
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,650
it from the legal team that's gonna be

209
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,030
your go-to person who is it from IT from

210
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,280
engineering

211
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:58,060
from the security team who needs to be

212
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:00,220
involved who is your executive liaison

213
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,199
how many of the execs are gonna want to

214
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,480
be kept informed who is it from the

215
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,160
communications team is there somebody

216
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,920
from customer support somebody from

217
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,900
customer management does somebody from

218
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,670
HR need to be involved these are all

219
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,760
questions you need to figure out in

220
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:17,860
advance to start to build an idea of who

221
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,260
your stakeholders are once you do that

222
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,260
you get the core stakeholders in a room

223
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,790
together and you basically walk through

224
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,920
what does it look like from beginning to

225
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:30,939
end and this process is not gonna be

226
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,560
quick it's not gonna be smooth and it's

227
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,880
not gonna be like a one hit and done

228
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,069
thing it's gonna be something you

229
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,920
iterate on and iterate on and iterate on

230
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,930
but you can start walking through the

231
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,150
scenarios and really kind of testing

232
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,560
yourself and asking each other questions

233
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:49,030
trying to figure out what are you each

234
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,579
need in a situation that you know would

235
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:53,260
classify as a crisis like what is the

236
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,340
comms person most need when do they need

237
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,870
to be brought in the chances are I'm

238
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,100
guessing most of you are not best

239
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,110
buddies with the comms people in your

240
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,810
organization so again quick show of

241
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:08,640
hands how many people speak regularly to

242
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,640
the comms people in their organization

243
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:16,090
yeah that's normal by the way that's

244
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:17,470
what I figured okay so you're gonna have

245
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,630
to do something about that to like start

246
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:23,170
building us up so once you have a

247
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:25,300
workflow you can start determining roles

248
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,400
or responsibilities again this is

249
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,199
absolutely your template like you have

250
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,770
this now you can go and use it it's

251
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,750
great it's a it's a it's an eye chart

252
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:37,240
and and it just gives you an example

253
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,300
this is something again that we used for

254
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,340
a period of time at rapid7

255
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,530
we specifically adopted the RACI model

256
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,840
for roles and responsibilities are

257
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:49,930
people familiar with the resi model if

258
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,930
yeah okay there are lots of different

259
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,250
roles and responsibilities type models

260
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,380
Google will happily tell you about all

261
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,420
of them find the one that works for your

262
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:03,110
organization for us what we wanted to

263
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:05,599
clarify is in every scenario who is

264
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:08,000
responsible accountable who is providing

265
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,650
input you know who are the final

266
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,300
approvers we wanted to go through all of

267
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,640
the different elements and figure out

268
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,800
like exactly what the expectations were

269
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,220
and actually the process of creating

270
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,699
this for us was quite eye-opening we had

271
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:26,120
situations in the creation of this

272
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:27,890
horrendous chart where we had teams that

273
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,460
butted heads and were like well hang on

274
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,040
a second

275
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:34,820
I own that no I own that we had this

276
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:38,449
moment where our product marketing team

277
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:41,420
was like if it's a vulnerability we own

278
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,800
all messaging around product so we own

279
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,819
the story we own the custom

280
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,140
communication the comms team were like

281
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,840
but like it's kind of in our name where

282
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,430
the communications team like it's kind

283
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,740
of what we do so we should have like

284
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,540
ultimate say you should be providing

285
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,280
input about the product message and we

286
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,689
should own the whole thing and so there

287
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,030
was this like sort of tension internally

288
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,650
now you don't want that tension when

289
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,390
you're actually in the heat of the

290
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,010
moment pushing to get a message out as

291
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,480
quickly as possible you want to have

292
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:11,420
figured all that stuff out in advance

293
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,040
and the problem is if you don't you run

294
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,250
the risk of one of two things happening

295
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,750
either you're gonna bash heads you're

296
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,570
gonna rub each other up the wrong way

297
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,930
and the end results will suffer you

298
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:26,360
won't get a good product out the door or

299
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:28,670
what the other thing all happen and I am

300
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,050
in Canada so you'll be terribly polite

301
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,579
to each other and you'll be like no no

302
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:37,910
no after you and nothing will get done

303
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:39,200
um so you have to like make sure that

304
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:42,050
you have talked through these things

305
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,850
directly and openly in advance and you

306
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,430
figured out how to like come to some

307
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,800
consensus on who's doing what a key part

308
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:51,020
of that is you need to make friends and

309
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,390
like if there's one thing I can tell you

310
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:57,500
after you like get back to the office on

311
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:59,090
Monday the thing to go do is to go make

312
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,950
friends with other people who might be

313
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:03,110
call stakeholders who you've never

314
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:05,120
spoken to before it doesn't matter if

315
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,890
they're a duck and you're a kitten like

316
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,230
you still can be great friends you can

317
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:11,390
have great fluffy moments together you

318
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,030
need to go back and like go talk to your

319
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:16,550
G C's office find out who are the ggc's

320
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:18,680
office is the person who would work

321
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,380
crisis response take them out for lunch

322
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,760
I'm a really big believer and if I don't

323
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,019
know someone just buying them lunch

324
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,600
which means all of you are gonna tell me

325
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:27,740
that I have to buy you lunch after this

326
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,450
but like that is a great way of getting

327
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,390
to know people sit down with them and

328
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:34,250
say hey so this is how I think about

329
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,199
this what do you care about when this

330
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,519
situation happens find out what their

331
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,110
job is like find out like what the

332
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,399
pressures are of their job what the

333
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,709
challenges are they face what are they

334
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,959
worried about because if you understand

335
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:47,060
those pieces in advance you can start to

336
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,768
build trust not only can you start to

337
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,869
build trust but you can start to play as

338
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:53,240
an actual team figuring out whose

339
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,880
offense whose defense how do you work

340
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,529
together I've given a version of this

341
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,980
talk in the past and normally when I

342
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:05,570
present it I present it with rapid7 CSO

343
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:08,000
and when he first joined the company we

344
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,920
did not like instantly you know look at

345
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,019
each other and our eyes met across a

346
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,610
room and we fell blatantly in love with

347
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:15,350
each other it wasn't like that to begin

348
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:18,410
with we irritated the out of each

349
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,660
other and the reality is heartbleed

350
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:23,660
happened and we sucked it up and we

351
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:26,360
worked through it and at the end we sat

352
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:29,120
down and we were like that could have

353
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,680
gone better and we had a really honest

354
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,020
conversation about what we could have

355
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,930
done better and we figured out how to

356
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,160
improve and by doing that we started to

357
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,359
get to a point where he had an

358
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,939
understanding of what the things were

359
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,410
but I cared about and need it and he and

360
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,779
I had an understanding of what he cared

361
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:47,240
about needed by the time he actually

362
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:50,990
moved on to digitalocean and it breaks

363
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,660
my heart but by the time he moved on we

364
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:56,120
were at a point where annoyingly we

365
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,130
finished each other's sentences and what

366
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,329
that meant was that if I was traveling

367
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,370
or he was traveling and something

368
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:01,790
happened we actually could step in for

369
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,040
each other

370
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,930
it meant that like if a decision needs

371
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,099
to be made really quickly in the heat of

372
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,229
the moment and one of us was not

373
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,149
available for some reason we had each

374
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,410
other's backs and we knew exactly what

375
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:16,040
the other person would think about a

376
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:18,469
need and how to like take that thinking

377
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,149
into the process it didn't mean that we

378
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,149
did each other's jobs you know we I

379
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:24,850
wasn't like an interim CSO for rapid7

380
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:29,060
no matter what I tell you when I'm drunk

381
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,580
it was just that I knew what Josh cared

382
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,890
about

383
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,720
and I knew how to represent that and

384
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,149
factored into my thinking and he was the

385
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,000
same and that meant that we could move

386
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:43,110
much faster it meant that the end result

387
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,850
for our end users was much better so go

388
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,760
make friends this is your number one

389
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:50,579
action take away go do that

390
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:52,620
so another core part of planning is that

391
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:54,300
you need to know and understand what the

392
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,920
legal requirements are going to be for

393
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:01,410
any of your course inari owes so and I'm

394
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,819
sorry like we're in Canada and I do not

395
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:06,899
know anything about the Canadian

396
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:08,339
legislation on this so I apologize I can

397
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,670
tell you that for people who are doing

398
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:14,120
business in the u.s. there are now 54

399
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:17,189
different state and territory

400
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,800
regulations on this 54 it's insane to

401
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:23,190
keep up with it and then how many people

402
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,229
have customers in Europe or interact

403
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:28,200
with European persons as the regulation

404
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,760
calls them I'm gonna tell you it's more

405
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,560
than that I'm gonna tell you you all are

406
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,850
covered by gdpr and you need to check it

407
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,209
out if you don't already know about it

408
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:39,020
um and the great fun thing about gdpr is

409
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:41,640
it requires notification in 72 hours

410
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:44,459
most of the times that I have worked on

411
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,990
an investigation I feel like the team

412
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:48,029
isn't even ready to definitively say

413
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,500
what happened in 72 hours and you have

414
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:51,660
to do your notification in that window

415
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,940
so you need to understand these

416
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,699
requirements there are also vertical

417
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,680
sector requirements certainly for health

418
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,200
care and for financial sector probably

419
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,729
for a lot of other sectors so you really

420
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,199
need to be up on this and you need to

421
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,540
make sure that your legal team is and

422
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,069
that's again when you go and take them

423
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,720
out to lunch this is a question you can

424
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,609
ask it's like have you looked at these

425
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,169
things is there something I can do to

426
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:15,809
help with that how are you thinking

427
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:18,300
about this it's really important to

428
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:20,970
understand what your organization's

429
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,500
attitude towards regulation is before

430
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,059
you get into these situations you want

431
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,780
to know what they're sort of Tolerance

432
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:29,970
around disclosure and transparency is

433
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:34,080
because it will shape how you move

434
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:37,320
forward with the rest of the response so

435
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,699
okay you've done your planning as a big

436
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,649
part of your planning you figured out

437
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,780
who your core stakeholders are gonna be

438
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,120
who that core team is that's gonna work

439
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:48,629
got any response but there's more than

440
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:52,739
just that group that are stakeholders in

441
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:54,600
most response situations there's also an

442
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,550
executive group that has stakeholders

443
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,290
and they want to know what's going on

444
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,389
you have to figure out very carefully

445
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,190
how are you going to communicate with

446
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,430
them effectively what does that look

447
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:08,730
like do you tell them everything that's

448
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:11,220
going on all the time do you try and

449
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,850
hold back some information is it all of

450
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:17,190
the execs or just some subset of execs

451
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:20,060
how many people have interacted or

452
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,560
communicated with their executive team

453
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,389
okay how many people find the idea of

454
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:29,460
telling their executive team about a

455
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:31,500
security crisis terrifying you need to

456
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:36,030
like figure out how to make this work

457
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:37,980
for you and and and you know you need to

458
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,899
figure out who is gonna be the person in

459
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,270
your response team who's like your

460
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,120
response captain who's the person who's

461
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:47,129
gonna be the guy or the the lady who's

462
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,939
going to manage the response I'm very

463
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:52,350
good at this I just you need to know who

464
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,620
that person is well we had a situation

465
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:58,199
recently and we had a response captain

466
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,750
and the response captain quite

467
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,070
reasonably had vacation planned and so

468
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,560
halfway through the response captain

469
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,179
went on vacation and then we had a

470
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,679
situation where the rest of us didn't

471
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:11,730
figure out who was the response captain

472
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,230
and so I was like is it you is he you're

473
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,610
gonna send an email I'm gonna say who's

474
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,210
telling me like I don't know what's

475
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,159
happening

476
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,630
and it actually did create friction like

477
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,640
it created like a little bit of

478
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,920
weirdness because I didn't want to

479
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,840
overstep and he's new and he didn't want

480
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,430
to overstep and so again we're being

481
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,340
terribly polite to each other but mainly

482
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:30,960
we're like what's going on so you need

483
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,520
to figure those things out you also need

484
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,110
to figure out a cadence like I think on

485
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,940
the last situation we had we probably

486
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,350
over communicated with execs when you're

487
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,320
sending emails being like there's no

488
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,389
update it's not that useful so you need

489
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,220
to figure those things out and like have

490
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,290
a sense of what are the execs expect to

491
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,970
see you also need to figure out like who

492
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:51,389
are your other stakeholders so for

493
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:54,300
example in most situations that you deal

494
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,640
with you might have a support team or or

495
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,919
support leadership

496
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,300
your stakeholders you might have your

497
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,310
customer management group as

498
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,080
stakeholders and you need to think if

499
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,700
they're stakeholders what does it mean

500
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,020
for them to be stakeholders at what

501
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,760
point should they be brought into the

502
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,410
process how are you going to communicate

503
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,900
with them what does that look like the

504
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:14,980
other core piece around managing

505
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:18,410
stakeholders is you have to remember

506
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:21,230
that perception is everything and that

507
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,970
people are not stupid and they generally

508
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,880
pay attention to what's around them ish

509
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,430
in the workplace and they build

510
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:32,480
conspiracy theories we're great at this

511
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:35,630
and so there's this whole there's a

512
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,360
phrase around like making like a swan

513
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,610
you know you like glide on the surface

514
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,139
and paddle like hell under the water you

515
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,790
basically need to figure out how to

516
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,150
master that because if you're running

517
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:49,940
around looking like very crazed

518
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:52,460
and worried and stressed the people

519
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,900
around you will notice and they will

520
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,360
start to build theories around what's

521
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,470
happening and they will become

522
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,330
disproportionate to whatever is actually

523
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,130
happening and then you'll have an issue

524
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:03,860
where rather than being able to just

525
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,300
focus on your response your technical

526
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,840
response the thing you need to get on

527
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,480
with

528
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,770
you'll be fielding questions from 800

529
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,810
people who want to know what's happening

530
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:14,240
and then trying to deal with managing

531
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:16,250
perceptions so you need to think about

532
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,040
like what is the part that you play on

533
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:21,830
this like how are you communicating

534
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,810
non-verbally are you like huddling very

535
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:26,449
visibly with other people looking very

536
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,710
stressed secret meetings are so tempting

537
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,240
for other people to look at and go oh

538
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,440
what's happening there and the next

539
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,730
thing you know they'll be speculation

540
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,880
that you're being acquired or something

541
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:37,840
because that's how my minds work so you

542
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:42,080
need to really think about those pieces

543
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:45,020
okay so you've got your plan you figured

544
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,240
out your stakeholders a situation has

545
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:51,170
arisen you start to put your plan in

546
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,900
place it is really critical that you

547
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:57,290
monitor the situation and you adapt as

548
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:59,870
you go the plan is very important I

549
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:02,750
think I mentioned that once or twice but

550
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:05,449
a very important additional part is

551
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:07,880
flexibility and agility you can't get so

552
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,540
locked into what's written down that you

553
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,880
can't respond to what's half

554
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,620
and in order to do that you need to

555
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,530
figure out how are you gonna monitor

556
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:19,169
effectively so for example do you have

557
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:22,110
somebody who is monitoring social media

558
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:25,430
and if so are they doing it in the most

559
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,429
effective way possible so as an example

560
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:32,790
Iron Mountain I think it was had a

561
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:37,320
situation where they had a fire at one

562
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:40,399
of their facilities huge fire and when

563
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:43,649
the responders first responders came in

564
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,230
they they you know obviously they they

565
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:48,300
put the fire out which is great and then

566
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:52,350
there were all these like partially

567
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,970
charred bits of paper everywhere and so

568
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,800
it was and it was like all along a

569
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,970
riverbed and so people were like kind of

570
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,280
walking down and they would just say

571
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:01,950
find bits of paper that had confidential

572
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,540
information on them and so the team that

573
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:06,660
worked on that response they had to

574
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:08,550
figure out how do we know when

575
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,740
somebody's done that and they've put it

576
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:13,379
on the Internet because like the chances

577
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,180
are they're not gonna like take a

578
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,120
picture of it put it on Twitter and put

579
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:20,400
hashtag Iron Mountain so what are you

580
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,320
searching for to try and like find those

581
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,280
pieces bear in mind the chances are

582
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,409
you're gonna deal with the litigious

583
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,960
situation and of these things could be

584
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,670
used as proof or evidence against you in

585
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,250
the courtroom so you really need to

586
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:34,980
think like okay how are we going to like

587
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,870
get this evidence capture and make sure

588
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,340
that we're finding these things when

589
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,260
people are not necessarily gonna use the

590
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,629
keywords we want them to use to make our

591
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,090
lives easier so you need to think a

592
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:48,210
little bit laterally and and like really

593
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:50,100
work with whoever manages the monitoring

594
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,400
like is it your comms team who else is

595
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,820
it

596
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,780
another thing is so I promised you that

597
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,679
I would talk to you about a recent

598
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:03,540
situation a rapid sentence so we had a

599
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:07,890
situation whereby we did a survey of

600
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:14,540
some of our users on a particular

601
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:20,460
product and the data from that survey

602
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:22,710
was accidentally put on a public github

603
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,409
repository and it is like this

604
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,990
simplest thing in the world whereby one

605
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:30,000
person said to another okay put that

606
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:32,159
file on github meaning rapid sevens

607
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,260
incredibly private github repository and

608
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,210
the other person didn't know that we had

609
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:41,520
one and so put it on her personal github

610
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,419
humans right do these things with no

611
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,330
mal-intent

612
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:48,720
whatsoever and yet there we are we have

613
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:51,809
some data accidentally out in public and

614
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,100
so we had to scramble to figure out what

615
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:58,710
to do about it and like how to respond

616
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:02,010
now we found out about it because a

617
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:04,140
customer that used a threat intelligence

618
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,158
feed got it from their threat

619
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,320
intelligence feed they were like hey

620
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,610
this looks like it's your data and so

621
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,230
the customer came and told us and so

622
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,370
like we had this big scramble to figure

623
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,779
out like what the hell was going on and

624
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,600
get the stuff taken down and then figure

625
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:19,679
out how to communicate anyone affected

626
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:24,719
in the process we overlooked talking to

627
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:26,460
support and we didn't talk to support

628
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,340
until we were at the point where we were

629
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:32,490
ready to make the public communication

630
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,360
so then we we got support involved and

631
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,220
we were like hey we're gonna do this

632
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,070
thing and it's for were like that's

633
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,529
great thanks for living us know and we

634
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,809
sent out the emails and one of the

635
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:44,130
customers came back and they were like

636
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:47,779
yeah I reported this to your support

637
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:51,510
team a week ago and we were like really

638
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:53,669
sucks good to know about that and that

639
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:57,539
was because we didn't connect the dots

640
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:59,010
like we didn't think about who all of

641
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:00,779
that stakeholders would be and we didn't

642
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:03,179
think about the role that they play in

643
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:05,399
helping us monitor a situation if we'd

644
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:07,260
brought support in at the beginning they

645
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:08,639
would have told us they would have known

646
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,440
to look out for people reporting the

647
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,880
issue and they would have said to us hey

648
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,159
we've had this other customer report it

649
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,600
and we would have been like oh crap we

650
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,460
should totally talk to that customer and

651
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,520
instead oh by the way I swear a lot and

652
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,169
instead we didn't do that and so this

653
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,940
other customer was like thanks for

654
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:26,850
ignoring me for a week on this thing

655
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,260
that you did and that's not great like

656
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,000
that doesn't fill any of us with warm

657
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,929
fuzzies we feel like that was a pretty

658
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,279
bad exercise so you need to think about

659
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:35,970
who all the people are in your

660
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,820
organization

661
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,470
help with monitoring and think laterally

662
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:43,080
about it as much as possible it won't be

663
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,850
as simple as it being one team that does

664
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,290
X you need to really sort of think about

665
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,120
all the different aspects that go into

666
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:51,330
it and make sure that you're then able

667
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:54,000
to respond as things come up your

668
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:59,040
internal team is very important they are

669
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,630
your frontline they are your no I'm not

670
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,870
gonna get any hose from any of you all

671
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:06,660
right fine whatever I get it you want

672
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:08,250
lunch so you need to think about how you

673
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,750
arm them to be as effective as possible

674
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,280
clearly I just gave an example of where

675
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,370
we did that really poorly with the

676
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,920
support team so generally speaking what

677
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:21,360
we try and do with any situation is we

678
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:24,600
try and create an FAQ to give to as

679
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,639
CSM's sometimes our sales team the

680
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,010
support team anybody that is on the

681
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,300
frontline of interacting with users so

682
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,370
that they are prepared to answer

683
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,899
questions as much as possible so if

684
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,879
somebody comes to them like worried and

685
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,400
stressed they're not gonna get like old

686
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,020
or no kind of a response so you need to

687
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,430
think about like how are you arming your

688
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,920
people to do that you also need to think

689
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:46,410
about that that your internal team will

690
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,790
be worried themselves particularly if

691
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,810
they see reports of something and they

692
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,950
haven't heard anything from you

693
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,139
internally so you have to think about

694
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:54,770
when is the right time to communicate

695
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,660
with the internal team and again as as

696
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:59,610
people who have like more point of view

697
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,990
on security more experience in this this

698
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,669
is an area where you can demonstrate

699
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,980
leadership to your comms team and you

700
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:07,110
can help them understand what the right

701
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,780
approach is to take when we have a

702
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:12,629
situation and we create the FAQ it is a

703
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:15,210
complete collaboration between the

704
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:17,700
security team the comms team and then

705
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:20,550
depending on the situation either IT or

706
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,930
engineering and like the security team

707
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,030
provide a lot of input into that

708
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,610
document and it's invaluable without

709
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:29,040
them we would not get to such a crisp

710
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:31,860
clear articulation of what's going on so

711
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,210
you have a role to play in this don't

712
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,709
think about the fact that like it's not

713
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,770
a technical response therefore it's not

714
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,970
my job okay so this is the bit that

715
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,980
everybody thinks about when they think

716
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,210
about like how you do communications

717
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,620
around crisis they think about like

718
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,300
going to the public and I particularly

719
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:50,399
think about media engagement I kind of

720
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:52,740
put this as a lower thing

721
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,900
often times if you manage a situation

722
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,060
well you won't even need to deal with

723
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,560
this piece but it's always good to be

724
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,090
prepared for it and to think about it

725
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,600
and to know how you're gonna deal with

726
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:06,300
it I will say with this piece the key

727
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,629
aspects are you need to think very

728
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:11,430
carefully about timing you need to

729
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,110
understand whether the situation you're

730
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,580
dealing with is already being discussed

731
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,159
in the public domain and that will

732
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,810
affect your timing and then you need to

733
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,170
think about like what is the right

734
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:23,639
message in terms of like giving too much

735
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,350
information giving too little

736
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,480
information I'll give you like a quick

737
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:32,040
like sort of semi funny anecdote about

738
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:39,060
this and that seven years ago rapid

739
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:41,100
sevens DNS was hijacked by the Syrian

740
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,830
electronic army who it turns out don't

741
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,850
know how to spell Palestine amusingly

742
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:52,379
and when we were doing the investigation

743
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:54,510
our DNS provider gave us some

744
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,670
information to begin with that like I

745
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:58,200
think there was a crossed wire or we

746
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,040
misinterpreted the information or they

747
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,620
said something there was little bit

748
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,230
misleading but basically we got the

749
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:07,469
impression that they had been social

750
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:13,890
engineered through a fax and so we were

751
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:16,980
like hacking like it's 1968 and our CSO

752
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:19,290
at the time a guy called HD Moore some

753
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,990
of you might have heard of him he said

754
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:27,810
to me this is kind of hilarious can I

755
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:32,400
tweet it and I had this moment where I

756
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:34,889
was like eh do you knows everything

757
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,290
about security so if he thinks it's okay

758
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:40,890
it's totes legit and so it's like yeah

759
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:42,240
sure go for it and then it turned out

760
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,040
obviously like yes some of you look at

761
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,840
me like you're a moron I am a

762
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:52,560
 moron guess what guys it turned

763
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,629
out not to be a fax um shocking now in

764
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,240
this situation we like to put out

765
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:58,410
another tweet and said hey it wasn't

766
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,840
that it was something much more mundane

767
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,040
and no harm was done like no one really

768
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,189
cared they thought it was funnier than

769
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,750
it was a fax weather

770
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,370
fana wasn't a fax they were like oh boo

771
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,470
and they moved on

772
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,510
this wasn't a harmful situation because

773
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,820
there was actually no customer impact

774
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,950
right like our homepage got to face with

775
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,540
some misspellings and we took it down

776
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:18,070
pretty quickly and got it fixed and like

777
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:22,440
nobody really cared in the grand scheme

778
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:24,520
of things but it is a lesson that if you

779
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,990
communicate too quickly if you

780
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,560
communicate before you've verified the

781
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:31,630
situation if you don't have really good

782
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,820
rigor in your communications on your

783
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:35,470
relationship with communications you

784
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:38,439
have the potential to miss communicate

785
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,790
and in most situations it will be far

786
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,370
more damaging than it was in our

787
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:45,610
somewhat ridiculous situation and it's

788
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:47,169
also a lesson in again as security

789
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,000
professionals the chances are your comms

790
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:52,540
team will think that on the topic of

791
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,460
security that you are godlike and that

792
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,379
you know everything and it's really

793
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,720
important for you to manage that with

794
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,310
them and be clear on like what are the

795
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,890
things that you do know and what are the

796
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:05,169
things that you don't know and you know

797
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,670
if if you're like hey I think we should

798
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,780
go and talk about this like really think

799
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,550
about like is that the right thing

800
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,320
because the chances are your consumer

801
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,690
would be like oh go that seems

802
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,919
reasonable because I have no clue so you

803
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,970
need to I don't know when they all talk

804
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,980
a little bit life's tricky we do but

805
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,230
they do so you need to really think

806
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,520
about like how to manage that piece so a

807
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:24,160
couple of other things to think about as

808
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,889
you're doing the external is and this is

809
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:30,550
my number one golden rule for all crisis

810
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:33,100
communications of any kind is always

811
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,450
focus on those who are affected and you

812
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,699
can do this in your technical response

813
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,560
and your communications response so are

814
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,200
there things that you as an organization

815
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,909
can do from a technical point of view to

816
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,120
address the issue for them and make it

817
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:48,940
easy for them for example if they need

818
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:51,429
to reset their password can you just

819
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,510
force a reset because then like you're

820
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,770
not really making them make a choice

821
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:56,650
they're like have to do it it'll be

822
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:57,910
annoying but it's better for security so

823
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,920
if that's the thing you think they

824
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:02,320
should do don't just say hey go change

825
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,610
your password like actually say your

826
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,730
password has been reset you need to go

827
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:09,010
and take steps think about those kinds

828
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:11,560
of things in the communications also

829
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:13,860
think about do they need a full

830
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,840
technical exposition of what happened

831
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,520
probably not is a full

832
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,529
Nicolle exposition going to scare the

833
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:24,070
bejesus out of them and confuse most of

834
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:26,020
them probably so think about who is your

835
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,770
end customer what is the right approach

836
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,889
to them

837
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:33,730
quick quick anecdote on this one two

838
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:36,390
years ago we did some research on the

839
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:38,559
Johnson and Johnson Animus OneTouch ping

840
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:41,110
which is a very catchy name for an

841
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,270
insulin pump basically the way it works

842
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:47,320
is the insulin pump attaches to you

843
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:49,330
bodily and it delivers insulin as the

844
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:53,470
name kind of suggests there is a remote

845
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:55,090
control like gadget that goes in your

846
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,850
pocket that monitors your insulin level

847
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:59,860
and it communicates via RF C with the

848
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,789
pump and says hey you need to dispense

849
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:04,209
insulin right

850
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:05,919
we basically discovered that you could

851
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,020
interfere with that communication to

852
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,859
either like stop insulin delivery which

853
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:16,139
might lead to death or you could you

854
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:18,668
could emulate the communication and push

855
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,940
fatal dose so like generally not great

856
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:23,799
scenarios however in order to do that

857
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,950
you would need to have the right

858
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,619
equipment know that the person has that

859
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:32,138
particular device and be within a

860
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:34,270
certain proximity of them and have the

861
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:35,800
technical capabilities so in other words

862
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,699
we're not talking about like drive-by

863
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,760
attacks here we're talking about

864
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:41,649
something super super targeted so the

865
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,780
chances are that most people's risk

866
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:46,179
profile means they're probably not going

867
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:49,599
to be the target of a hacking assassin

868
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:50,710
so when we did the communication out we

869
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,750
worked really really closely with

870
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,460
Johnson Johnson they did make the

871
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,469
decision to proactively communicate to

872
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,000
their patients which was the first time

873
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,230
that a US medical device manufacturer

874
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,320
has ever done that for cybersecurity

875
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,820
which was two thumbs up very cool but we

876
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,830
all worked together to get a

877
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,050
communication that went out saying hey

878
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,609
don't pull your insulin pumps out like

879
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,609
that is not the right response because

880
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:13,869
you know what will kill you diabetes so

881
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:16,779
don't don't do that

882
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:18,940
um and so we had this like very sort of

883
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,490
like clear communication that said

884
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:24,030
here's the risk here's what you can do

885
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:26,169
about it do not panic it was it was very

886
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:29,290
hitchhikers do not panic and big

887
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:30,020
capitals and because we took that

888
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,150
approach

889
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,130
the patients came back to us and they

890
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,420
were like thank you we really appreciate

891
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,560
the fact that you made this really clear

892
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,849
for us you made it easy for us to

893
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,390
understand what the right thing was to

894
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:42,830
do and then the FDA came and said this

895
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,970
was really great guys we want everyone

896
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,980
to follow your example which Don

897
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:48,500
suggested were like what just happened

898
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,570
well that's great let's do that more um

899
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,180
so that's how you do a vulnerability

900
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:55,609
disclosure and make people happy and so

901
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,710
which is very uncommon so again like use

902
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:59,930
your guiding pins principle around how

903
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,280
do you focus on those who affect it when

904
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:04,460
we were going through that disclosure

905
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,470
there were definitely times where you

906
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:09,380
know Johnson Johnson which is like you

907
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:12,290
know an amazingly enormous organization

908
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:14,630
with lots of lawyers and rapid7 which is

909
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:16,910
like a tiny amoeba on the like you know

910
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,560
edge of the galaxy where we were like

911
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,879
yeah we're gonna argue with you but

912
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,509
you're very big and scary we don't know

913
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,660
what to do and they would say well we

914
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:27,890
think it should be this and I'd be like

915
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,480
yeah okay so you are big and scary but

916
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:31,430
like we've done a lot of disclosures and

917
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,200
that's wrong it's not the way to do it

918
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,609
and so we had these moments right where

919
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,200
we were like Bosch he heads against each

920
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,060
other and in every one of those

921
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,950
situations the thing that brought us to

922
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,630
alignment is we sat down and we were

923
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:44,569
like what is the best thing for the

924
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:46,490
patients that was our unifying factor so

925
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,320
again like use this as your guiding

926
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,149
principle always think about like what

927
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,650
are the right things to tell them when

928
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:54,140
is it the right time to tell them and

929
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:56,089
above all like be authentic in how you

930
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,950
do it like really think about like who

931
00:36:56,089 --> 00:37:00,109
are your customers how do you interact

932
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:03,109
with them what feels right to you don't

933
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:04,640
try and people people know like

934
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:06,440
how many of you have seen security

935
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,830
advisories and got annoyed with how it's

936
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:13,040
written I have definitely Oh none of you

937
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:15,560
really Wow you are much nicer to vendors

938
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,759
than I am all right well in which case

939
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:22,190
do what everyone but I think it's it's

940
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,359
critical to be authentic okay so that

941
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,940
was a lot of information that I just

942
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,089
went through I blathered at you for a

943
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:31,670
good solid 40 minutes but like the

944
00:37:29,089 --> 00:37:33,470
bottom line here is these are pretty

945
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:35,990
simple rules like there is I'm now down

946
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:37,970
to I think five of them so number one is

947
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,169
preparation make friends this is the

948
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:40,910
thing you're gonna do when you get back

949
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:43,369
to the offices you're gonna identify one

950
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:44,569
person to go and like

951
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:48,170
learn about and build a relationship

952
00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:50,329
with that is not in the security team

953
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:52,400
the second is timing is super important

954
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:54,319
figuring out when to talk how to talk

955
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,470
what to say what the medium is all that

956
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:59,558
kind of stuff don't be overconfident and

957
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:01,970
tell people that you got hacked via fax

958
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:04,130
think about what the information is that

959
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:05,499
is the right information to share don't

960
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:08,690
make it like if you are dealing with

961
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:09,529
consumers like regular Joe's don't give

962
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,759
them loads of technical information

963
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:12,410
they're not gonna understand it'll

964
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:14,720
terrify them if you're dealing with

965
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:16,578
security professionals focus on what

966
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,490
they need to do make it actionable for

967
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:23,269
them think through the questions people

968
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:25,308
will have and try to like proactive you

969
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:27,919
come up with answers don't be caught in

970
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:29,240
that situation of being like oh you need

971
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,650
to like there are obvious questions

972
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,720
people ask and the best thing you can do

973
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:34,609
is think about the shittiest questions

974
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,230
you're gonna get you know when we did

975
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:37,670
the gear hub thing we knew we were gonna

976
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,430
get bad questions we knew people were

977
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:41,869
gonna be like you did what now

978
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:44,419
someday we're gonna have a whole raft of

979
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:46,640
questions about it mostly how could you

980
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:49,249
be so stupid and so we needed to have

981
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,470
like good answers prepared to say yeah

982
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:52,848
we we like Maricopa we totally messed

983
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,230
this up and here's what we're gonna do

984
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:57,470
to make sure it doesn't happen again

985
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:59,809

987
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:04,369
everything else that you do you need to

988
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,920
really think about what's in the best

989
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:09,230
interests of the people that are

990
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,019
affected by it and if you do all of that

991
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:15,559
you will you will get through your cat

992
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:18,049
our trophy in in one piece you will

993
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:20,839
whether it probably with with minimal

994
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:22,220
fallout until some bozo from your team

995
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:22,999
goes out and does it talk about all the

996
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:27,230
