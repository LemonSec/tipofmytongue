1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,239
like

2
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:22,289
hopefully give you an insight into what

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,029
security is an OT and what I see is some

4
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,439
overthrew that term around lop so just

5
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,289
give some background to that and it

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,119
security about that so a little bit

7
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,980
about me I worked as a Technical

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,870
Architect in the design of secure

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,210
systems for operator technology

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:41,070
primarily in air and rail transport so

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,379
the type of technical talk that we had

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,760
previously on the first round we're not

13
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:49,260
getting that deep at all because simply

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,539
I don't have the skills to do that as

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,539
the agenda is what is ICS pretty

16
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,219
standard one there is some touching on

17
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,750
legislation and regulation simply

18
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,359
because it kind of needs to be spoken

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,430
about but it'll be very very quick and

20
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,799
then about the challenges within

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,390
security and ICS and loads of things

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,610
that are easy tarik to that particular

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,010
all those industries and then some of

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,320
the stuff in defense and design and for

25
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:20,040
the attacking side which I'm sure many

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:21,539
of you be more interested in so it is

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,009
ICS you'll see these a lot

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,080
anytime that anyone brings up some

29
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,479
slides on ICS got a lot of pipes and

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,100
chimneys my favorite one is anyone in a

31
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,110
hardhat pointing at some equipment

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,640
although it wasn't until this morning to

33
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,360
our writers that he's quite gently

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,710
caressing that PLC while hiding an iPad

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,750
I don't know what he's doing or why is

36
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,399
doing that but there we go so this is

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,409
kind of what it looks like a lot of sort

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,450
of industrial type technology really of

39
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,540
ICS is a blanket term for a whole lot of

40
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,210
other systems you see this is this is

41
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,360
SCADA or SCADA over here is there we've

42
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,250
seen the high level controls of that but

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,759
it's no factories and power stations

44
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,000
actually operational technology covers a

45
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:04,350
whole host of other things so everywhere

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,509
that you see within this building itself

47
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,728
if you came through an airport it came

48
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,770
through a train station you use the

49
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,230
roads all of these things are a whole

50
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,190
host of devices that are

51
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,649
linked together in some way and managed

52
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,489
you know so they are the kind of the one

53
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,750
of the main differences between

54
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:26,970
enterprise IT and OT is that the number

55
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,150
of people per device so you look at a

56
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:32,099
typical airport in space I work in you

57
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,010
might have run in excess of a million

58
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,329
end devices with you know less than a

59
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,518
hundred people looking at those so

60
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,290
there's that kind of eyes on two screens

61
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,180
that you'll see within if you work in

62
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,359
the banking industry is you may have

63
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,709
like a two device per person ratio its

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,540
fact there's a whole load of stuff going

65
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,970
on behind the scenes behind what was in

66
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,420
riser cupboards in data center somewhere

67
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,340
else what that means for you especially

68
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,480
if like people who want to get into ICS

69
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,829
security cuz it seems to be a bit of a

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,780
everyone's riding it bow wave at the

71
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:01,920
moment is that you don't have to go and

72
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,930
work in a power station you don't have

73
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,879
to go and work in a wastewater

74
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,900
distribution which sounds exciting but

75
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,179
you've got all of these other areas

76
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,920
which are managing large amounts of

77
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,900
process control systems or distributed

78
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,309
control systems or some way that we are

79
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:23,459
looking at what the physical environment

80
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:24,930
looks like so this is a pretty standard

81
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:30,060
kind of picture you see it's taken out

82
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:32,430
of NIST 882 vision - and this kind of

83
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,500
shows where you've got this low-level

84
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,090
controls down here some form of actuator

85
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,250
or sensor or something that's happening

86
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,569
something managing those and they come

87
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,650
up to hope it's got high level control

88
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,679
so you've got this kind of management

89
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,989
layer and that's where the SCADA server

90
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,819
sitting and people sit up there so these

91
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,650
are out in the field where there is a

92
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:52,798
valve or a pump actuator that kind of

93
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,989
thing and that's a pretty sound picture

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,129
you see its massive oversimplification

95
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:01,079
of what a control system looks like

96
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:02,370
whereas this is far more bottle talking

97
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,310
about so these are groups of functional

98
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,139
areas within an ICS system and how they

99
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,430
communicate and that's simply that's

100
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,680
still quite a high level of abstraction

101
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,230
there's a lot of complex or complex

102
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,780
systems and it's worth noting that

103
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,099
actually between complex systems and

104
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,048
complicated systems are two different

105
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:21,089
things a complex system is one in which

106
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:22,739
everything in here every single

107
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,289
interaction or device is generally quite

108
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,590
simple and easy to understand they

109
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:27,909
operate in complex

110
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,440
manners none of it's perfectly

111
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,290
complicated at what level of a

112
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,889
distraction that you enter into so

113
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,240
you'll it all may look untoward at the

114
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,650
start but actually as you kind of pick

115
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,970
that heart and pick it apart you

116
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,669
understand that a lot of this is

117
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:46,060
actually fairly simple and non so much

118
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:49,680
as the dumb kick so this is these are

119
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:52,210
the things that we're seeing so relays

120
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,490
senses of some description and actuator

121
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:58,419
this is the the point where the system

122
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:00,130
is touching the physical world and so

123
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:01,719
the problem with this if you're talking

124
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,460
about in terms of data security or any

125
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,350
form of system security is that there is

126
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,930
no compute capacity in this I can't have

127
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,669
entity authentication I can't get it to

128
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,470
negotiate cipher suites I can't get it

129
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:12,789
to do anything because it is simply an

130
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,500
electrical input and some sort of

131
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,979
physical output or a physical input an

132
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:21,700
electrical output so that's where the

133
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:23,800
first issue comes in is that we have no

134
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,080
way to authenticate that device or its

135
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,229
input we had kind of trust that that the

136
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,700
temperature is 37 degrees or the air

137
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:34,120
pressure is whatever it's going to be in

138
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:38,110
millibar so there's that's a first issue

139
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:42,490
inherent trust which is not an ideal

140
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:44,410
situation so further up and so this is

141
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,889
moving from the low level controllers

142
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,120
the high level controls we have PLC's

143
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,789
HMI which is human machine interface

144
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,160
which you'll see panels on kit around

145
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:58,719
the place and this is this is guarded so

146
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,220
this is a view of the physical system so

147
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,099
we do have some compute capacity at this

148
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,690
point we can do things like encrypt

149
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:06,789
communications have entity

150
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,520
authentication but as we said before

151
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:11,530
that there is a you know we have no

152
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,840
authentication on the input to that so

153
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,880
everything here is done on trust that

154
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,210
that particular propane tank is not

155
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,950
going to blow up you know if you look at

156
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,500
mr. robot when he takes out the the data

157
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,760
center in that he is basically fooling

158
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,960
the system into thinking that it's a

159
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,159
particular temperature the one of the

160
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,599
issues with a particular one I know

161
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,190
other people have you know they're done

162
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,830
talks about that particular attack is

163
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,320
that the fact that there are hundreds of

164
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,359
thousands of n devices the fact that

165
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,340
trying to fool one is very

166
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,639
but to undo that 500,000 times there's a

167
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,138
lot of hard work so it's looking at what

168
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,250
the actual risk profile of that is what

169
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,669
is the chance that something is going to

170
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,110
attack all 500,000 end devices probably

171
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:56,049
Louis you have some control of risk

172
00:06:53,110 --> 00:07:00,039
around there so all of these devices

173
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:04,419
took on some proprietary and open source

174
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:06,969
communications there's an issue here is

175
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:11,349
that these are all very much plaintext

176
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:12,939
so you know the the simple attack on

177
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:14,560
this is to just intercept that of

178
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:16,240
man-in-the-middle and write whatever you

179
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,060
want to write into it so this one here

180
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,740
is Modbus which is writing a single

181
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,500
register which is out of PLC and is

182
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,669
writing some data into that there is

183
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,610
nothing that's happening in the stack

184
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:29,378
above that is authenticating any of that

185
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,300
tools this is just taking that on trust

186
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:33,539
on an arms up hammering that point home

187
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:37,090
but it is very important to know that

188
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:38,830
there's a telnet session and we have D

189
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,859
mp3 which is another one there's a whole

190
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:45,460
host of protocols which simply take that

191
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:49,479
data on trust it's okay because you

192
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:51,370
wouldn't put those facing internet until

193
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,839
you have a look at showdown and I will

194
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,469
actually have real admit so out of those

195
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:59,169
18,000 systems that are showing back net

196
00:07:55,469 --> 00:08:00,789
502 work on part which is a honeypot one

197
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:02,589
of the things I've done is some of the

198
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:04,750
slide notes of this I've great to github

199
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:07,180
repo and there's a link to the end of it

200
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:09,699
and living into this that actually shows

201
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,779
you some of this data as well as some of

202
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,759
its direct links to that so you can have

203
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:15,250
a poke around and and see what this is

204
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,500
doing so not all of these actually

205
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,029
that's from port 478 not all of those

206
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,229
are back net but enough of them are for

207
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:27,610
you to be a little bit worried about

208
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:29,500
that so the fun one legislation and

209
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,120
regulation there's lots so it depends

210
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,159
what industry you work in and there'll

211
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,260
be a whole load of legislation and

212
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:37,390
regulation that doesn't directly apply

213
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,069
to security but would determine what you

214
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,289
need to do so you look in the nuclear

215
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,789
industry power industries they've all

216
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:44,709
got their own sets of constraints you

217
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,569
need to just not blindly apply a

218
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:51,300
technical solution to it there needs to

219
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:53,410
be in context with what the weather

220
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,279
regulators say that you must be doing so

221
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,920
it's a bit like if you work

222
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,990
pci-dss world is I'll make a whole lot

223
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,370
of policy decisions that you have to

224
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,670
abide by regardless of whether they're

225
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,949
correct or not you can have that fight

226
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,529
out with legislators it's entirely up to

227
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:10,750
you so you should be aware them and how

228
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:12,100
they apply to your organization you're

229
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,240
not by yourself they're all of their

230
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,089
technical solutions that go into these

231
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,800
systems will have the same constraints

232
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:24,699
so it's a case of understanding where

233
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:26,979
that fits in and which ones apply so

234
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:28,569
challenges which I've put in it's a

235
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,160
horrible term challenges so I put it

236
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,870
into tallix because it's it's one of

237
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,329
those ones where really it means that

238
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,310
why is this so difficult to do all the

239
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:37,959
time one of the major concerns

240
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,189
especially in areas where if you're

241
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:41,649
looking at power distribution that

242
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:43,839
you're looking at airports or you're

243
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:47,050
looking at road networks all of these

244
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,310
things have a high operating time so in

245
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,279
the interview that I work in at the

246
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:53,170
moment we have a four-hour maintenance

247
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,180
window every day and that's not four

248
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,479
hours shut down the systems are still

249
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:00,878
running the the facility is still

250
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,769
running but we've got four hours in

251
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,959
which to make any changes so things like

252
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:07,480
patching cycles the reason why we might

253
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,878
sit a quarter or half a year behind

254
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,259
everyone else at Patrick cycle it's kids

255
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:13,180
can't get to the kit fast enough to

256
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:15,449
upgrade that or to update their in some

257
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,859
way or to make those kinds of changes

258
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:19,599
the other factor with maintenance as

259
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,029
well it's things like physical access to

260
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,149
the thing if you're looking at North Sea

261
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:26,290
oil rig then it's all very well saying I

262
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:27,910
need to replace this bit of kit or I

263
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:31,480
need to update that it's the fact we

264
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,670
physically have to get to that or you

265
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,199
know you're long oil pipelines it's

266
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,290
getting to those so there is a

267
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:40,089
maintenance issue within that next one

268
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,529
as a legacy kit is because this

269
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:45,399
maintenance issue means that you are way

270
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:48,040
behind any form of bow wave of stuff

271
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,930
that you should be patching is that all

272
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,449
of your kit or replacement of that kid

273
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,878
as well goes by the wayside

274
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:56,109
you know I had about I put a couple more

275
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,939
slides in here with just certain horror

276
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,500
shows that all horror shows I've got kit

277
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:02,500
that's been though it has a runtime of

278
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,410
eight years so it's been up it's not

279
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,329
being patched I know this and here's a

280
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,120
lot of wanky term light challenges which

281
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:09,709
is compensate

282
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,150
and control was its if I'm aware that

283
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,440
that kid is not gonna be patched it's

284
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,380
not gonna be powered down can't be taken

285
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,640
out service it's not gonna be new then

286
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,080
we need to have a look at what the

287
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,699
controls are around that and that's a

288
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,900
that's a very simple auditor term I'm

289
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,029
afraid and I'm sorry to bring that to a

290
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,189
room of actual professionals but that is

291
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:28,400
the unfortunately the reality of the

292
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,930
situation next one is systemic

293
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,890
complexity and I've touched on this a

294
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:36,439
minute ago around systems and they reach

295
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,089
a point where they become complex in

296
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,089
that the interaction between components

297
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:42,890
is not necessarily difficult to

298
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:45,110
understand but on such a grand scale

299
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,660
that it becomes difficult to do that

300
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,160
so looks say it's not complicated

301
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,199
because you can build this up to that

302
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,640
point where you understand system but

303
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,190
it's what is the capacity of your brain

304
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,980
to understand what a 500-thousand advice

305
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:00,290
system looks like it's it's a difficult

306
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:03,170
job so actually abstraction is your

307
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,279
friend here so you say I you know I

308
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,050
don't need to understand the entire

309
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,240
tcp/ip stack to say that that server

310
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,859
talks to that device I just need to

311
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,910
understand at this point that is the

312
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,130
interaction that I'm interested in

313
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:16,459
obviously as you get further into some

314
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,570
of those sort of designing around and

315
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:20,359
understand how it works you'll want to

316
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,770
dive into that further so this is the

317
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,589
this is a real kind of unique kind of

318
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:28,459
lecture one on systemic complexity so

319
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:30,290
it's not stem complexity is not solely a

320
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:33,920
security issue it's a system operation

321
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:36,949
issue so this has been picked up in

322
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,439
great depth and there are three primary

323
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,180
kinds of failures if we look at the

324
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,220
reason I'm talking about failures here

325
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,859
in not security directly is because

326
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,440
security is generally in this case only

327
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,120
is is a case of it's a factor of the

328
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,670
reliability and availability of the

329
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,339
system trusted device is secure

330
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:57,260
and of what it's saying is true then I

331
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:58,730
can act on that if I'm not sure that's

332
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,010
true then that affects whether I trust

333
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,890
that and the availability of that input

334
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:06,620
or output or whatever it is so look at

335
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,540
three particular types cascade failure I

336
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,720
break one thing so I break you know we

337
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,040
lose power then we hit over to UPS as

338
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,480
you have got four hours in which to shut

339
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,730
everything down or to continue working

340
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,670
that's kind of a knock-on effect there's

341
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,630
a very simple one interactive complexity

342
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:25,189
is

343
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:26,300
a this is the one where you didn't know

344
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,180
that something else was going to break

345
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,500
as the result of you know you spectacle

346
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,060
all done this where you go in with a

347
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,660
change we're gonna patch this particular

348
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:37,250
device that removes a TLS 1.0 cipher

349
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,839
suite off of that and the monitoring

350
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,230
drops out and you didn't realize so this

351
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,520
is largely that that's a very simple

352
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,900
approach that really it's the kind of I

353
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,220
didn't know that thing was going to

354
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,380
happen because I did something that I

355
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,480
thought was correct from a security

356
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,300
point of view this is good from

357
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,640
attackers view because you might not

358
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,810
have the view as a defender what is

359
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,170
happening further down the line as a

360
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:03,170
result of the loss of this server or or

361
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:06,199
any other component has caused the net

362
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,540
effect further down the line and that's

363
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,650
when is tight coupling which I'm not

364
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,719
really sure who came up with the term

365
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,459
it's not it's not the best ones but what

366
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,440
it is is that the speed at which a

367
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,930
failure occurs and this may be the speed

368
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,780
at which compromise of servers occur

369
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,609
during a you know an attack is that the

370
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,709
first time that you notice that server a

371
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:28,070
has been affected or compromised in some

372
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:29,630
way exact has way down the line now and

373
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,220
you hadn't noticed so that's an issue

374
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:39,260
with monitoring in your response to that

375
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:40,670
kind of event and the last one it's

376
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,400
brilliant Security's not biggest concern

377
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,410
which is once again I'm aware which

378
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,030
audience I'm in because I really like

379
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,000
that to be the case because it makes the

380
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:53,510
battle much easier some of the reason

381
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,800
why you'll see resistance to putting in

382
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,840
additional controls making any change

383
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,430
with the system is because in this list

384
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,850
of this is actually a reduced list of

385
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:04,280
things from a Dutch researcher who was

386
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:08,540
working out here at Cascade failures is

387
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,610
looking at the origins of threats to

388
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,290
particularly national infrastructure

389
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,810
actually the only thing in here

390
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,870
somewhere is we've got cyber which is a

391
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,640
horrible term but it is there it is in

392
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,800
amongst and whole number of other things

393
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,970
that exist so when you're trying to sell

394
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,959
this security you need to be in a

395
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:29,030
context of if we you know upgrade that

396
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,680
operating system I don't care but

397
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,270
actually our biggest threat is you know

398
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,329
wear and tear or any of these other

399
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,329
things

400
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:43,459
so generally safety is king in this

401
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:45,290
especially in you know you're looking at

402
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,850
chemical plants power plants all these

403
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:50,839
kind of things where there is going to

404
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:52,550
be a major effect of you perhaps

405
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,160
shutting down a connection because you

406
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,329
thought it looked a bit dodgy so you

407
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,490
need to make sure that any decisions

408
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,020
that you do or any response times or any

409
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,670
delay to a message while you check

410
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,780
whether that's true or not is having an

411
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,829
effect on the security so it's almost

412
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:08,300
it's on the safety of the system so the

413
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:12,080
available and reliable operations come

414
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,160
next is really the case of where a so

415
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,320
that security is an element of

416
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,290
availability is that your job there is

417
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,640
to ensure the correctness of the system

418
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,939
so there is operating correct way if it

419
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,740
is not that you aware of this and that

420
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,600
security needs to complement and support

421
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,810
safety and operations basically you are

422
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,090
there not as a as a Department of no but

423
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:33,589
to say this is how we're going to make

424
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,780
the system better than it was previously

425
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,580
than when we turned up generally looking

426
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,020
at a lot of these places where up until

427
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,120
in the last ten years they didn't even

428
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,730
have an IT operation so the fact you're

429
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,870
coming in with security is yet another

430
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,670
thing on there these are the kind of

431
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,010
old-school engineers who are terrifying

432
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,189
and don't care what you do with the rest

433
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,300
of is quite passionate about it so

434
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,250
understand that it might be a bit of a

435
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,770
fight for this but you need to put on

436
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,240
your big diplomacy pants and understand

437
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,210
how it's done so I've been in a comms

438
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,390
room where we've walked in and within a

439
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:07,430
rack itself was one desktop PC and I

440
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,140
said what is this PC and they said

441
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,640
that's a fire alarm interface so when

442
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,410
that goes off that's between the fire

443
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,900
alarm and the access control system when

444
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,689
the fire alarms off goes off that all of

445
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,000
the doors on forex escape routes open

446
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:21,020
and it's on this desktop PC running XP

447
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,290
that's sat there forever

448
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,910
what's the inside your mind this is

449
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,470
this shouldn't be a thing why isn't this

450
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,450
why isn't there more than one of them

451
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,550
why haven't we tested this but the other

452
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,190
point is that you could go around and

453
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,629
say but one of the issues there is that

454
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,970
the people are putting this in so your

455
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,830
engineers are checking this in don't

456
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,270
have the same knowledge of security they

457
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,610
do don't have the same knowledge of IT

458
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,980
so it's at that point despite the fact

459
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,689
that you're screaming internally your

460
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,250
one job is to go okay well

461
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,720
is the requirement when do you want how

462
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,179
long do you want us up for what is the

463
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,100
effect this so as to really kind of not

464
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:57,200
berate anyone for doing that unless it's

465
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,120
egregious and horrible but but to

466
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,710
understand that a lot of the time these

467
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,090
decisions are made because they don't

468
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:08,120
have the full picture of security that

469
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:10,370
you do so it comes of really selling

470
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,899
security maybe hard is that they don't

471
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,129
care and they don't care because they

472
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:16,758
don't know enough so you have to do a

473
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:18,709
bit of a an education program why you

474
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,179
know we're looking at we shared a load

475
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,860
of passwords and that's the most simple

476
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,000
of it the reason why we don't share

477
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,469
passwords because we want to know which

478
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,360
operator did this particular thing by

479
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,490
sharing passwords that we don't have we

480
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,490
don't have that audit trail for that

481
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:35,480
so it's case of taking what they know

482
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:37,159
and building up on that so the next one

483
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,940
is the you know what does the estate

484
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,750
look like there is no point in you

485
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,669
saying we'll implement all these

486
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,740
controls and they will implement some V

487
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:47,629
laning we've put some some firewalls

488
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,970
here and there if you don't know what

489
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:51,019
kit is out there stealth IT in an

490
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,220
enterprise environment happens

491
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:53,509
occasionally someone will come in with

492
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,490
their own PC and I'll plug it in to the

493
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:56,960
network and do something in engineering

494
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,570
it may well be that all we need a PC to

495
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,279
this thing or actually I've like to look

496
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,990
at my emails on the shop floor up like a

497
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,049
PC in here or don't have Wi-Fi coverage

498
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:08,690
up it in a 4G network

499
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:10,100
sorry 4G hub and connect my machine to

500
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:14,210
that there which connects the rest the

501
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,889
rest of the system and then relevant

502
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,320
threats some risk to the organization is

503
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:21,019
that those things if you're coming in

504
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,129
with you know here's all of the controls

505
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:23,779
we should put in place which of those

506
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:26,299
are relevant to the organization of the

507
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:29,480
organization that you're in and then the

508
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:31,700
effect of implementing those and how

509
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,980
that changes operations and one of the

510
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,629
biggest resistance changes is if you

511
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,919
look at particular engineering staff

512
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:39,080
seem to have this thing but they will be

513
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,299
engrained in the process they do they do

514
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,158
they press button a then they look at

515
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:44,658
output C and then do these things and we

516
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:46,120
say oh actually before you do that I'd

517
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:48,529
like you to enter your password here

518
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,449
that is always a fight with them

519
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:51,590
I know if the chances are we won't be

520
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:55,340
doing any of that but it's a case of

521
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:58,689
that once you change their routine that

522
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,689
becomes a horrible horrible fight

523
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,810
so I do work in design

524
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,570
I don't do pen testing I don't do I

525
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:12,330
don't sit in a sock and it's case of

526
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,970
understand that whatever I do makes the

527
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,669
bread team's job as hard as possible but

528
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,930
the blue team's job is easy as possible

529
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,910
but it doesn't mean that you know

530
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,320
anytime that all of the people here that

531
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,310
doing some red team stuff they're off

532
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,169
doing CTF

533
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:27,480
I have no idea how much of that works

534
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,130
simply because I kind of I understand

535
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,440
that I can use net cap to receive a

536
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:35,580
shell but I have to look up a TV every

537
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,650
single time so bear in mind that my view

538
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,689
on this especially is coming from in the

539
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,980
design side flow I absolutely love to

540
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,090
talk to people who do this in defense

541
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,650
and do this in attack and what are they

542
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:47,790
poking at so yeah in the design as well

543
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,940
it's that logical of physical

544
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:52,860
segregation a lot of this it's a

545
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,870
horrible flat network and they simply

546
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,370
because what the engineers need is a

547
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,899
connection between point a and point B

548
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,520
and you put that in regardless of

549
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,260
whether that's traversing a large

550
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,670
geographical area or between systems

551
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,410
system that we shouldn't be talking

552
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:06,990
coffee machine probably shouldn't be on

553
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:09,090
the on the engineering network those

554
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:12,560
kind of things where to understand this

555
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:15,050
time to kind of split that up so into

556
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:19,190
integral and physical areas within there

557
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:20,970
there are some I know mentioned about

558
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,920
regulation and legislation these are

559
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,230
outside of these these are standards is

560
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,290
a six two three three four so I'm overly

561
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:31,560
familiar with once you look at actually

562
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:33,180
the terms within that there also seem

563
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,780
very obvious to you when I say this is a

564
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:39,630
security in engineering is a relatively

565
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:42,000
new industry so although they're all

566
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,160
fairly simple to us let's get up that

567
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,440
step first and get basic controls in

568
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,020
Kelly's understood before we go and do

569
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,040
anything flash like let me try some dark

570
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,690
traits are doing things like that

571
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,879
there's no point in doing that if you

572
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:59,460
don't know what sort of what what's in

573
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:01,200
your site out there NIST is very very

574
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,660
far they're probably the best place to

575
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,740
go for some of this information and then

576
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:11,430
there's ncsc which is poly UK's cyber

577
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,810
defense six which is unfortunately it's

578
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,380
been two years out of date so far I have

579
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,470
a check

580
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:19,490
this week it could be better I'm waiting

581
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,000
for them to to to revisit their

582
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,350
understand the environment

583
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,049
it's just reiteration on the one above

584
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,820
and consider what is the applicable

585
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,769
configs and towards it controls you

586
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,600
putting in place you might say I want a

587
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:32,429
secretive firewall between a and B and

588
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,379
you go we don't really need that kind of

589
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:40,500
the thing is working out what things

590
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:41,850
within that are applicable to you so

591
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,259
because you've got half a million

592
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,129
devices the only thing that were you

593
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:46,019
doing from your point of view is they're

594
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,120
talking to each other so from a defense

595
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:49,399
one of you you need to understand what

596
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:54,029
that communication pattern looks like

597
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:55,830
and what the all of these things here so

598
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:57,360
you know who talks on which direction as

599
00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:00,090
well so if you've got a masculine slave

600
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,889
set of devices then when I should only

601
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,629
be sending rights down and I should be

602
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:05,939
sending reads up that's the only thing I

603
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:07,469
should see so if a write is coming from

604
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,450
a an end device that you weren't

605
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:12,870
expecting it to that's a red flag for

606
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,399
that that where is this data being

607
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:17,428
aggregated so where we showed earlier

608
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:19,049
these sensors and those PRCs it's what

609
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:21,360
we're doing is becoming from five

610
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:23,460
hundred thousand devices down to maybe

611
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,209
five thousand PLC's and down to one

612
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,799
SCADA system at what point of it is that

613
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,179
data aggregated what point we verifying

614
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,289
of that data that's hitting that server

615
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:36,139
or hitting that PLC is correct it's a

616
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:38,129
flow Direction frequency of volume

617
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:40,379
generally within the engineering system

618
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:41,759
actually chatty is good we should see

619
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:43,289
constant chatter it's when things are

620
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,350
quiet so we see this in our in our sock

621
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:48,600
for example once that calms drops off we

622
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:50,340
see that cliff and if that is the point

623
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,009
where we start to worry something's gone

624
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:55,649
terribly wrong we've lost a link or if

625
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:57,210
nothing's failed over to one side and

626
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:59,100
what's the expected content so we have

627
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:02,460
the quick look at what Modbus looks like

628
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,049
on the on the wire is that what we

629
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,080
expect to see is there any XML that was

630
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:09,000
seeing out of that but the engineers

631
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,100
that we've already said are idiots when

632
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,509
it comes security they know this data

633
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,949
they know what good looks like know what

634
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:17,100
bad looks like and I want something

635
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,629
 is about happen looks like so work

636
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,559
with them don't berate them for not

637
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:21,269
knowing Scootie because you don't know

638
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:25,460
engineering I mean some of you make or

639
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:25,460
do but invariably you don't

640
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,690
so detection in action it's often

641
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,670
difficult see and I've been in post

642
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,500
mortems that take three weeks four weeks

643
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:39,120
to work out what went wrong we have

644
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,000
recovered from the failure of some

645
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,260
description and we're still four weeks

646
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,420
down the line trying to work out what

647
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,120
happened for this for that particular

648
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,710
one it was the fact that there is a EMC

649
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,570
Isilon Shadow Copy

650
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,210
job running at the same time as the

651
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,649
sequel housekeeping we hadn't realized

652
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,580
that those things occurred and then we

653
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,290
were testing failover

654
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,470
which we do after last flight which is

655
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:03,360
at 12 midnight those three jobs sorry

656
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,550
the two jobs and failover testing was

657
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,879
run exactly the same time because far

658
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:09,990
too long to understand that so

659
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,000
understanding what your communication

660
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,040
patterns looked like what's in the

661
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,470
estate gives you at least some

662
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:20,670
understanding of when something go when

663
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:21,900
something is going wrong logs it says

664
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,180
good luck up there simply because you've

665
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,610
got two issues one is if you do have a

666
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,920
device with some compute capacity it

667
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:31,500
largely has no storage capacity so your

668
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,390
logs are maybe 10,000 events but if

669
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,930
that's as far as it can go and that

670
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:38,580
10,000 events in a failover takes five

671
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:41,910
minutes to fill up you're not going to

672
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,560
see anything useful over that so the

673
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:45,980
indicators compromised in isolation this

674
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,570
is this is not new to any of us here

675
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:51,060
they don't mean anything there give us a

676
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:54,419
picture of what's going on so if you

677
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:57,179
understand what the system looks like in

678
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,740
its entirety to some extent you

679
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,900
understand what expected behavior looks

680
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,820
like once something strange comes in

681
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,060
that's when you know where to start

682
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,830
running down that particular rabbit hole

683
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,480
and one other issue particularly in

684
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:12,149
operation technology safety insulated

685
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,970
systems where what I need to happen is

686
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:17,400
that if there is something safety

687
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:21,000
related such as I need to open those

688
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:23,160
doors in the event of a fire I don't

689
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,590
want that to be delayed by some form of

690
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,090
IDs I don't want there to be connection

691
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,230
spiking to have on that or automate

692
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,959
decisions that will get in the way of

693
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,370
that so to understand where you can do

694
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,730
those things on where you should not do

695
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,729
those things

696
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:43,360
so from an attackers point of view

697
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,580
because these systems are complex the

698
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,709
disruption is easy but a planned

699
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,169
existent disruption is much harder to

700
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:53,230
understand what the system is doing and

701
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:54,460
how it's doing it if you're part of the

702
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,410
security team for that particular

703
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,670
company it's hard enough already you've

704
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,440
got access to the engineering your

705
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:01,150
access to the diagrams you can work

706
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,410
through this you can test it on the on

707
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:04,000
the pre prod environment should you have

708
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,320
one you see what that looks like if

709
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,810
you're coming in from the outside you

710
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:11,350
may have to take wild guesses this and

711
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:14,610
so on the plus side is a lot of it is

712
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:17,439
configured of convenience so because

713
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,820
what I need is point A to point B and

714
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,450
these way to do that is just have a

715
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:24,879
flight between point A and point B it's

716
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,470
to look at once you understand what the

717
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,610
environment looks like is that those

718
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,070
things where they're configured for

719
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,629
convenience become evidence but from a

720
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,510
from a tax point of view if you're doing

721
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,980
a red team engagement on there is that

722
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:37,390
chances are its default chances are it's

723
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,010
a direct line chances are it doesn't

724
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:43,320
traverse a firewall these kind of things

725
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:45,700
and with that comes inherent trust so

726
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,919
that device that is talking there's

727
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,540
bridging that server is not based on any

728
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,340
authentication it's just simply that

729
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,050
connection so you could replace that PLC

730
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,639
with your own device or you could you

731
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,919
could session hijack and do what you

732
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,330
need to do to say you should talk to me

733
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,270
instead I've got the data that you want

734
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:02,530
and when you get a scarlet level it's

735
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,910
two things this one called loss of

736
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,200
control which means that they will send

737
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,090
a commander nothing will happen the

738
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,380
other one's loss of view where they will

739
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,209
read something and it's not coming back

740
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,450
or that we've changed the output of that

741
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:15,580
and say this device is up default

742
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:19,060
hard-coded and common credentials are

743
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:20,800
everywhere so you can go to a BB or any

744
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:22,659
PLC manufactures Schneider and just so

745
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,639
give me a list of your default passwords

746
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:28,510
or give me a list of where there's no

747
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,400
access cameras access cameras have the

748
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:32,440
admin password sorry that admin use name

749
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,650
is always route and there's no

750
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,900
enforcement on the password so there's

751
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:40,840
no lockout so you just just hammer that

752
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:43,840
until you find it and everything's in

753
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,820
plain text for the most part there are

754
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,459
some other controllers or configurations

755
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,850
such as if anybody come across OPC which

756
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,620
is a

757
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,330
it's previous iteration when it's using

758
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,949
decom where you had have the same

759
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:58,159
account on the machine as the as the

760
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:59,600
client and it was horrible OPC UA which

761
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,290
is a new version has a whole load of

762
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,030
different security controls around there

763
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,129
I've not seen those implemented yet in

764
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:08,750
the wild because it's designed by

765
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:12,130
engineers and engineers don't get that

766
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,130
it's a another education issue

767
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:28,340
so those attacks on communications these

768
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,480
are taken from the security research

769
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,780
with the best name which is Ian

770
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,970
Turnipseed their number of attacks you

771
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,070
can take place on those on

772
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:38,810
communications interception it's not

773
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,950
like from having interruption is we hold

774
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,230
that message back modification of

775
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:43,670
fabrication self-explanatory and then

776
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,890
the different scenarios that they they

777
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,720
have is the response injection which is

778
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,560
I will it's a bit like the previous

779
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,730
talker with it

780
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,030
you know we're going to fuzz what's

781
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:54,200
happening here and try and get gain some

782
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,710
information from the system they're

783
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,450
attacking the complex one is where we

784
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,500
understand what the system looks like

785
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,930
and we want to make it do this

786
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,280
particular thing and then there's

787
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,450
there's the other ones there which is

788
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,250
obviously denial of service and easing

789
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,990
one reconnaissance which probably should

790
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,420
come above complex militias response

791
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:19,760
injection but it's to understand what

792
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:21,590
the system looks like and then all the

793
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,360
devices not all of these devices many of

794
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:27,709
them just have firmware that PLC's are

795
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,850
will have some firmware on there which

796
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,870
really if you want to take control of

797
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,760
them we want to understand what they're

798
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:34,250
doing and how they're wired and how they

799
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:38,540
communicate is to really sort of dig

800
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:40,880
into those so you can go by one there's

801
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:44,540
one's an eBay there's Siemens do it like

802
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,300
an education kit which includes a s 1200

803
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,800
which is uses s 7 communication which is

804
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,990
I don't if you've read countdown to zero

805
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,710
we have a look at Stuxnet that's that's

806
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:57,230
their baby they're getting a bit a kid

807
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:59,570
out check what ports are on their fuzzy

808
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:02,300
iOS check for jtech headers check for

809
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:04,580
you are get off the chip legs and have a

810
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:07,030
look or you know remove the flash chips

811
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:09,560
and done the EEPROM without blowing it

812
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,060
or the other option is we don't -

813
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,450
Siemens we come and get the firmware and

814
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:16,429
we reverse it in reversal from there

815
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,590
this is not the only full Siemens into

816
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:21,530
this this is not the only one that does

817
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:25,490
this don't go and find them there's lots

818
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:28,550
of them and really sort of quick talker

819
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:30,380
so I realized when I was doing this

820
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:33,040
previously I've got 45 minutes for a 33

821
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:35,200
and I think we're pretty much done there

822
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,070
what I've done is all of my notes of

823
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,900
this and some of the stuff that was

824
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:41,500
added into it I've created a github repo

825
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:46,410
for that it's pinned this morning is the

826
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:49,990
top post under Tunney traffic and also

827
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:51,340
part of net sac focus which couple of

828
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,510
guys from here are as well if you want

829
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,780
to come and join us on there's just a

830
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:58,900
the community for discussing security

831
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:01,240
and getting on with stuff so that's fit

832
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,370
about it from me so sorry it's short and

833
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:10,760
sweet

834
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:10,760
[Applause]

835
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:30,159
were there any questions at all look

836
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:31,330
these 100k so the question was when

837
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,740
we're testing these environments do we

838
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:34,750
have a separate test rig and what is the

839
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,840
cost of that and the cost is huge

840
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:40,390
because what we tend to do for so work

841
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,439
in critical national infrastructure at

842
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,850
the moment on the site then working on

843
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,700
we have an entire different building in

844
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:47,320
another town in which there is at least

845
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,090
one of each of the systems to do that

846
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,439
the cost of running that is about five

847
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,970
million pounds per year the cost of

848
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,490
putting that up was about 50 million

849
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,870
pounds so yes we do so our pre point

850
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,490
environment looks very nice and we try

851
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,379
and kick the living out of it

852
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,580
before we put anything production money

853
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,590
because that maintenance windows so

854
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,949
short we haven't got time to do a deep

855
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:07,570
dive at that point but I'm quite blessed

856
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:17,110
I'm aware with that kind of environment

857
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:25,750
it doesn't happen very often sorry sorry

858
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:27,129
say yes okay yeah I think anywhere where

859
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,929
there's some human risk involved that

860
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,389
people tend to like doing in tests

861
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:34,330
before we do in live otherwise Yolo but

862
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:38,889
just get it on with it there any other

863
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:42,539
questions which case thank you very much

864
00:33:38,889 --> 00:33:42,539
your time really appreciate it thank you
